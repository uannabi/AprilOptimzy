{"id":100003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Peace of Westphalia refers to the pair of peace treaties, the Treaty of Osnabr\u00FCck and the Treaty of M\u00FCnster, signed on May 15 and October 24 of 1648, which ended both the Thirty Years' War and the Eighty Years' War. The treaties involved the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III Habsburg, the other German princes, Spain, France, Sweden and representatives of the Dutch Republic. The Treaty of the Pyrenees, signed in 1659, ending the war between France and Spain, is also often considered part of the overall accord.\nLocations.\nThe peace negotiations were held in the cities of M\u00FCnster and Osnabr\u00FCck, which lie about 50\u00A0km apart from each other, in the present day German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. Sweden had favoured Osnabr\u00FCck due to its Protestant background, France chose M\u00FCnster due to its Catholic background. In any case two locations were required because Protestant and Catholic leaders refused to meet each other. The Catholics used M\u00FCnster, while the Protestants used Osnabr\u00FCck.\nResults.\nSpain accepted the independence of the Dutch Republic.\nThe power which Ferdinand III had taken for himself against the Holy Roman Empire's constitution was stripped. That meant that the rulers of the German states were again able to determine the religion of their lands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peace_treaty","surface_form":"peace treaties","offset":59},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":89},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":117},{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":136},{"uri":"October_24","surface_form":"October 24","offset":147},{"uri":"1648","surface_form":"1648","offset":161},{"uri":"Thirty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Thirty Years' War","offset":188},{"uri":"Eighty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Eighty Years' War","offset":214},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Holy Roman Emperor","offset":259},{"uri":"Ferdinand_III","surface_form":"Ferdinand III","offset":279},{"uri":"Habsburg","surface_form":"Habsburg","offset":293},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"German","offset":313},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":320},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":329},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":336},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":344},{"uri":"Dutch_Republic","surface_form":"Dutch Republic","offset":378},{"uri":"Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees","surface_form":"Treaty of the Pyrenees","offset":398},{"uri":"1659","surface_form":"1659","offset":432},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":449},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":593},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":605},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":697},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":724},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":738},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":903},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":918}]}
