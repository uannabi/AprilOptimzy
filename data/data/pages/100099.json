{"id":100099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew","text":"The Gospel of Matthew is a book of the Bible. (Its full name is the Gospel According to Matthew, but it is often called the Gospel of Matthew or just Matthew). It is one of the four gospels of the New Testament that tell the story of Jesus' life and teachings.\nIt is \"not\" thought to have been written by the apostle Matthew, who was one of Jesus' twelve apostles (see below). The Gospel of Matthew is called one of the synoptic gospels because it has some of the same stories and language as the Gospels of Mark and Luke.\nMatthew wrote the gospel mainly for the Jewish people, to show them that Jesus is really the Messiah. Like the Gospels of Mark and Luke, Matthew tells many stories about Jesus' life. Matthew's gospel also talks about Jewish scripture.\nDate.\nEarly Christian tradition attributes the gospel to the apostle Matthew. This is now rejected by modern scholars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":39},{"uri":"Gospel","surface_form":"gospel","offset":182},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":197},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":234},{"uri":"Matthew_the_Evangelist","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":317},{"uri":"Twelve_Apostles","surface_form":"twelve apostles","offset":348},{"uri":"Synoptic_gospels","surface_form":"synoptic gospels","offset":420},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Mark","surface_form":"Gospels of Mark","offset":497},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Luke","surface_form":"Luke","offset":517},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":563},{"uri":"Messiah","surface_form":"Messiah","offset":616},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Jewish scripture","offset":740},{"uri":"Matthew_the_Evangelist","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":827}]}
