{"id":10010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend","text":"e=\"preserve\">Legends (derived from Latin, \"Legenda)\" are stories in oral tradition and a narrative of human actions. They are usually old but are believed to have taken place within human history. Legends are often passed on by word-of-mouth. Legends have often been transformed over time to keep them realistic.\nThe word is also used for famous or historically significant people, places, art, etc. We sometimes say of someone who is extremely famous that they are a \"legend\" or \"of legendary fame\".\nExamples of legends are Ali Baba, the Fountain of Youth, Paul Bunyan, Kraken, Atlantis, the Loch Ness Monster, and Bigfoot. Some legends are stories about real people; others are not. Odysseus and Robin Hood for example may have been real but most the stories about them are definitely fiction.\nFor some places, legends are the earliest history. For example, the origin of ancient Rome is known only from legends, as are the earliest dynasties in the history of China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oral_tradition","surface_form":"oral tradition","offset":68},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":374},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":390},{"uri":"Ali_Baba","surface_form":"Ali Baba","offset":525},{"uri":"Fountain_of_Youth","surface_form":"Fountain of Youth","offset":539},{"uri":"Paul_Bunyan","surface_form":"Paul Bunyan","offset":558},{"uri":"Kraken","surface_form":"Kraken","offset":571},{"uri":"Loch_Ness_Monster","surface_form":"Loch Ness Monster","offset":593},{"uri":"Bigfoot","surface_form":"Bigfoot","offset":616},{"uri":"Odysseus","surface_form":"Odysseus","offset":685},{"uri":"Robin_Hood","surface_form":"Robin Hood","offset":698},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":787},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":838},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Rome","offset":874},{"uri":"History_of_China","surface_form":"history of China","offset":952}]}
