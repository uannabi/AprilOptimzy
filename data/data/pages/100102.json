{"id":100102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke","text":"The Gospel of Luke is a book of the Bible. Like the other gospels, the \"Gospel of Luke\" tells the stories of the life and teachings of Jesus. It is the third and longest book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark. The gospel is believed to be written by Luke, who was a friend of the Apostle Paul.\nLuke was a doctor. He wrote his gospel for a man he calls 'most excellent Theophilus' (1:3). Luke wrote another book which is fifth in the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles which tells what Jesus' disciples did after his rise back to Heaven.\nUnlike the gospel writers Matthew, Mark and John, Luke was probably not Jewish but was Greek. He wrote the gospel mainly for non-Jewish people, (who were called Gentile by the Jews). Luke wrote to prove that Jesus is the Son of God. Luke's gospel contains many similar stories of Jesus. He tells more about the Virgin birth of Jesus than the other gospel writers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":36},{"uri":"Gospel","surface_form":"gospel","offset":58},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":135},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":182},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Matthew","surface_form":"Gospel of Matthew","offset":216},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Mark","surface_form":"Gospel of Mark","offset":242},{"uri":"Saint_Luke","surface_form":"Luke","offset":298},{"uri":"Saint_Paul","surface_form":"Apostle Paul","offset":328},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":353},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":481},{"uri":"Acts_of_the_Apostles","surface_form":"Acts of the Apostles","offset":500},{"uri":"Ascension","surface_form":"rise back to Heaven","offset":569},{"uri":"Matthew_the_Evangelist","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":616},{"uri":"Mark_the_Evangelist","surface_form":"Mark","offset":625},{"uri":"John_the_Apostle","surface_form":"John","offset":634},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":662},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":677},{"uri":"Gentile","surface_form":"Gentile","offset":751},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":818},{"uri":"Virgin_birth_of_Jesus","surface_form":"Virgin birth of Jesus","offset":901}]}
