{"id":100113,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Hebrews","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Epistle to the Hebrews or Letter to the Hebrews is one of the letters of the New Testament. Although it is believed by many to be written by the Apostle Paul, many others think it might have been written by one group of early Christians to a general group of Jews (also called Hebrews), or to a church with Jewish members.\nThe letter explains that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the perfect sacrifice for human sinners. He is superior to angels and is our High priest in the order of Melchizedek. Jesus is the Messiah whose coming gives us the superior New Covenant, as compared to the Old Covenant of Abraham and\nMoses. The writers state that if the Old Covenant was faultless, God would not have sent his Son to start a new one.\nBy stating that people are called righteous through their faith and belief in God's ways, the writers urge the readers to receive God's grace by accepting Jesus Christ.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":94},{"uri":"Saint_Paul","surface_form":"Paul","offset":170},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":243},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":276},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":621},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":633}]}
