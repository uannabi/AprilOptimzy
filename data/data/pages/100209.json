Above all, he is known by being a coauthor (with Nicholas Metropolis) of the Monte Carlo algorithm.\nUlam was of Jewish descent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":60},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":67},{"uri":"Manhattan_Project","surface_form":"Manhattan Project","offset":102},{"uri":"Thermonuclear_weapon","surface_form":"thermonuclear weapon","offset":158},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":298},{"uri":"Set_theory","surface_form":"set theory","offset":313},{"uri":"Algebraic_topology","surface_form":"algebraic topology","offset":344},{"uri":"Monte_Carlo_algorithm","surface_form":"Monte Carlo algorithm","offset":441},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":476}]}
