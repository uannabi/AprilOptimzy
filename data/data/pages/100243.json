{"id":100243,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(tattoo)","text":"=\"preserve\">A flash (also known as a \"tattoo flash\") is a design or picture that is used in order to create a tattoo. They often come in sets like a poster (called flash sheets), and can be seen in most tattoo shops.\nTattoo flashes are often drawn for general use, rather than being a custom made piece like some personal tattoos. However, some flashes have space for personalisation, for example space for the person to include a name in their tattoo.\nTattoo flashes come in a variety of different designs, and are divided into categories such as celtic, heart, arm band tattoos e.t.c. A person wanting a tattoo made from a flash chooses which design they like best. Then the tattooist uses a stencil to draw the basic design onto the skin of the person being tattooed, and afterwards starts to make the tattoo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tattoo","surface_form":"tattoo","offset":110},{"uri":"Personalisation","surface_form":"personalisation","offset":368},{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":431},{"uri":"Categories","surface_form":"categories","offset":529},{"uri":"Stencil","surface_form":"stencil","offset":694}]}
