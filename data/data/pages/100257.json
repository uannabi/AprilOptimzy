They boo when he takes the field.\nOn 13 May 2012 Lescott helped Man City win their first premiership title in 44 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"footballer","offset":59},{"uri":"Manchester_City_F.C.","surface_form":"Manchester City","offset":84},{"uri":"England_national_football_team","surface_form":"England national football team","offset":108},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":220},{"uri":"Wolverhampton_Wanderers","surface_form":"Wolverhampton Wanderers","offset":263},{"uri":"Football_League_Championship","surface_form":"Championship","offset":316},{"uri":"Everton_F.C.","surface_form":"Everton","offset":419},{"uri":"Manchester_City_F.C.","surface_form":"Manchester City","offset":598}]}
