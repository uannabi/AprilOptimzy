{"id":100303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport","text":"Singapore Changi Airport, or simply Changi Airport, is a commercial airport serving Singapore in Asia, and is one of the largest in the Southeast Asian region. It is located in Changi, at the eastern part of the island of Singapore, on a site.\nThe airport is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and is the home base of Singapore Airlines, Singapore Airlines Cargo, SilkAir, Jetstar Asia Airways and Scoot.\nHistory.\nChangi Airport opened on July 1, 1981, and was the largest airport in Asia at the time. The first flight to arrive at the new airport came from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia and the first flight to leave was for Penang, also in Malaysia.\nWhen the airport first opened, it only handled about 8 million passengers a year. This number has grown, and in 2015, the airport handled a record of 55,448,964 passengers, a 2.5% increase over the previous year.\nDesign.\nPeople can go between Terminals 1, 2, and 3 (but not Terminal 4) using an automatic, driverless train called the Skytrain. The system opened in 1990 and received new trains in 2006. A new building with shops and hotels is being built that will connect to each of these three terminals directly. It is called Jewel Changi Airport and will be ready in early 2019.\nA new terminal building, Terminal 5, is being built on an empty piece of land opposite the current airport terminals. It will open in the 2020s and be bigger in size than Terminals 1, 2, and 3 combined.\nGround transportation.\nIt is very easy to get to and from Changi Airport.\nOne of the stations on Singapore's MRT network is called Changi Airport and it is on a two-stop branch of the East West Line. The station opened in 2002, is located between Terminals 2 and 3 of the airport and can be reached from both terminals. To get into the city one has to change to another East West Line train at Tanah Merah or, since 2017, to the Downtown Line at Expo. Terminal 5 could possibly be served by an extension of the Thomson-East Coast Line when it is completed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":68},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":84},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":97},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":136},{"uri":"Changi","surface_form":"Changi","offset":177},{"uri":"Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_Singapore","surface_form":"Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore","offset":275},{"uri":"Singapore_Airlines","surface_form":"Singapore Airlines","offset":344},{"uri":"Singapore_Airlines_Cargo","surface_form":"Singapore Airlines Cargo","offset":364},{"uri":"SilkAir","surface_form":"SilkAir","offset":390},{"uri":"Jetstar_Asia_Airways","surface_form":"Jetstar Asia Airways","offset":399},{"uri":"Scoot","surface_form":"Scoot","offset":424},{"uri":"Kuala_Lumpur_International_Airport","surface_form":"Kuala Lumpur International Airport","offset":584},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":622},{"uri":"Penang","surface_form":"Penang","offset":669},{"uri":"Changi_Airport_Skytrain","surface_form":"Skytrain","offset":1029},{"uri":"Jewel_Changi_Airport","surface_form":"Jewel Changi Airport","offset":1224},{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"MRT","offset":1590},{"uri":"Changi_Airport_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Changi Airport","offset":1612},{"uri":"East_West_MRT_Line","surface_form":"East West Line","offset":1665},{"uri":"Tanah_Merah_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Tanah Merah","offset":1875},{"uri":"Downtown_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Downtown Line","offset":1910},{"uri":"Expo_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Expo","offset":1927},{"uri":"Thomson-East_Coast_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Thomson-East Coast Line","offset":1992}]}
