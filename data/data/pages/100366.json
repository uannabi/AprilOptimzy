{"id":100366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity","text":"ce=\"preserve\">In dimensional analysis, a dimensionless quantity (or more precisely, a quantity with the dimensions of 1) is a quantity without any physical units and thus a pure number. Such a number is typically defined as a product or ratio of quantities which do have units, in such a way that all the units cancel out.\nExample.\n\"out of every 10 apples I gather, 1 is rotten.\" -- the rotten-to-gathered ratio is (1 apple) / (10 apples) = 0.1 = 10%, which is a dimensionless quantity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dimensional_analysis","surface_form":"dimensional analysis","offset":17},{"uri":"Quantity","surface_form":"quantity","offset":126},{"uri":"Physical_unit","surface_form":"physical unit","offset":147},{"uri":"Product_(mathematics)","surface_form":"product","offset":226},{"uri":"Ratio","surface_form":"ratio","offset":237},{"uri":"Quantity","surface_form":"quantities","offset":246}]}
