{"id":100475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge","text":"Doge (plural dogi or doges) is a word of an Italian dialect that comes from the Latin \"dux\" (as does the English \"duke\" and the standard Italian \"duce\"), that means \"leader\", especially in a military context.\nThe title of doge was used for the elected head of state in a number of Italian \"crowned republics\". The two best known such republics were Venice and Genoa, which had maritime, commercial, and territorial mini-empires. Sometimes the Doge ruled for life; sometimes for a fixed number of years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":44},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":52},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":80},{"uri":"Duke","surface_form":"duke","offset":114},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":252},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":281},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":334},{"uri":"Republic_of_Venice","surface_form":"Venice","offset":349},{"uri":"Genoa","surface_form":"Genoa","offset":360}]}
