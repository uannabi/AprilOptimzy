The Spanish word for those ranches was \"Hato\" and there are many places in the province with the word \"Hato\" in their names (Hato del Yaque, Hato Nuevo, Hato Viejo, Hato del Medio) or \"Hatico\" (small \"Hato\").\nThe road from the border with Haiti to Santiago de los Caballeros, the second most important city of the country, went across this region and during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856), Haitian armies came across this region and people did not want to live here.\nIn 1918, a Belgian engineer, Luis L. Bogaert (\"Monsieur Bogaert\"), built a canal to take water from the river to the fields and he began to grow rice. That was an important change in the province and now Valverde is a province where rice is an important product.\nSince the Dominican Independence, the territory was part of the Santiago province. It was made a province in 1959 with lands of the Santiago and the Monte Cristi provinces, with the municipality of Esperanza; in 1978, Laguna Salada became a municipality of the province.\nLocation.\nThe Valverde province is in the northwest part of the \"Cibao\" valley.
