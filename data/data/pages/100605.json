{"id":100605,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicts_of_Ashoka","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the \"Pillars of Ashoka\", as well as on large stones and cave walls, made by the Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty during his reign from 272 to 231 BCE. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism. According to the edicts, the extent of Buddhist proselytism during this period reached as far as the Mediterranean, and many Buddhist monuments were created.\nAshoka did not completely forbid the killing of animals; he wanted to control the number of\nanimals that had to be killed for human consumption or sacrificing, protected some of them, and in general criticized violent acts against animals, such as castration.\nHe wrote these edicts on rock and pillar.\nEdicts are royal orders or proclamations.These edicts were set up in different part of Ashoka's empire and spread the message of Ashoka's Dhamma.There are about 14 rock edicts and 7 pillar edicts currently found.\nEdicts were written in local language. Most of the Ashoka's edicts are written in Brahmi Script and were discovered by James Prinsep, a British official in 1837. After this major breakthrough, historians and scholars were able to obtain information about Ashoka and his reign.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Inscription","surface_form":"inscriptions","offset":57},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":129},{"uri":"Ashoka_the_Great","surface_form":"Ashoka","offset":161},{"uri":"Edict","surface_form":"edicts","offset":233},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":287},{"uri":"Proselytism","surface_form":"proselytism","offset":345},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":398},{"uri":"Ashoka","surface_form":"Ashoka","offset":455},{"uri":"Castration","surface_form":"castration","offset":703}]}
