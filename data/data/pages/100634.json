{"id":100634,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fert","text":"Albert Fert (born 7 March 1938) is a French physicist. He discovered giant magnetoresistance which was used to make gigabyte hard disks much easier to build. He is a professor at Universit\u00E9 Paris-Sud in Orsay and scientific director of a laboratory called Unit\u00E9 mixte de recherche. The laboratory is part of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (National Scientific Research Centre) and Thales Group. He was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with the German physicist Peter Gr\u00FCnberg.\nStudies.\nFert graduated in 1962 from the \u00C9cole Normale Sup\u00E9rieure in Paris. He received his master's degree in 1963 at the University of Paris, and earned his PhD in 1970 at the Universit\u00E9 Paris-Sud.\nIn 1988 Fert discovered Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in iron and chromium which began spintronics; GMR was also discovered by Peter Gr\u00FCnberg from the J\u00FClich Research Centre but Peter Gr\u00FCnberg did not work with Fert. Since 1988, Albert Fert has helped to improve spintronics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"7_March","surface_form":"7 March","offset":18},{"uri":"1938","surface_form":"1938","offset":26},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":37},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physicist","offset":44},{"uri":"Giant_magnetoresistance","surface_form":"giant magnetoresistance","offset":69},{"uri":"Gigabyte","surface_form":"gigabyte","offset":116},{"uri":"Hard_disk","surface_form":"hard disk","offset":125},{"uri":"Universit%C3%A9_Paris-Sud","surface_form":"Universit\u00E9 Paris-Sud","offset":179},{"uri":"Orsay","surface_form":"Orsay","offset":203},{"uri":"Unit%C3%A9_mixte_de_recherche","surface_form":"Unit\u00E9 mixte de recherche","offset":256},{"uri":"Centre_national_de_la_recherche_scientifique","surface_form":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","offset":312},{"uri":"Thales_Group","surface_form":"Thales Group","offset":399},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":437},{"uri":"Peter_Gr%C3%BCnberg","surface_form":"Peter Gr\u00FCnberg","offset":495},{"uri":"%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure","surface_form":"\u00C9cole Normale Sup\u00E9rieure","offset":552},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":580},{"uri":"University_of_Paris","surface_form":"University of Paris","offset":634},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":670},{"uri":"Universit%C3%A9_Paris-Sud","surface_form":"Universit\u00E9 Paris-Sud","offset":689},{"uri":"Giant_magnetoresistance","surface_form":"Giant magnetoresistance","offset":735},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":768},{"uri":"Chromium","surface_form":"chromium","offset":777},{"uri":"Spintronics","surface_form":"spintronics","offset":798},{"uri":"J%C3%BClich_Research_Centre","surface_form":"J\u00FClich Research Centre","offset":862},{"uri":"Spintronics","surface_form":"spintronics","offset":974}]}
