{"id":100643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gr%C3%BCnberg","text":"Peter Andreas Gr\u00FCnberg (18 May 1939 \u2013 7 April 2018) was a German physicist.\nHe won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of giant magnetoresistance which made gigabyte hard disk drives easier to produce. Half the prize was given to Albert Fert who discovered giant magnetoresistance at the same time but Fert and Gr\u00FCnberg did not work together.\nEarly life.\nGr\u00FCnberg was born in Pilsen, Bohemia, which was controlled by the Nazis. They called the country the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and it is known now as the Czech Republic. Gr\u00FCnbergs father was called Fjodor Grinberg but he changed his name to Fjodor Gr\u00FCnberg in 1941.\nThe rest of the Gr\u00FCnberg family stayed for some time in the Petermann house in Untersekerschan but, after World War II, all people living in Pilsen who spoke German were made to leave the country by the Czech government. This was called the Bene\u0161 decrees. He moved with his mother (who died in 2002 aged 74) and sister to Lauterbach, Hesse. He studied at a gymnasium (second level school) there.\nGr\u00FCnberg received a diploma in 1962 from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University. Then he studied at the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany, where he received his diploma in physics in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1969. From 1969-1972, he did studied at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Later he joined the Institute for Solid State Physics at the J\u00FClich Research Centre, where he became a leading researcher of magnetism until he retired in 2004.\nImportant work.\nGr\u00FCnberg made important discoveries with ferrite (iron) and magnetism such as the Giant magnetoresistive effect (GMR) in 1988. GMR has been used in many modern hard drives. Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetic random access memory.\nApart from the Nobel Prize, Gr\u00FCnberg has been awarded with shared prizes in the APS International Prize for New Materials, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Magnetism Award, the Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize, the Wolf Prize in Physics in and the 2007 Japan Prize. He won the German Future Prize for Technology and Innovation in 1998 and was named European Inventor of the Year in the category \"Universities and research institutions\" by the European Patent Office and European Commission in 2006.\nDeath.\nGr\u00FCnberg died on 7 April 2018 in J\u00FClich, Germany at the age of 78.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":58},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":65},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":92},{"uri":"Giant_magnetoresistance","surface_form":"giant magnetoresistance","offset":136},{"uri":"Gigabyte","surface_form":"gigabyte","offset":171},{"uri":"Hard_disk_drive","surface_form":"hard disk drive","offset":180},{"uri":"Albert_Fert","surface_form":"Albert Fert","offset":244},{"uri":"Pilsen","surface_form":"Pilsen","offset":390},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":398},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":435},{"uri":"Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia","surface_form":"Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia","offset":470},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":533},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":751},{"uri":"Bene%C5%A1_decrees","surface_form":"Bene\u0161 decrees","offset":886},{"uri":"Lauterbach%2C_Hesse","surface_form":"Lauterbach, Hesse","offset":967},{"uri":"Gymnasium_(Germany)","surface_form":"gymnasium","offset":1002},{"uri":"Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe_University","surface_form":"Johann Wolfgang Goethe University","offset":1086},{"uri":"Darmstadt_University_of_Technology","surface_form":"Darmstadt University of Technology","offset":1144},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":1248},{"uri":"Carleton_University","surface_form":"Carleton University","offset":1297},{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":1320},{"uri":"J%C3%BClich_Research_Centre","surface_form":"J\u00FClich Research Centre","offset":1397},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":1461},{"uri":"Ferrite","surface_form":"ferrite","offset":1554},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":1573},{"uri":"Giant_magnetoresistive_effect","surface_form":"Giant magnetoresistive effect","offset":1595},{"uri":"Hard_drives","surface_form":"hard drives","offset":1673},{"uri":"MRAM","surface_form":"magnetic random access memory","offset":1722},{"uri":"Wolf_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Wolf Prize in Physics","offset":1988},{"uri":"Japan_Prize","surface_form":"Japan Prize","offset":2026},{"uri":"European_Inventor_of_the_Year","surface_form":"European Inventor of the Year","offset":2122},{"uri":"J%C3%BClich","surface_form":"J\u00FClich","offset":2312}]}
