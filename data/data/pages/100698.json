{"id":100698,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_(title)","text":"It may be from an Altaic language, probably a Mongolic language like Ruanruan.\nPresently, khans exist mostly in South Asia, Central Asia and Iran.\nA female khan is called a Khatun or Khanum.\nKhagan means 'Khan of Khans' but is often (incorrectly) 'shortened' to Khan. This is similar to how the Persian \"Shahanshah,\" 'King of Kings', is usually simply called the Shah. Genghis was also called the 'Great Khan' like how Ottoman Padishah was called the 'Great Sultan'.\nKhans rule over Khanates. Khagans rule over Khaganates.\nName.\nKhan is sometimes spelled as \"Xan\", \"Han\", \"Ke-Han\". Khan is a popular South Asian last name (e.g. Salman Khan).\nKhan now has many equivalent meanings such as commander, leader, or ruler. It is sometimes translated as king or prince (but khan is a bit different). Originally khans led small tribes.\nVariations.\nThere have been several variations on the title used in modern times. \"Khan Bahadur\" or \"Khan Sahib\" was a title of honor, granted by India to Muslims who had done major deeds of valor, or service to the nation or government. The Hindu counterpart for this title was \"Rai Bahadur\" or \"Rai Sahib\". This title was normally granted in addition to other awards and decorations and added either before or after a person's actual name as a prefix or suffix.\nMongol Empire.\nIt was used by the Mongols in their Mongol Empire.\nThe title \"Khan\" became well known when Mongol Tem\u00FCjin conquered most of Eurasia and formed the Mongol Empire. It was the greatest land empire the world ever saw.\nHe is often called Genghis Khan. But his real title was khagan.\nThe Mongol empire branched into the Ilkhanate of Persia and the Chagatai Khaganate of Central Asia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic language","offset":18},{"uri":"Mongolic_languages","surface_form":"Mongolic","offset":46},{"uri":"Ruanruan","surface_form":"Ruanruan","offset":69},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":112},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":124},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":141},{"uri":"King_of_Kings","surface_form":"King of Kings","offset":318},{"uri":"Shah","surface_form":"Shah","offset":363},{"uri":"Salman_Khan_(educator)","surface_form":"Salman Khan","offset":628},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"king","offset":747},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":755},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":983},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":1070},{"uri":"Mongols","surface_form":"Mongols","offset":1326},{"uri":"Mongol_Empire","surface_form":"Mongol Empire","offset":1343},{"uri":"Mongols","surface_form":"Mongol","offset":1398},{"uri":"Genghis_Khan","surface_form":"Tem\u00FCjin","offset":1405},{"uri":"Mongol_Empire","surface_form":"Mongol Empire","offset":1454},{"uri":"Genghis_Khan","surface_form":"Genghis Khan","offset":1540},{"uri":"Khagan","surface_form":"khagan","offset":1577}]}
