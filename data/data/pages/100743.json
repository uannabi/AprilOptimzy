{"id":100743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Haber_Institute_of_the_MPG","text":"The Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society is a science research group in Dahlem, Berlin, Germany.\nThe original was called Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, and it was founded in 1911. That became part of the Max Planck Society and took the name of the first director, Fritz Haber, in 1953.\nThe Institute has researched many kinds of physics including chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics, colloid chemistry, atomic physics, spectroscopy, surface chemistry and surface physics, chemical physics and molecular physics, theoretical chemistry, and materials science.\nDuring World War I and World War II, the Institute did much war work for Germany's military.\nSome of the most important members in the Institutes past are: Herbert Freundlich, Paul Friedlander, Rudolf Ladenburg, Michael Polanyi, Ladislaus Farkas, Hartmut Kallmann, Robert Havemann, Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, Rudolf Brill, Kurt Moliere, Jochen Block, Heinz Gerischer, Rolf Hosemann, Kurt \u00DCberreiter, and Alex Bradshaw.\nNobel Prize winners involved with the Institute include Max von Laue (1914), Fritz Haber (1918), James Franck (1925), Otto Hahn (1944), Eugene Wigner (1963), Ernst Ruska (1986), Gerhard Ertl (2007).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":57},{"uri":"Dahlem","surface_form":"Dahlem","offset":83},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":91},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":99},{"uri":"Max_Planck_Society","surface_form":"Max Planck Society","offset":254},{"uri":"Fritz_Haber","surface_form":"Fritz Haber","offset":314},{"uri":"Kinetics","surface_form":"kinetics","offset":406},{"uri":"Reaction_dynamics","surface_form":"reaction dynamics","offset":419},{"uri":"Colloid","surface_form":"colloid","offset":438},{"uri":"Atomic_physics","surface_form":"atomic physics","offset":457},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopy","offset":473},{"uri":"Surface_chemistry","surface_form":"surface chemistry","offset":487},{"uri":"Surface_physics","surface_form":"surface physics","offset":509},{"uri":"Chemical_physics","surface_form":"chemical physics","offset":526},{"uri":"Molecular_physics","surface_form":"molecular physics","offset":547},{"uri":"Theoretical_chemistry","surface_form":"theoretical chemistry","offset":566},{"uri":"Materials_science","surface_form":"materials science","offset":593},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":1031},{"uri":"Max_von_Laue","surface_form":"Max von Laue","offset":1087},{"uri":"Fritz_Haber","surface_form":"Fritz Haber","offset":1108},{"uri":"James_Franck","surface_form":"James Franck","offset":1128},{"uri":"Otto_Hahn","surface_form":"Otto Hahn","offset":1149},{"uri":"Eugene_Wigner","surface_form":"Eugene Wigner","offset":1167},{"uri":"Ernst_Ruska","surface_form":"Ernst Ruska","offset":1189},{"uri":"Gerhard_Ertl","surface_form":"Gerhard Ertl","offset":1209}]}
