{"id":100829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars","text":"Tatars refer to a number of Turkic-speaking peoples, which include (but are not limited to) the Volga Tatars, Lipka Tatars, Siberian Tatars. But do not include the Crimean Tatars. Most Tatars live in Russia (forming the majority in Tatarstan), as well as in countries as Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.\nSmaller minorities of Tatars live in Israel, France, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, and Japan.\nThe Tatars mostly practice Sunni Islam.\nTheir closest relatives are the Bashkirs, and they are also related to the Azerbaijanis, Kazakhs, Chuvash people, and the Turkish people.\nHistory.\nHistorically, the word \"Tatar\" might have referred to the Tatar confederation, which eventually became part of the Mongol Empire when Genghis Khan joined the various Eurasian steppe tribes into one empire. The term \"Tatars\" was spelled as \"Tartars\" on occasion. In the past, this term was used to refer to anyone coming from North and Central Asia dominated by many predominantly Turco-Mongol empires and kingdoms. Neighbouring non-Turkic peoples called any Turkic-speaking people Tatar. Nowadays, this term is used to refer to certain Turkic peoples.\nRussian historian D. Iskhakov wrote in 2000: \u201Cthe real history of Tatars, of the people in every respect historical, is not written yet\u201D.
