{"id":101235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_D._Kornberg","text":"Roger David Kornberg (born) is an American biochemist and Nobel prize winner. Kornberg got the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for studying eukaryote transcription (the copying of information from DNA to RNA).\nKornberg is a professor of Structural Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. His father, Arthur Kornberg, was also a professor at Stanford University, and got the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959.\nEarly life.\nKornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri to a Jewish family. He was the first of three children born to Arthur Kornberg and his wife, Sylvy. The parents worked together as biochemists. Roger Kornberg earned his bachelors degree from Harvard University in 1967 and his PhD from Stanford University in 1972. He then became a Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge, England.\nImportant studies.\nAll heredity is controlled by genes. For the cells to make use of the information in the genes, a copy of part of the gene must be made. The copying is called transcription. Transcription makes an RNA copy of part of the DNA. The RNA is moved out of the cell nucleus, to ribosomes, where it does its work. This is called messenger RNA and it gives the amino acid sequence for protein production. This second process is called translation. It works in all eukaryotes, including all plants and animals.\nKornberg worked with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s. He discovered the nucleosome, a very important protein structure in chromosomes. Nucleosomes form the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin. This packs the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus and allows it to be controlled.\nKornberg made the discovery that signals to the RNA are made by a complex of proteins that they called \"mediator\". The Nobel Prize committee said, \"the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and mediator. The discovery of mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process\".\nAfter long effort, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to take 3D pictures of RNA molecules, lipids and proteins. With these studies, Kornberg has created a picture of how DNA works. The Nobel Prize committee said, \"the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process\".\nIn 1959, Roger Kornberg's father, Arthur Kornberg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for studies of how genetic information moves from one DNA molecule to another. This is called DNA replication. Arthur Kornberg found the first enzyme that could make DNA. This was the first known enzyme to take its instructions from a DNA copy. Roger Kornberg's younger brother, Thomas Bill Kornberg, discovered DNA polymerases II and III in 1970 and is now a geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco. All three Kornbergs have worked to understand how genetic information is used in cells. Arthur and Roger Kornberg are the sixth father and son to win Nobel Prizes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":34},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":43},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":95},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":141},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":151},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":198},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":205},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":225},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":260},{"uri":"Arthur_Kornberg","surface_form":"Arthur Kornberg","offset":312},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":386},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":466},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":477},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":491},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":678},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":713},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":722},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Fellow","offset":768},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":821},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":846},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"heredity","offset":878},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":904},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":919},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":1033},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":1071},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"cell nucleus","offset":1128},{"uri":"Ribosome","surface_form":"ribosome","offset":1145},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":1195},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":1226},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":1250},{"uri":"Translation_(genetics)","surface_form":"translation","offset":1300},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":1329},{"uri":"Aaron_Klug","surface_form":"Aaron Klug","offset":1396},{"uri":"Francis_Crick","surface_form":"Francis Crick","offset":1411},{"uri":"Nucleosome","surface_form":"nucleosome","offset":1468},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":1518},{"uri":"Chromatin","surface_form":"chromatin","offset":1588},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":1631},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":1648},{"uri":"Mediator_(coactivator)","surface_form":"\"mediator\"","offset":1791},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":2137},{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallography","offset":2143},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":2167},{"uri":"Lipid","surface_form":"lipid","offset":2197},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":2645},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":2737},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":2741},{"uri":"DNA_replication","surface_form":"DNA replication","offset":2777},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":2826},{"uri":"Thomas_B._Kornberg","surface_form":"Thomas Bill Kornberg","offset":2962},{"uri":"DNA_polymerase","surface_form":"DNA polymerase","offset":2995},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":3043},{"uri":"University_of_California","surface_form":"University of California","offset":3061}]}
