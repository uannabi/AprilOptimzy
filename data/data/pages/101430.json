{"id":101430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butane","text":"Butane is an organic compound with the chemical formula. It is an alkane with four carbon atoms. It is used as a fuel (sometimes with propane) and in aerosol cans.\nUses of Butane.\nButane is sold in canisters, for cooking and camping. It is also used as fuel in cigarette lighters, and as propellant in aerosol sprays or deodorants. Some kinds of Butane are used in refrigerators.\nMixtures with Propane are known as LPG.\nDangers.\nButane can be hazardous. Inhalation can lead to death by asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in the lungs. Contact with the skin can lead to frostbite. If the gas is mixed with air and ignighted it is prone to explode like many other fuels that are volatile","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":13},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":39},{"uri":"Alkane","surface_form":"alkane","offset":66},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":90},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":113},{"uri":"Propane","surface_form":"propane","offset":134},{"uri":"Aerosol","surface_form":"aerosol","offset":150},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":253},{"uri":"Cigarette","surface_form":"cigarette","offset":261},{"uri":"Lighter","surface_form":"lighter","offset":271},{"uri":"Propellant","surface_form":"propellant","offset":288},{"uri":"Aerosol_spray","surface_form":"aerosol spray","offset":302},{"uri":"Deodorant","surface_form":"deodorant","offset":320},{"uri":"Refrigerator","surface_form":"refrigerator","offset":365},{"uri":"Propane","surface_form":"Propane","offset":394},{"uri":"Liquefied_petroleum_gas","surface_form":"LPG","offset":415},{"uri":"Asphyxiation","surface_form":"asphyxiation","offset":486},{"uri":"Frostbite","surface_form":"frostbite","offset":577},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explode","offset":646},{"uri":"Volatile","surface_form":"volatile","offset":685}]}
