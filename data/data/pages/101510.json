{"id":101510,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant","text":"e=\"preserve\">In science, a physical constant is a number (physical quantity) that does not change. This is different from a mathematical constant, which is not based on a real measurement.\nThere are many physical constants in science. Some famous ones are the speed of light, Planck's constant, the gravitational constant, and Avogadro's number.\nSome scientists think that physical constants may decrease as the universe gets older. There has been no evidence to support this yet.\nConstants that do not have units (like length or speed) are called fundamental physical constants.\nSome believe that if the physical constants were different, there would be no life in the universe. They say that the universe seems to be fine-tuned for intelligent life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":16},{"uri":"Physical_quantity","surface_form":"physical quantity","offset":58},{"uri":"Mathematical_constant","surface_form":"mathematical constant","offset":124},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":260},{"uri":"Planck%27s_constant","surface_form":"Planck's constant","offset":276},{"uri":"Gravitational_constant","surface_form":"gravitational constant","offset":299},{"uri":"Avogadro%27s_number","surface_form":"Avogadro's number","offset":327},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":412},{"uri":"Fundamental_physical_constant","surface_form":"fundamental physical constant","offset":548},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":658},{"uri":"Fine-tuned_universe","surface_form":"fine-tuned","offset":719}]}
