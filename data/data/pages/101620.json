The building had offices for the writers, and also a small recording studio to make demo recordings. Don Kirshner hired the writers who worked there, and helped promote their works.\nThe Brill Building writers included many pop stars and future pop stars, including Jeff Barry, Neil Diamond, Carole King, Carole Bayer Sager, and Neil Sedaka. The Monkees recorded a large number of Brill Building songs, but they also wrote songs of their own.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":34},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":54},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":76},{"uri":"1950s","surface_form":"1950s","offset":95},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":105},{"uri":"Recording_studio","surface_form":"recording studio","offset":171},{"uri":"Demo_(music)","surface_form":"demo","offset":196},{"uri":"Recording","surface_form":"recording","offset":201},{"uri":"Don_Kirshner","surface_form":"Don Kirshner","offset":213},{"uri":"Promotion","surface_form":"promote","offset":273},{"uri":"Pop_star","surface_form":"pop star","offset":335},{"uri":"Jeff_Barry","surface_form":"Jeff Barry","offset":377},{"uri":"Neil_Diamond","surface_form":"Neil Diamond","offset":389},{"uri":"Carole_King","surface_form":"Carole King","offset":403},{"uri":"Carole_Bayer_Sager","surface_form":"Carole Bayer Sager","offset":416},{"uri":"Neil_Sedaka","surface_form":"Neil Sedaka","offset":440},{"uri":"The_Monkees","surface_form":"The Monkees","offset":453}]}
