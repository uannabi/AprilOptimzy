{"id":101625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stewart","text":"e=\"preserve\">Christopher \"Chris\" Stewart (born 1950), is an English musician and writer. He was the first drummer for rock band Genesis. He is now a writer and a farmer.\nStewart went to school with Tony Banks, Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Anthony Phillips. The five of them formed a band called Anon. This band eventually became Genesis in January 1967. Stewart appears on the band's first two singles, \"The Silent Sun\"/\"That's Me\" and \"A Winter's Tale\"/\"One-Eyed Hound\".\nStewart was asked to leave the band in the summer of 1968, because he was not skilled enough. He was replaced by John Silver. After travelling and working throughout Europe, Stewart settled and bought a farm named \"El Valero\" in Andalusia, Spain.\nHe is now better known for his autobiograpical books: \"Driving Over Lemons: An Optimist in Andalucia\" (1999,) and the sequels, \"A Parrot In The Pepper Tree\" () and \"The Almond Blossom Appreciation Society\" (2006,). They are all about his work farming in Spain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":60},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":68},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":81},{"uri":"Drummer","surface_form":"drummer","offset":106},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock","offset":118},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":123},{"uri":"Genesis_(band)","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":128},{"uri":"Tony_Banks_(musician)","surface_form":"Tony Banks","offset":198},{"uri":"Peter_Gabriel","surface_form":"Peter Gabriel","offset":210},{"uri":"Mike_Rutherford","surface_form":"Mike Rutherford","offset":225},{"uri":"Anthony_Phillips","surface_form":"Anthony Phillips","offset":245},{"uri":"John_Silver","surface_form":"John Silver","offset":591},{"uri":"Andalusia","surface_form":"Andalusia","offset":707},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiograpical","offset":756},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":772}]}
