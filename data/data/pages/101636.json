{"id":101636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larch","text":"Larches are conifers in the genus \"Larix\". They grow on the northern hemisphere. Unlike other conifers, larches lose their leaves during autumn and winter.\nSpecies.\nThere are 10\u201314 species, for example the European Larch, the North American Larch and the Japanese Larch. Scientists usually divide them into two main groups, New World species (North America) and Old World species (Europe and Asia). Inside this one, there are two more groups, Northern (Central Europe, Siberia, Japan, north of China) and Southern (south of China, Himalaya, Myanmar).\nNorthern.\n\"Larix decidua\" or \"Larix europaea\" European Larch.\n\"Larix kaempferi\" or \"Larix leptolepis\" Japanese Larch.\nSouthern.\n\"Larix griffithii\" or \"Larix griffithiana\" Himalayan Larch.\nNorth American.\n\"Larix laricina\" Tamarack Larch or American Larch.\nThere is also a hybrid, the Dunkeld Larch, which is a mix of the European Larch and the Japanese Larch.\nUses.\nLarch wood is very valuable because it is resistant and it grows quickly. It is used for boats as well as houses.\nLarches are also used in herbal medicine and in bonsai.\nThe tree appeared in many Monty Python sketches as a joke.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":12},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":28},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":137},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":148},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":343},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":381},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":392},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":453},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":469},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":478},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":494},{"uri":"Himalaya","surface_form":"Himalaya","offset":531},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":541},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":822},{"uri":"Herbal_medicine","surface_form":"herbal medicine","offset":1055},{"uri":"Bonsai","surface_form":"bonsai","offset":1078},{"uri":"Monty_Python","surface_form":"Monty Python","offset":1112}]}
