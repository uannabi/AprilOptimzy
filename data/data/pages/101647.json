He then spends a lot of time explaining to the people why he is an apostle. Some of the people are mad at him because in 1st Corinthians he told them to stop doing bad things. He explains that he told them to stop because he loved them. He also teaches them that it is very important to forgive others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":77},{"uri":"Corinth","surface_form":"Corinth","offset":143},{"uri":"Paul_of_Tarsus","surface_form":"Apostle Paul","offset":158},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Lord Jesus Christ","offset":272},{"uri":"First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians","surface_form":"1st Corinthians","offset":412}]}
