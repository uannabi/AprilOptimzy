Their official titles are the Union with Ireland Act 1800 (1800 c.67 39 and 40 Geo 3), an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, and the Act of Union (Ireland) 1800 (1800 c.38 40 Geo 3), an Act of the Parliament of Ireland.\nThese two Acts merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the unified Kingdom of Great Britain, (being itself a merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Acts of Union 1707), to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe Union Flag.\nThe flag created as a consequence of the merger combined the flags of England and Scotland with \"St Patrick's Cross\" to represent Ireland. However, Wales is not included on the Union Flag, as when the original Union Flag was devised Wales was considered a part of the Kingdom of England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":70},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Parliament of Great Britain","offset":242},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Parliament of Ireland","offset":343},{"uri":"Merge","surface_form":"merged","offset":381},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Ireland","offset":392},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Kingdom of Great Britain","offset":427},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"Kingdom of England","offset":483},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Scotland","offset":510},{"uri":"Acts_of_Union_1707","surface_form":"Acts of Union 1707","offset":540},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","surface_form":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland","offset":575},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":706},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":718},{"uri":"St_Patrick%27s_Cross","surface_form":"St Patrick's Cross","offset":733},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":766},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":784},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"Kingdom of England","offset":904}]}
