{"id":101838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database","text":"A relational database is a way of storing information (\"data\"). The database matches data by using identical information that is found within the data set. The resulting groups of data are organized and are much easier for many people to understand.\nFor example, a database has all information about real-estate sales in a town. This information can be grouped by year, or by sale price, or by buyer's last name and so on. Such a grouping uses the relational model (a technical term for this is schema). Hence, such a database is called a \"relational database.\"\nThe software used to do this grouping is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). The term \"relational database\" often refers to this type of software.\nRelational databases are currently the main way in which companies store information like financial records, medical records, personal information and manufacturing and logistical data.\nThe term \"relational database\" was originally defined by and is attributed to Edgar Codd at IBM Almaden Research Center in 1970.\nReferences.\nRDBMS(Relational Database Management System):- RDBMS is a software package used to store and retrieve data is organized in the form of tables. In other words RDBMS store information in rows and columns and conducts searches by using data in specified columns and rows of one tables as well as to find additional data in another related table.\nTwo dimensional table is a natural way to represent data to a user. A table must be set up in a way that no information about the relations among data elements is lost.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database","offset":13},{"uri":"Relational_model","surface_form":"relational model","offset":448},{"uri":"Logical_schema","surface_form":"schema","offset":495},{"uri":"Relational_database_management_system","surface_form":"relational database management system","offset":612},{"uri":"E.F._Codd","surface_form":"Edgar Codd","offset":993},{"uri":"IBM_Almaden_Research_Center","surface_form":"IBM Almaden Research Center","offset":1007}]}
