{"id":10191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine","text":"Caffeine is a drug (or chemical) found in plants. It can be harmful for both humans and animals if a large amount is consumed. If a person ate 10-13 grams of caffeine quickly, between 80-100 cups of coffee, it would kill them.\nSource.\nCaffeine is the main drug that is in coffee. Coffee comes from a tree. The seeds of the tree are roasted to make coffee.\nCaffeine comes from other plants as well. It is in guarana, yerba mat\u00E9, cacao, and some plants used to make tea. The plants use caffeine as a \"pesticide\". This is a chemical that kills insects if they eat the plant. It is the way the plant protects itself.\nCaffeine was first extracted from cocoa beans into its purest form which is a white powder and the word originated from the German word \u201Ckaffee\u201D and the French word \u201Ccaf\u00E9\u201D which both mean caffeine.\nIt is called guaranine when it comes from the guarana plant and theine when it comes from a tea plant. It is called mateine in the mate drink. This drink is an infusion made with Yerba mate.\nWhat caffeine is.\nCaffeine is a \"stimulant\" drug. A stimulant is a drug that increases body actions like heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. It makes a person more awake and alert.\nCaffeine also is a diuretic. This means it makes a person make more urine (the waste liquid a person makes).\nThe caffeine chemical is called a \"xanthine alkaloid\". This is a group of chemicals that are stimulants. Some xanthine alkaloids (like theophylline) are used to help asthma.\nWhat caffeine is used for.\nThe biggest use of caffeine is as a stimulant. People drink coffee and other drinks with caffeine to stay awake.\nDoctors sometimes use caffeine as a medicine. It is used for headaches (head pain). It is sometimes used to help premature (born \"very\" early) babies to breathe. The short-term risk of this treatment seems to be that the babies treated gain less weight than usual.\nCaffeine is sometimes given to people after a lumbar puncture. This is a test to see if someone has meningitis.\nIn the beginning caffeine was found to relieve hunger, so it was used for weight loss. That did not last because people were using too much. Caffeine can be a very dangerous drug when not used in the right way.\nCaffeine also has medicinal properties. It is used in many over the counter medicines, such as Excedrin, Midol and Anacin. When combined with other analgesics, caffeine can help to alleviate headaches and cramps.\nHow much caffeine is safe.\n250\u2013300\u00A0mg of caffeine a day is a \"moderate\" amount. That is as much caffeine that is in three cups of coffee (8oz each cup). More than 750\u20131000\u00A0mg a day is a significant amount, but is very unlikely to kill someone. The Lethal Dose 50 of caffeine is 192\u00A0mg per kilogram, in rats. In humans, it is between 150 and 200\u00A0mg per kilogram (70-90 per pound.)\nOne ounce \u2013 abbreviated oz - is 30ml.\nA 'cup' is 8 oz (240ml.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":14},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":23},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":42},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":199},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":272},{"uri":"Cacao","surface_form":"cacao","offset":428},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":464},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":499},{"uri":"Guarana","surface_form":"guarana","offset":857},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":903},{"uri":"Mate_(drink)","surface_form":"mate drink","offset":942},{"uri":"Yerba_mate","surface_form":"Yerba mate","offset":990},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":1046},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":1107},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":1119},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":1139},{"uri":"Diuretic","surface_form":"diuretic","offset":1210},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":1259},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":1313},{"uri":"Asthma","surface_form":"asthma","offset":1466},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Doctors","offset":1614},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":1650},{"uri":"Headache","surface_form":"headache","offset":1675},{"uri":"Lumbar_puncture","surface_form":"lumbar puncture","offset":1925},{"uri":"Meningitis","surface_form":"meningitis","offset":1979},{"uri":"Analgesic","surface_form":"analgesic","offset":2350},{"uri":"LD50","surface_form":"Lethal Dose 50","offset":2663},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviated","offset":2807}]}
