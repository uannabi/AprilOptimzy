He is a Jedi Master who plays an important part in the films. Frank Oz voices Yoda. Originally he was a puppet, played by Oz. But in the last two movies, Episodes II and III, Yoda is made with CGI.\nHistory.\nYoda has lived for over 900 years and not much of his history before ' is known. He is an alien, but his race and where he is from are never said. He speaks the same language as everyone else but says his sentences sort of backwards. For example, \"Teach you, I will\" instead of \"I will teach you\".\nYoda is the oldest and wisest member of the Jedi Council. Even though he is very small, he is very good with a lightsaber and uses the 4th jedi style known as Ataru.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":33},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":53},{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":64},{"uri":"Jedi","surface_form":"Jedi","offset":82},{"uri":"Frank_Oz","surface_form":"Frank Oz","offset":136},{"uri":"Puppet","surface_form":"puppet","offset":178},{"uri":"Computer-generated_imagery","surface_form":"CGI","offset":267},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":335},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"alien","offset":371},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"race","offset":386},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":447},{"uri":"Jedi_Council","surface_form":"Jedi Council","offset":623},{"uri":"Lightsaber","surface_form":"lightsaber","offset":690},{"uri":"Ataru","surface_form":"Ataru","offset":738}]}
