{"id":102082,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi_(band)","text":"Gandhi is a rock band from Costa Rica. They play music using distorted guitars and rhythm. The band members are Abel Guier (bassist), Massimo Hern\u00E1ndez (drummer), Federico Miranda (guitarist) and Luis Montalbert-Smith (singer and pianist). The lyrics of Gandhi songs are written mainly by Montalbert-Smith. Some of the bands that influenced their songs are Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Queen and Soda Stereo.\nMontalbert-Smith is a very important part of the band's performances because of his charisma and stage presence. These characteristics makes the shows very interesting and full of adrenaline for their fans.\nThe band began when Miranda and Montalbert-Smith met in high school in the mid 1990s. The complete group of four members started playing at universities and local bars. One of the things that made their shows so well liked was the many different types of art offered. The fans could not only listen to the music, but also see very good scenery design, body painting and their performance.\nThe band won the Costa Rican award \"Album of the Year\" in 2004 for the album \"Ciclos\". The album \u201CP\u00E1ginas P\u00E9rdidas\u201D got three local awards in 2000. They have played in Costa Rica but also in Central America, Mexico and the United States.\nThe band was chosen to be part of the Tribute to Soda Stereo (\"Tributo a Soda Stereo\"). They played a version of \"En el s\u00E9timo d\u00EDa\" (\"In the Seventh Day\"). They have opened concerts for many international artists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock","offset":12},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":17},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":27},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":49},{"uri":"Distortion","surface_form":"distorted","offset":61},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":71},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":83},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bassist","offset":124},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":153},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":181},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":219},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"pianist","offset":230},{"uri":"Lyrics","surface_form":"lyrics","offset":244},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":261},{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":357},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":369},{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":382},{"uri":"Soda_Stereo","surface_form":"Soda Stereo","offset":392},{"uri":"Performance","surface_form":"performance","offset":461},{"uri":"Charisma","surface_form":"charisma","offset":489},{"uri":"Stage_(theatre)","surface_form":"stage","offset":502},{"uri":"Characteristic","surface_form":"characteristic","offset":524},{"uri":"Adrenaline","surface_form":"adrenaline","offset":585},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fans.","offset":606},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":668},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":752},{"uri":"Pub","surface_form":"bars","offset":775},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":867},{"uri":"Scenery","surface_form":"scenery","offset":948},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":956},{"uri":"Body_painting","surface_form":"body painting","offset":964},{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"award","offset":1030},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1192},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1209},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1224},{"uri":"Tribute_to_Soda_Stereo","surface_form":"Tribute to Soda Stereo","offset":1277},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":1412},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":1430},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"artists","offset":1444}]}
