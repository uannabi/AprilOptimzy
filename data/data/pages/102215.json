What started as a small surfing village popular with Costa Ricans from all over the Pacific coast, has developed into the most popular and visited tourism destination in the whole country. As the closest and most developed beach town from Costa Rica's Juan Santa Maria International Airport in San Jose, Jaco is only a 1 hour and 10 minute ride from the airport.\nJaco is home to the largest selection of hotels, vacation rental condos and private vacation rental homes than any other beach town in Costa Rica, as well as 3 casinos, over 75 restaurants, 3 major grocery stores, surf shops, pharmacies, souvenir and artesan shops, bakeries, dentists, emergency care, and an 18-hole championship golf course. The region is also home to Costa Rica's best zip line canopy tours, ATV tours, white water rafting, surfing and the fishing capital of Costa Rica at the Los Suenos Resort & Marina, in Herradura Beach directly next to Jaco Beach.\nTo the immediate south of Jaco is the surf town of Playa Hermosa (Hermosa Beach). 1 hour and 15 minutes to the south of Jaco Beach is the Manuel Antonio National Park and Wildlife preserve offering visitors a first hand glimpse of Costa Rica's famed wildlife species such as white face monkeys, howler monkeys, sloths, pizotes, iguanas, butterflies, frogs, insects, and exotic jungle plants native to Costa Rica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":54},{"uri":"Puntarenas_Province","surface_form":"Puntarenas","offset":67},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":95}]}
