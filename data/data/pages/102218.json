{"id":102218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irazu_Volcano","text":"Irazu Volcano National Park has one of the most active volcanos of Costa Rica. It is in the central mountain range at 31\u00A0km to northwest of the city of Cartago, 3,435 meters above sea level. It last erupted in 1963 and 1965.\nIrazu Volcano National Park offers many types of craters, some having small lakes. The park also includes 2,309 hectares of rain forest. From the highest point in the park, on a clear day, you can see both, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea at the same time.\nThe Crater Principal lake has an unusual greenish yellow coloring caused by rainfall dissolving the minerals along the craters walls. It has also been known to change colour to rust-red depending on the minerals present. The inactive, dry Diego de la Haya crater sits just up to the right of the Crater Principal and is filled with volcanic ash.\nThe park is the site of a reforestation project to restore the area which was destroyed by the eruptions. The forest is made up of conifers and other exotic and native species. There is a native forest consisting mainly of oaks and alder, protecting the watershed of the Reventado River.\nThe vegetation of the park has been changed by the constant eruptions, but it is very beautiful and diverse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":48},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":67},{"uri":"Cartago","surface_form":"Cartago","offset":152},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":274},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":301},{"uri":"Rain_forest","surface_form":"rain forest","offset":349},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":436},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":458},{"uri":"Oak","surface_form":"oak","offset":1059},{"uri":"Alder","surface_form":"alder","offset":1068},{"uri":"Reventado_River","surface_form":"Reventado River","offset":1107}]}
