{"id":102222,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathar_castles","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cathar castles (\"Ch\u00E2teaux cathares\" in French) is a term used by the French tourist industry. It is used for castles in the Languedoc-Roussillon, usually built by the enemies of the Cathars during the Albigensian Crusade.\nThe true Cathar castles.\nThe Cathars built fortified homesteads, but not castles. The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth. The cathar church did not build anything. For this reason, the only ones which can claim the description \"Cathar\" are the small castles, often totally unknown to the public. Their unspectacular ruins are often far-away from tourist routes.\nThe royal citadels.\nBecause Raimond II was unable to recapture Carcassone in 1240, the city walls were strengthened by the French King. He also destroyed small \"castra\" in the Corbi\u00E8res region and built citadels to protect the border with the kingdom of Aragon.\nThese five fortresses resisted various assaults led by the Aragonese army.\nThe abandonment of the citadels.\nIn 1659, Louis XIV and the Philip IV of Spain signed the Treaty of the Pyrenees. The French king also married the Infanta Marie Therese. The treaty changed the borders. It gave Rousillon to France and moved the frontier south to the crest of the Pyrenees, where it is now. The fortresses therefore lost their importance. Some maintained a garrison for a while, a few until the French Revolution, but they slowly fell into decay, often becoming sherpherds' shelters or bandits hideouts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":52},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":122},{"uri":"Languedoc-Roussillon","surface_form":"Languedoc-Roussillon","offset":137},{"uri":"Albigensian_Crusade","surface_form":"Albigensian Crusade","offset":214},{"uri":"Homestead","surface_form":"homestead","offset":288},{"uri":"Raimond_II","surface_form":"Raimond II","offset":654},{"uri":"Carcassone","surface_form":"Carcassone","offset":689},{"uri":"Citadel","surface_form":"citadel","offset":829},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":853},{"uri":"Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":880},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":1005},{"uri":"Philip_IV_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip IV of Spain","offset":1023},{"uri":"Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees","surface_form":"Treaty of the Pyrenees","offset":1053},{"uri":"Infanta","surface_form":"Infanta","offset":1110},{"uri":"Maria_Theresa_of_Spain","surface_form":"Marie Therese","offset":1118},{"uri":"Rousillon","surface_form":"Rousillon","offset":1173},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":1373},{"uri":"Sherpherd","surface_form":"sherpherd","offset":1440}]}
