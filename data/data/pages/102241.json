He was given the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006 for his work on COBE satellite with George Smoot. The COBE satellite measures black holes and cosmic radiation.\nThis work supported the big-bang theory of the universe beginning. It made cosmology much more accurate. The Nobel Prize committee said: \"the COBE-project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology as a precision science.\"\nMather is a Senior Astrophysicist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 2007, Mather was listed in \"Time\" magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.\nWork with COBE.\nAfter being awarded his Ph.D. Professor Mather went to work at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University. He started the work on COBE there (1974-1976). More than 1,000 researchers, engineers and other workers made the COBE satellite. John Mather was in control of them all and created the technology for measuring the cosmic radiation. George Smoot had the job of measuring small changes in the temperature of the radiation.\nProfessor Mather and John Boslough wrote all about the COBE teams work in a book called \"The Very First Light\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roanoke%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Roanoke, Virginia","offset":54},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":79},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysicist","offset":88},{"uri":"Cosmology","surface_form":"cosmologist","offset":107},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":137},{"uri":"COBE","surface_form":"COBE","offset":184},{"uri":"George_Smoot","surface_form":"George Smoot","offset":204},{"uri":"COBE","surface_form":"COBE","offset":222},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":246},{"uri":"Cosmic_radiation","surface_form":"cosmic radiation","offset":262},{"uri":"Big-bang","surface_form":"big-bang","offset":304},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":327},{"uri":"Cosmology","surface_form":"cosmology","offset":482},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":558},{"uri":"Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","surface_form":"Goddard Space Flight Center","offset":563},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":594},{"uri":"University_of_Maryland%2C_College_Park","surface_form":"University of Maryland, College Park","offset":640},{"uri":"Time_(magazine)","surface_form":"\"Time\" magazine's","offset":708},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":808},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":1095},{"uri":"George_Smoot","surface_form":"George Smoot","offset":1142},{"uri":"John_Boslough","surface_form":"John Boslough","offset":1252}]}
