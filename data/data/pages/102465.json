{"id":102465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language","text":"Romani or Romany (native name: ') is the language of the Roma and Sinti, once spoken in the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Aryan Romani language should not be confused with either Romanian (spoken by Romanians), or Romansh (spoken in parts of southeastern Switzerland), both of which are Romance languages.\nAnalysis of the Sanskrit based Romani language has shown that it is closely related to those spoken in central and northern India, Hindustani language in particular. This linguistic relationship is believed to indicate the Roma's and Sinti's geographical origin. Loanwords in Romani make it possible to trace the pattern of their migration westwards.\nDistribution.\nThe following table shows the distribution of Romani speakers in Europe according to Bakker et al. (2000) [http://romani.uni-graz.at/rombase/cd/data/lang/gen/data/numbers.en.pdf]. The last column shows the percentage of Romani speakers in the Roma population in each country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":41},{"uri":"Roma_people","surface_form":"Roma","offset":57},{"uri":"Sinti","surface_form":"Sinti","offset":66},{"uri":"Indo-Greek_Kingdom","surface_form":"Indo-Greek Kingdom","offset":92},{"uri":"Indo-Aryan_languages","surface_form":"Indo-Aryan","offset":116},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":178},{"uri":"Romanians","surface_form":"Romanians","offset":198},{"uri":"Romansh_language","surface_form":"Romansh","offset":213},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":254},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":286},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":321},{"uri":"Hindustani_language","surface_form":"Hindustani language","offset":436},{"uri":"Sinti","surface_form":"Sinti","offset":539},{"uri":"Loanword","surface_form":"Loanword","offset":568}]}
