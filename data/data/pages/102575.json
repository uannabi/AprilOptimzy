{"id":102575,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclamen","text":"\"Cyclamen\" is a genus of 20 species of flowering plants. It is in the Myrsinaceae family. The genus is most widely known by its scientific name Cyclamen. It may also be called Persian violet (it is not related to the violets), or primrose (neither is it a primrose). This is because Cyclamen has been part of the Primulaceae families.\nCyclamen come from the Mediterranean, from Spain to Iran. They are also found from northeast Africa to Somalia. They are perennial herbaceous aestivating plants, with a surface or underground tuber (derived from the hypocotyl) 4-12\u00A0cm diameter, which produces leaves in late winter, and flowers in the autumn; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the Mediterranean summer drought to save water. Each leaf or flower grows on its own stem, which shoots up from the hypocotyl. The variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive camouflage to reduce grazing damage by animals.\nThe hypocotyl grows leaves and flowers on stems, either one flower or one leaf per stem. The stem for leaves and flowers appears identical except in height. The leaves grow on stems of around 6\u00A0cm height.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":28},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":39},{"uri":"Myrsinaceae","surface_form":"Myrsinaceae","offset":70},{"uri":"Violet_(plant)","surface_form":"violets","offset":217},{"uri":"Primula_vulgaris","surface_form":"primrose","offset":256},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":358},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":378},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":387},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":428},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":438},{"uri":"Perennial","surface_form":"perennial","offset":456},{"uri":"Aestivate","surface_form":"aestivating","offset":477},{"uri":"Tuber","surface_form":"tuber","offset":527},{"uri":"Hypocotyl","surface_form":"hypocotyl","offset":551},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":595},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":622},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":717},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"camouflage","offset":899},{"uri":"Grazing","surface_form":"grazing","offset":920},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":938}]}
