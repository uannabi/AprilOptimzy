{"id":102591,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacmel","text":"Jacmel (Kr\u00E9y\u00F2l: \"Jakm\u00E8l\") is a city in southeast Haiti, on the Caribbean coast, at the mouth of the river \"Grande Rivi\u00E8re de Jacmel\". It is the capital city of the Sud-Est \"D\u00E9partement\".\nThe city is in the \"Baie de Jacmel\" (\"Jacmel Bay\") about 86\u00A0km south of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has four \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): Jacmel, Cayes-Jacmel, La Vall\u00E9e and Marigot.\nName.\n\"Jacci\" was the Ta\u00EDno name for the region where is located Jacmel. It was changed to the Spanish word \"Y\u00E1quimo\" (sometimes written as \"J\u00E1quimo\") and then to the French word Jacmel.\nHistory.\nChristopher Columbus gave the name \"Puerto de Brasil\" (\"Brazil port\") to the place where Jacmel is now because there were many trees called \"Brasil\" (English: Brazilwood) in the region that were cut and sent to Spain; the tree has a yellow substance (and wood) that was used to give that color to hair, cloths and other objects.\nIn 1504, Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of \"Villanueva de Y\u00E1quimo\" (or \"Villanova de Y\u00E1quimo\"). But people left the town and French people came to live here; in 1698, the new town of Jacmel was founded.\nJacmel today.\nThere are many beautiful old houses in Jacmel, from the 1880s. Since 2004, the 'Festival Film Jakm\u00E8l' is celebrated in Jacmel and, since 2007, the international music festival 'Festival Mizik Jakm\u00E8l'.\nMany visitors come to Jacmel for its carnival, the \"Bassins Bleu\" waterfalls, and the white sand beaches near the city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Haitian_Creole","surface_form":"Kr\u00E9y\u00F2l","offset":8},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":31},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":49},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":63},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":73},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":100},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":144},{"uri":"Sud-Est_Department","surface_form":"Sud-Est","offset":164},{"uri":"Departments_of_Haiti","surface_form":"D\u00E9partement","offset":173},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":263},{"uri":"Port-au-Prince","surface_form":"Port-au-Prince","offset":279},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":453},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":535},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":608},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":680},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":709},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":859},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":920},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":964},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":1006},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":1012},{"uri":"1504","surface_form":"1504","offset":1041},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Ovando","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando","offset":1047},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":1074},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":1090},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French people","offset":1204},{"uri":"1698","surface_form":"1698","offset":1240},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":1365},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":1433},{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":1563},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":1589},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":1594}]}
