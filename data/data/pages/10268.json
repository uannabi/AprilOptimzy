{"id":10268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta","text":"Delta (uppercase/lowercase \u0394 \u03B4), is a letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the \"d\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 4. Letters that came from it include the Roman D and Cyrillic \u0414.\nIn mathematics, the upper-case letter \u0394 can be used as symbol to represent \"change\" in a variable (e.g., formula_1). It can also be used to represent discriminant\u2014a key algebraic expression used to determine the number of roots a polynomial has. The lower-case letter formula_1, on the other hand, is often used to denote small quantities in proofs involving limit, a key concept on calculus is based on.\nIn molecular chemistry, the lower case Greek letter \u03B4 is used to represent a partial charge. This is always less than the unit charge associated with an ion, but has no real fixed value.\nA river delta is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":52},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":103},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern","offset":115},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":146},{"uri":"D","surface_form":"D","offset":227},{"uri":"%D0%94","surface_form":"\u0414","offset":242},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":248},{"uri":"Change","surface_form":"change","offset":321},{"uri":"Discriminant","surface_form":"discriminant","offset":395},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":475},{"uri":"Mathematical_proof","surface_form":"proofs","offset":587},{"uri":"Limit_of_a_function","surface_form":"limit","offset":604},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":628},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"river delta","offset":839}]}
