Kuban have previously spent two seasons in Russian Premier League and three seasons in Soviet Top League.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded as Dynamo in 1928, but was named Neftyanik in 1954, Kuban in 1958, and Spartak in 1960. In 1963 the club was renamed Kuban and has been known by this name ever since.\nKuban and their predecessors mainly played at the lower levels of Soviet football, winning the RSFSR championship four times. Kuban played in the Soviet Top League in 1980-1982, achieving their best result (13th position) in 1981.\nIn 1992, due to the dissolution of the USSR, Kuban were entitled to play at the top level instead of being relegated to the Second League. They finished 18th out of 20 teams and were relegated. After spending several seasons in First and Second divisions, they won promotion back to the Premier League for 2004, but were again relegated straight away. This happened again in 2006 when they won promotion for the 2006-2007 season and then finished second to bottom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":17},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":25},{"uri":"Krasnodar","surface_form":"Krasnodar","offset":48},{"uri":"Russian_Premier_League","surface_form":"Russian Premier League","offset":93},{"uri":"Russian_Premier_League","surface_form":"Russian Premier League","offset":160},{"uri":"Soviet_Top_League","surface_form":"Soviet Top League","offset":204},{"uri":"Kuban","surface_form":"Kuban","offset":305},{"uri":"Soviet_Top_League","surface_form":"Soviet Top League","offset":566},{"uri":"Russian_First_Division","surface_form":"First","offset":879},{"uri":"Russian_Second_Division","surface_form":"Second","offset":889},{"uri":"Russian_Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":938}]}
