{"id":10272,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main","text":"The Main (pronounced in German like the English word \"mine\") is a river in Germany, 524\u00A0km in length, and one of the bigger tributaries of the Rhine river. Its average discharge at Frankfurt East Harbour is 190 cubic metres/second. It flows through the Bundesl\u00E4nder (states) of Bavaria, Hesse and 25 Kilometers along the border of Bavaria with Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg. The biggest city on the Main is Frankfurt, others are Bayreuth, Bamberg, W\u00FCrzburg, Hanau and Offenbach. The mid Main valley is characterised by many vineyards. It is part of the region of Franken. Boats on the Main can use the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal to go to Eastern Europe.\nThe name of the river has nothing to do with the English word \"main\", which means \"most important\", or the French word \"main\", which means \"hand\". The river was named \"Mogin\" by the ancient celts after their god Mogon. Later, the Romans called the river \"Moenus\" in their language. In the Middle Ages, this name became \"Meyn\" and later \"Main\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":75},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":143},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"Bundesl\u00E4nder","offset":253},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":278},{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse","offset":287},{"uri":"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg","offset":344},{"uri":"Frankfurt_am_Main","surface_form":"Frankfurt","offset":395},{"uri":"Bayreuth","surface_form":"Bayreuth","offset":417},{"uri":"Bamberg","surface_form":"Bamberg","offset":427},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrzburg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrzburg","offset":436},{"uri":"Hanau","surface_form":"Hanau","offset":446},{"uri":"Offenbach_am_Main","surface_form":"Offenbach","offset":456},{"uri":"Winery","surface_form":"vineyard","offset":512},{"uri":"Franken","surface_form":"Franken","offset":551},{"uri":"Rhine-Main-Danube_Canal","surface_form":"Rhine-Main-Danube Canal","offset":590},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":623},{"uri":"Celts","surface_form":"celts","offset":829},{"uri":"Mogon","surface_form":"Mogon","offset":851},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":869},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"their language","offset":905},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":928}]}
