{"id":102721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army","text":"The Confederate States Army (CSA) was organized in February 1861 to fight for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Somewhere between 750,000 and 1.2 million soldiers served the Confederacy in one form or another. The exact numbers are not known because of incomplete and destroyed records. Although it won many battles the Confederate Army lost the war. It could not overcome the Union army's larger numbers and better resources. On April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee surrendered what was left of the Army of Northern Virginia to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. While his army was only a part of the total Confederate army, his surrender marked the end of the Confederacy. On June 23, 1865, Georgia's Stand Watie became the last Confederate general to surrender.\nMakeup.\nMuch of the design of the Confederate States Army was based on the structure and customs of the U.S. Army. Both armies were mainly infantry, cavalry and artillery units. While the structure of the two armies was very similar, the number of men in each unit could be different. Many Confederate officers were graduates of West Point just like Union officers. Regiments were usually numbered and named for the state where they were first organized and where most of the soldiers came from. Brigades were usually named after their commanders (past or present). For example, the Stonewall Brigade was named for its commanding general, Stonewall Jackson.\nThe Confederate Army had three parts; the Army of the Confederate States of America (ACSA, smallest but intended to be the permanent, regular army), the Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS, or \"volunteer\" Army, to be disbanded after the war), and the various Southern state militias. The Confederate Constitution called for the President, Jefferson Davis to be Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy. It did not call for a commanding general of the army but several generals were advisors to President Davis.\nConfederate officers.\nBefore the Civil War, many Confederate officers were in the United States Army. When war started, 313 army officers resigned and became officers in the Confederate army. Robert E. Lee was one of those who found it difficult to leave. Abraham Lincoln had offered to make him commander-in-chief of the Union Army. But he could not fight against his native Virginia. He became commander of the Virginia militia and when Virginia Seceded, a General of the Confederacy.\nMany militias elected their officers including field officers. When these units joined the Confederate army, their officers were commissioned. There were also a number of professional officers who came from Germany or Britain (just as there were in the Union army). But at the start of the war, few Southern officers had any real experience. Wealthy planters who owned 20 or more slaves were not required to serve in the army and many stayed home during the war. Some served in the Enlisted rank but many thought it was unfair to serve under officers so poor they could not afford a single slave. Many Confederate officers kept a slave as a personal servant throughout the war.\nConfederate soldiers.\nConfederate officers often did not maintain discipline among their men. Many of their soldiers were illiterate and some did not know which was their left foot and which was their right. At the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, even Lee complained about the lack of discipline in his army. Visiting foreign officials were shocked at lack of discipline and were amazed they could fight.\nAlmost all Confederate soldiers where white\nThe average Confederate soldier was in his early 20s. He was usually gaunt, unkempt and beards were common. It often did not fit, especially if taken off a dead soldier. Most wore a white shirt under their wool jacket. Replacement uniforms were hard to get. They would often stain homespun (clothing made at home) with a dye made from walnuts. This gave their uniforms a yellowish-brown appearance they called \"butternut\". Many did not have shoes or shoes that fit. Those who did nailed horseshoes to the bottom to keep them from wearing through the sole. At first he carried a musket or flintlock rifle. Later in the war many carried the better Enfield rifles taken from dead Union soldiers. Any boots, uniforms or supplies Union soldiers left behind or were captured were used by the Confederate soldiers. In camp, most of the tents were marked \"U.S.\" Most of the Southern Artillery was also captured Union cannons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Confederate_States_of_America","surface_form":"Confederate States of America","offset":82},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":123},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":177},{"uri":"Soldiers","surface_form":"soldiers","offset":185},{"uri":"Incomplete","surface_form":"incomplete","offset":284},{"uri":"Destroy","surface_form":"destroy","offset":299},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"records","offset":309},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":339},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":377},{"uri":"Union_army","surface_form":"Union army","offset":408},{"uri":"Resource","surface_form":"resource","offset":447},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"General","offset":476},{"uri":"Robert_E._Lee","surface_form":"Robert E.
