{"id":102767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druidism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Druidism or Druidry (referred to as Neodruidry or Neodruidism by some followers) is a form of modern spirituality that generally promotes harmony with nature, often through the form of nature worship. It is considered to be a Neopagan faith.\nOriginally inspired by 17th, 18th and 19th century romantic movements, early neo-druidism was based upon largely historically incorrect depictions of the Iron Age Celtic druids, and has no direct relation to the ancient Celts or their culture.\nBeliefs and Practises.\nNeo-druidic beliefs vary wildly, and there is no set dogma or belief system by which all adherents follow. The main belief is an idea that the Earth and nature is sacred, and is worthy of worship itself. For this reason many druids are pantheistic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spirituality","offset":114},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmony","offset":151},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":164},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":205},{"uri":"Neopaganism","surface_form":"Neopagan","offset":239},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"romantic","offset":306},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":409},{"uri":"Celt","surface_form":"Celt","offset":418},{"uri":"Druid","surface_form":"druid","offset":425},{"uri":"Dogma","surface_form":"dogma","offset":575},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":665},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":675},{"uri":"Pantheism","surface_form":"pantheistic","offset":758}]}
