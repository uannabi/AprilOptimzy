{"id":10278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans","text":"The Balkans is a peninsula in Europe. The region has a combined area of 550,000\u00A0km\u00B2 and an approximate population of 55 million people. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains, which run through the centre of Bulgaria into eastern Serbia and then continue to Slovenia as the Dinaric Alps.\nDefinitions and boundaries.\nBalkans comes from the Turkish language meaning \u201Cchain of wooded mountains\u201D or 'swampy forest'.\nGeography.\nThe Balkans are bordered by water on three sides: the Black Sea to the east and branches of the Mediterranean Sea to the south and west (including the Adriatic, Ionian, Aegean and Marmara seas). The Balkan Peninsula is bordered on the north by the Danube, Sava, and Kr\u010Da rivers.\nPopulation composition by nationality and religion.\nThe most common religions in the Balkans are Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christianity and Islam (mostly Sunni or non-denominational). Many different specific kinds of each faith are practiced, with each of the Eastern Orthodox countries having its own national church with its own patriarch.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a special case - 50% are Muslim Bosniaks, 31% are Serbian Orthodox, and 15% are Catholic Croats (therefore 46% are Christian). The remaining 4% adhere to other denominations of Christianity, other religions, or are irreligious.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":30},{"uri":"Balkan_Mountains","surface_form":"Balkan Mountains","offset":171},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":221},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":243},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":271},{"uri":"Dinaric_Alps","surface_form":"Dinaric Alps","offset":287},{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish language","offset":352},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":490},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":532},{"uri":"Adriatic_sea","surface_form":"Adriatic","offset":587},{"uri":"Ionian_sea","surface_form":"Ionian","offset":597},{"uri":"Aegean_sea","surface_form":"Aegean","offset":605},{"uri":"Sea_of_Marmara","surface_form":"Marmara","offset":616},{"uri":"Danube","surface_form":"Danube","offset":684},{"uri":"Sava","surface_form":"Sava","offset":692},{"uri":"Kr%C4%8Da","surface_form":"Kr\u010Da","offset":702},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodoxy","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox","offset":812},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":833},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":842},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":859},{"uri":"Sunni_Islam","surface_form":"Sunni","offset":873},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":1061},{"uri":"Bosniaks","surface_form":"Bosniaks","offset":1119},{"uri":"Serbs","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":1137},{"uri":"Croats","surface_form":"Croats","offset":1176}]}
