{"id":102803,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist","text":"e=\"preserve\"> (from German \"poltern\", meaning to rumble or make noise, and \"Geist\", meaning \"ghost\", \"spirit\", or \"embodiment\") is a spirit or ghost that is able to move and influence objects. Poltergeists are said to be invisible.\nPoltergeists are said to bother only one person at a time. This person is called their \"focus\". Poltergeists will bother only their focus. They are said to only last a few weeks, then will move on to another target. Often poltergeists are reported around children and adolescents. Some scientists think that poltergeists only exist in a person's head as a result of psychokinesis. They think that the \"poltergeist effect\" is a result of mental trauma.\nMedia.\nThere is a 1982 movie called \"Poltergeist\".\nIn \"Harry Potter\" there is a poltergeist named Peeves. However, Peeves is not a classic poltergeist. He can be seen and does not focus on bothering just one person.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":20},{"uri":"Geist","surface_form":"Geist","offset":76},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":93},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":102},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"spirit","offset":133},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":143},{"uri":"Psychokinesis","surface_form":"psychokinesis","offset":598},{"uri":"Trauma","surface_form":"trauma","offset":676},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":707},{"uri":"Poltergeist_(movie)","surface_form":"Poltergeist","offset":721},{"uri":"Harry_Potter","surface_form":"Harry Potter","offset":739}]}
