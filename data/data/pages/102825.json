{"id":102825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals","text":"The Kansas City Royals are a Major League Baseball team based in Kansas City, Missouri. They began play in 1969. The Royals won a World Series title in 1985. From 1973 to the present, the Royals have played in Kauffman Stadium. They are owned by David Glass, managed by Ned Yost, and their General Manager is Dayton Moore.\nThe old minor league baseball team in Kansas City had been called the Blues. There was also a famous Negro league baseball team called the Kansas City Monarchs. The Royals name and their team color blue are at least partly in honor of those older teams. The Kansas City Royals returned to the World Series in 2014 but lost to the San Francisco Giants. However, they won their second World Series championship in 2015, defeating the New York Mets 4 games to 1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":29},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City, Missouri","offset":65},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":130},{"uri":"1985","surface_form":"1985","offset":152},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":163},{"uri":"Kauffman_Stadium","surface_form":"Kauffman Stadium","offset":210},{"uri":"Owner","surface_form":"owned","offset":237},{"uri":"Ned_Yost","surface_form":"Ned Yost","offset":270},{"uri":"Minor_league_baseball","surface_form":"minor league baseball","offset":331},{"uri":"Negro_league_baseball","surface_form":"Negro league baseball","offset":424},{"uri":"Kansas_City_Monarchs","surface_form":"Kansas City Monarchs","offset":462},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Giants","surface_form":"San Francisco Giants","offset":653},{"uri":"New_York_Mets","surface_form":"New York Mets","offset":755}]}
