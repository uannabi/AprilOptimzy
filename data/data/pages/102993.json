{"id":102993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Grubbs","text":"Robert H. Grubbs (born 27 February 1942 in Possum Trot, Kentucky) is an American chemist. He won Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005.\nBirth and education.\nIn his Nobel Prize autobiography he says, \"In some places, my birthplace is listed as Calvert City, Kentucky and in others Possum Trot (both in Marshall County). I was actually born between the two, so either one really is correct.\" He spent his early childhood in Marshall County and attended public school at McKinley Elementary, Franklin Junior High and Paducah Tilghman High School in Paducah, Kentucky. Grubbs studied chemistry at the University of Florida where he was awarded a B.S. and an M.S.. He worked with Merle Battiste in Florida University, and Columbia University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1968. He was taught by Ronald Breslow in Columbia.\nHe next spent a year with James Collman at Stanford University. He was then made part of the faculty at Michigan State University. In 1978 he moved to California Institute of Technology where he still works as the Victor and Elizabeth Atkins Professor of Chemistry.\nHis main interest is for organometallic chemistry and organic chemistry. These interests are for catalysts, such as Grubbs' catalyst for olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization and norbornene. He also produced some important work on \"living polymerization\".\nAwards.\nGrubbs received the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Richard R. Schrock and Yves Chauvin, for his work in the field of olefin metathesis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"27_February","surface_form":"27 February","offset":23},{"uri":"1942","surface_form":"1942","offset":35},{"uri":"Possum_Trot%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Possum Trot","offset":43},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":56},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":72},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":81},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":97},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":125},{"uri":"Calvert_City","surface_form":"Calvert City","offset":238},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":252},{"uri":"Marshall_County%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Marshall County","offset":296},{"uri":"Elementary_school","surface_form":"Elementary","offset":472},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"High","offset":500},{"uri":"Paducah_Tilghman_High_School","surface_form":"Paducah Tilghman High School","offset":509},{"uri":"Paducah%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Paducah, Kentucky","offset":541},{"uri":"University_of_Florida","surface_form":"University of Florida","offset":592},{"uri":"B.S.","surface_form":"B.S.","offset":637},{"uri":"M.S.","surface_form":"M.S.","offset":649},{"uri":"Merle_Battiste","surface_form":"Merle Battiste","offset":670},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":712},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":755},{"uri":"Ronald_Breslow","surface_form":"Ronald Breslow","offset":787},{"uri":"James_Collman","surface_form":"James Collman","offset":841},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":858},{"uri":"Michigan_State_University","surface_form":"Michigan State University","offset":919},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"California Institute of Technology","offset":966},{"uri":"Victor_and_Elizabeth_Atkins_Professor_of_Chemistry","surface_form":"Victor and Elizabeth Atkins Professor of Chemistry","offset":1029},{"uri":"Organometallic_chemistry","surface_form":"organometallic chemistry","offset":1106},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":1135},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":1178},{"uri":"Grubbs%27_catalyst","surface_form":"Grubbs' catalyst","offset":1197},{"uri":"Olefin_metathesis","surface_form":"olefin metathesis","offset":1218},{"uri":"Ring-opening_metathesis_polymerization","surface_form":"ring-opening metathesis polymerization","offset":1240},{"uri":"Norbornene","surface_form":"norbornene","offset":1283},{"uri":"Living_polymerization","surface_form":"living polymerization","offset":1336},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":1393},{"uri":"Richard_R._Schrock","surface_form":"Richard R.
