After a bad industry collapse in 1983 and a rebirth two years later, the video game industry has experienced large growth for over twenty years. Now, it is a $10 billion industry and it earns almost as much money as the motion picture industry.\nNowadays, we have companies such as Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo that are very popular in most countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":105},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":119},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":165},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":180},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":191},{"uri":"Motion_picture","surface_form":"motion picture","offset":419}]}
