It is 21 kilometers north of Beaudesert on the Mount Lindsay Highway. The word Jimboomba is an Indigenous Australian word which means \"Loud thunder, little rain.\"\nHistory.\nJimboomba was first settled by Europens in 1845, when Thomas Dowse started to graze cattle and sheep in the area. In 1880, the first hotel, the Norfolk Hotel, opened for business, with several more hotels opened in the next few years as the railway from Beaudesert reached the town. The railway station became a loading spot for the local saw mill. The first school was opened in 1890 in the Presbyterian Church hall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":15},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":34},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":46},{"uri":"Beaudesert%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Beaudesert","offset":117},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Indigenous Australian","offset":183},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":291},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":393}]}
