{"id":103047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empire","text":"The Sassanid Empire or Sassanian Dynasty is the name used for the Iranian dynasty which lasted from 224 to 651 AD.\nThe Sassanid Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the two great power<nowiki/>s in Western Asia, alongside the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire, for more than 400 years.\nKing of kings.\nThe Sassanid dynasty was founded by Ardashir I when he had defeated the last Parthian (Arsacid) king, Artabanus IV, and ended when the last Sassanid Shahanshah (\"King of Kings\"), Yazdegerd III (632\u2013651), lost a 14-year struggle to drive out the early Arab Caliphate, the first of the Islamic empires.\nThe Sassanid Empire's traditional territory included all of today's Iran, Iraq, Armenia, Afghanistan, eastern parts of Turkey, and parts of Syria, Pakistan, Caucasia, Central Asia and Arabia.\nThe Sassanid era is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran. In many ways the Sassanid period saw the highest achievement of Persian civilization, and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the Muslim conquest and adoption of Islam.\nPersia influenced Roman civilization considerably during the Sassanids' times,p109 and the Romans reserved for the Sassanid Persians alone the status of equals. The Roman Emperor wrote letters to the Persian Shahanshah, which were addressed to \"my brother\". Their cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India, and played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art.\nThis influence carried forward to the early Islamic world. The dynasty's unique, aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest of Iran into a Persian renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing and other skills were borrowed mainly from the Sassanid Persians and propagated throughout the broader Muslim world.\nDecline.\nIn the spring of 632, a grandson of Khosrau I, Yazdegerd III who had lived in hiding, ascended the throne. In that same year, the first raiders from the Arab tribes made their raids into Persian territory. They were united by Islam. Years of warfare had exhausted both the Byzantines and the Persians. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation, religious unrest, rigid social stratification, the increasing power of the provincial landholders, and a rapid turnover of rulers. These factors made the Islamic conquest of Persia easier than it would have been in earlier times.\nThe Sassanids never mounted a truly effective resistance to the pressure applied by the Muslim conquests.\nSassanid Empire chronology.\n271\u2013301: A period of dynastic struggles.\n283: War with Rome.
