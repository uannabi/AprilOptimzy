{"id":103123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roentgenium","text":"=\"preserve\">Roentgenium (,) is a chemical element. It is a transition metal. Its symbol is Rg, and its position in the periodic table of the elements is 111.\nThe element is named in honor of a German physicist Wilhelm R\u00F6ntgen.\nSo far, it has not been found in nature. There seem to be 7 isotopes. All of them are radioactive. They have a half life of between 1.6 milliseconds and 26 seconds. Because of the Inert pair effect, it could have a color similar to that of gold.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":33},{"uri":"Transition_metal","surface_form":"transition metal","offset":59},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table of the elements","offset":119},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":200},{"uri":"Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen","surface_form":"Wilhelm R\u00F6ntgen","offset":210},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":287},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":313},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half life","offset":338},{"uri":"Inert_pair_effect","surface_form":"Inert pair effect","offset":407},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":467}]}
