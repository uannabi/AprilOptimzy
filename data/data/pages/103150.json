{"id":103150,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam","text":"e=\"preserve\">Salam (, '), sometimes spelled salaam, is an Arabic word that literally means \"peace\", but is also used as a general greeting, above all in Arabian countries and by the Muslims and farsi language countries, but also in other countries where Islam is important.\nAs-salamu \u02BFalaykum\u00A0() is a greeting in\u00A0Arabic\u00A0that means \"peace be upon you\". The greeting is a standard salutation among Muslims, whether socially or within worship and other contexts.\u00A0\u00A0The typical response to the greeting is\u00A0\"wa-\u02BFalaykumu as-sal\u0101m\"\u00A0(\u0648\u064E\u0639\u064E\u0644\u064E\u064A\u0652\u0643\u064F\u0645\u064F \u0671\u0644\u0633\u064E\u0651\u0644\u064E\u0627\u0645\u064F; \"and upon you be peace\"). The full version of the greeting is \"as-salamu \u02BFalaykum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh\" (, \"peace be upon you, as well as the mercy of God and His blessings\"), with the full response being \"wa-\u02BFalaykum as-salam wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh\" (). It is also preferred to use the greeting when arriving and also while leaving. It was reported that\u00A0Abu Hurairah\u00A0said \"When one of you joins a gathering, let him say 'Peace'. When he wants to get up and leave, let him say 'Peace'. The former is not more important than the latter\" (Hasan hadith reported in\u00A0J\u0101mi\u02BF at-Tirmidhi).\nIn addition, \"As-Salam\" is one of the 99 Names of God.\nThe Hebrew version is \"shalom\", that in Israel is used in the same way like \"salaam\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":92},{"uri":"Arabian_world","surface_form":"Arabian countries","offset":153},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":182},{"uri":"Persian","surface_form":"farsi","offset":194},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":254},{"uri":"99_Names_of_God","surface_form":"99 Names of God","offset":1185},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":1206},{"uri":"Shalom","surface_form":"shalom","offset":1225},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":1242}]}
