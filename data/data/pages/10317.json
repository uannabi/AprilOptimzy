{"id":10317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Eurovision Song Contest is a song contest run by the European Broadcasting Union that started in 1956. Different singers representing countries in Europe compete every year.\nFamous past winners include ABBA (representing their native Sweden in 1974), C\u00E9line Dion (though Canadian, she represented Switzerland) in 1988, Lordi (Finland, 2006), Loreen (Sweden, 2012).\nOne of Eurovision's most famous moments was in 1990 when Spain's entry suffered a technical fault at the start of the song but it was soon performed without any further problems.\nThe latest winner of the Eurovision Song Contest is Duncan Laurence of the Netherlands, achieving his country's fifth win of the contest (and first in 44 years) in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2019, with his song \"Arcade\".\nThe country that had to wait the longest from its first participation to achieve a win was Portugal, which won with the song \"Amar pelos dois\" by Salvador Sobral in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2017.\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first time the contest was cancelled.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"European_Broadcasting_Union","surface_form":"European Broadcasting Union","offset":71},{"uri":"ABBA","surface_form":"ABBA","offset":220},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":252},{"uri":"C%C3%A9line_Dion","surface_form":"C\u00E9line Dion","offset":269},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":289},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":315},{"uri":"Lordi","surface_form":"Lordi","offset":337},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":344},{"uri":"Loreen","surface_form":"Loreen","offset":360},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":368},{"uri":"Duncan_Laurence","surface_form":"Duncan Laurence","offset":614},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":637},{"uri":"Tel_Aviv","surface_form":"Tel Aviv","offset":726},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":736},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":868},{"uri":"Salvador_Sobral","surface_form":"Salvador Sobral","offset":923},{"uri":"Kiev","surface_form":"Kiev","offset":942},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":948},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"COVID-19 pandemic","offset":1024}]}
