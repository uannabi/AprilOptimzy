{"id":10318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability","text":"e=\"preserve\">Malleability is a substance's ability to deform under pressure (compressive stress). If malleable, a material may be flattened into thin sheets by hammering or rolling. Malleable materials can be flattened into metal leaf. One well-known type of metal leaf is gold leaf. Many metals with high malleability also have high ductility. Some do not; for example lead has low ductility but high malleability.\nMalleability is a physical property of matter, usually metals. The property usually applies to the family groups 1 to 12 on the modern periodic table of elements. It is the ability of a solid to bend or be hammered into other shapes without breaking. Examples of malleable metals are gold, iron, aluminum, copper, silver, and lead.\nGold and silver are highly malleable. When a piece of hot iron is hammered it takes the shape of a sheet. The property is not seen in non-metals. Non-malleable metals may break apart when struck by a hammer. Malleable metals usually bend and twist in various shapes.\nZinc is malleable at temperatures between 100 and 200\u00A0\u00B0C but is brittle at other temperatures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metal_leaf","surface_form":"metal leaf","offset":224},{"uri":"Gold_leaf","surface_form":"gold leaf","offset":273},{"uri":"Ductility","surface_form":"ductility","offset":334},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":370},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":455},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":471},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":551},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":602},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":622},{"uri":"Broken","surface_form":"breaking","offset":657},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":700},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":706},{"uri":"Aluminum","surface_form":"aluminum","offset":712},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":722},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":730},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":742},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"Gold","offset":748},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":757},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":806},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":814},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"Zinc","offset":1015}]}
