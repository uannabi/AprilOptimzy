{"id":10324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam","text":"Potsdam is a small German city which is right next to Berlin. In fact it touches the border of Berlin, and is about 26\u00A0km southwest of Berlin's centre. It is the capital of the state of Brandenburg. Potsdam has a small population: about 176,000 people lived in this city in 2017.\nOn the other hand, it is the largest World Heritage site in Germany. Potsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. It was planned in the Age of Enlightenment with a careful balance of architecture and landscape. Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its people of their relationship with nature and reason.\nAround the city there are a series of lakes and cultural landmarks. The parks and palaces of Sanssouci are the centre of the World Heritage Site. The Soviet Union did not return many of the Potsdam art treasures, and they remain to this day in Russia. The library of Frederick the Great was returned, but only 36 oil paintings.\nThe Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at the palace Cecilienhof.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["German Location"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":19},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":54},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":162},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"state","offset":177},{"uri":"Brandenburg","surface_form":"Brandenburg","offset":186},{"uri":"World_Heritage_site","surface_form":"World Heritage site","offset":317},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":380},{"uri":"German_Emperor","surface_form":"German Kaiser","offset":403},{"uri":"Age_of_Enlightenment","surface_form":"Age of Enlightenment","offset":451},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":498},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":515},{"uri":"Sanssouci","surface_form":"Sanssouci","offset":751},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":808},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":902},{"uri":"Frederick_the_Great","surface_form":"Frederick the Great","offset":925},{"uri":"Potsdam_Conference","surface_form":"Potsdam Conference","offset":990},{"uri":"Cecilienhof","surface_form":"Cecilienhof","offset":1040}]}
