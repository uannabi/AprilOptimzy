Its name comes from the name of its capital city, Hato Mayor del Rey (in English: \"the largest cattle farm of the King\").\nIt is one of the last provinces created in the Dominican Republic; it was made a province on 3 December 1984. The province's territory was part of the El Seibo province.\nLocation.\nHato Mayor is bordered to the northwest by the province of Saman\u00E1, to the east by the El Seibo province, to the west by the Monte Plata province and to the south by the San Pedro de Macor\u00EDs province.

There were other groups, mainly Ta\u00EDnos, living inland but, in general, the population was low.\nWhen the Spanish people came to this region, they found that there were many savannas with good grasses for food for cattle (cows), horses and sheep. And they made nine \"hatos\". \"Hato\" is a word from southern Spain that means a large farm for raising cattle (a ranch); it is a common word in the Dominican Republic. One of those \"hatos\" was Hato Mayor del Rey, made in the name of King Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) but given as a \"Mayorazgo\" (a family property) to Francisco D\u00E1vila as the manager and the property was called sometimes \"Hato Mayor de D\u00E1vila\".\nBecause there were many French people and from other countries trying to live in the Saman\u00E1 region, the colonial government founded the city of Sabana de la Mar in 1760 and brought people from the Canary Islands to live here.\nThe area of Hato Mayor was part of the El Seibo province until the new province began in 1984 with three municipalities: Hato Mayor del Rey, its capital, and Sabana de la Mar and El Valle.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Hato Mayor province, and 63,012 () living in towns and cities.
