{"id":103284,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheine","text":"Rheine is a city in the district of Steinfurt, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the biggest city in the district.\nGeography.\nRheine is on the river Ems, about 40 kilometers north of M\u00FCnster, about 45 kilometers west of Osnabr\u00FCck and 45 kilometers east of Enschede (Netherlands).\nHistory.\nAlthough a lot of people have lived in the area around the city since prehistorical times, Rheine was first mentioned in a document signed by Louis the Pious only in 838. On 15 August 1327 it got its town charter from Louis II, Bishop of M\u00FCnster.\nThe settlement was founded by reason of two old merchant roads crossing nearby, as well as a ford crossing the river Ems. Frankish soldiers secured this strategic point by a barrack yard at first. Later a church and more buildings were added to this outpost.\nIn the end of Thirty Years' War the city burned down almost completely. Swedish and Hessian troops besieged imperial soldiers who entrenched themselves in Rheine. On 20th/21st September and 19th October 1647 glowing cannonballs set fire to the city, 365 houses got razed.\nDuring the industrialisation textile industry prospered. It continued to be an important economical factor until the second half of the 20th century. Today engineering industries and services form the largest part of economy in Rheine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Steinfurt_(district)","surface_form":"Steinfurt","offset":36},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":50},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":74},{"uri":"Ems_(river)","surface_form":"Ems","offset":157},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":191},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":228},{"uri":"Enschede","surface_form":"Enschede","offset":264},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":274},{"uri":"Louis_the_Pious","surface_form":"Louis the Pious","offset":439},{"uri":"Louis_II%2C_Bishop_of_M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"Louis II, Bishop of M\u00FCnster","offset":515},{"uri":"Thirty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Thirty Years' War","offset":817},{"uri":"Industrialisation","surface_form":"industrialisation","offset":1086}]}
