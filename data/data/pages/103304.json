It is on position 185 of the biggest cities in Germany and the biggrst city in Tecklenburger Land.\nGeography.\nIbbenb\u00FCren (Ibbenbueren) is on the Ibbenb\u00FCrener Aa river, at the northwest end of the Teutoburger forest and rather exactly in the center of the two cities Rheine in the west and Osnabr\u00FCck in the east, both about 20\u00A0km away.\nHistory.\nIbbenb\u00FCren is said in documentary evidence for the first time in 1146, when the bishop of Osnabr\u00FCck at that time, Philipp of Katzenelnbogen, donated a tenth of his possessions in Ibbenb\u00FCren to the Getrudenkloster of Osnabr\u00FCck. Although Ibbenb\u00FCren is already much older and a document of the year 1348 already occupies the establishment of a church in the year 799, the year 1146 is officially considered as the year of the foundation of Ibbenb\u00FCren.\nIn the years 1219 and/or 1234 it appears as church village. In this transition of the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages the noble gentlemen of Ibbenb\u00FCren, that is the abbot of Herford and the counts of Tecklenburg, possessed basic rule in the place. To this time Ibbenb\u00FCren belonged to the Diocese of Osnabr\u00FCck. During this time the castle of Ibbenb\u00FCren was built by the noble gentlemen of Ibbenb\u00FCren starting from 1150. Last remainder of this castle are the remnants of the heath tower in the proximity of the Aasee.\nAfter the noble gentleman of Ibbenb\u00FCren died out, Ibbenb\u00FCren came under the exclusive rule of the counts of Tecklenburg. This rule lasted until the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century, when Ibbenb\u00FCren finally fell into possession Charles' V. in 1548 by awkward and luckless tactics used by the counts of Tecklenburg. Karl donated it to his sister Mary of Habsburg, governor of the Netherlands. Ibbenb\u00FCren was assigned to the office Lingen. Into this period also the falls the beginning of coal mining.\nAfter Ibbenb\u00FCren repeatedly fell under control of the Netherlands and Spain in the Dutch Revolt, it was assigned to the House of Orange-Nassau after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. In this time falls the beginning of iron ore mining in and around Ibbenb\u00FCren, which ended in the first half of the 19th century. By succession it came under Prussian rule in 1702. On February 1, 1724 Ibbenb\u00FCren attained municipal rights, which stood among other things in connection with the introduction excise duty. In the year 1743 the first magistrate and mayor appointed.\nDuring the rule of Napol\u00E9on Bonaparte at the beginning of the 19th century, Ibbenb\u00FCren belonged to the first French Empire, until it was freed by Prussian and Russian troops in 1815. It came back under Prussian rule on January 1, 1816, resulting to be assigned to the district of Tecklenburg. After the end of World War II the city Ibbenb\u00FCren and the municipality Ibbenb\u00FCren Land formed by December 31, 1974 the department federation Ibbenb\u00FCren, resulting in today's city of Ibbenb\u00FCren. With the simultaneous dissolution of the district of Tecklenburg and fusion with the old district of Burgsteinfurt, Ibbenb\u00FCren was assigned to the new district of Steinfurt.\nCoat of arms.\nCoat of arms has a golden anchor on blue reason.
