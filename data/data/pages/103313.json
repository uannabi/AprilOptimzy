{"id":103313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osnabr%C3%BCck_(district)","text":"Osnabr\u00FCck () is a district (\"Landkreis\") in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is near the districts of Emsland, Cloppenburg, Vechta and Diepholz, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (districts of Minden-L\u00FCbbecke, Herford, G\u00FCtersloh, Warendorf and Steinfurt) and the City of Osnabr\u00FCck.\nHistory.\nThe district is almost the same as the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00FCck which existed until 1803. When the clerical states of Germany were dissolved, Osnabr\u00FCck became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which in turn fell to Prussia in 1866. The district was established in 1972 by merging four old districts (Osnabr\u00FCck, Melle, Bersenbr\u00FCck, Wittlage).\nGeography.\nThe landscape is characterised by two mountain chains: the Wiehengebirge in the north and the northern foothills of the Teutoburg Forest in the south. These chains go around the City of Osnabr\u00FCck.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Districts_of_Germany","surface_form":"district","offset":18},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":44},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":58},{"uri":"Emsland","surface_form":"Emsland","offset":95},{"uri":"Cloppenburg_(district)","surface_form":"Cloppenburg","offset":104},{"uri":"Vechta_(district)","surface_form":"Vechta","offset":117},{"uri":"Diepholz_(district)","surface_form":"Diepholz","offset":128},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":151},{"uri":"Minden-L%C3%BCbbecke","surface_form":"Minden-L\u00FCbbecke","offset":188},{"uri":"Herford_(district)","surface_form":"Herford","offset":205},{"uri":"G%C3%BCtersloh_(district)","surface_form":"G\u00FCtersloh","offset":214},{"uri":"Warendorf_(district)","surface_form":"Warendorf","offset":225},{"uri":"Steinfurt_(district)","surface_form":"Steinfurt","offset":239},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":266},{"uri":"Prince-Bishopric_of_Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":325},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":375},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Hanover","surface_form":"Kingdom of Hanover","offset":462},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":504},{"uri":"1866","surface_form":"1866","offset":515},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":553},{"uri":"Wiehengebirge","surface_form":"Wiehengebirge","offset":701},{"uri":"Teutoburg_Forest","surface_form":"Teutoburg Forest","offset":762}]}
