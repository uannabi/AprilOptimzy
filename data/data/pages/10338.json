He was bisexual.\nCrowley also started a mystical philosophy known as Thelema, the \"Abbey of Thelema\", and revived the term magick.\nEarly life.\nEdward Alexander Crowley was born at 36 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England, between 11:00pm and 11:59\u00A0p.m. on 12 October 1875.\nIn 1895, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge after going to Malvern College and Tonbridge School. In his three years at Cambridge, his father died and left him a large sum of money.\nIn December 1896, Crowley took interest in occultism and by the next year, he began reading books on alchemy and mysticism. A year later, he published his first book of poetry (\"Aceldama\"), and left Cambridge, only to meet Julian L. Baker who introduced him to Samuel Mathers and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\nIn November 1899, Crowley bought Boleskine House in Foyers on the shore of Loch Ness in Scotland.\nThe Golden Dawn.\nSamuel Mathers, acting leader of the Golden Dawn organisation, acted as his early mentor in western magic. Crowley lost faith in his mentor's abilities in 1900 but did not officially break with Mathers until 1904.\nDeath.\nCrowley died of a respiratory infection in a Hastings boarding house on 1 December 1947 at the age of 72. He had been addicted to heroin after being prescribed morphine for his asthma and bronchitis many years earlier.\nReadings at the cremation service in Brighton included \"Hymn to Pan\", and newspapers referred to the service as a black mass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":59},{"uri":"Mystic","surface_form":"mystic","offset":67},{"uri":"Occult","surface_form":"occult","offset":75},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":86},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":94},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":121},{"uri":"Influential","surface_form":"influential","offset":176},{"uri":"Occult","surface_form":"occult","offset":203},{"uri":"Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn","surface_form":"Golden Dawn","offset":237},{"uri":"A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4","surface_form":"A\u2234A\u2234","offset":254},{"uri":"Ordo_Templi_Orientis","surface_form":"Ordo Templi Orientis","offset":264},{"uri":"Bisexual","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":361},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":403},{"uri":"Thelema","surface_form":"Thelema","offset":423},{"uri":"Magick","surface_form":"magick","offset":477},{"uri":"Royal_Leamington_Spa","surface_form":"Royal Leamington Spa","offset":557},{"uri":"Warwickshire","surface_form":"Warwickshire","offset":579},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":593},{"uri":"Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Trinity College, Cambridge","offset":673},{"uri":"Malvern_College","surface_form":"Malvern College","offset":715},{"uri":"Tonbridge_School","surface_form":"Tonbridge School","offset":735},{"uri":"Occultism","surface_form":"occultism","offset":880},{"uri":"Alchemy","surface_form":"alchemy","offset":938},{"uri":"Mysticism","surface_form":"mysticism","offset":950},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":1036},{"uri":"Samuel_Liddell_MacGregor_Mathers","surface_form":"Samuel Mathers","offset":1098},{"uri":"Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn","surface_form":"Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn","offset":1121},{"uri":"Boleskine_House","surface_form":"Boleskine House","offset":1189},{"uri":"Foyers","surface_form":"Foyers","offset":1208},{"uri":"Loch_Ness","surface_form":"Loch Ness","offset":1231},{"uri":"Samuel_Liddell_MacGregor_Mathers","surface_form":"Samuel Mathers","offset":1271},{"uri":"Hastings","surface_form":"Hastings","offset":1537},{"uri":"Boarding_house","surface_form":"boarding house","offset":1546},{"uri":"Asthma","surface_form":"asthma","offset":1669},{"uri":"Bronchitis","surface_form":"bronchitis","offset":1680},{"uri":"Brighton","surface_form":"Brighton","offset":1748},{"uri":"Black_mass","surface_form":"black mass","offset":1825}]}
