{"id":103400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnadevaraya","text":"Sri Krishnadevaraya (, 1509-1529 CE) was the most famous king of Vijayanagara Empire. He ruled the Vijayangara empire at the most important time. He is considered to be one of the great kings of India. Emperor Krishnadevaraya also earned the titles \"Kannada Rajya Rama Ramana (\u0C95\u0CA8\u0CCD\u0CA8\u0CA1\u0CB0\u0CBE\u0C9C\u0CCD\u0CAF\u0CB0\u0CAE\u0CBE\u0CB0\u0CAE\u0CA3)\", \"Moorurayaraganda (\u0CAE\u0CC2\u0CB0\u0CC1\u0CB0\u0CBE\u0CAF\u0CB0\u0C97\u0C82\u0CA1)\" (what means \"King of three kings\") and \"Andhra Bhoja (\u0C06\u0C02\u0C27\u0C4D\u0C30\u0C2D\u0C4B\u0C1C)\". Much of our information about his reign comes from the accounts of Portuguese travelers Domingos Paes and Nuniz.\nPaes describes the king's attitude to law and order by the sentence, \"The king maintains the law by killing.\" Offences against property (designed to maintain stability) and for murder ranged from cutting of a foot and hand for theft and beheading for murder (except for those occurring as a result of duel). Paes could not estimate the size of Vijaynagar as his view was obscured by the hills but estimated the city to be at least as large as Rome. Furthermore, he considered Vijaynagar to be \"the best provided city in the world\" with a population of not less than a half a million.\nPaes praises Krishnadevaraya as, \u201Cthe most feared and perfect King\u2026 a great ruler and a man of much justice\u201D.\nThe rule of Krishnadevaraya was an age of good literature in many languages. But it is known as a golden age of Telugu literature. Many Telugu, Sanskrit, Kannada and Tamil poets enjoyed the patronage of the emperor. Emperor Krishnadevaraya was fluent in many languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1509","surface_form":"1509","offset":23},{"uri":"1529","surface_form":"1529","offset":28},{"uri":"Vijayanagara_Empire","surface_form":"Vijayanagara Empire","offset":65},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":195},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":547},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":952},{"uri":"Golden_age","surface_form":"golden age","offset":1301},{"uri":"Telugu","surface_form":"Telugu","offset":1339},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":1347},{"uri":"Kannada","surface_form":"Kannada","offset":1357},{"uri":"Tamil_language","surface_form":"Tamil","offset":1369},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":1375},{"uri":"Patronage","surface_form":"patronage","offset":1393}]}
