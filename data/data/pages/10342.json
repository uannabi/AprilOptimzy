The wealthy John Allan took Edgar into his home in Richmond, Virginia. In 1815, the Allan family moved to England. Young Poe went to an English private school. After five years, the family moved back to Richmond, Virginia.\nAfter moving back to Virginia, Poe entered the University of Virginia in 1826. While there, he gambled, lost money, and went into debt. John Allan became angry, and cut off all contact with Poe. In 1827, Poe published his first work, a collection of poetry titled, \"Tamerlane and Other Poems\". Poe did not have his name published in the book; it was attributed to \"a Bostonian.\"\nMilitary life.\nPoe enlisted in the army. He used the name Edgar A. Perry and lied about his age. He was successful as a soldier and quickly became a sergeant major. While in the army his foster-mother Frances Allan died. Poe attempted to mend his relationship with John Allan. Poe soon left the army and enrolled at West Point in New York state.\nPoe did not enjoy his time at West Point and got very bored. He was expelled in March 1831. At this point, John Allan disowned him. Poe was well-liked by other cadets. They contributed money to pay for Poe to publish a book of his poems called \"Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems\". He soon moved to Baltimore, Maryland.\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, New York.\nIn Baltimore, Poe lived with his aunt, Maria Poe Clemm. She was the sister of Edgar's real father. Clemm also had a daughter named Virginia Clemm. Virginia admired Poe very much. In 1836, when Virginia was thirteen, she and Poe married.\nPoe was writing a lot by this time. He sold his first short story in 1832. His writing did not earn very much money. He also worked as an editor for various magazines over the years, becoming very well known for his literary criticism. Poe also was drinking off and on during these years.\nIn 1842, while Poe was living with Clemm and Virginia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Virginia became sick with tuberculosis. The family moved to the New York City area in 1843 before settling in The Bronx. On January 29, 1845, Poe published his most famous poem, \"The Raven\", making him very popular. Virginia died a few years later, on January 30, 1847.\nDeath.\nOn September 27, 1849, Poe left Richmond after a short visit. It is unknown what happened to him until October 3, when he was discovered outside of Gunner's Hall by a man named Joseph W. Walker in Baltimore. He was taken to Washington College Hospital. While in the hospital he became delirious and started seeing hallucinations. He died on October 7, 1849, in the hospital. Though it is not known what was his cause of death, there are several possible theories, including congestion of the brain, alcoholism withdrawal, tuberculosis, and rabies.\nPoe was buried in the grounds of the Westminster Church and Burying Ground after a small funeral with only a few people. On May 17, 1875, Poe was reburied at the front of the churchyard after a city-wide campaign to raise money to build a large monument. He is buried there alongside his wife Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":60},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":69},{"uri":"Horror","surface_form":"horror","offset":86},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":105},{"uri":"Vaudeville","surface_form":"vaudeville","offset":211},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":386},{"uri":"Richmond%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Richmond, Virginia","offset":476},{"uri":"University_of_Virginia","surface_form":"University of Virginia","offset":695},{"uri":"West_Point","surface_form":"West Point","offset":1343},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":1357},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore, Maryland","offset":1675},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":1734},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short story","offset":2022},{"uri":"Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","offset":2314},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":2406},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"The Bronx","offset":2452},{"uri":"January_29","surface_form":"January 29","offset":2466},{"uri":"1845","surface_form":"1845","offset":2478},{"uri":"The_Raven","surface_form":"The Raven","offset":2521},{"uri":"January_30","surface_form":"January 30","offset":2594},{"uri":"1847","surface_form":"1847","offset":2606},{"uri":"Delirium","surface_form":"delirious","offset":2904},{"uri":"Hallucination","surface_form":"hallucination","offset":2933},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":3118},{"uri":"Rabies","surface_form":"rabies","offset":3159},{"uri":"Funeral","surface_form":"funeral","offset":3256},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":3412}]}
