He was the most famous stage, movie and television dancer of his day.\nAstaire started dancing on the stage with his sister Ad\u00E8le, and when she married he started a movie partnership with Ginger Rogers. After that, he danced with a succession of talented American dancers on movie and on television. He appeared in 32 movies. His movie partners included Eleanor Powell, Ann Miller, Vera-Ellen, Cyd Charisse: all high-class dancers, and on TV with Barrie Chase. Their \"An evening with Fred Astaire\" won nine Emmy Awards in 1958.\nMany male dancers of the 20th century were influenced by him, and said so. He owed something to the choreography of Hermes Pan, but more to his own perfectionism and relentless practice.\nAstaire was also an excellent actor, and a successful, though personally modest, singer. He introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the Great American Songbook. He married Phyllis Potter in 1933; they had two children. After her death, he remarried in 1980 to Robyn Smith, a female jockey 45 years his junior.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":77},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":86},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":94},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":105},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"stage","offset":135},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":142},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":152},{"uri":"Ginger_Rogers","surface_form":"Ginger Rogers","offset":299},{"uri":"Eleanor_Powell","surface_form":"Eleanor Powell","offset":465},{"uri":"Ann_Miller","surface_form":"Ann Miller","offset":481},{"uri":"Vera-Ellen","surface_form":"Vera-Ellen","offset":493},{"uri":"Cyd_Charisse","surface_form":"Cyd Charisse","offset":505},{"uri":"Barrie_Chase","surface_form":"Barrie Chase","offset":558},{"uri":"Choreography","surface_form":"choreography","offset":739},{"uri":"Hermes_Pan","surface_form":"Hermes Pan","offset":755},{"uri":"Perfectionism","surface_form":"perfectionism","offset":787},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":907},{"uri":"Great_American_Songbook","surface_form":"Great American Songbook","offset":972},{"uri":"Jockey","surface_form":"jockey","offset":1118}]}
