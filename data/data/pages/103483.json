{"id":103483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle","text":"The Beagle is a breed of small to medium-sized dog. It is a Hound, and it has short legs and long, soft ears. Beagles are mostly developed for hunting and finding hare, rabbit, and other kinds of game. They can do this because they can smell well and have very quick instincts. They are also popular as pets because of their good size, sweet temper, and health. This kind of character also makes them be used very much for animal testing.\nBeagles can have coats of different colors. Some variations can be tri-colored, orange, red, or lemon, although they are widely known for sporting the tri-colored look (Black, brown, and white). They usually have brown eyes.\nAlthough beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years, the modern kind came from Great Britain around the 1830s.\nBeagles have been included in popular culture since the times when Queen Elizabeth began to rule, in literature and paintings, and more recently in movie, television and comic books. Snoopy of the comic strip \"Peanuts\" has been picked as \"the world's most famous beagle\".\nEarly beagles.\nDogs that look almost the same as the modern Beagle can be traced in Ancient Greece\nback to around the 5th century BC. In the \"Treatise on Hunting\" or \"Cynegeticus\", written by Xenophon, who said there was a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed by foot. Small hounds were mentioned in the Forest Laws. If these laws were true, it would be enough proof that beagle-type dogs lived in England before 1016, but it is likely that the laws were written in the Middle Ages for tradition.\nIn the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a white, slow hound. Once, English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to make them faster in running. They are extinct now, but once they had made the Southern Hound more popular, which helped the Southern Hound descend to the Beagle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dog_breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":16},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":47},{"uri":"Hound","surface_form":"Hound","offset":60},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":104},{"uri":"Develop","surface_form":"developed","offset":129},{"uri":"Hunt","surface_form":"hunt","offset":143},{"uri":"Hare","surface_form":"hare","offset":163},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":169},{"uri":"Game_(food)","surface_form":"game","offset":196},{"uri":"Olfaction","surface_form":"smell","offset":236},{"uri":"Instinct","surface_form":"instinct","offset":267},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":354},{"uri":"Animal_testing","surface_form":"animal testing","offset":423},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coats","offset":456},{"uri":"Exist","surface_form":"existed","offset":695},{"uri":"Modern","surface_form":"modern","offset":729},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":751},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":821},{"uri":"Elizabeth_I_of_England","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth","offset":850},{"uri":"Snoopy","surface_form":"Snoopy","offset":966},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comic strip","offset":980},{"uri":"Peanuts","surface_form":"Peanuts","offset":993},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":1139},{"uri":"Hound","surface_form":"hound","offset":1278},{"uri":"Scent","surface_form":"scent","offset":1305},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":1538},{"uri":"William_I_of_England","surface_form":"William the Conqueror","offset":1586},{"uri":"Greyhound","surface_form":"Greyhound","offset":1721}]}
