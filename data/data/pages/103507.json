{"id":103507,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_Ship","text":"=\"preserve\">The Cylon Resurrection Ship is a fictional type of spacecraft found in the television series \"Battlestar Galactica\". The ship is a part of Cylon fleet.\nCylons who are killed have their consciousness downloaded into a nearby resurrection ship. A new body is created for their consciousness. This lets them live again after they die. If a cylon is too far away from the nearest resurrection ship, death will be permanent. With nowhere for the consciousness to download to, they will simply cease to exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":45},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":63},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":87},{"uri":"Battlestar_Galactica","surface_form":"Battlestar Galactica","offset":106},{"uri":"Cylon","surface_form":"Cylon","offset":151},{"uri":"Fleet_(ships)","surface_form":"fleet","offset":157},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":197},{"uri":"Download","surface_form":"download","offset":211}]}
