It originated from China and is now widely practised in Korea.\n\u9053 Dao, also Romanized as Tao, is the \"Force\" that Taoists believe makes everything in the world. It is very mysterious, and instead of spending a lot of time trying to explain what the Tao is, Taoists focus on living a simple and balanced life in harmony with nature. This is one of the most important principles in Taoism. Taoists also believe that conflict is not good and that if you have a problem with something, it is better to find a way around it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":45},{"uri":"Chinese_folk_religion","surface_form":"Chinese folklore","offset":55},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoism","offset":73},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucianism","offset":84},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religions","offset":115},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang Dynasty","offset":272},{"uri":"Hui_people","surface_form":"Hui people","offset":290},{"uri":"Uyghur_people","surface_form":"Uyghur people","offset":305},{"uri":"Muslims","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":323},{"uri":"Han_Buddhism","surface_form":"Han Buddhism","offset":394},{"uri":"Tibetan_Buddhism","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhism","offset":408},{"uri":"Theravada","surface_form":"Theravada","offset":430},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":462},{"uri":"Mahayana","surface_form":"Mahayana","offset":488},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythical figures","offset":1030},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":1178},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucianism","offset":1209},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":1244},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoism","offset":1257},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"neolithic","offset":1324},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":1385},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":1390},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":1396},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"Heaven","offset":1403},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":1422},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":1500},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucianism","offset":1510},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoism","offset":1528},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1712},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":1749},{"uri":"%E9%81%93","surface_form":"\u9053 Dao","offset":1756},{"uri":"Tao","surface_form":"Tao","offset":1781},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":2016},{"uri":"Conflict","surface_form":"conflict","offset":2106}]}
