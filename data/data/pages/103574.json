{"id":103574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ungyong","text":"Kim Ung-yong (born 8 March 1962) was a Korean child prodigy. He was able to read and write in Japanese, Korean, German and English before he turned four years old. At the age of four, on 2 November 1967, he answered differential and integral calculus questions on Japanese television, showed that he could speak German, English, Japanese and Korean, and write poetry. Kim was listed in the Guiness Book of World Records under \"Highest IQ\"; the book guessed the boy's score at \"over 200.\"\nKim was a guest student of physics at Hanyang University from the age of 3 until he was 6. At the age of 7 he was invited to the United States by NASA. He finished his university studies, eventually getting a Ph.D. in physics at Colorado State University before he was 15. In 1974, during his university studies, he began his research work at NASA and continued this work until his return to Korea in 1978.\nWhen he returned to Korea, he decided to switch from physics to civil engineering and eventually received a doctorate in that field. Kim was offered the chance to study at the most prestigious universities in Korea, but instead chose to attend a provincial university.\nAs of 2007 he also serves as adjunct faculty at Chungbuk National University.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Korean_people","surface_form":"Korean","offset":39},{"uri":"Child_prodigy","surface_form":"child prodigy","offset":46},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":94},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":104},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":112},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":123},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":242},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":273},{"uri":"Guiness_Book_of_World_Records","surface_form":"Guiness Book of World Records","offset":390},{"uri":"IQ","surface_form":"IQ","offset":435},{"uri":"Hanyang_University","surface_form":"Hanyang University","offset":526},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":617},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":634},{"uri":"Colorado_State_University","surface_form":"Colorado State University","offset":717},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":880},{"uri":"Civil_engineering","surface_form":"civil engineering","offset":959},{"uri":"Chungbuk_National_University","surface_form":"Chungbuk National University","offset":1212}]}
