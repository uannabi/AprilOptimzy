For instance, he tried to change the Parliament of Scotland to suit English lines. Many of his actions were useful, but they also upset many people. Therefore during the later years of his reign his ability was questioned, but when the king threw a party on February 21, 1437, he was assassinated by a group of Scots led by Sir Robert Graham. He attempted to escape his attackers through a sewer but could not because the sewer was blocked. A wave of executions followed, including the king's uncle, Sir Walter Sterwart and Sir Robert Steward.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_of_Scots","surface_form":"King of Scots","offset":52},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economic","offset":172},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"legal","offset":185},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Parliament of Scotland","offset":237},{"uri":"Robert_Graham","surface_form":"Robert Graham","offset":528},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"execution","offset":651},{"uri":"Uncle","surface_form":"uncle","offset":693},{"uri":"Walter_Sterwart","surface_form":"Walter Sterwart","offset":704},{"uri":"Robert_Steward","surface_form":"Robert Steward","offset":728}]}
