{"id":103796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder","text":"A sleep disorder is a problem that stops people from sleeping normally. But really what is normal sleeping? There are many sleep disorders, and some of them are very serious. A test commonly ordered for some sleep disorders is the polysomnogram.\nTreatment.\nA sleep diary or log can be used to help diagnose (define) the problem. It can also be used to measure improvements.\nAccording to Dr. William Dement of the Stanford Sleep Center, anyone who snores and is sleepy in the daytime should see a doctor about sleep disorders.\nIn case of chronic pain, both the pain and the sleep problems should be treated. Pain can lead to sleep problems and vice versa.\nThe choice of a treatment for a sleep disorder depends on the patient's diagnosis, his/her medical and psychiatric history, and how she or he prefers to be treated. Medications sometimes work fast. On the other hand, sometimes behavioral treatment of insomnia may give more lasting results.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polysomnogram","surface_form":"polysomnogram","offset":231}]}
