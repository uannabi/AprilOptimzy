It is a part of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe sea and its islands and reefs are claimed by many nations, including China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. These claims are mirrored in the many names used for the islands and the sea.\nNames.\nThe name of the sea as used internationally is \"South China Sea.\" In Vietnam the sea is called \"Bi\u1EC3n \u0110\u00F4ng\" (which exactly means \"East Sea\").\nIn the Philippines the eastern part of the sea, right to the west of Luzon island, was commonly called \"Luzon Sea\",\" with the remaining sea still called \"South China Sea.\" To support its claims on the Spratly Islands and the Scarborough Shoal, the Philippines has named the eastern part of the sea the \"West Philippine Sea\" in 2012. Sometimes, this name is extended as the name of the entire sea itself in the country.\nGeography.\nThe South China Sea runs from Singapore to the Taiwan Strait The sea has an area of around 3,500,000\u00A0km\u00B2. It is located in the western arm of the Pacific Ocean\nIt is one of the largest seas after the five oceans. There are hundreds of small South China Sea Islands. As a group, these islands are called an archipelago.\nSome of the bigger islands have people living on them. They are inhabited. Most of the islands are small and uninhabited.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":26},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":32},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":55},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":82},{"uri":"Reef","surface_form":"reef","offset":125},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":170},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":177},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":190},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":203},{"uri":"Brunei","surface_form":"Brunei","offset":216},{"uri":"Mirror","surface_form":"mirrored","offset":241},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":337},{"uri":"Luzon","surface_form":"Luzon","offset":519},{"uri":"Spratly_Islands","surface_form":"Spratly Islands","offset":651},{"uri":"Scarborough_Shoal","surface_form":"Scarborough Shoal","offset":675},{"uri":"Extend","surface_form":"extended","offset":807},{"uri":"Entire","surface_form":"entire","offset":835},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":910},{"uri":"Taiwan_Strait","surface_form":"Taiwan Strait","offset":927},{"uri":"Seas","surface_form":"seas","offset":1065},{"uri":"Oceans","surface_form":"oceans","offset":1085},{"uri":"South_China_Sea_Islands","surface_form":"South China Sea Islands","offset":1121},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":1186},{"uri":"Inhabited","surface_form":"inhabited","offset":1263},{"uri":"Uninhabited","surface_form":"uninhabited","offset":1308}]}
