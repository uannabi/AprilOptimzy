One exabyte holds 1000 petabytes (PB) or a million trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes. An exabyte is so large that it would take about one million powerful home computers to store this amount of data.\nOne thousand exabytes make one zettabyte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit of measurement","offset":33},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":57},{"uri":"Future","surface_form":"future","offset":74},{"uri":"Petabyte","surface_form":"petabyte","offset":105},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":170},{"uri":"Zettabyte","surface_form":"zettabyte","offset":322}]}
