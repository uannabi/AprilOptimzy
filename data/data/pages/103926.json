One zettabyte holds 1000 exabytes (EB) or a billion trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes, and 1000 zettabytes make one yottabyte.\nA zettabyte is so large that it would take about a million supercomputers (or a billion powerful home computers)\nto store this amount of data.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit of measurement","offset":34},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":58},{"uri":"Exabyte","surface_form":"exabyte","offset":108},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":176},{"uri":"Yottabyte","surface_form":"yottabyte","offset":212},{"uri":"Supercomputer","surface_form":"supercomputer","offset":282}]}
