{"id":104000,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Arran","text":"Arran or the Isle of Arran is the largest island in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland.\nWith an area of it is the seventh largest Scottish island. Just over 5,000 people live there.\nArran shares with the Hebrides cultural and physical similarities. Arran is mountainous and has been described as a \"geologist's paradise\".p11/17\nPeople have lived there since the early Neolithic period, from which time on there are numerous prehistoric remains.\nFrom the 6th century on peoples from Ireland colonised the island and it became a centre of religious activity. During the troubled Viking Age, Arran became the property of the Norwegian crown before becoming formally absorbed by the Kingdom of Scotland in the thirteenth century.\nThe 19th century \"clearances\" led to significant reductions in population and the end of the Gaelic language and way of life.\nThe economy and population have recovered in recent years, the main industry being tourism. There is diversity of wildlife, including three species of tree endemic to the area. There are regular field trips in the summer by geology and biology students.\nGeology.\nThe island is sometimes referred to as \"Scotland in miniature\", as it is divided into \"Highland\" and \"Lowland\" areas by the Highland Boundary Fault which runs northeast to southwest across Scotland.p297/301\nThe island is a popular destination for geologists, who come to see intrusive igneous landforms such as sills and dykes as well as sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Mesozoic.\nMost of the interior of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial volcanic activity around 60 million years ago in the Tertiary period. There is an older outer ring of coarse granites and an inner core of finer grained material.\nSedimentary rocks dominate the southern half of the island, especially Old and New Red Sandstone. Sand dunes are preserved in Permian sandstones near Brodick, there are localised outcrops of Triassic rocks,p143/4/9 and even some Cretaceous chalk.\nVisiting in 1787, the geologist James Hutton found his first example of an unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza. It showed evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism, and about the age of the Earth. This spot is one of the most famous places in the study of geology.\nThe Pleistocene glaciations almost entirely covered Scotland in ice. After the last retreat of the ice at the close of the Pleistocene epoch sea levels were up to lower than at present and it is likely that circa 14,000 years ago the island was connected to mainland Scotland.p68/69\nSea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting coastlines a complex task, but the island is clearly ringed by post glacial raised beaches.p28\nWhat this means is that the huge weight of ice pressed down the Earth's crust here, and so the beaches were much higher up than now. Gradually, long after the ice melted, the island came back up.\nKing's Cave on the south west coast is an example of such a raised beach. This cave, which is over long and up to high, lies well above the present day sea level.\nThere are tall sea cliffs to the north east including large rock slides under the heights of Torr Reamhar and at Scriden (\"An Scriodan\") at the far north end of the island. The Scriden rocks fell \"some two hundred years ago, with a concussion that shook the earth and was heard in Bute and Argyllshire\".p19","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Firth_of_Clyde","surface_form":"Firth of Clyde","offset":56},{"uri":"Hebrides","surface_form":"Hebrides","offset":198},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":252},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":362},{"uri":"Prehistory","surface_form":"prehistoric","offset":418},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":476},{"uri":"Viking_Age","surface_form":"Viking Age","offset":571},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":616},{"uri":"Gaelic_language","surface_form":"Gaelic language","offset":813},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":1002},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":1070},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":1082},{"uri":"Highland_Boundary_Fault","surface_form":"Highland Boundary Fault","offset":1233},{"uri":"Geologist","surface_form":"geologist","offset":1356},{"uri":"Igneous_rock","surface_form":"intrusive igneous landforms","offset":1384},{"uri":"Sill_(geology)","surface_form":"sill","offset":1420},{"uri":"Dike_(geology)","surface_form":"dyke","offset":1430},{"uri":"Sedimentary","surface_form":"sedimentary","offset":1447},{"uri":"Precambrian","surface_form":"Precambrian","offset":1505},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":1520},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":1609},{"uri":"Batholith","surface_form":"batholith","offset":1617},{"uri":"Tertiary","surface_form":"Tertiary","offset":1712},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":1768},{"uri":"Old_Red_Sandstone","surface_form":"Old","offset":1893},{"uri":"New_Red_Sandstone","surface_form":"New Red Sandstone","offset":1901},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":1948},{"uri":"Brodick","surface_form":"Brodick","offset":1972},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":2013},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":2051},{"uri":"James_Hutton","surface_form":"James Hutton","offset":2101},{"uri":"Unconformity","surface_form":"unconformity","offset":2144},{"uri":"Lochranza","surface_form":"Lochranza","offset":2191},{"uri":"Plutonism","surface_form":"Plutonist","offset":2229},{"uri":"Uniformitarianism_(science)","surface_form":"uniformitarianism","offset":2251},{"uri":"Age_of_the_Earth","surface_form":"age of the Earth","offset":2284},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":2374},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":2493},{"uri":"Isostasy","surface_form":"isostatic","offset":2679},{"uri":"Raised_beach","surface_form":"raised beach","offset":2793}]}
