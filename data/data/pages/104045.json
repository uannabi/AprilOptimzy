This settlement served as the capital of the colony. It is today the modern town of Plymouth, Massachusetts.\nSeparatists and Anglicans (together, the \"Pilgrims\") founded the colony. With Jamestown and other settlements in Virginia Colony, it was one of the earliest successful English colonies in North America. It was the first sizable permanent English settlement in the New England region.\nThe colony made a treaty with Chief Massasoit. This helped to make the colony a success. The colonists played a role in King Philip's War. The colony merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other territories in 1691. Together they formed the Province of Massachusetts Bay.\nPlymouth holds a special role in American history. Many of the Plymouth colonists left England for a place to worship in their own way. The social and legal systems of the colony became tied to their religious beliefs, as well as English custom. Many of the people and events surrounding Plymouth Colony have become part of American folklore. These include Thanksgiving and Plymouth Rock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":31},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":41},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":179},{"uri":"Plymouth%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Plymouth","offset":352},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":362},{"uri":"Anglicanism","surface_form":"Anglicans","offset":393},{"uri":"Pilgrims","surface_form":"Pilgrims","offset":419},{"uri":"Jamestown%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Jamestown","offset":455},{"uri":"Virginia_Colony","surface_form":"Virginia Colony","offset":490},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":641},{"uri":"Massasoit","surface_form":"Chief Massasoit","offset":691},{"uri":"King_Philip%27s_War","surface_form":"King Philip's War","offset":781},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Bay_Colony","surface_form":"Massachusetts Bay Colony","offset":827},{"uri":"American_history","surface_form":"American history","offset":972},{"uri":"Thanksgiving","surface_form":"Thanksgiving","offset":1296},{"uri":"Plymouth_Rock","surface_form":"Plymouth Rock","offset":1313}]}
