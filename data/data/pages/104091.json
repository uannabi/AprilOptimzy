{"id":104091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period","text":", also called the Tokugawa period (\u5FB3\u5DDD\u6642\u4EE3 \"Tokugawa-jidai\"), is the time between 1600 and 1868 in the history of Japan. During this long time Japanese society was ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate and the country's 300 regional feudal lords.\nThese years come after the Azuchi-Momoyama period and before the Meiji Restoration and the development of modern Japan.\nThe Tokugawa shogunate was established at Edo in 1603 by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. The period was marked by the influence of neo-Confucianism and Shinto. The 15th and last shogun was Tokugawa Yoshinobu.\nThe period ended with the Meiji Restoration, which was the restoration of imperial rule. The Edo period is also known as the beginning of the early modern period of Japan.\nTimeline.\nIn 1600, the Battle of Sekigahara establishes a context for the next two centuries. Tokugawa Ieyasu defeats a coalition of daimyo and establishes hegemony over most of Japan.\nIn 1868, Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigns, the Tokugawa shogunate ends. This marks the end of the Edo period. Emperor Meiji establishes his Imperial capital in Edo, which is renamed Tokyo (\"eastern capital\").\nEconomy Trade Diplomacy.\nIn the Edo period, Japan developed very much economically, and accumulation of the capital became the driving force of the economic development after the Meiji Restoration.\nBecause many daimyos stayed at the inn along the highway by daimyo's alternate-year residence in Tokyo, the circulation of the economy became active.\nAnd due to the stable economy, Japanese special culture such as Nou or Kabuki or Ukiyoe had also developed very well.\nThe Shogunate instituted a foreign policy of isolationism.\nTherefore trade relations carried out by the Shogunate are only in Nagasaki, and the Netherland in Dejima.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"History_of_Japan","surface_form":"history of Japan","offset":100},{"uri":"Tokugawa_shogunate","surface_form":"Tokugawa shogunate","offset":174},{"uri":"Feudal","surface_form":"feudal","offset":224},{"uri":"Azuchi-Momoyama_period","surface_form":"Azuchi-Momoyama period","offset":265},{"uri":"Meiji_Restoration","surface_form":"Meiji Restoration","offset":303},{"uri":"Established","surface_form":"established","offset":385},{"uri":"Edo","surface_form":"Edo","offset":400},{"uri":"Shogun","surface_form":"shogun","offset":419},{"uri":"Tokugawa_Ieyasu","surface_form":"Tokugawa Ieyasu","offset":426},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"neo-Confucianism","offset":485},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":506},{"uri":"Tokugawa_Yoshinobu","surface_form":"Tokugawa Yoshinobu","offset":543},{"uri":"Meiji_Restoration","surface_form":"Meiji Restoration","offset":589},{"uri":"Governance","surface_form":"rule","offset":646},{"uri":"Battle_of_Sekigahara","surface_form":"Battle of Sekigahara","offset":758},{"uri":"Tokugawa_Ieyasu","surface_form":"Tokugawa Ieyasu","offset":829},{"uri":"Tokugawa_Yoshinobu","surface_form":"Tokugawa Yoshinobu","offset":929},{"uri":"Emperor_Meiji","surface_form":"Emperor Meiji","offset":1024}]}
