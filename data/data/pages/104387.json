{"id":104387,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterspout","text":"A waterspout is a funnel cloud over water. It is a nonsupercell tornado over water. Waterspouts do \"not\" suck up water; the water seen in the main funnel cloud is actually water droplets formed by condensation. It is weaker than most of its land counterparts.\nNon-tornadic.\nWaterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm, are known as \"nontornadic\" or \"fair-weather waterspouts\", and are by far the most common type.\nFair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective cumulus towers.\nSnowspout.\nA winter waterspout, also known as a snow devil, an icespout, an ice devil, a snonado, or a snowspout, is a very rare meteorological phenomenon in which a vortex from snow develops that looks like a waterspout. One does not know much about this rare happening and there are only six known pictures of this event so far.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Funnel_cloud","surface_form":"funnel cloud","offset":18},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":64},{"uri":"Supercell","surface_form":"supercell","offset":339},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":349},{"uri":"Cumulus","surface_form":"cumulus","offset":574},{"uri":"Rare","surface_form":"rare","offset":714},{"uri":"Meteorology","surface_form":"meteorological","offset":719},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":734},{"uri":"Vortex","surface_form":"vortex","offset":756},{"uri":"Waterspout","surface_form":"waterspout","offset":800}]}
