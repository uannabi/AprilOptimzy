Samford ranked 118 out of 262 institutions in \"U.S. News and World Reports' \" college rankings.\nHistory.\n\"Samford University\" was founded as \"Howard College\" in 1841 and opened its doors to students on January 3, 1842, in Marion, Alabama. In 1887 the school moved to Birmingham.\nWomen were first admitted to \"Howard College\" in 1895. In 1920 the school joined the \"Southern Association of Colleges\" and in 1927 it added its pharmacy school. In 1965, \"Howard\" got back its master's degree program. This led to the college's becoming a well-known college by November 9, 1965. The school was renamed in honor of \"Frank Park Samford\", chairman of the Board of Trustees and most generous personal supporter, because there was already a \"Howard University\" in Washington, D.C..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Private_school","surface_form":"private","offset":24},{"uri":"Southern_Baptist","surface_form":"Southern Baptist","offset":33},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":58},{"uri":"Homewood%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Homewood, Alabama","offset":72},{"uri":"Birmingham%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Birmingham, Alabama","offset":103},{"uri":"1841","surface_form":"1841","offset":285},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":314},{"uri":"January_3","surface_form":"January 3","offset":326},{"uri":"1842","surface_form":"1842","offset":337},{"uri":"Marion%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Marion, Alabama","offset":346},{"uri":"1887","surface_form":"1887","offset":366},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"Women","offset":403},{"uri":"1895","surface_form":"1895","offset":452},{"uri":"1927","surface_form":"1927","offset":530},{"uri":"Pharmacy","surface_form":"pharmacy","offset":548},{"uri":"1965","surface_form":"1965","offset":568},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"degree","offset":605},{"uri":"November_9","surface_form":"November 9","offset":680},{"uri":"1965","surface_form":"1965","offset":692},{"uri":"Honor","surface_form":"honor","offset":724},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":878}]}
