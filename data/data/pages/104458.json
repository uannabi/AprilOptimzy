He is most famous for his epic poem \"The Faerie Queene\", which talks about different knights who fight against evil. The poem also praises Queen Elizabeth I of England. He wrote also many sonnets and poems. The sonnets were collected under the name of Amoretti.\nEdmund Spenser invented a new rhyme-scheme for sonnet (abab bcbc cdcd ee) and a nine-line stanza (ababbcbcc). These forms are today called Spenserian sonnet and Spenserian stanza. Spenserian stanza was later used by many poets, among others by George Gordon Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats and Alfred Tennyson.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":62},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":72},{"uri":"The_Faerie_Queene","surface_form":"The Faerie Queene","offset":118},{"uri":"Knight","surface_form":"knight","offset":166},{"uri":"Elizabeth_I_of_England","surface_form":"Elizabeth I of England","offset":226},{"uri":"Sonnet","surface_form":"sonnet","offset":390},{"uri":"Spenserian_sonnet","surface_form":"Spenserian sonnet","offset":482},{"uri":"Spenserian_stanza","surface_form":"Spenserian stanza","offset":504},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"George Gordon Byron","offset":587},{"uri":"Percy_Bysshe_Shelley","surface_form":"Percy Bysshe Shelley","offset":608},{"uri":"John_Keats","surface_form":"John Keats","offset":630},{"uri":"Alfred_Tennyson","surface_form":"Alfred Tennyson","offset":645}]}
