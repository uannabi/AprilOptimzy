{"id":104462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_languages","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term Papuan languages means languages of the western Pacific which are neither Austronesian nor Australian. That is, the term is defined negatively and does not mean a linguistic relationship.\nThe languages.\nThe majority of the Papuan languages are spoken on the island of New Guinea (which is divided between the country of Papua New Guinea and Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Irian Jaya), with a number spoken in the Bismarck Archipelago, Bougainville Island, and the Solomon Islands to the east, and in Halmahera, Timor, and the Alor archipelago to the west. One Papuan language, Meriam Mir, is spoken within the national borders of Australia, in the eastern Torres Strait. The only Papuan languages with official recognition are those of East Timor.\nNew Guinea is perhaps the most linguistically diverse region in the world. Besides the Austronesian languages, there are some 800 languages divided into perhaps sixty small language families, with unclear relationships to each other or to anything else, plus a large number of language isolates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":45},{"uri":"Austronesian_languages","surface_form":"Austronesian","offset":96},{"uri":"Australian_Aboriginal_languages","surface_form":"Australian","offset":113},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":290},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":342},{"uri":"Papua_(Indonesian_province)","surface_form":"Papua","offset":387},{"uri":"West_Irian_Jaya","surface_form":"West Irian Jaya","offset":397},{"uri":"Bismarck_Archipelago","surface_form":"Bismarck Archipelago","offset":443},{"uri":"Bougainville_Island","surface_form":"Bougainville Island","offset":465},{"uri":"Solomon_Islands","surface_form":"Solomon Islands","offset":494},{"uri":"Halmahera","surface_form":"Halmahera","offset":530},{"uri":"Timor","surface_form":"Timor","offset":541},{"uri":"Alor","surface_form":"Alor","offset":556},{"uri":"Meriam_Mir_language","surface_form":"Meriam Mir","offset":607},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":660},{"uri":"Torres_Strait","surface_form":"Torres Strait","offset":686},{"uri":"East_Timor","surface_form":"East Timor","offset":766},{"uri":"Language_isolate","surface_form":"language isolate","offset":1055}]}
