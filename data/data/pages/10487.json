{"id":10487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas","text":"The Bahamas (officially called Commonwealth of The Bahamas) is a group of islands in the West Indies. The country's capital, Nassau, is on New Providence Island.\nThe Taino were the first people living there. In 1492, Christopher Columbus found the Americas by landing on another of the islands, San Salvador. The Eleutheran Adventurers soon came along, making a home in Eleuthera.\nThe islands' mostly black population speaks English, the country's main language.\nThe Bahamas are a popular place for people to visit for holidays, the 700 islands and cays attract many visitors from nearby America, as well as Europe and other countries.\nHistory.\nLucayanss were the first people to arrive in the Bahamas. They moved into the southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century AD, having come there from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan. About 30,000 Lucayan lived the Bahamas when Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Columbus' first landfall in the New World was on an island named San Salvador, which some scholars believe to be present-day San Salvador Island.\nThe Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to move to Hispaniola. They were used for forced labour. This and the exposure to foreign diseases led to most of the population of the Bahamas dying. Smallpox alone wiped out half of the population in what is now the Bahamas.\nIn 1670, King Charles II rented out the islands to the Carolinas, along with rights of trading, tax, and governing the country. During this time, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard. To restore proper government, Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718. The first governor was Woodes Rogers.\nAfter the American War of Independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists and their slaves in the Bahamas from New York, Florida, and the Carolinas. The first group of loyalists left St. Augustine in East Florida in September 1783. These Loyalists established plantations on several islands. British Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.\nOn 10 July 1973 The Bahamas gains full independence within British Commonwealth.\nPeople.\nNearly 500,000 people live in the Bahamas. The ethnic groups of the population is: 82% African descent 15% European & Mixed descent 3% Asian and other.\nLanguages.\nThe official language of the Bahamas is English, but they also speak a local dialect called Bahamianese. The Bahamian dialect is based based on the West Country England accents along with South Hiberno English dialects with strong influences from West African languages.\nGeography and climate.\nIn 1864 the Governor of the Bahamas reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.\nThe closest island to the United States is Bimini. The southeasternmost island is Inagua. The largest island is Andros Island. Nassau, capital city of The Bahamas, is on the island of New Providence.\nAll the islands are low and flat. The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia on Cat Island. It is high.\nClimate.\nThe climate of The Bahamas is subtropical to tropical. The Gulf Stream can be very dangerous in the summer and autumn. This is when hurricanes pass near or through the islands. Hurricane Andrew hit the northern islands during the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Floyd hit most of the islands during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season.\nThere has never been a freeze reported in The Bahamas. The temperature can fall as low as.\nDistricts.\nThe Bahamas are divided into 32 districts and the town of New Providence.\nMilitary.\nThe Bahamas does not have an army or an air force. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF) is the navy. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 2 aircraft and over 850 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"group of islands","offset":65},{"uri":"Nassau%2C_Bahamas","surface_form":"Nassau","offset":125},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":217},{"uri":"San_Salvador_Island","surface_form":"San Salvador","offset":295},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":425},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":588},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":608},{"uri":"Lucayans","surface_form":"Lucayans","offset":645},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":745},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":760},{"uri":"Lucayan_people","surface_form":"Lucayan","offset":860},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":913},{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":983},{"uri":"San_Salvador_Island","surface_form":"San Salvador Island","offset":1076},{"uri":"Forced_labour","surface_form":"forced labour","offset":1189},{"uri":"Infectious_disease","surface_form":"diseases","offset":1237},{"uri":"Smallpox","surface_form":"Smallpox","offset":1298},{"uri":"Charles_II_of_England","surface_form":"King Charles II","offset":1383},{"uri":"Carolinas","surface_form":"Carolinas","offset":1429},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"governing","offset":1479},{"uri":"Piracy","surface_form":"pirates","offset":1551},{"uri":"Blackbeard","surface_form":"Blackbeard","offset":1583},{"uri":"British_overseas_territories","surface_form":"crown colony","offset":1652},{"uri":"Woodes_Rogers","surface_form":"Woodes Rogers","offset":1697},{"uri":"American_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"American War of Independence","offset":1722},{"uri":"Loyalist_(American_Revolution)","surface_form":"Loyalists","offset":1785},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":1805},{"uri":"St._Augustine%2C_Florida","surface_form":"St. Augustine","offset":1904},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":1981},{"uri":"British_America","surface_form":"British America","offset":2013},{"uri":"10_July","surface_form":"10 July","offset":2165},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":2173},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":2201},{"uri":"British_Commonwealth","surface_form":"British Commonwealth","offset":2221},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":2338},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2358},{"uri":"Asian","surface_form":"Asian","offset":2386},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":2454},{"uri":"Bahamian_Creole","surface_form":"Bahamianese","offset":2506},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":2661},{"uri":"Bimini","surface_form":"Bimini","offset":2865},{"uri":"Inagua","surface_form":"Inagua","offset":2904},{"uri":"Andros_Island","surface_form":"Andros Island","offset":2934},{"uri":"Nassau%2C_Bahamas","surface_form":"Nassau","offset":2949},{"uri":"New_Providence","surface_form":"New Providence","offset":3006},{"uri":"Mount_Alvernia","surface_form":"Mount Alvernia","offset":3092},{"uri":"Cat_Island%2C_Bahamas","surface_form":"Cat Island","offset":3110},{"uri":"Gulf_Stream","surface_form":"Gulf Stream","offset":3202},{"uri":"Hurricane_Andrew","surface_form":"Hurricane Andrew","offset":3320},{"uri":"1992_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1992 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":3373},{"uri":"Hurricane_Floyd","surface_form":"Hurricane Floyd","offset":3405},{"uri":"New_Providence","surface_form":"New Providence","offset":3648}]}
