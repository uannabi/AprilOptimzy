{"id":10489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu","text":"Vanuatu is a country in the Pacific Ocean. The official languages of Vanuatu are Bislama, English and French. Vanuatu has a population of about 202,609 people (2004). The capital of Vanuatu is Port Vila. The country was ruled as a colony by England and France until it got its freedom in 1980. During the colonial time, it was named the \"New Hebrides\" or \"Nouvelles Hebrides\".\nGeography.\nVanuatu is an island archipelago. It has about 82 small islands. The islands were made from Volcanos. 65 of the islands are inhabited. There is about north to south distance between the outermost islands. Two of the islands (Matthew and Hunter) are also claimed by France. Fourteen of Vanuatu's islands have surface areas of more than.\nThe highest point in Vanuatu is Mount Tabwemasana, at, on the island of Espiritu Santo.\nFlora and fauna.\nEven though it has tropical forests, Vanuatu has a small number of plant and animal species. There are no large mammals. The 19 species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The Fiji Banded Iguana (\"Brachylophus fasciatus\") was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s. There are 11 species of bats and 61 species of land and water birds.\nThe region is rich in sea life. There are more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs. Coneshell and stonefish carry poison that will kill humans. The giant East African land snail arrived only in the 1970s but already has spread from the Port-Vila region to Luganville.\nThere are three or possibly four adult saltwater crocodiles living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population. It is said the crocodiles reach the northern part of the islands after cyclones. This is because of the island chain's closeness to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where crocodiles are very common.\nCuisine.\nThe national dish of Vanuatu is the lap lap.\nLocations.\nThere are six provinces in Vanuatu. They are Malampa, Penama, Sanma, Shefa, Tafea and Torba.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":28},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":56},{"uri":"Bislama","surface_form":"Bislama","offset":81},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":90},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":102},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":124},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":171},{"uri":"Port_Vila","surface_form":"Port Vila","offset":193},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":231},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":241},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":253},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"freedom","offset":277},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":409},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"Volcano","offset":480},{"uri":"Matthew_and_Hunter_Islands","surface_form":"Matthew and Hunter","offset":613},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":653},{"uri":"Mount_Tabwemasana","surface_form":"Mount Tabwemasana","offset":756},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":913},{"uri":"Ramphotyphlops_braminus","surface_form":"flowerpot snake","offset":996},{"uri":"Fiji_Banded_Iguana","surface_form":"Fiji Banded Iguana","offset":1038},{"uri":"Feral","surface_form":"feral","offset":1104},{"uri":"Molluscs","surface_form":"molluscs","offset":1276},{"uri":"Saltwater_crocodile","surface_form":"saltwater crocodile","offset":1509},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":1550},{"uri":"Cyclone","surface_form":"cyclone","offset":1667},{"uri":"Solomon_Islands","surface_form":"Solomon Islands","offset":1732},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":1752},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":1877},{"uri":"Malampa","surface_form":"Malampa","offset":1908},{"uri":"Penama","surface_form":"Penama","offset":1917},{"uri":"Sanma","surface_form":"Sanma","offset":1925},{"uri":"Shefa","surface_form":"Shefa","offset":1932},{"uri":"Tafea","surface_form":"Tafea","offset":1939},{"uri":"Torba","surface_form":"Torba","offset":1949}]}
