{"id":105081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa","text":"The moa were large flightless birds. They lived only in New Zealand, and are now all extinct.\nThere were nine species (in six genera) of Moa. The largest and best known were the genus \"Dinornis\", which grew up to 3.6 meters (12\u00A0feet) tall, and weighed as much as 230 kilograms (510 pounds).\nThe group of birds to which the moa belong had been in existence since the Cretaceous period. The M\u0101ori people arrived in New Zealand from Oceania about a thousand years ago. Then, moas lived in large numbers, especially on South Island. Archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago. The moas had survived being hunted by Haast's eagle. However, they could not survive being hunted for food by the Maoris.\nRecent extinctions (also mostly birds) have been caused by habitat change and introduced species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flightless_birds","surface_form":"flightless birds","offset":19},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":56},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":85},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":110},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":126},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":178},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":366},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori people","offset":389},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":430},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"Archaeological","offset":529},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":621},{"uri":"Haast%27s_eagle","surface_form":"Haast's eagle","offset":697},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":840},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":870}]}
