They are commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere, but may be found in wetlands elsewhere. These plants are known in British English as bulrush, bullrush or reedmace, and in American English as cattail or punks.\nUses by humans.\nCattails were once used to make paper. Cattail paper is very heavy and coarse, and is rarely used today. Cattail has also been used as a water filter to remove the poisonous chemical arsenic from drinking water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":13},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"wetland","offset":48},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":56},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":97},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":184},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":241},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":478}]}
