{"id":105185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square","text":"Red Square (,) is the most famous city square in Moscow, Russia. The square separates the Kremlin, the former royal citadel and currently the official residence of the President of Russia, from a historic merchant quarter known as Kitay-gorod (China-Town). As major streets of Moscow radiate from here in all directions, being promoted to major highways outside the city, the Red Square is often considered the central square of Moscow and of all Russia.\nRed Square and the Kremlin are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nJoseph Stalin's body was preserved near Red Square, in Lenin's mausoleum. It was later moved and reburied deep behind the Kremlin Wall without any ceremony.\nRed Square is a popular tourist attraction in Russia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City_square","surface_form":"city square","offset":34},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":49},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":57},{"uri":"Kremlin","surface_form":"Kremlin","offset":90},{"uri":"Moscow_Kremlin","surface_form":"Kremlin","offset":474},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":488},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":495},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":516},{"uri":"Mausoleum","surface_form":"mausoleum","offset":579},{"uri":"Kremlin_Wall","surface_form":"Kremlin Wall","offset":638},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":697}]}
