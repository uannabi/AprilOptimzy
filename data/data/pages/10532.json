The head of the country is Va'aletoa Sualauvi II.\nThe languages spoken in Samoa include Samoan and English.\nThe sport that is most popular in Samoa is Rugby, and many Samoan people play Rugby.\nSamoa was admitted to the United Nations on 18 September 1962.\nA measles outbreak began in October 2019 and continued through December. As of December 28, there were 81 deaths out of 5667 cases.\nDistricts.\nSamoa has eleven political districts. These are called \"it\u016Bm\u0101l\u014D\".

The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters of Samoa's people\nThe two large islands of Upolu and Savai'i are 99% of the total land area. There are eight small islets. These are the three islets in the Apolima Strait: Manono Island, Apolima and Nu'ulopa. There are four Aleipata Islands off the eastern end of Upolu. They are: Nu'utele, Nu'ulua, Namua, and Fanuatapu. And there is Nu'usafe'e.\nEast of Samoa is a group of islands called American Samoa. They are part of the United States, but they are similar to the country Samoa, because they also speak Samoan.\nSamoa used to be east of the international date line. In 2011, the line changed, so that Samoa would be to the west of the date line. This change took effect on the night of 29 December.

For males, it is called the Pe'a, It is intricate and geometrical patterns tattooed on areas from the knees up towards the ribs. A male who has such a tatau is called a soga'imiti.
