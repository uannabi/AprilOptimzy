{"id":105528,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gili_Trawangan","text":"Gili Trawangan is the largest of Lombok's Gili Islands. It is the only one to rise notably above sea level. It is long and wide. The island has a population of about 1000 people. Of the Gilis, Trawangan has the most tourist facilities. The pub T\u00EEr na N\u00F4g says that Trawangan is the smallest island in the world with an Irish pub. The most crowded part of Trawangan is on the eastern side.\nOn Gili Trawangan (as well as the other two Gilis), there are no motorized vehicles. The main means of transportation are bicycles (rented by the people who live on the island to tourists) and cidomo (a small horse pulled carriage). For traveling to and from each of the Gilis, motorized boats and speedboats are used.\nSome of the first people to live on Gili Trawangan were from Sulawesi. They were fishermen and farmers. Before they came to Gili Trawangan, the island was covered in forest and deer lived there.\nThe economy of Gili Trawangan centres on tourism. The island is too small to support large amounts of agriculture. It is also too far away from other places to be useful for either industry or commerce.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lombok","surface_form":"Lombok","offset":33},{"uri":"Gili_Islands","surface_form":"Gili Islands","offset":42},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":97},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":146},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist facilities","offset":216},{"uri":"Pub","surface_form":"pub","offset":240},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":319},{"uri":"Motor","surface_form":"motor","offset":454},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":464},{"uri":"Transportation","surface_form":"transportation","offset":492},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":511},{"uri":"Renting","surface_form":"rented","offset":521},{"uri":"Cidomo","surface_form":"cidomo","offset":582},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":598},{"uri":"Carriage","surface_form":"carriage","offset":611},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":626},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":677},{"uri":"Speedboat","surface_form":"speedboat","offset":687},{"uri":"Sulawesi","surface_form":"Sulawesi","offset":769},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishermen","offset":789},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farmers","offset":803},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":874},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":885},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":907},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1005},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":1084},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commerce","offset":1096}]}
