Each island has several small resorts, usually consisting of a small collection of huts for tourists, and a restaurant. Most local inhabitants live in the hilly interior of the islands. Automobiles and motorized traffic are not allowed on the islands by local law. Bicycles or the horse-drawn carriages called a \"cidomo\" are common transportation on the islands. Scuba diving in and around the Gilis is also popular. The name \"Gili\" simply means \"small island\" in the local Sasak language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indonesian_language","surface_form":"Indonesian","offset":18},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":124},{"uri":"Gili_Trawangan","surface_form":"Gili Trawangan","offset":139},{"uri":"Gili_Meno","surface_form":"Gili Meno","offset":155},{"uri":"Gili_Air","surface_form":"Gili Air","offset":169},{"uri":"Lombok","surface_form":"Lombok","offset":217},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":225},{"uri":"Scuba_diving","surface_form":"Scuba diving","offset":659},{"uri":"Sasak_language","surface_form":"Sasak language","offset":770}]}
