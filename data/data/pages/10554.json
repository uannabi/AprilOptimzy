{"id":10554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_de_Villepin","text":"Dominique Marie Fran\u00E7ois Ren\u00E9 Galouzeau de Villepin (born November 14, 1953), simply known as Dominique de Villepin, was Premier (or Prime Minister) of France from 31 May 2005 to 17 May 2007. He was made Premier by Jacques Chirac after the French President removed Jean-Pierre Raffarin from the premiership. Raffarin failed to gain the support of the French people for the European Constitution.\nDominique de Villepin said that his government's most important task would be job creation. He knew that the French people were concerned about the condition of the French economy. This was one of the reasons they had voted against the European Constitution in the referendum on 29 May 2005.\nOn 15 May 2007, the last full day of President Jacques Chirac's term, Villepin gave his resignation from the office of Prime Minister and it was accepted by the President. He was replaced two days later by Fran\u00E7ois Fillon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":133},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":152},{"uri":"Jacques_Chirac","surface_form":"Jacques Chirac","offset":215},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":247},{"uri":"Jean-Pierre_Raffarin","surface_form":"Jean-Pierre Raffarin","offset":265},{"uri":"European_Constitution","surface_form":"European Constitution","offset":373},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":568},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":661},{"uri":"Jacques_Chirac","surface_form":"Jacques Chirac","offset":735},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Fillon","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Fillon","offset":894}]}
