{"id":105549,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padangbai","text":"Padangbai is a small town in eastern Bali, Indonesia. It serves as a ferry port for travel to Lombok, The Gilis and other of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is also a lovely beach town that is popular with those who prefer a small town atmosphere over the large scale beach party that is Kuta.\nBesides the beach near the ferry terminal there is a beach just to the north known locally as the \"Blue Lagoon\" and the especially nice \"Secret Beach\" just to the south of town. These pleasant beaches have clusters of small family owned warungs that will be glad to prepare a meal and serve beer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bali","surface_form":"Bali","offset":37},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":43},{"uri":"Lombok","surface_form":"Lombok","offset":94},{"uri":"Gili_Islands","surface_form":"The Gilis","offset":102},{"uri":"Lesser_Sunda_Islands","surface_form":"Lesser Sunda Islands","offset":129},{"uri":"Kuta","surface_form":"Kuta","offset":285},{"uri":"Warung","surface_form":"warung","offset":528}]}
