It was started on 2 March 1988 by joining the Liberal Party, which had been a powerful political party in Britain in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Social Democratic Party, which had been formed from the Labour Party in 1981. The two parties had already been working together for seven years.\nThe Liberal Democrats are strong supporters of the European Union, as well as environmentalism and they are in favour of creating a new British House of Commons which is elected using proportional representation.\nThe party has 18 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons, 105 out of 793 seats in the House of Lords, 16 out of 73 British seats in the European Parliament, 5 out of 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament and 1 out of 60 seats in the Welsh Assembly. The party was in a coalition government with the Conservative Party and the former party leader Nick Clegg was the Deputy Prime Minister until the May 2015 general election.\nFormer party leaders.\nAsterisk (*) means that this person was an interim leader, meaning he was just standing in as leader because the previous leader resigned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["political party"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Centre_(politics)","surface_form":"centrist","offset":57},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":66},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":89},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberal","offset":118},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Liberal Party","offset":182},{"uri":"Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Social Democratic Party","offset":296},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":352},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":492},{"uri":"Environmentalism","surface_form":"environmentalism","offset":519},{"uri":"Proportional_representation","surface_form":"proportional representation","offset":625},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":695},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":741},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":791},{"uri":"Scottish_Parliament","surface_form":"Scottish Parliament","offset":838},{"uri":"National_Assembly_for_Wales","surface_form":"Welsh Assembly","offset":887},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":922},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative Party","offset":952},{"uri":"Nick_Clegg","surface_form":"Nick Clegg","offset":999}]}
