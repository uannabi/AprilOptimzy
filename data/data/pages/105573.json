The population of the town in 2007 was about 45,000.\nHouten lies on the railway line from Utrecht to Tiel and 's Hertogenbosch. In 2004, the railway line needed fixing, but the old station building was in the way. What was done is pretty unique: the old station building was lifted off its foundations, and moved a few hundred metres to new foundations.\nMany people living in Houten have jobs in Utrecht. According to plans of the government, the city should grow to about 50.000 people by 2010.\nPeople have lived in the area since Roman times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Utrecht_(province)","surface_form":"Utrecht","offset":22},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":46},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":63},{"uri":"Tiel","surface_form":"Tiel","offset":160},{"uri":"%27s_Hertogenbosch","surface_form":"'s Hertogenbosch","offset":169}]}
