{"id":105624,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_crossing","text":"e=\"preserve\">A level crossing (also called a grade crossing, a railway crossing, or a railroad crossing) is a place where a railway line and a road meet each other on the same level. This means that the grades (the road and the track) are not separated by using a bridge or a tunnel. Usually, there are signs indicating the crossing. There may also be barriers/gates that go down before a train passes.\nSince level crossings are dangerous (there are many accidents), they are usually grade separated once there is more traffic, or high speed trains.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":124},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":143},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":264},{"uri":"Tunnel","surface_form":"tunnel","offset":276},{"uri":"Grade_separation","surface_form":"grade separated","offset":484},{"uri":"High-speed_rail","surface_form":"high speed trains","offset":531}]}
