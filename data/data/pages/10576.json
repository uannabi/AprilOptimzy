{"id":10576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","text":"The term House of Commons is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is made up of Members of Parliament elected by the people. Sometimes it is called the 'lower house'. (The 'upper house' is called the House of Lords.) Other countries also have a bicameral parliament with a House of Commons working in the same way.\nIn the British parliament, there are 650 Members of Parliament or MPs. Each MP represents a constituency, which covers an area of the country. The people of each constituency vote at a general election or a by-election to choose one person to represent them in the House of Commons. Usually, the people choose someone who belongs to a political party. When all the parties get together, the party or coalition with the most members is the government and runs the country. The leader of that party is called the Prime Minister.\nThe House of Commons hold their meetings in the Palace of Westminster. Their chief officer is the Speaker of the House who elected by MPs. The current Speaker is Lindsay Hoyle, who was elected in 2019. The Clerk of the House of Commons is the Principal Adviser to the Speaker. The Serjeant-at-Arms is in charge of the security.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lower_house","surface_form":"lower house","offset":33},{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Parliament of the United Kingdom","offset":52},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Members of Parliament","offset":103},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":125},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":223},{"uri":"Bicameral","surface_form":"bicameral","offset":268},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"MPs","offset":404},{"uri":"Constituency","surface_form":"constituency","offset":430},{"uri":"General_election","surface_form":"general election","offset":523},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":545},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":673},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":738},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":777},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":849},{"uri":"Palace_of_Westminster","surface_form":"Palace of Westminster","offset":913},{"uri":"Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)","surface_form":"Speaker of the House","offset":963},{"uri":"Lindsay_Hoyle","surface_form":"Lindsay Hoyle","offset":1027}]}
