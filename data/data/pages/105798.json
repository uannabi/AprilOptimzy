It is called \"transistor\u2013transistor logic\" because the logic function (e.g., AND) and amplification is performed by transistors. Many integrated circuits have TTL technology. They are used in applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, synthesizers, etc.\nTTL gates define a voltage below 0.5V as \"0\", and a voltage of 4\u20135V as \"1\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":48},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":76},{"uri":"Resistor","surface_form":"resistor","offset":92},{"uri":"Logic_gate","surface_form":"logic function","offset":158},{"uri":"Logical_conjunction","surface_form":"AND","offset":180},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":237},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":316},{"uri":"Synthesizer","surface_form":"synthesizer","offset":384},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":422}]}
