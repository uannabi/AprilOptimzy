The term \"Algonquin\" comes from the Maliseet word \"elak\u00F3mkwik\" (), \"they are our relatives/allies\". Many Algonquian languages are extremely endangered today, while a number of others have already died out completely.\nSpeakers of Algonquian languages stretch from the east coast of North America all the way to the Rocky Mountains. The language from which all of the languages of the family come was spoken at least 3,000 years ago.\nThe Algonquian languages are 'poly-synthetic', which means that you can make entire sentences in one word.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_American_languages","surface_form":"Native American languages","offset":73},{"uri":"Algic_languages","surface_form":"Algic","offset":142},{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"language family","offset":148},{"uri":"Maliseet","surface_form":"Maliseet","offset":201},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":446},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":479}]}
