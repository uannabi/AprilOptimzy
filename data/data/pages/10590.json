Vishnu is one of the three main gods in Hinduism and the Absolute Supreme being in Vaishnava tradition. Vishnu is one of the Trimurtis in Hinduism. Vishnu is the preserver god, which means he protects the universe from being destroyed and keeps it going, according to this religion, and he has come to earth in nine forms (called avatars) so far, with one yet to come at the end of Kali Yuga to destroy evil. His most famous incarnations are Rama, Krishna, and Narasimha. Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune.\nLord Vishnu is usually shown with light blue skin and four arms. The Lord holds a lotus (Padma), the Indestructible Mace Of Lord Vishnu (Kaumodaki), a conch (Shankha) and the Unstoppable Disc Of Lord Vishnu (Sudarshan Chakra) in each of his four hands.
