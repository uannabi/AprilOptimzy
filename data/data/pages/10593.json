{"id":10593,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering","text":"e=\"preserve\">Money laundering is something some criminals do to hide the money they make from crimes. Criminals do money laundering to make it hard for the police to find out where the criminal got the money.\nOne way criminals launder money is by using the money earned from illegal activities to buy things (like gold and silver, shares or casino chips, other legitimate business activities like food or liquor stores) and then selling those items to get the money back. If a criminal buys and sells things many times it is hard for the police to find out where the criminal got the money.\nMoney laundering in Canada.\nIn Canada money laundering is a serious issue. The government of Canada has allocated more than $70 million to fight money laundering.\nThe province of British Columbia announced it is holding a public inquiry into this issue.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"criminal","offset":48},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":73},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":156},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":314},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":323},{"uri":"Shares","surface_form":"shares","offset":331},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":622},{"uri":"Government_of_Canada","surface_form":"government of Canada","offset":670},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":770},{"uri":"Public_inquiry","surface_form":"public inquiry","offset":813}]}
