{"id":105942,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Football_League","text":"The Arena Football League (or AFL) is a defunct American football league in the United States that ran from 1987 to 2008, and 2010 to 2019. After it ended the first time, another league like it started in 2010, called Arena Football 1. Some, but not all, of the AFL teams joined Arena Football 1. The league later changed its name to the Arena Football League. There were 6 teams in 2019 when the league folded due to bankruptcy.\nUnlike what people in this league call the outdoor league (the NFL), \"Arena football\" is played in an smaller arena. Arena Football is played with only 8 players on a team, not 11 like the NFL.\nTimeline.\nThe Arena Football League has had many teams join and leave the league. Every year, there has been at least one team which did not play with the same name as the year before.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":48},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":80},{"uri":"Bankruptcy","surface_form":"bankruptcy","offset":418},{"uri":"NFL","surface_form":"NFL","offset":493},{"uri":"Small","surface_form":"small","offset":532},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":540}]}
