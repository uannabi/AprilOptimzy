{"id":105964,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmo","text":"Elmo is a fictional character from the TV show \"Sesame Street\". He is a red monster, and has his own part of the show called \"Elmo's World\". His age is three and a half years old. He is very famous for his laugh. His best friend is an orange monster named Zo\u00EB.\nElmo was originally a nameless extra performed by various puppeteers with no established identity. After that, he became a recurring character on the show. Brian Muehl was the first main performer and gave him a whispery voice. Richard Hunt performed him next and gave him a gruff voice. However, Kevin Clash was given the muppet in 1984 and used a new voice for him. This voice was made using falsetto. The muppet then became very popular. Elmo always talks in third person: for example, Elmo says \"Elmo knows where you live!\" rather than \"I know where you live!\" Elmo has a pet fish named Dorothy. He plays the toy piano and likes to ride his tricycle. Elmo is very popular with younger children.\nIn the 1990s, an Elmo toy called \"Tickle Me Elmo\" was sold. In a short time, it became one of the most popular \"Sesame Street\" toys in stores.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":10},{"uri":"Sesame_Street","surface_form":"Sesame Street","offset":48},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":72},{"uri":"Zo%C3%AB_(Sesame_Street)","surface_form":"Zo\u00EB","offset":256},{"uri":"Kevin_Clash","surface_form":"Kevin Clash","offset":558},{"uri":"Falsetto","surface_form":"falsetto","offset":655},{"uri":"Grammatical_person","surface_form":"third person","offset":723},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":878},{"uri":"Tricycle","surface_form":"tricycle","offset":906}]}
