{"id":106015,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","text":"The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team in Kansas City, Missouri. The team is a part of the Western Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). Their starting quarterback is Patrick Mahomes.\nOriginally called the Dallas Texans, the club was founded by Lamar Hunt in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League. The team moved to Kansas City and became the Chiefs in 1963 after then-Kansas City mayor H. Roe Bartle promised the team they would have more ticket sales. The Chiefs then joined the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL Merger. The Chiefs hold the distinction of being the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to beat an NFL club in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game when they beat the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV.\nThe Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV by defeating the San Francisco 49ers 31-20. This was the team\u2019s first Super Bowl win since 1969.\nThe term \"chief\" is sometimes considered to be insulting to Native Americans. There has been no serious effort to change the team's nickname. They have used an arrowhead as their symbol for a long time. They also named their home field Arrowhead Stadium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":42},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City, Missouri","offset":68},{"uri":"AFC_West","surface_form":"Western Division","offset":117},{"uri":"American_Football_Conference","surface_form":"American Football Conference","offset":141},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":183},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":230},{"uri":"Patrick_Mahomes","surface_form":"Patrick Mahomes","offset":245},{"uri":"Lamar_Hunt","surface_form":"Lamar Hunt","offset":323},{"uri":"American_Football_League","surface_form":"American Football League","offset":369},{"uri":"H._Roe_Bartle","surface_form":"H.
