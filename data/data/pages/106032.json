{"id":106032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvedon","text":"Kelvedon is a village and town in Essex, England.\nOrigins.\nThere has been a settlement on the bend of the River Blackwater for thousands of years. Archeologists have found evidence that shows the settlement was a Celtic trading port. The Romans started a settlement here called \"Canonium\".\nThe present village of Kelvedon has been lived in since the early Middle Ages. The building of the Norwich - London railway, made Kelvedon a good place to live, but with easy and quick access to London. The village was built along one road, High Street. From the 1930's the village began to spread for miles along the street which was part of the A12. In the 1960's a bypass was built to go around the village. In the 1980's a large housing development called \"Riverside Park\" added hundreds of houses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":14},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":26},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":34},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":41},{"uri":"Roman_Britain","surface_form":"Romans","offset":238},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":356},{"uri":"Norwich","surface_form":"Norwich","offset":389},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":399},{"uri":"Bypass","surface_form":"bypass","offset":658}]}
