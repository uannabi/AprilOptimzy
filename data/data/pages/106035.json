{"id":106035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Football_Team","text":"The Washington Football Team are a professional American football team based in the Washington, D.C. area. The team plays at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The team's head office and training area are at Redskin Park in Ashburn, Virginia. They are part of the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL).\nThe team began in Boston. They were first named for the Boston Braves baseball team. They were soon renamed the \"Redskins\". They kept that nickname after moving to Washington. Some consider it offensive to name a team after a race or ethnic group, resulting in protests and legal challenges, but the team owners have refused to think about changing the name.\nOn June 18, 2014, the United States Patent Office decided that they were going to cancel the Redskins trademarks and called the name \"disparaging to Native Americans\".\nIn 2020, the team announced that there would be a review of the name. On July 13, 2020, the team plans to officially retire the \"Redskins\" name, although they have not chosen a new team name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":48},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":84},{"uri":"FedExField","surface_form":"FedExField","offset":125},{"uri":"Landover%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Landover","offset":139},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":149},{"uri":"Ashburn%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Ashburn","offset":223},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":232},{"uri":"NFC_East","surface_form":"Eastern Division","offset":263},{"uri":"National_Football_Conference","surface_form":"National Football Conference","offset":287},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":329},{"uri":"Atlanta_Braves","surface_form":"Boston Braves","offset":417},{"uri":"United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","surface_form":"United States Patent Office","offset":742},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":869}]}
