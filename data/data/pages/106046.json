{"id":106046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacled_bear","text":"The spectacled bear (\"Tremarctos ornatus\"), also known as the Andean bear is the last of the lineage of short-faced bears. Locally, it is also called \"ukuku\", \"jukumari\" or \"ukumari\". The other short-faced bears are now extinct. They lived during middle to late Pleistocene age.\nThe spectacled bear is a relatively small species of bear native to South America. It has black fur with a distinctive beige-coloured marking across its face and upper chest. Males are 33% larger than females. Males can weigh 130 \u2013 200 kilograms (286 \u2013 440 lb), and females 35 \u2013 60 kilograms (77 \u2013 132\u00A0lb). They are found in several areas of northern and western South America, including western Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia, northwestern Argentina, and eastern Panama. Spectacled bears are the only surviving types of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae. Their survival has depended mostly on their ability to climb even the highest trees of the Andes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Short-faced_bear","surface_form":"short-faced bear","offset":104},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":220},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":262},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"bear","offset":332},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":347},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilogram","offset":515},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"lb","offset":536},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":675},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":686},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":696},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":705},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":719},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":741},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":764},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":1003}]}
