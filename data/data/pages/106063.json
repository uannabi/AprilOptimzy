{"id":106063,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariq_Ramadan","text":"Tariq Said Ramadan (born 26 September 1962 in Geneva, Switzerland) is a Swiss Muslim academic and theologian. He thinks Islamic texts should be studied. He also thinks that Islamic society today is different from what it was when the Koran was written. He therefore says that Muslims living in Europe need to adapt and change Islam, so they can contribute its values to a European society.\nThis position is often referred to as Euroislam.\nIn November 2017, multiple women accused Ramadan of rape. On 31 January 2018, Ramadan was taken into custody by French police. After two days of questioning, he was formally charged with two counts of rape and ordered to remain in custody.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geneva_City","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":46},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":54},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":78},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":85},{"uri":"Theologian","surface_form":"theologian","offset":98},{"uri":"Koran","surface_form":"Koran","offset":234},{"uri":"Euroislam","surface_form":"Euroislam","offset":428},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":491}]}
