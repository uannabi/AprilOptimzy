{"id":106156,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hemisphere","text":"The water hemisphere is the hemisphere on the Earth with the highest area of water. It is centered on, near New Zealand. The other half of the Earth is the land hemisphere.\nNot including Antartica, the water hemisphere has only one-eighth of the world's land. Australia, New Zealand, a small part of Southeast Asia and the southern part of South America are in the water hemisphere.\nAntarctica is included in the hemisphere, and most of it is certainly land. If it were included in the total land area of Earth, the water hemisphere would have one-fifth of the world's land. Most of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are on the water hemisphere. The area of the oceans of the water hemisphere is much higher than its land area, but the area of the oceans of the land hemisphere is still higher than its land area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hemisphere","surface_form":"hemisphere","offset":28},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":46},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":108},{"uri":"Land_hemisphere","surface_form":"land hemisphere","offset":156},{"uri":"Antartica","surface_form":"Antartica","offset":187},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":260},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":271},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":300},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":340},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":383},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":587},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":609},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":655},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":667},{"uri":"Land_hemisphere","surface_form":"land hemisphere","offset":767}]}
