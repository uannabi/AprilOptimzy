During that day the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States were selected. Barack Obama from the Democratic Party defeated John McCain to win the presidency, and is the first African-American president. He was sworn in as President on January 20, 2009. In a United States presidential election, a person must get 270 electoral votes to win.\nDemocratic Primaries.\nThe candidates running for the nomination of the Democratic Party were Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Joe Biden, Dennis Kucinich, Mike Gravel, Chris Dodd, and Bill Richardson.\nThe main contest during the Democratic primaries was between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, which was a very close race. Clinton won the popular vote, but ultimately Obama won more unpledged delegates and therefore the nomination.\nAll candidates except Mike Gravel, who switched to the Libertarian Party during the election, supported Barack Obama.\nBarack Obama chose Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate on August 23, 2008.\nRepublican Primaries.\nThe candidates running for the nomination of the Republican Party were John McCain, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Tom Tancredo, Alan Keyes, Jim Gilmore, Sam Brownback, and Duncan Hunter.\nRepublican President George W. Bush was unable to run for re-election since a president is only able to be elected twice. Vice president Dick Cheney chose not to run.\nMost of the candidates withdrew early. As a result, John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Mitt Romney emerged as the three people most likely to win the nomination. Ron Paul became popular among libertarians.\nJohn McCain was nominated by the Republican Party (by a decisive victory).\nHe chose Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential candidate.\nThe Campaign.\nThe biggest issue during the campaign was the bad economy. Other issues included health care, the Iraq War, the war on terrorism, and energy independence.\nThe president during the election, George W. Bush (who eventually supported John McCain), was very unpopular due to the 2007-09 \"great recession\", and because of that, the Obama campaign compared McCain to Bush several times.\nThere were four television debates during the campaign: three of them were between the two presidential candidates, and one of them was between the two vice-presidential candidates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":51},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":125},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President of the United States","offset":160},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":211},{"uri":"United_States_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":233},{"uri":"John_McCain","surface_form":"John McCain","offset":259},{"uri":"African-American_people","surface_form":"African-American","offset":311},{"uri":"Inauguration","surface_form":"sworn in as President","offset":346},{"uri":"Electoral_college","surface_form":"electoral votes","offset":453},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":570},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton","surface_form":"Hillary Clinton","offset":584},{"uri":"John_Edwards","surface_form":"John Edwards","offset":601},{"uri":"Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Joe Biden","offset":615},{"uri":"Dennis_Kucinich","surface_form":"Dennis Kucinich","offset":626},{"uri":"Mike_Gravel","surface_form":"Mike Gravel","offset":643},{"uri":"Chris_Dodd","surface_form":"Chris Dodd","offset":656},{"uri":"Bill_Richardson","surface_form":"Bill Richardson","offset":672},{"uri":"Primary_election","surface_form":"primaries","offset":728},{"uri":"Libertarian_Party","surface_form":"Libertarian Party","offset":978},{"uri":"John_McCain","surface_form":"John McCain","offset":1218},{"uri":"Mitt_Romney","surface_form":"Mitt Romney","offset":1231},{"uri":"Mike_Huckabee","surface_form":"Mike Huckabee","offset":1244},{"uri":"Ron_Paul","surface_form":"Ron Paul","offset":1259},{"uri":"Rudy_Giuliani","surface_form":"Rudy Giuliani","offset":1269},{"uri":"Fred_Thompson","surface_form":"Fred Thompson","offset":1284},{"uri":"Alan_Keyes","surface_form":"Alan Keyes","offset":1313},{"uri":"Sam_Brownback","surface_form":"Sam Brownback","offset":1338},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
