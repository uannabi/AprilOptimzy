{"id":106767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match","text":"A match is a tool for making fire under controlled circumstances. Most often, it is a small piece of wood, or hardened paper. At one end, the match is coated with a material that will ignite from friction. The lighting end of a match is known as the match \"head\". It either contains phosphorus or phosphorus sesquisulfide as the active ingredient and gelatin as a binder. Matches are sold in multiples, packaged together either in a box, or in matchbooks. There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface; and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used.\nThere are also electric matches, which use electricity and not friction to produce a fire.\nEarly matches.\nMatches that used sulfur were mentioned by Martial in ancient Rome. He called them \"sulphurata\".\nAround the year 1530, Matches appeared in Europe. The first modern, self-igniting match was invented in 1805 by K. Chancel, assistant to Professor Louis Jacques Th\u00E9nard of Paris, though. The head of the match was made of a mixture of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar, and rubber. They were ignited by dipping the tip of the match in a small asbestos bottle filled with sulfuric acid. This kind of match was quite expensive and its usage was dangerous, so Chancel's matches never gained much popularity.\nSpecial-purpose matches.\nStorm matches, also known as lifeboat matches or flare matches, have an easy to strike tip like a normal match, but much of the stick is coated with a combustible compound which will keep burning even in a strong wind. They have a wax coating to make them waterproof. They are a component of many survival kits. This particular match was used in the first mass-produced Molotov cocktails.\n\"Bengal matches\" are actually small hand-held fireworks akin to sparklers. They are similar to storm matches in form, but they include compounds of strontium or barium in the compound on the stick to produce a red or green flame respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":13},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":29},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":101},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":119},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":196},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":283},{"uri":"Phosphorus_sesquisulfide","surface_form":"phosphorus sesquisulfide","offset":297},{"uri":"Gelatin","surface_form":"gelatin","offset":351},{"uri":"Box","surface_form":"box","offset":433},{"uri":"Matchbook","surface_form":"matchbook","offset":444},{"uri":"Electric_match","surface_form":"electric match","offset":671},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":699},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":780},{"uri":"Martial","surface_form":"Martial","offset":805},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Rome","offset":816},{"uri":"Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","surface_form":"Louis Jacques Th\u00E9nard","offset":1006},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1031},{"uri":"Potassium_chlorate","surface_form":"potassium chlorate","offset":1093},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":1113},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":1121},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":1132},{"uri":"Asbestos","surface_form":"asbestos","offset":1201},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":1229},{"uri":"Lifeboat_(shipboard)","surface_form":"lifeboat","offset":1417},{"uri":"Burning","surface_form":"combustible","offset":1539},{"uri":"Wax","surface_form":"wax","offset":1619},{"uri":"Survival_kit","surface_form":"survival kit","offset":1685},{"uri":"Molotov_cocktail","surface_form":"Molotov cocktail","offset":1758},{"uri":"Fireworks","surface_form":"fireworks","offset":1823},{"uri":"Sparkler","surface_form":"sparkler","offset":1841},{"uri":"Strontium","surface_form":"strontium","offset":1925},{"uri":"Barium","surface_form":"barium","offset":1938}]}
