{"id":106800,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater","text":"e=\"preserve\">Alma mater is the singular form of the Latin word for \"nourishing mother\". It was used in ancient Rome as a title for the mother goddess, and in Medieval Christianity for the Virgin Mary. In current days, it is most often used to refer to the university or college a person went to. However, it may also refer to the song or hymn of a college or university.\nThe term alma mater can be traced back to eleventh-century Europe. The first known use of the term in reference to university was in 1088. The University of Bologna coined their motto \u201CAlma Mater Studiorum,\u201D (translated: \u201Cnourishing mother of studies\u201D).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":52},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Rome","offset":103},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":142},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":158},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":167},{"uri":"Virgin_Mary","surface_form":"Virgin Mary","offset":188},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":212},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":256},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":270},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":280}]}
