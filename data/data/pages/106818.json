{"id":106818,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biberach_(district)","text":"Biberach ['bi:b\u0259rax] is a district in Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg, Germany. It is surrounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Ravensburg, Sigmaringen, Reutlingen and Alb-Donau, and the Bavarian districts Neu-Ulm, Unterallg\u00E4u and the district-free city Memmingen. The most important towns in the district of Biberach are Biberach (Ri\u00DF), Riedlingen, Ochsenhausen and Laupheim.\nGeography.\nThe district has hilly countryside between the rivers of the Danube and the Iller. The Danube crosses the district in its westernmost part from south to north. The Iller forms the eastern border of the district. Another river is the Ri\u00DF, an affluent of the Danube (the river Ri\u00DF goes into the Danube). It goes across the district from south to north.\nThe Federsee is a small lake in the southwest of the district. Its area is only 1.4 km\u00B2, but it is famous for Neolithic findings and birds that are not seen a lot.\nMedia.\nThe local newspaper is the \"Schw\u00E4bische Zeitung\" (\"Swabian Newspaper\"). The Biberach Independent Film Festival focusses on experimental shorts and documentaries. The festival starts at the end of October and runs into November.\nCoat of arms.\nThe imperial eagle symbolizes the imperial city of Biberach. At first, the coat of arms of the city showed an eagle as well as a beaver as a canting symbol. In 1488 the coat of arms of the city was changed to show only the beaver. The crosier symbolises the monasteries of the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg","offset":38},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":57},{"uri":"Ravensburg_(district)","surface_form":"Ravensburg","offset":134},{"uri":"Sigmaringen_(district)","surface_form":"Sigmaringen","offset":146},{"uri":"Reutlingen_(district)","surface_form":"Reutlingen","offset":159},{"uri":"Alb-Donau_(district)","surface_form":"Alb-Donau","offset":174},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":193},{"uri":"Neu-Ulm_(district)","surface_form":"Neu-Ulm","offset":212},{"uri":"Unterallg%C3%A4u","surface_form":"Unterallg\u00E4u","offset":221},{"uri":"Memmingen","surface_form":"Memmingen","offset":260},{"uri":"Biberach_(Ri%C3%9F)","surface_form":"Biberach (Ri\u00DF)","offset":328},{"uri":"Riedlingen","surface_form":"Riedlingen","offset":344},{"uri":"Ochsenhausen","surface_form":"Ochsenhausen","offset":356},{"uri":"Laupheim","surface_form":"Laupheim","offset":373},{"uri":"Danube","surface_form":"Danube","offset":455},{"uri":"Iller","surface_form":"Iller","offset":470},{"uri":"Ri%C3%9F","surface_form":"Ri\u00DF","offset":627},{"uri":"Federsee","surface_form":"Federsee","offset":749},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":855},{"uri":"Biberach_Independent_Film_Festival","surface_form":"Biberach Independent Film Festival","offset":992},{"uri":"Imperial_eagle","surface_form":"imperial eagle","offset":1162},{"uri":"Beaver","surface_form":"beaver","offset":1287}]}
