{"id":106873,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_(death)","text":"=\"preserve\">Hanging is caused when a person is held by a rope around the neck. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" says that hanging in this sense is \"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\". Hanging is often used as a form of execution or suicide.\nThe first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \"Odyssey\" (Book XXII). In this meaning of the common word \"hang\", the past and past participle is \"hanged\" instead of \"hung\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxford_English_Dictionary","surface_form":"Oxford English Dictionary","offset":84},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"execution","offset":239},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":252},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":316},{"uri":"Odyssey","surface_form":"Odyssey","offset":325}]}
