{"id":106913,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna","text":"The Congress of Vienna was a conference of ambassadors of the major powers of Europe.\nIt was held in Vienna from November 1, 1814, to June 8, 1815. The chairman was the Austrian statesman Klemens Wenzel von Metternich.\nIts purpose was to decide about the political situation in Europe after the defeat of Napoleon.\nTo be precise there was never \"one\" \"Congress of Vienna\". Instead, there were discussions in informal sessions among the Great Powers.\nThe Congress was concerned with determining the entire shape of Europe after the Napoleonic wars, with the exception of the terms of peace with France, which had already been decided by the Treaty of Paris, signed a few months earlier, on May 30, 1814.\nThe four victorious powers (the Concert of Europe) hoped to exclude the French from participation in the negotiations, but Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00E9rigord managed to get into \"her inner councils\" in the first weeks of negotiations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":78},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":101},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":169},{"uri":"Klemens_Wenzel_von_Metternich","surface_form":"Klemens Wenzel von Metternich","offset":188},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":305},{"uri":"Great_power","surface_form":"Great Powers","offset":436},{"uri":"Peace_of_Paris_(1814)","surface_form":"Treaty of Paris","offset":640},{"uri":"Concert_of_Europe","surface_form":"Concert of Europe","offset":735},{"uri":"Charles-Maurice_de_Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord","surface_form":"Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00E9rigord","offset":826}]}
