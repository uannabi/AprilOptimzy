{"id":106990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_(tool)","text":"A walker or walking frame is a tool for disabled people who need help to support and keep balance while walking. The rollator/walker is from Sweden. These are popular items in the mobility aid field.\nGenerally there are three or four wheel rollators. Most have some type of pouch or basket to carry items. Rollators are often used for long trips or when a person does not want to be slowed down by their mobility equipment. Rollators are often viewed as easier to use than a walker due to their ability to just be pushed instead of lifted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":31},{"uri":"Disabled","surface_form":"disabled","offset":40},{"uri":"Walking","surface_form":"walking","offset":104},{"uri":"Mobility_aid","surface_form":"mobility aid","offset":180}]}
