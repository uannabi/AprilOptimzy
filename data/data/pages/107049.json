{"id":107049,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)","text":"At the beginning of World War I in 1914, the German army started the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium. They gained military control of many important industrial regions in France. Their quick advance was stopped by the Battle of the Marne. Both sides then dug defensive trenches. The trenches eventually reached from the North Sea to the Swiss border with France. During the years between 1915 and 1917, many offensives were started from these trenches. Both sides used large numbers of artillery and thousands of infantry in these offensives. However, a combination of entrenchments, machine gun nests, barbed wire, and artillery stopped these advances. No major breakthroughs happened. New military technology, like poison gas, aircraft, and tanks were developed to try and get through these lines of trenches.\nThe deadlock is mostly due to both sides not allowing a single piece of land to give some kind of advantage to the enemy, even if there was little advantage. As the war continued and more blood was lost on both sides, the soldiers grew more and more tired of war and had begun to make large promises to the government. To keep the war effort going, they begun to say that they would kill soldiers who did not attack, saying that they were betraying the Army if they did not fight.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":20},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German","offset":45},{"uri":"Invade","surface_form":"invading","offset":86},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":95},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":110},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":188},{"uri":"First_Battle_of_the_Marne","surface_form":"Battle of the Marne","offset":235},{"uri":"Trench_warfare","surface_form":"trenches","offset":286},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":337},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":354},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":503},{"uri":"Infantry","surface_form":"infantry","offset":530},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":601},{"uri":"Barbed_wire","surface_form":"barbed wire","offset":620},{"uri":"Technology_during_World_War_I","surface_form":"New military technology","offset":704},{"uri":"Poison_gas_in_World_War_I","surface_form":"poison gas","offset":734},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":746},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tank","offset":760}]}
