It flows through the Banat region and into the Danube near Pan\u010Devo, in the northern part of Serbia.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Timi\u015F River's Drainage area covers 13.085\u00A0km\u00B2 (in Romania 8.085\u00A0km\u00B2, in Serbia 5,000\u00A0km\u00B2).\nThe river starts at the joining of the headwaters Brebu,Gr\u0103di\u015Ftea and Semenic in Lake Trei Ape.\nTributaries.\nThe river flows through Romania for 241\u00A0km.\nThese are the tributaries of the Timi\u015F River: R\u00E2ul Rece, Slatina, Valea Mare, M\u0103cica\u015F River, P\u00E2r\u00E2ul Lung, Armeni\u015F River, Sebe\u015F, Bistra, \u015Eurgani River, Timi\u015Fana, Pog\u0103ni\u015F River, Timi\u015Ful Mort River and Vena Mare. In its 118\u00A0km course through Serbia it has only one tributary, albeit the longest one, Brzava.\nRomania.\nBig cities in the rivers Romanian flow are Caransebe\u015F and Lugoj.\nOne of the big Romanian cities, Timi\u015Foara, though the name makes it seem like it, is not settled on the river. Although, the name comes from the river, when about 800 years ago the region was a swampy one and the Timi\u015F had a very large flow area. In 1728 when the rivers Timi\u015F and Bega were canalized, Timi\u015F stopped to flow through the city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":20},{"uri":"Serbian_language","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":39},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":66},{"uri":"Hungarian_language","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":85},{"uri":"Semenic_Mountains","surface_form":"Semenic Mountains","offset":154},{"uri":"Carpathian_Mountains","surface_form":"Carpathian Mountains","offset":191},{"uri":"Cara%C5%9F-Severin_County","surface_form":"Cara\u015F-Severin County","offset":216},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":238},{"uri":"Banat","surface_form":"Banat","offset":268},{"uri":"Danube","surface_form":"Danube","offset":294},{"uri":"Pan%C4%8Devo","surface_form":"Pan\u010Devo","offset":306},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":339},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"Drainage area","offset":382},{"uri":"Headwater","surface_form":"headwater","offset":498},{"uri":"Brebu_River_(Timi%C5%9F)","surface_form":"Brebu","offset":509},{"uri":"Gr%C4%83di%C5%9Ftea_River","surface_form":"Gr\u0103di\u015Ftea","offset":515},{"uri":"Semenic_River","surface_form":"Semenic","offset":529},{"uri":"Lake_Trei_Ape","surface_form":"Lake Trei Ape","offset":540},{"uri":"R%C3%A2ul_Rece","surface_form":"R\u00E2ul Rece","offset":658},{"uri":"Slatina_River_(Romania)","surface_form":"Slatina","offset":669},{"uri":"Valea_Mare","surface_form":"Valea Mare","offset":678},{"uri":"M%C4%83cica%C5%9F_River","surface_form":"M\u0103cica\u015F River","offset":690},{"uri":"P%C3%A2r%C3%A2ul_Lung","surface_form":"P\u00E2r\u00E2ul Lung","offset":705},{"uri":"Armeni%C5%9F_River","surface_form":"Armeni\u015F River","offset":718},{"uri":"Sebe%C5%9F_River","surface_form":"Sebe\u015F","offset":733},{"uri":"Bistra_River","surface_form":"Bistra","offset":740},{"uri":"%C5%9Eurgani_River","surface_form":"\u015Eurgani River","offset":748},{"uri":"Timi%C5%9Fana","surface_form":"Timi\u015Fana","offset":763},{"uri":"Pog%C4%83ni%C5%9F_River","surface_form":"Pog\u0103ni\u015F River","offset":773},{"uri":"Timi%C5%9Ful_Mort_River","surface_form":"Timi\u015Ful Mort River","offset":788},{"uri":"Vena_Mare","surface_form":"Vena Mare","offset":811},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":874},{"uri":"B%C3%A2rzava_River_(Timi%C5%9F)","surface_form":"Brzava","offset":909},{"uri":"Caransebe%C5%9F","surface_form":"Caransebe\u015F","offset":969},{"uri":"Lugoj","surface_form":"Lugoj","offset":984},{"uri":"Timi%C5%9Foara","surface_form":"Timi\u015Foara","offset":1023},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":1185},{"uri":"Bega","surface_form":"Bega","offset":1272}]}
