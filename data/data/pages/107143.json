{"id":107143,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat%C3%A1n","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Spanish Conquest of Yucat\u00E1n was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish \"conquistadores\" against the Late Postclassic Maya states. This part of the conquest and colonization of the Americas began in the early 16th century, but it took more time than the similar campaigns against the Aztec and Inca Empires. It was about 170 years later before the last Maya stronghold fell, that of the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake Pet\u00E9n Itz\u00E1, in 1697. But except for the Pet\u00E9n region and the Guatemalan highlands, the Spanish had control over Yucat\u00E1n itself already by 1546.\nUnlike the campaigns against the Aztec and Inca states, the Maya had no single political center. Therefore the Spanish had to fight city by city to break resistance by the indigenous peoples.\nIn the beginning the \"conquistadores\" were mainly interested to get as much gold and silver as possible. Because the Maya lands were poor in this respect, they were not very interesting for the Spanish at that stage. But when land workers became important for the colonies, the Spanish turned to the Maya region. That was around the 1520s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_Empire","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":80},{"uri":"Conquistador","surface_form":"conquistador","offset":89},{"uri":"Mesoamerican_chronology","surface_form":"Late Postclassic","offset":117},{"uri":"Maya_civilization","surface_form":"Maya","offset":134},{"uri":"Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"colonization of the Americas","offset":177},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":225},{"uri":"Aztec","surface_form":"Aztec","offset":300},{"uri":"Inca_Empire","surface_form":"Inca Empire","offset":310},{"uri":"Stronghold","surface_form":"stronghold","offset":374},{"uri":"Itza","surface_form":"Itza","offset":403},{"uri":"Tayasal","surface_form":"Tayasal","offset":419},{"uri":"Lake_Pet%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1","surface_form":"Lake Pet\u00E9n Itz\u00E1","offset":430},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous peoples","offset":751},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":847},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":856},{"uri":"1520s","surface_form":"1520s","offset":1104}]}
