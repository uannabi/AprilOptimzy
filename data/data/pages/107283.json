{"id":107283,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a polynomial is a kind of mathematical expression. It is a sum of several mathematical terms called monomials. That is, a number, a variable, or a product of a number and several variables. When an algebra<nowiki/>ic expression contains letters mixed with numbers and arithmetic, like \"7x\u2074-3x\u00B3+19x\u00B2-8x+197\", there is a good chance that it is a polynomial. Polynomials are taught in algebra, which is a gateway course to all technical subjects. Mathematicians, scientists and engineers all use polynomials to solve problems.\nIn algebra, when letters, numbers, and arithmetic symbols occur together, the understanding is that the letters stand for variables, which are either symbols of their own, numbers not yet known, or numbers that change during the course of the problem (such as time). A polynomial is an algebraic expression in which the only arithmetic is addition, subtraction, multiplication and whole number exponentiation. If harder operations are used, such as division or square root<nowiki/>s, then this algebraic expression is not a polynomial. Polynomials are often easier to use than other algebraic expressions.\nPolynomials are often used to form polynomial equations, such as the equation \"7x\u2074-3x\u00B3+19x\u00B2-8x+197\" = 0, or polynomial functions, such as \"f\"(\"x\") = \"7x\u2074-3x\u00B3+19x\u00B2-8x+197\".\nTerminology.\nGiven a series of \"n\" numbers formula_1, a polynomial of variable formula_1 generally takes the form formula_1. The parts of a polynomial separated by plus (or minus) signs are called \"terms\", and the signs are themselves part of the term.\nIf a polynomial has only one term, it is called a \"monomial\". Monomial are also the building blocks of polynomials. For example, 5\"x\"3 is a monomial.\nIn a term, the multiplier out in front is called a \"coefficient\". The letter is called an \"unknown\" or a \"variable\", and the raised number after the letter is called an exponent. On a calculator and some computers, instead of putting an exponent above and to the right of the variable, the symbol ^ is used, so that the monomial above could be written as 5\"x\"^3.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Term_(mathematics)","surface_form":"mathematical terms","offset":103},{"uri":"Monomial","surface_form":"monomials","offset":129},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":161},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":227},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":411},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":556},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":813},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"exponentiation","offset":947},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":1014},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":1205},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":1228},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":1278},{"uri":"Term_(mathematics)","surface_form":"terms","offset":1529},{"uri":"Monomial","surface_form":"monomial","offset":1635},{"uri":"Coefficient","surface_form":"coefficient","offset":1786},{"uri":"Exponent","surface_form":"exponent","offset":1903}]}
