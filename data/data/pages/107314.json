{"id":107314,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_pharmacy","text":"e=\"preserve\">An online pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates on the Internet to sell medications to consumers. There are online pharmacies in many countries of the world\u2014from India, the U.S., Germany, the UK\u2014and many other nations that sell to consumers in their own countries and often to consumers worldwide.\nDepending on its location and local regulations, an online pharmacy may or may not require prescriptions to purchase prescription medications.\nPrices at a given online pharmacy can vary from one city or country to another. Typically, drug prices at online pharmacies located in countries with drug price controls in place (i.e., India, UK, Germany, South Africa) will have more affordable costs. In contrast, costs at pharmacies in countries where there are no drug price controls (i.e., U.S.) will usually be much higher. Especially for consumers seeking low-priced medications, it can be very worthwhile to compare prices at various online pharmacies. Prices can vary as much as 80 percent or more for one medication from one country to another.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pharmacy","surface_form":"pharmacy","offset":37}]}
