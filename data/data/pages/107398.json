{"id":107398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Ellison","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ralph Waldo Ellison (March 1, 1913\u2013April 16, 1994) was an African-American writer. He was born in Oklahoma and studied at the Tuskegee Institute.\nEllison is most famous for writing \"Invisible Man\", a novel about racism and African American identity. The narrator of the book calls himself an invisible man because people refuse to see him for who he really is. \"Invisible Man\" won a National Book Award and is still read today by many students and scholars.\nBesides \"Invisible Man\", Ellison wrote many essays. He was very interested in music, especially jazz. He started a second novel, called \"Juneteenth\", but never finished it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"March_1","surface_form":"March 1","offset":34},{"uri":"1913","surface_form":"1913","offset":43},{"uri":"April_16","surface_form":"April 16","offset":48},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":58},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":71},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":88},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":111},{"uri":"Tuskegee_Institute","surface_form":"Tuskegee Institute","offset":139},{"uri":"Invisible_Man","surface_form":"Invisible Man","offset":195},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":213},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":225},{"uri":"Identity","surface_form":"identity","offset":253},{"uri":"Narrator","surface_form":"narrator","offset":267},{"uri":"National_Book_Award","surface_form":"National Book Award","offset":396},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":461},{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essay","offset":515},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":567},{"uri":"Juneteenth","surface_form":"Juneteenth","offset":608}]}
