{"id":107633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallstatt","text":"Hallstatt is a village in Upper Austria. Currently, a little over 900 people live there. It is in the Salzkammergut, a mountain regionin Austria. It lies on a lake.\nBecause of its position, Hallstatt could only be reached by boat (or by using narrow, difficult mountain trails) for a long time. At the end of the 19th century a road was built. Despite this, even in the Neolithic people might have lived there. This is because there is a lot of natural salt there. In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer (a salt miner) found a cemetery from the neolithic age just above the village. A cultural epoch in Europe is named after this. It is called Hallstatt culture. Other finds in the region include a Shoe-last celt (a special kind of wedge, probably used to treat wood). A blacksmith site has also been excavatzed.\nToday, the village lives mainly on tourism. There is a copy of the village in China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":15},{"uri":"Upper_Austria","surface_form":"Upper Austria","offset":26},{"uri":"Salzkammergut","surface_form":"Salzkammergut","offset":102},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":119},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":137},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":159},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":225},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":313},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":370},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":453},{"uri":"Johann_Georg_Ramsauer","surface_form":"Johann Georg Ramsauer","offset":474},{"uri":"Cemetery","surface_form":"cemetery","offset":519},{"uri":"Hallstatt_culture","surface_form":"Hallstatt culture","offset":636},{"uri":"Shoe-last_celt","surface_form":"Shoe-last celt","offset":691},{"uri":"Wedge_(mechanics)","surface_form":"wedge","offset":725},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":755},{"uri":"Blacksmith","surface_form":"blacksmith","offset":764},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":841}]}
