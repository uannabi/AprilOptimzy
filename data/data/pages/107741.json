{"id":107741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_sports","text":"=\"preserve\">Motor sports are sports where the people taking part use a motor vehicle. The usual vehicles are a car, motorcycle or boat. Some motor sports use aircraft or snowmobiles.\nMotor sports can be based either on speed (the first one to reach the finish line wins) or on skill (the one with the least amount of penalty points wins). Speed-based motor sports are often called \"races\". Motor sports based on skill are often called \"trials\".\nWell known motor sports are rally, Formula 1 and Nascar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":29},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":77},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":111},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":116},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":130},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":158},{"uri":"Snowmobile","surface_form":"snowmobile","offset":170},{"uri":"Rally","surface_form":"rally","offset":473},{"uri":"Formula_1","surface_form":"Formula 1","offset":480},{"uri":"Nascar","surface_form":"Nascar","offset":494}]}
