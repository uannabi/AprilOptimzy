{"id":107841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","text":"Native Americans in the United States (also known as Indians) are the indigenous peoples from the areas of North America now part of the continental United States, including parts of Alaska. The Cherokee were the first Native Americans to be recognized as US citizens. In the 19th century white colonists called the Cherokee one of the Five Civilized Tribes. The others were Chicksaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole.\nThere are about 310 Indian reservations in the US. Most Native Americans do not live on a reservation anymore.\nNative Americans are affected by some problems more than White Americans. For example Native Americans are six times more likely to suffer from alcoholism than average. About 24% live in extreme poverty. Native American and Native Alaskan women are more likely to be targets of sexual violence than other women.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous peoples","offset":70},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":107},{"uri":"Continental_United_States","surface_form":"continental United States","offset":137},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":183},{"uri":"Cherokee","surface_form":"Cherokee","offset":195},{"uri":"Colonist","surface_form":"colonist","offset":295},{"uri":"Reservation","surface_form":"reservation","offset":504}]}
