{"id":107867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning","text":"e=\"preserve\">Deduction is one of the two main types of reasoning. The other is induction. In deduction, we apply a general rule to a particular case.\nDeductive arguments are attempts to show that a conclusion must follow from a set of premises or hypotheses. A deductive argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nThe first two statements are called \"premises\". The last statement is called the \"conclusion\". The conclusion is taken from the premises.\nDeductive reasoning is often called \"top-down logic\", whereas inductive reasoning is called \"bottom-up reasoning\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reason","surface_form":"reason","offset":55},{"uri":"Inductive_reasoning","surface_form":"induction","offset":79},{"uri":"Premise","surface_form":"premise","offset":235},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypotheses","offset":247},{"uri":"Validity","surface_form":"valid","offset":283},{"uri":"Inductive_reasoning","surface_form":"inductive reasoning","offset":546}]}
