{"id":107939,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal","text":"Tikal (or Tik\u2019al, according to modern orthography) is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the Maya civilization. It lies in modern day Guatemala at. Now it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a popular tourist spot.\nTikal was one of the major cultural and population centers of the Maya civilization. The oldest monumental architecture at the site dates to the 4th century BC. The best time of Tikal was during the Classic Period, from 200 AD to 900 AD. In this period, Tikal was in charge of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily. This is because it was linked with areas throughout Mesoamerica, such as central Mexican, the center of Teotihuacan. After the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built. Some palaces were burned and the population declined. The site was abandoned by the end of the 10th century.\nSite characteristics.\nThe ruins are on lowland rainforest, but Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored underground. Archaeologists working in Tikal during the last century used the underground facilities to store water for their own use. The absence of springs, rivers, and lakes nearby is unusual for a major city. However, Tikal did well with agricultural techniques. These were more advanced than the slash & burn methods originally theorized by archeologists. The reliance on seasonal rainfall made Tikal open to drought. This is now thought to play a major part in the \"Classic Maya Collapse\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orthography","surface_form":"orthography","offset":38},{"uri":"Maya_civilization","surface_form":"Maya civilization","offset":102},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":143},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":169},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":176},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":321},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":332},{"uri":"Mesoamerican_chronology","surface_form":"Classic Period","offset":424},{"uri":"900","surface_form":"900","offset":455},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politically","offset":518},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economically","offset":531},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"militarily","offset":549},{"uri":"Mesoamerica","surface_form":"Mesoamerica","offset":613},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":642},{"uri":"Teotihuacan","surface_form":"Teotihuacan","offset":665},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":760},{"uri":"Decline","surface_form":"declined","offset":799},{"uri":"Abandon","surface_form":"abandon","offset":822},{"uri":"10th_century","surface_form":"10th century","offset":850},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":911},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"Archaeologist","offset":1015},{"uri":"Facility","surface_form":"facilities","offset":1092},{"uri":"Absent","surface_form":"absence","offset":1141},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":1244},{"uri":"Technique","surface_form":"techniques","offset":1257},{"uri":"Slash_%26amp%3B_burn","surface_form":"slash & burn","offset":1303},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theorized","offset":1335},{"uri":"Reliance","surface_form":"reliance","offset":1367},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":1379},{"uri":"Rainfall","surface_form":"rainfall","offset":1388},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":1416}]}
