{"id":108001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec_language","text":"=\"preserve\">Yucatec Maya (\"Maaya T'aan\" in the revised orthography of the \"Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala\") is a Mayan language spoken in the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula. It is also spoken in northern Belize and parts of Guatemala. To native speakers, it is known only as Maya - \"Yucatec\" is a label linguists use to distinguish it from other Mayan languages (such as K'iche' and Itza' Maya).\nIn the Mexican states of Yucat\u00E1n, northern Campeche and Quintana Roo, Maya remains many speakers' first language today, with approximately 800,000 speakers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orthography","surface_form":"orthography","offset":55},{"uri":"Academia_de_Lenguas_Mayas_de_Guatemala","surface_form":"Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala","offset":75},{"uri":"Mayan_language","surface_form":"Mayan language","offset":121},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula","offset":150},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":199},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":219},{"uri":"K%27iche%27_language","surface_form":"K'iche'","offset":366},{"uri":"Itza%27_language","surface_form":"Itza'","offset":378},{"uri":"States_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican states","offset":398},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n","offset":416},{"uri":"Campeche","surface_form":"Campeche","offset":434},{"uri":"Quintana_Roo","surface_form":"Quintana Roo","offset":447}]}
