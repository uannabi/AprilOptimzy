{"id":108007,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayasal","text":"Tayasal is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site from the Postclassic period. The site is in the southern Maya lowlands on a small island in Lake Pet\u00E9n Itz\u00E1. This island is now part of the Department of Pet\u00E9n in northern Guatemala. Tayasal was the capital of one of the last independent Maya polities to be conquered by the Spanish \"conquistadores\" and colonizers, along with Zacpeten (the capital of the Ko'woj Maya) and Eixequil (the Yalnain capital), in 1697.\nAs an archaeological site, it was heavily damaged by the Spanish after its fall. The capital city of the modern Pet\u00E9n department, Flores, has been built over the island and the nearby shores of the lake.\nThe Itza left the Yucat\u00E1n region in the 13th century and built the city later known as Tayasal as their capital. They called it \"Noh Pet\u00E9n\", or literally \"City Island\". It was also called \"Tah Itz\u00E1\", or Place of the Itz\u00E1.\nIn 1541, Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s came to the island, on route to Honduras, but needed to move on and did not try to conquer it due to its very good defensive position.\nThe Spanish were not able to conquer the island until 1697, after several attempts, that begun in 1629, when they marched in, from Corozal in Belize, Yucat\u00E1n and Alta Verapaz, attacked with boats, and destroyed it. Many Itz\u00E1 people hid in the jungle for years. The structures of Noh Pet\u00E9n were turned into the Roman Catholic Church and other buildings in the city of Flores.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pre-Columbian","surface_form":"pre-Columbian","offset":13},{"uri":"Maya_civilization","surface_form":"Maya","offset":27},{"uri":"Archaeological_site","surface_form":"archaeological site","offset":32},{"uri":"Mesoamerican_chronology","surface_form":"Postclassic","offset":61},{"uri":"Lake_Pet%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1","surface_form":"Lake Pet\u00E9n Itz\u00E1","offset":144},{"uri":"Pet%C3%A9n_(department)","surface_form":"Department of Pet\u00E9n","offset":192},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":224},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":251},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":278},{"uri":"Polity","surface_form":"polities","offset":295},{"uri":"Spanish_Empire","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":327},{"uri":"Conquistador","surface_form":"conquistador","offset":336},{"uri":"Zacpeten","surface_form":"Zacpeten","offset":379},{"uri":"Ko%27woj","surface_form":"Ko'woj","offset":408},{"uri":"Eixequil","surface_form":"Eixequil","offset":425},{"uri":"Flores%2C_El_Pet%C3%A9n","surface_form":"Flores","offset":596},{"uri":"Itza","surface_form":"Itza","offset":674},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n","offset":688},{"uri":"1541","surface_form":"1541","offset":895},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":901},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":947},{"uri":"Defense_(military)","surface_form":"defensive","offset":1030},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":1192},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n","offset":1200},{"uri":"Alta_Verapaz","surface_form":"Alta Verapaz","offset":1212}]}
