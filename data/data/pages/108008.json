{"id":108008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_site","text":"An archaeological site is a place where physical remains of the past survive. The archaeologists working there will carefully record what they find. They may also change the site so that what has been found can be preserved better.\nThe site will have trenches so that people can excavate better. To start the excavation, the topsoil will be removed. Special tools like pickaxes and mattocks are used to break up and remove very hard compacted soil. Shovels and spades are used to clear away bulk debris. Other hand tools used in bulk cleanup work are hoes, rakes, forks, and the wheelbarrow to cart it away.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeologists","offset":82},{"uri":"Topsoil","surface_form":"topsoil","offset":325},{"uri":"Pickaxe","surface_form":"pickaxe","offset":369},{"uri":"Shovel","surface_form":"Shovel","offset":449},{"uri":"Spade","surface_form":"spade","offset":461},{"uri":"Hoe","surface_form":"hoe","offset":551},{"uri":"Rake","surface_form":"rake","offset":557},{"uri":"Wheelbarrow","surface_form":"wheelbarrow","offset":579}]}
