They together represent the general economy of the United States.\nIt used to be that most of the companies were in heavy industries, such as steel, oil, autos, and appliances, but it now has companies from many different industries. The most recent companies to join the index are from the technology industry.\nFor a list of companies that have once been a part on the Dow Jones but are no longer part of it today, see this list.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stock_market_index","surface_form":"stock market indices","offset":120},{"uri":"The_Wall_Street_Journal","surface_form":"Wall Street Journal","offset":176},{"uri":"Dow_Jones_%26amp%3B_Company","surface_form":"Dow Jones & Company","offset":208},{"uri":"Charles_Dow","surface_form":"Charles Dow","offset":239},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":289},{"uri":"New_York_Stock_Exchange","surface_form":"NYSE","offset":319},{"uri":"NASDAQ","surface_form":"NASDAQ","offset":331},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":412},{"uri":"Industrial","surface_form":"heavy industries","offset":491},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":517},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":524},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"autos","offset":529},{"uri":"Appliance","surface_form":"appliance","offset":540},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":666},{"uri":"Historical_components_of_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","surface_form":"this list","offset":795}]}
