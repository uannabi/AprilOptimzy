{"id":10821,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube","text":"The Nintendo GameCube (called GameCube, \"NGC\", or \"GC\" for short) is the fourth video game home console made by Nintendo. Nintendo's previous console was called the Nintendo 64. Nintendo's next console is called the Nintendo Wii, released in 2006 with models released before November 2011 being backwards compatible with GameCube games. The last game for the console was \"Madden NFL 08\" (also released for the Wii and Nintendo DS), which was released on August 14, 2007. However, first-party development ended six months prior.\nThe GameCube also had many new features compared to other Nintendo video game consoles, and was the first Nintendo console to officially support Internet play (playing together without wires). It could also connect to the Game Boy Player to allow special features and play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games.\nThe console was released on September 14, 2001 in Japan, November 18, 2001 in North America, May 3, 2002 in Europe, and May 17, 2002 in Australia. The GameCube sold 21.74 million units worldwide was discontinued in early 2009 to focus production on the Wii and DS.\nController.\nThe GameCube's controllers have two analog joysticks. In many games, one of them is used to control a character, while the other is used to control the camera, or some other secondary function. In addition to the analog sticks and the directional pad (D-pad), there are eight buttons: A, B, Y, X, L, R, Z, and Start.\nNintendo later released a wireless version of the controller, called the WaveBird. Instead of wires, it used RF signals to communicate with the console and was powered by standard AA batteries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game home console","offset":80},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":112},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":165},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Nintendo Wii","offset":216},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":418},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Player","surface_form":"Game Boy Player","offset":750},{"uri":"Game_Boy","surface_form":"Game Boy","offset":801},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Color","surface_form":"Game Boy Color","offset":811},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance","offset":831},{"uri":"Joystick","surface_form":"joystick","offset":1175},{"uri":"WaveBird_Wireless_Controller","surface_form":"WaveBird","offset":1522}]}
