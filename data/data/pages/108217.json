It is the capital city of the Grand'Anse \"D\u00E9partement\".\nJ\u00E9r\u00E9mie is also called the \"City of Poets\" because of the many writers, poets, and historians that were born or live there, such as Etzer Vilaire and \u00C9mile Roumer. The father of the French writer Alexandre Dumas, p\u00E8re, General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, was born at Mad\u00E8re, near J\u00E9r\u00E9mie.\nHistory.\nThe town was founded in 1756 when the country was the French colony of \"Saint-Domingue\". It was built where there was a small fishing town called \"Trou-J\u00E9r\u00E9mie\".\nGeography.\nThe city is on the north coast of the Southern Peninsula, on a small bay. It is among low mountains (Bordes, Rochasse and Caracol) and almost isolated from the rest of the country, about 280\u00A0km south of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. To the southeast of the city is the River Grande-Anse.\nIt is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has five \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): J\u00E9r\u00E9mie, Abricots, Bonbon, Chambellan and Moron.\nEconomy.\nJeremie is an important Haitian port; bananas are send to other countries from this port.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Haitian_Creole","surface_form":"Kr\u00E9y\u00F2l","offset":9},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":32},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":50},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":67},{"uri":"Grand%27Anse_Department","surface_form":"Grand'Anse","offset":87},{"uri":"Departments_of_Haiti","surface_form":"D\u00E9partement","offset":99},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"Poet","offset":149},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":176},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":196},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":295},{"uri":"Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Alexandre Dumas, p\u00E8re","offset":309},{"uri":"Thomas-Alexandre_Dumas","surface_form":"Thomas-Alexandre Dumas","offset":340},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":461},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":468},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":533},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":605},{"uri":"Bay","surface_form":"bay","offset":649},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":670},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":787},{"uri":"Port-au-Prince","surface_form":"Port-au-Prince","offset":803},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":1032},{"uri":"Harbour","surface_form":"port","offset":1137},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":1143}]}
