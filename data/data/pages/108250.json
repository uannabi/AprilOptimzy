{"id":108250,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring","text":"The N\u00FCrburgring, known as simply \"the Ring\" by enthusiasts, is the name of a famous motorsport race track in N\u00FCrburg, Germany, built in the 1920s around the village and medieval castle of N\u00FCrburg in the Eifel, which is about 70 kilometres south of Cologne, 100 kilometres northwest of Mainz, and 120 kilometres northwest of Frankfurt.\nOriginally, the track featured four track configurations: the long \"Gesamtstrecke\" (\"Whole Course\"), which included the 22.810\u00A0km \"Nordschleife\" (\"Northern Loop\"), and the 7.747\u00A0km \"S\u00FCdschleife\" (\"Southern Loop\"). There also was a 2.281\u00A0km warm-up loop called \"Zielschleife\" (\"Finish Loop\") or better known as \"Betonschleife\", around the pit area.\nBetween 1982 and 1983 the start-finish area was demolished to create a new \"GP-Strecke\", and this is currently used for all major and international racing events.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Motorsport","surface_form":"motorsport","offset":84},{"uri":"Race_track","surface_form":"race track","offset":95},{"uri":"N%C3%BCrburg","surface_form":"N\u00FCrburg","offset":109},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":118},{"uri":"Eifel","surface_form":"Eifel","offset":203},{"uri":"Cologne","surface_form":"Cologne","offset":248},{"uri":"Mainz","surface_form":"Mainz","offset":285},{"uri":"Frankfurt","surface_form":"Frankfurt","offset":324},{"uri":"S%C3%BCdschleife","surface_form":"S\u00FCdschleife","offset":517},{"uri":"Pit_stop","surface_form":"pit","offset":673}]}
