{"id":108601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)","text":"\"House\" is an American medical television drama. It was created by David Shore in 2004 and aired on FOX from 2004-2012. \"House\" M.D. has fans all over the world. It is set at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. The show's main character, Doctor Gregory House, is a grumpy, sarcastic man who hates having to deal with his patients. Even though he spends a lot of his time insulting his patients and co-workers, or watching TV in his office, Dr. House almost always manages to cure his patients with his great medical intelligence.\nLayout.\nNearly all episodes of \"House\" follow the same pattern: we see the events that come before the patient being taken to the hospital, then House and his colleagues spend a lot of time doing tests and coming up with different ideas for what the problem is. At the very end, House comes up with the answer, generally through epiphanies, and usually the patient recovers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":14},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medical","offset":23},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":42},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":137},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":155},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":231},{"uri":"Cure","surface_form":"cure","offset":507},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":581},{"uri":"Patient","surface_form":"patient","offset":665},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":692},{"uri":"Colleague","surface_form":"colleague","offset":721},{"uri":"Answer","surface_form":"answer","offset":865},{"uri":"Insight","surface_form":"epiphanies","offset":891}]}
