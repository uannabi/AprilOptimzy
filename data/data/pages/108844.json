When their engagement was announced, it was also said that she would not be known as \"The Princess of Wales\". This was because Prince Charles' extremely popular first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, held that title from 1981 until her death in 1997. The relationship between Camilla and Prince Charles began when they met at a polo match in 1970. Camilla was seen to be an unsuitable match for the future king.\nThe Duchess now makes many visits, mostly in Great Britain \u2014 often with Prince Charles, but sometimes on her own. She lives at Clarence House, which is a part of St James's Palace in London (very close to Buckingham Palace).
