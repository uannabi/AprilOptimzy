{"id":108891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine%2C_Florida","text":"St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States begun by Europeans and filled with people since it was started. The admiral from Spain, Pedro Men\u00E9ndez de Avil\u00E9s, started St. Augustine in 1565. There was fighting between England and Spain in 1586, 1702, and 1740 over the city. Spain won each time. In 1763, St. Augustine was given to the English as part of the Treaty of Paris which ended the French and Indian War. After the American colonies became independent from England, another Treaty of Paris, this one in 1783, returned the area to Spain. In 1819, the Adams-On\u00EDs Treaty gave all of Florida to the United States.\nThe largest sign of the years under Spain is the Castillo de San Marcos, a large masonry fort built between 1672 and 1695. This fort still stands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":135},{"uri":"Pedro_Men%C3%A9ndez_de_Avil%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Pedro Men\u00E9ndez de Avil\u00E9s","offset":142},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":226},{"uri":"1586","surface_form":"1586","offset":247},{"uri":"1702","surface_form":"1702","offset":253},{"uri":"1740","surface_form":"1740","offset":263},{"uri":"1763","surface_form":"1763","offset":307},{"uri":"French_and_Indian_War","surface_form":"French and Indian War","offset":399},{"uri":"1783","surface_form":"1783","offset":520},{"uri":"Adams-On%C3%ADs_Treaty","surface_form":"Adams-On\u00EDs Treaty","offset":567},{"uri":"Castillo_de_San_Marcos","surface_form":"Castillo de San Marcos","offset":676},{"uri":"1672","surface_form":"1672","offset":735},{"uri":"1695","surface_form":"1695","offset":744}]}
