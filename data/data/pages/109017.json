{"id":109017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulawesi","text":"Sulawesi (formerly known as Celebes) is one of the four larger Sunda Islands of Indonesia, and is between Borneo and the Maluku Islands.\nGeography.\nSulawesi is the world's eleventh-largest island, covering an area of 174,600\u00A0km2. The island is surrounded by Borneo to the west, by the Philippines to the north, by Maluku to the east, and by Flores and Timor to the south. It has a distinctive shape, dominated by four large peninsulas: the Semenanjung Minahassa; the East Peninsula; the South Peninsula; and the South-east Peninsula. The central part of the island is ruggedly mountainous, such that the island's peninsulas have traditionally been remote from each other, with better connections by sea than by road.\nMajor cities.\nThese are the ten largest cities in Sulawesi by population in 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sunda_Islands","surface_form":"Sunda Islands","offset":63},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":80},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":106},{"uri":"Maluku_Islands","surface_form":"Maluku Islands","offset":121},{"uri":"List_of_islands_by_area","surface_form":"world's eleventh-largest island","offset":164},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":258},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":285},{"uri":"Maluku","surface_form":"Maluku","offset":314},{"uri":"Flores","surface_form":"Flores","offset":341},{"uri":"Timor","surface_form":"Timor","offset":352},{"uri":"Semenanjung_Minahassa","surface_form":"Semenanjung Minahassa","offset":440},{"uri":"East_Peninsula%2C_Sulawesi","surface_form":"East Peninsula","offset":467},{"uri":"South_Peninsula%2C_Sulawesi","surface_form":"South Peninsula","offset":487},{"uri":"South-east_Peninsula%2C_Sulawesi","surface_form":"South-east Peninsula","offset":512}]}
