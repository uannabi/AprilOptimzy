{"id":10907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry","text":"Forestry means working to take care of forests. Someone who has a job looking after forests is called a forester.\nForests are very important for the world today. Much of the water cycle and carbon cycle goes through forests. Many of them are disappearing because people destroy them for firewood or to make farms. A forester makes sure the forest and all the animals that live there are healthy. Foresters also make sure the forest is in good condition for people to use. They makes sure that forests are not destroyed by wildfires before they are ready to use for timber production (cutting down trees to use the wood).\nForests are important for recreation (letting people enjoy them). They are very important today because humans produce a lot of carbon dioxide and the trees in forests help to turn this back into oxygen, which we breathe to live. Foresters also help the government figure out what to do about artificial forestry. Many universities offer forestry courses. Forestry students also study zoology and botany.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":39},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":149},{"uri":"Water_cycle","surface_form":"water cycle","offset":174},{"uri":"Carbon_cycle","surface_form":"carbon cycle","offset":190},{"uri":"Firewood","surface_form":"firewood","offset":287},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"to make farms","offset":299},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"animals","offset":359},{"uri":"Timber","surface_form":"timber","offset":565},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":647},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":749},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":817},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoology","offset":1006},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":1018}]}
