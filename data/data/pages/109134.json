The story of the \"Songmaster\" occurs in a future human empire, and follows Ansset, a young boy whose singing voice has the power of making people's feelings stronger. This makes him both a possible healer and destroyer. He is trained in the art of singing so perfectly that his songs can show ideas and feelings better than words. This book was based on Card's short story \"Mikal's Songbird\".\nLiterary significance & criticism.\nOne reviewer said that \"Songmaster\" was \"Quite possibly Card's best published work, ever.\" The publisher described the story as \"...a haunting story of power and love\u2014the tale of the man who would destroy everything he loves to preserve humanity's peace, and the boy who might just sing the world away\".\nAwards and nominations.\nAs with some other Card novels (\"Ender's Game\", for example), this book started out as a shorter story \"Mikal's Songbird\", which was a Nebula Award finalist in 1978. \"Songmaster\" got the Hamilton-Brackett Memorial Award in 1981.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["book"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":25},{"uri":"Orson_Scott_Card","surface_form":"Orson Scott Card","offset":49},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":122},{"uri":"Mikal%27s_Songbird","surface_form":"Mikal's Songbird","offset":441},{"uri":"Ender%27s_Game","surface_form":"Ender's Game","offset":856},{"uri":"Mikal%27s_Songbird","surface_form":"Mikal's Songbird","offset":927},{"uri":"Nebula_Award","surface_form":"Nebula Award","offset":958},{"uri":"1981","surface_form":"1981","offset":1046}]}
