{"id":109214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints","text":"The New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The Saints play in the Southern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL).\nIn 1980, the Saints became the first ever NFL team to finish with 1 win and 15 losses.\nAfter a history of bad luck, the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV in the 2009 season off an interception from Peyton Manning by cornerback Tracy Porter. That was also meaningful because only about four years earlier the city was badly hurt when Hurricane Katrina came through in 2005.\nThat was later tarnished as in 2012 they and defesnive coodinator Gregg Williams were exposed to have used a bounty stystem, in which players were paid to deliver especially hard/illegal hits to the opponent. Brees denied knowing of the system. The Saints soon recovered and won three straight NFC South division titles.\nThe team name was inspired by a popular Mardi Gras song called \"When the Saints Go Marching In\".\nThe Saints have several famous players including their starting quarterback Drew Brees. They also have running back Alvin Kamara, wide receiver Michael Thomas and defensive end Cameron Jordan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":42},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":68},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":81},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":92},{"uri":"NFC_South","surface_form":"Southern Division","offset":120},{"uri":"National_Football_Conference","surface_form":"National Football Conference","offset":145},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":187},{"uri":"1980_New_Orleans_Saints_season","surface_form":"1980","offset":222},{"uri":"Super_Bowl_XLIV","surface_form":"Super Bowl XLIV","offset":350},{"uri":"Peyton_Manning","surface_form":"Peyton Manning","offset":410},{"uri":"Cornerback","surface_form":"cornerback","offset":428},{"uri":"Tracy_Porter","surface_form":"Tracy Porter","offset":439},{"uri":"Hurricane_Katrina","surface_form":"Hurricane Katrina","offset":545},{"uri":"Gregg_Williams","surface_form":"Gregg Williams","offset":651},{"uri":"Mardi_Gras","surface_form":"Mardi Gras","offset":946},{"uri":"When_the_Saints_Go_Marching_In","surface_form":"When the Saints Go Marching In","offset":970},{"uri":"Drew_Brees","surface_form":"Drew Brees","offset":1079},{"uri":"Alvin_Kamara","surface_form":"Alvin Kamara","offset":1119},{"uri":"Michael_Thomas","surface_form":"Michael Thomas","offset":1147},{"uri":"Cameron_Jordan","surface_form":"Cameron Jordan","offset":1180}]}
