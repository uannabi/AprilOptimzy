He was the main leader of the FARC-EP (\"Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ej\u00E9rcito del Pueblo\"). He was born on May 13, 1930 (a date that has been disputed), in a coffee-growing region of west-central Colombia in the Quind\u00EDo Department, to a peasant family politically aligned with the Liberal Party during La Violencia.\nMarulanda himself changed his political and ideological inclinations to the Communist Party (PCC) sometime during the period of \"La Violencia\" (roughly 1948 to 1958) that followed the assassination of the Liberal Party's leader Jorge Eli\u00E9cer Gait\u00E1n.\nHe has been considered to be seriously ill, and his death has been reported several times throughout his long career as a guerrilla, but the status of his health remains uncertain.\nIn March 2006, Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General of the United States, announced in conjunction with DEA and Department of Justice officials that the State Department had placed a $5 million dollar reward on Tirofijo's head, or for information leading to his capture.\nAccording to a Brazilian journal, he seems to have sufffered from some form of cancer. There also seem to have been disputes on leadership (of the FARC) in January 2008.\nHis death has been reported several times; He seems to have died of a heart attack in May 2008 This has now been confirmed.\nA Colombian newspaper published an interview with the defense minister of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos on the 24th of May, 2008. In it, Santos said, that Colombian intelligence agents thought, that Manuel Marulanda had died on the 26th of March 2008, either of natural causes, or through a heart attack. FARC commander \u2018Timochenko\u2019 confirmed on May 25 Telesur that \u2018Manuel Marulanda\u2019 died of a heart attack, as announced earlier by the Colombian government and the Colombian armed forces\nThis information was confirmed on the 25th of May: Marulanda had died of a heart attack.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pseudonym","surface_form":"pseudonym","offset":46},{"uri":"Firearm","surface_form":"firearm","offset":185},{"uri":"FARC","surface_form":"FARC","offset":225},{"uri":"May_13","surface_form":"May 13","offset":319},{"uri":"1930","surface_form":"1930","offset":327},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":370},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":408},{"uri":"Quind%C3%ADo_Department","surface_form":"Quind\u00EDo Department","offset":424},{"uri":"Peasant","surface_form":"peasant","offset":449},{"uri":"Colombian_Liberal_Party","surface_form":"Liberal Party","offset":493},{"uri":"La_Violencia","surface_form":"La Violencia","offset":514},{"uri":"Colombian_Communist_Party","surface_form":"Communist Party","offset":604},{"uri":"Jorge_Eli%C3%A9cer_Gait%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Jorge Eli\u00E9cer Gait\u00E1n","offset":756},{"uri":"Alberto_Gonzales","surface_form":"Alberto Gonzales","offset":974},{"uri":"Attorney_General_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Attorney General of the United States","offset":996},{"uri":"Drug_Enforcement_Administration","surface_form":"DEA","offset":1065},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Justice","surface_form":"Department of Justice","offset":1073},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1311},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1472},{"uri":"Juan_Manuel_Santos","surface_form":"Juan Manuel Santos","offset":1610}]}
