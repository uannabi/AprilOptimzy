{"id":109285,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishaw","text":"Wishaw is a town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is bordered by Motherwell and Carluke, and is split into several areas such as Netherton, Craigneuk, Newmains, Cambusnethan and Pather.\nOne of only three hospitals in Lanarkshire is in Wishaw. Wishaw General Hospital is at the bottom of Wishaw, easy to find as it is on the main A721 road.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the name is uncertain. One suggestion is that it is from the Scots word for \"Wicket gate in the wood\", and that it used to be called \"Wygateshaw\". Another theory is that it was originally \"Viashaw\", meaning way or road through the wood. Yet another theory is that the name derives from \"Wee Shaw\", meaning small wood.\nIn November 1996, the world's worst recorded outbreak of \"E. coli\" occurred in the town, in which 20 people died and around 200 were infected.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_Lanarkshire","surface_form":"North Lanarkshire","offset":20},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":39},{"uri":"Motherwell","surface_form":"Motherwell","offset":67},{"uri":"Carluke","surface_form":"Carluke","offset":82},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":206},{"uri":"Lanarkshire","surface_form":"Lanarkshire","offset":219}]}
