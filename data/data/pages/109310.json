He was born in Hampstead and raised in Golders Green, both in north-west London.\nWaugh is well known for his satirical novels which include \"Decline and Fall\", \"Vile Bodies\", \"Scoop\", \"A Handful of Dust\" and \"The Loved One\", and especially for \"Brideshead Revisited\" and the \"Sword of Honour\" trilogy. When he was writing these novels he used experiences that he had in his own life. He often described British aristocracy and high society, making satirical fun of them. However, in his real life he was also attracted to them.\nWaugh was a convert to Catholicism. His travel writings and his diaries and letters have also been published.\nHe was the father of writer Auberon Waugh (1939-2001).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":86},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":94},{"uri":"Hampstead","surface_form":"Hampstead","offset":117},{"uri":"Golders_Green","surface_form":"Golders Green","offset":141},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":175},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satirical","offset":211},{"uri":"Novels","surface_form":"novels","offset":221},{"uri":"Brideshead_Revisited","surface_form":"Brideshead Revisited","offset":347},{"uri":"Sword_of_Honour","surface_form":"Sword of Honour","offset":378},{"uri":"Aristocracy","surface_form":"aristocracy","offset":513},{"uri":"High_society","surface_form":"high society","offset":529},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":653},{"uri":"Auberon_Waugh","surface_form":"Auberon Waugh","offset":768}]}
