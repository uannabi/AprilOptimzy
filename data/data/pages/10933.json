They are normally made of maize (corn), but can also be made of wheat or potatoes.\nIn Spanish cuisine, tortillas are very different; they are closer to an omelette based on potatoes, usually mixed with other ingredients like onions, pork sausages or other vegetables; they can be baked or cooked in a frying pan. Also many Latin-American countries call omelettes tortillas, and the ingredients can be different in every country, using their local ingredients and by choice of the chef.\nIn Turkish cuisine a tortilla is known as lavash which is a type of flat bread.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":21},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":35},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":43},{"uri":"Burrito","surface_form":"burrito","offset":69},{"uri":"Enchilada","surface_form":"enchilada","offset":79},{"uri":"Taco","surface_form":"taco","offset":119},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":151},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":189},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":198},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":211},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":219},{"uri":"Omelette","surface_form":"omelette","offset":280},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":350},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"pork sausages","offset":358},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":614}]}
