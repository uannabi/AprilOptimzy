{"id":109710,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Cathedral","text":"Coventry Cathedral, also known as St. Michael's Cathedral, is an Anglican cathedral. It is in Coventry, West Midlands, England.\nIn fact, the city has three cathedrals. The first was St. Mary's, a monastic building, only a few ruins of which remain. The second was St Michael's, a 14th-century Gothic Cathedral, which was largely destroyed by a bombing raid in the Second World War. The cathedral was bombed on 14 November 1940 by the German Luftwaffe, which destroyed much of central Coventry. Nails found in the ruins were formed into a cross and consecrated in the Kaiser Wilhelm Ged\u00E4chtniskirche in Berlin.\nThe third cathedral is the new St Michael's Cathedral, built to replace the bombed cathedral. It is an important example of 20th century architecture.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Coventry. The Right Reverend Dr. Christopher Cocksworth is the current Bishop of Coventry. He is the 9th Bishop of Coventry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anglicanism","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":65},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":74},{"uri":"Coventry","surface_form":"Coventry","offset":94},{"uri":"West_Midlands_(county)","surface_form":"West Midlands","offset":104},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":119},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastic","offset":196},{"uri":"Ruin","surface_form":"ruin","offset":226},{"uri":"Gothic","surface_form":"Gothic","offset":293},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":344},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":364},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":434},{"uri":"Luftwaffe","surface_form":"Luftwaffe","offset":441},{"uri":"Kaiser_Wilhelm_Ged%C3%A4chtniskirche","surface_form":"Kaiser Wilhelm Ged\u00E4chtniskirche","offset":567},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":747},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"seat","offset":782},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Coventry","surface_form":"Bishop of Coventry","offset":794},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"Dr.","offset":833}]}
