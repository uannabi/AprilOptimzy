{"id":109711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean","text":"The World Ocean, or global ocean is a term used to define all the world's oceans as one large interconnected ocean.\nIt is divided into the standard oceans: the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the proposed Southern Ocean and ocean round the Antarctic.\nThe approximate shape of the 'World Ocean' can for most purposes be treated as constant, although in detail it is not. Climate change continually changes its structure, and continental drift does so over a much longer timescale.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":74},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":160},{"uri":"Arctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Arctic Ocean","offset":176},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":190},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":204},{"uri":"Southern_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Ocean","offset":236},{"uri":"Antarctic","surface_form":"Antarctic","offset":271},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"Climate change","offset":401},{"uri":"Continental_drift","surface_form":"continental drift","offset":455}]}
