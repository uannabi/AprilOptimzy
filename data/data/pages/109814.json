Sometimes called (alternatively attributed to James Brown) \"the hardest working man in show business\", he held the world record for the most time spent in front of a television camera. He was most widely known for \"Live! with Regis and Kelly\" (previously \"Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee\"), \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", \"Million Dollar Password\", and for hosting the first season of \"America's Got Talent\".\nEarly life.\nPhilbin was born in the Bronx, New York City. His father, Francis \"Frank\" Philbin, a U.S. Marine who served in the Pacific, was of Irish ancestry. His mother, Filomena \"Florence\" (nee Boscia), was of Arb\u00EBresh\u00EB ancestry. They lived in the Van Nest section of the Bronx. Philbin was raised Roman Catholic. He was supposedly named \"Regis\" because his father wanted him to attend the prestigious Regis High School. It was long believed that Philbin was an only child, but on the February 1, 2007, broadcast of \"Live with Regis and Kelly\", Philbin announced that he did have a brother, Frank M. Philbin (March 1, 1951 \u2013 January 27, 2007), who had died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma several days earlier. Philbin said his brother had asked to not be mentioned on television or in the press.\nPhilbin attended Our Lady of Solace grammar school in the Bronx, and graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1949 before attending the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated in 1953 with a sociology degree. He later served in the United States Navy as a supply officer, then went through a few behind-the-scenes jobs in television and radio before moving into the broadcasting arena.\nTelevision career.\nPhilbin filled in for Dick Clark for the 2004 edition of \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" after Clark suffered a stroke.\nOn November 18, 2011, Philbin aired his final episode of \"Live! with Regis and Kelly.\"\nDeath.\nOn July 24, 2020, Philbin's family released a statement that he had died at the age of 88, one month before his 89th birthday. \"TMZ\" reported that Philbin had died at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut of heart disease. \"The Blast\" revealed that he had died after having a heart attack caused by coronary artery disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":72},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":100},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":110},{"uri":"Talk_show","surface_form":"talk","offset":136},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":145},{"uri":"James_Brown","surface_form":"James Brown","offset":219},{"uri":"Show_business","surface_form":"show business","offset":260},{"uri":"Live%21_with_Kelly_and_Michael","surface_form":"Live! with Regis and Kelly","offset":388},{"uri":"Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_(U.S._game_show)","surface_form":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire","offset":465},{"uri":"Million_Dollar_Password","surface_form":"Million Dollar Password","offset":498},{"uri":"America%27s_Got_Talent","surface_form":"America's Got Talent","offset":561},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"the Bronx","offset":616},{"uri":"Van_Nest%2C_Bronx","surface_form":"Van Nest","offset":834},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":884},{"uri":"Regis_High_School_(New_York_City)","surface_form":"Regis High School","offset":988},{"uri":"Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","surface_form":"non-Hodgkin lymphoma","offset":1248},{"uri":"Cardinal_Hayes_High_School","surface_form":"Cardinal Hayes High School","offset":1461},{"uri":"University_of_Notre_Dame","surface_form":"University of Notre Dame","offset":1530},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":1590},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":1631},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":1736},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"broadcasting","offset":1765},{"uri":"Dick_Clark","surface_form":"Dick Clark","offset":1826},{"uri":"Dick_Clark%27s_New_Year%27s_Rockin%27_Eve_with_Ryan_Seacrest","surface_form":"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve","offset":1862},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":2296},{"uri":"Coronary_artery_disease","surface_form":"coronary artery disease","offset":2319}]}
