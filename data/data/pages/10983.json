{"id":10983,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota","text":"Minnesota is a state in the Upper Midwest of the United States of America. Part of the state has a border with the country of Canada.\nThe capital of Minnesota is Saint Paul. The largest city is Minneapolis. Over 3 million people live in the two cities and the suburbs that surround it, which are separated by the Mississippi River. They are known as the Twin Cities.\nBefore Minnesota was a state, indigenous peoples like the Dakota and the Ojibwe had lived there for a long time. White people entered the area to trade for furs and gain land; they tried to push out the indigenous peoples, which led to a war. The U.S. Army was sent in to fight the indigenous peoples, and the army officers brought many black slaves with them to their forts.\nMinnesota became a state on May 11, 1858; the army was still practicing slavery at the time. It was the 32nd state in the United States of America. The name Minnesota is Dakota (a Native American language) for \"sky-tinted water\". Eagle Mountain is the highest point in Minnesota. The state bird is the Common Loon.\nMinnesota has a humid continental climate. The winters in Minnesota are long and severe. Hence the state has a short growing season. During the summer, the south of the state is hot; the north is warm.\nIn the 1984 election, Minnesota was the only state that voted for Walter Mondale.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":15},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":49},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":126},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":138},{"uri":"Saint_Paul%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Saint Paul","offset":162},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":186},{"uri":"Minneapolis","surface_form":"Minneapolis","offset":194},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":313},{"uri":"Minneapolis-Saint_Paul","surface_form":"Twin Cities","offset":354},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous peoples","offset":397},{"uri":"Dakota_people","surface_form":"Dakota","offset":425},{"uri":"Ojibwe","surface_form":"Ojibwe","offset":440},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"White people","offset":480},{"uri":"Fur_trade","surface_form":"trade for furs","offset":513},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":605},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black","offset":704},{"uri":"Slavery_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"slaves","offset":710},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"forts","offset":736},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":923},{"uri":"Common_Loon","surface_form":"Common Loon","offset":1045},{"uri":"Humid_continental_climate","surface_form":"humid continental climate","offset":1074},{"uri":"1984_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"1984 election","offset":1267},{"uri":"Walter_Mondale","surface_form":"Walter Mondale","offset":1326}]}
