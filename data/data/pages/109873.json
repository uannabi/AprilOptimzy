Valery Gergiev is the artistic director of the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg.\nEarly years.\nGergiev was born in Moscow but was brought up in North Ossetia in the Caucasus. He was not a child prodigy, but he began to play the piano at secondary school, before going on to study at the St. Petersburg Conservatory in Leningrad from 1972 to 1977. His main conducting teacher was Ilya Musin who was one of the greatest conductors and teachers of conducting in Russian musical history.\nCareer.\nIn 1978, he became assistant conductor at the Kirov Opera, now the Mariinsky Opera. His first conducting appearance was with Sergei Prokofiev's \"War and Peace\". He was chief conductor of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra from 1981 until 1985 - the year he made his first appearance in the United Kingdom, together with pianist Evgeny Kissin, and violinists Maxim Vengerov and Vadim Repin, at The Lichfield Festival.\nIn 1991 Gergiev conducted the Bavarian State Opera in a performance of Modest Mussorgsky's \"Boris Godunov\" in Munich. In the same year he made his American d\u00E9but, performing \"War and Peace\" with the San Francisco Opera. Since then he has conducted operas and concerts all over the world.

He has often supported peace in the Caucasus during times of conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia. After the 2004 Beslan school massacre, Gergiev made an appeal on television for calm and against any revenge. He conducted concerts in tribute to the victims of the massacre.\nIn August 2008 Gergiev conducted the Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre in a concert given in the ruined headquarters of the South Ossetia separatist government. There had been a short war between Georgia and Russia because South Ossetia, which had been part of Georgia, wanted to be independent. The Georgian government tried to force them not to break away, but the Russian government did not want Georgia to do this. The concert, which was broadcast live on Russian television, was in support of the Russian action. Some people in the West did not agree that Gergiev should have supported Russia in this way.\nFamily life.\nIn 1999, Gergiev married the musician Natalya Debisova and they have three children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":33},{"uri":"2_May","surface_form":"2 May","offset":41},{"uri":"1953","surface_form":"1953","offset":47},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":58},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":66},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":80},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"Ossetian","offset":106},{"uri":"Mariinsky_Theatre","surface_form":"Mariinsky Theatre","offset":174},{"uri":"London_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"London Symphony Orchestra","offset":220},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Opera","surface_form":"Metropolitan Opera","offset":283},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":303},{"uri":"White_Nights_Festival","surface_form":"White Nights Festival","offset":360},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":385},{"uri":"North_Ossetia","surface_form":"North Ossetia","offset":463},{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucasus","offset":484},{"uri":"Prodigy","surface_form":"prodigy","offset":513},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":547},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg_Conservatory","surface_form":"St. Petersburg Conservatory","offset":606},{"uri":"Leningrad","surface_form":"Leningrad","offset":637},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conducting","offset":675},{"uri":"Ilya_Musin","surface_form":"Ilya Musin","offset":698},{"uri":"Kirov_Opera","surface_form":"Kirov Opera","offset":857},{"uri":"Mariinsky_Opera","surface_form":"Mariinsky Opera","offset":878},{"uri":"Sergei_Prokofiev","surface_form":"Sergei Prokofiev","offset":936},{"uri":"War_and_Peace_(Prokofiev)","surface_form":"War and Peace","offset":956},{"uri":"Armenian_Philharmonic_Orchestra","surface_form":"Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra","offset":1002},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1102},{"uri":"Evgeny_Kissin","surface_form":"Evgeny Kissin","offset":1140},{"uri":"Maxim_Vengerov","surface_form":"Maxim Vengerov","offset":1170},{"uri":"Vadim_Repin","surface_form":"Vadim Repin","offset":1189},{"uri":"The_Lichfield_Festival","surface_form":"The Lichfield Festival","offset":1205},{"uri":"Bavarian_State_Opera","surface_form":"Bavarian State Opera","offset":1259},{"uri":"Modest_Mussorgsky","surface_form":"Modest Mussorgsky","offset":1300},{"uri":"Boris_Godunov_(opera)","surface_form":"Boris Godunov","offset":1321},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":1339},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Opera","surface_form":"San Francisco Opera","offset":1428},{"uri":"Rotterdam_Philharmonic_Orchestra","surface_form":"Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra","offset":1821},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Opera","surface_form":"Metropolitan Opera","offset":1912},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1934},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Wagner","offset":2024},{"uri":"Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen","surface_form":"The Ring of the Nibelung","offset":2034},{"uri":"Cardiff","surface_form":"Cardiff","offset":2142},{"uri":"Wales_Millennium_Centre","surface_form":"Wales Millennium Centre","offset":2165},{"uri":"Costa_Mesa%2C_California","surface_form":"Costa Mesa, California","offset":2197},{"uri":"Lincoln_Center","surface_form":"Lincoln Center","offset":2318},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":2336},{"uri":"London_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"London Symphony Orchestra","offset":2432},{"uri":"Baton","surface_form":"baton","offset":2506},{"uri":"Toothpick","surface_form":"toothpick","offset":2519},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":2719},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":2731},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":3046},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":3118},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":3130},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":3205}]}
