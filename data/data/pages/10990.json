{"id":10990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering","text":"Aerospace engineering is a field of engineering that specializes in designing vehicles that move through air and/or space, namely aircraft or spacecraft. Aerospace engineering is a culmination of design, development and testing to produce top-notch civilian and military aircrafts and space crafts.\nAs with other fields of engineering, aerospace engineers (who design and oversee the repair of vehicles) must study for several years at a university or college and earn a degree that specializes in aerospace engineering. The course curriculum is designed to ensure critical thinking and inculcate problem-solving thinking for designing and testing aircrafts, missiles and space crafts. Aerospace engineer is responsible for devising project proposals to ensure financial and technical feasibility, ensuring effective progress of various phases in hardware development, integration and evaluation, testing and analyzing new applications for implementation in aerospace systems. Vet projects to ensure they meet the quality benchmark. Assess ongoing projects in terms of safety and feasibility to match desired objectives. Apart from the technical aspects, the job also has some managerial elements that are: Preparing risk assessment plans and elaborate strategic solutions and working on insightful and attractive presentations for prospective business contacts, clients and various stakeholders. Aerospace technicians (those who repair and construct vehicles) will complete a shorter technical course with 'on the job' training that equips them with the skills required to construct and repair said vehicles. Aerospace jobs include astronauts, pilots, and other professionals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":78},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":130},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":142},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":323},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":438},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":452},{"uri":"Degree_(school)","surface_form":"degree","offset":471},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":1344},{"uri":"Stakeholder","surface_form":"stakeholders","offset":1383},{"uri":"Astronaut","surface_form":"astronaut","offset":1633},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":1645},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":1663}]}
