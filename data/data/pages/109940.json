Mastodons became extinct about 11,000 years ago.\nMastodons, with mammoths, modern elephants and various older families, are members of the order Proboscidea. As adults they stood between 2.5 and 3 meters (8-10 feet) at the shoulder and weighed between 3500 and 5400 kilograms (4-6 tons).\nMastodons were browsers on leaves and branches, as shown by their molar teeth.\nRecent discovery.\nStone tools and bones from a butchered mastodon were found at the bottom of a river in Florida.
