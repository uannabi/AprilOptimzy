{"id":11009,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia","text":"Nova Scotia (); French pronunciation:) is a small province found on the east coast of Canada. The name \"Nova Scotia\" is Latin for \"New Scotland\". The capital and largest city is Halifax.\nPeople who live in Nova Scotia are called Nova Scotians. There are over 900,000 of them; over 400,000 of whom live in Halifax.\nWhat is now Nova Scotia used to be controlled by the Mik'maq Indians. The French settled among them at Port Royal after 1600, and called the land part of Acadia, with Port Royal as its capital. In 1710, after a war, the British captured Port Royal and went on to capture the rest of the peninsula. It was the first time that the British had captured and held a French colony.\nOn 6 December 1917, about 2,000 people were killed in the Halifax Explosion.\nNova Scotia's government is a democracy. Stephen McNeil is the premier and John James Grant is the lieutenant governor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":50},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":86},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":120},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":135},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":150},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":170},{"uri":"Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Halifax","offset":178},{"uri":"Mik%27maq","surface_form":"Mik'maq","offset":367},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":388},{"uri":"Port_Royal","surface_form":"Port Royal","offset":417},{"uri":"Acadia","surface_form":"Acadia","offset":468},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":525},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":534},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":601},{"uri":"French_colonial_empire","surface_form":"French colony","offset":675},{"uri":"Halifax_Explosion","surface_form":"Halifax Explosion","offset":748},{"uri":"Government_of_Canada","surface_form":"government","offset":781},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":797},{"uri":"Premier","surface_form":"premier","offset":830},{"uri":"Lieutenant_governor","surface_form":"lieutenant governor","offset":866}]}
