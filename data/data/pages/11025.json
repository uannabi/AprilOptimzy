{"id":11025,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder","text":"A cylinder is one of the most basic curved three dimensional geometric shapes, with the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given line segment, known as the axis of the cylinder. The shape can be thought of as a circular prism. Both the surface and the solid shape created inside can be called a \"cylinder\". The surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since ancient times.\nIn differential geometry, a cylinder is defined more broadly as a ruled surface which is spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines. A cylinder whose cross section is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder, or hyperbolic cylinder respectively.\nCommon use.\nFor a given volume, the cylinder with the smallest surface area has. For a given surface area, the cylinder with the largest volume has, i.e. the cylinder fits in a cube (height = diameter).\nVolume.\nHaving a right circular cylinder with a height units and a base of radius units with the coordinate axes chosen so that the origin is at the center of one base and the height is measured along the positive x-axis. A plane section at a distance of units from the origin has an area of square units where\nAn element of volume, is a right cylinder of base area square units and a thickness of units. Thus if \"V\" cubic units is the volume of the right circular cylinder, by Riemann sums,\nUsing cylindrical coordinates, the volume can be calculated by integration over\nCylindric section.\nCylindric sections are the intersections of cylinders with planes. For a right circular cylinder, there are four possibilities. A plane tangent to the cylinder, meets the cylinder in a single straight line. Moved while parallel to itself, the plane either does not intersect the cylinder or intersects it in two parallel lines. All other planes intersect the cylinder in an ellipse or, when they are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, in a circle.\nOther types of cylinders.\nThis equation is for an elliptic cylinder, a generalization of the ordinary, circular cylinder (). Even more general is the generalized cylinder: the cross-section can be any curve.\nThe cylinder is a \"degenerate quadric\" because at least one of the coordinates (in this case) does not appear in the equation.\nAn oblique cylinder has the top and bottom surfaces displaced from one another.\nProjective geometry.\nIn projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity.\nThis is useful in the definition of degenerate conics, which require considering the cylindrical conics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometric","surface_form":"geometric","offset":61},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":88},{"uri":"Line_segment","surface_form":"line segment","offset":150},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circular","offset":232},{"uri":"Prism","surface_form":"prism","offset":241},{"uri":"Surface_area","surface_form":"surface area","offset":332},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":353},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":427},{"uri":"Parallel","surface_form":"parallel","offset":537},{"uri":"Cross_section_(geometry)","surface_form":"cross section","offset":570},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"ellipse","offset":590},{"uri":"Parabola","surface_form":"parabola","offset":599},{"uri":"Hyperbola","surface_form":"hyperbola","offset":612},{"uri":"Riemann_sums","surface_form":"Riemann sums","offset":1392},{"uri":"Cross_section_(geometry)","surface_form":"cross-section","offset":2137},{"uri":"Quadric","surface_form":"quadric","offset":2199},{"uri":"Projective_geometry","surface_form":"projective geometry","offset":2400},{"uri":"Cone_(geometry)","surface_form":"cone","offset":2444},{"uri":"Apex_(geometry)","surface_form":"apex","offset":2455}]}
