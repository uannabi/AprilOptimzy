He named it after Axel Heiberg, manager of the Norwegian Ringnes brewery which sponsored the expedition. Other explorers visited the island during the early 20th century, during which time it was claimed by Norway until 1930. It is now part of Nunavut, Canada.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics_Canada","surface_form":"Statistics Canada","offset":106},{"uri":"1_E10_m%C2%B2","surface_form":"43\u00A0178\u00A0km\u00B2","offset":143},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Inuit","offset":181},{"uri":"Otto_Sverdrup","surface_form":"Otto Sverdrup","offset":296},{"uri":"Ringnes","surface_form":"Ringnes","offset":397},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":547},{"uri":"Nunavut","surface_form":"Nunavut","offset":584}]}
