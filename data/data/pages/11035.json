{"id":11035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII","text":"Louis XIII (27 September 1601 \u2013 14 May 1643) was King of France from 1610 to 1643. He was the son of Henry IV and Marie de' Medici. He lived during the time of the Thirty Years War and had to deal with many rebellions. He was proud of his country, and tried to encourage French artists to stay in France instead of going off to Italy. He did this by giving them work in the Louvre.\nAlthough he was married, many people thought that he would never produce an heir. Then, after 23 years of marriage, his wife Anne gave birth to a baby boy. He was to become King Louis XIV of France.\nHe died of Crohn's disease in 1643 and was later buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis, France. His oldest son would succeed him on the throne.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":49},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":57},{"uri":"1610","surface_form":"1610","offset":69},{"uri":"1643","surface_form":"1643","offset":77},{"uri":"Henri_IV_of_France","surface_form":"Henry IV","offset":101},{"uri":"Thirty_Years_War","surface_form":"Thirty Years War","offset":164},{"uri":"Rebellion","surface_form":"rebellion","offset":207},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":278},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":328},{"uri":"Louvre","surface_form":"Louvre","offset":374},{"uri":"Heir","surface_form":"heir","offset":458},{"uri":"Boy","surface_form":"boy","offset":533},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":560},{"uri":"Crohn%27s_disease","surface_form":"Crohn's disease","offset":592},{"uri":"Royal_Basilica_of_Saint_Denis","surface_form":"Royal Basilica of Saint Denis","offset":644},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":675}]}
