Its capital is Moca.\nThe province was created on 1885. It was part of the La Vega province until it was made a province.\nName.\nThe province was named after \"Ulises Francisco Espaillat\" who was President of the Dominican Republic for a short period of time (April 1876 - October 1876).\nLocation.\nThe Espaillat province is bordered to the east by the province of Hermanas Mirabal, to the south by La Vega, to the west by the Santiago and Puerto Plata provinces.

Before 1885, when the province was made, the southern part of the present province was part of La Vega province and the northern part was of the Puerto Plata province.\nWhen the province was made in 1885, it had the land of the present provinces of Hermanas Mirabal, Duarte and Mar\u00EDa Trinidad S\u00E1nchez provinces and the southern part of the present Espaillat province. But when the Duarte province was made in 1896, the Espaillat province lost most of the land east of the Hermanas Mirabal province; in 1945, the land north of the \"Cordillera Septentrional\" was added to the Espaillat province.\nIn 1952, the Salcedo province (now Hermanas Mirabal province) was made and the Espaillat province kept the land that it has now, with some parts to the south of the Cordillera Septentrional and other parts to the north of it. The province had two municipalities: Moca, its capital, and Gaspar Hern\u00E1ndez. Cayetano Germos\u00E9n became a municipality of the province in 1987 and Jamao al Norte in 2001.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Espaillat province, and 105,187 () living in towns and cities.

They are, from north to south: the Atlantic coastal plains close to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cordillera Septentrional and the Cibao Valley.\nThree main roads go through this province. One goes along the Atlantic coast; it goes from Puerto Plata to Saman\u00E1.\nA second road comes from the south, from La Vega province and, when it gets to Moca, turns to the west to Santiago de los Caballeros. This is the old \"Carretera Duarte\" (Duarte National Road) but from Concepci\u00F3n de la Vega to Santiago de los Caballeros the \"Duarte Highway\" is used by most people, without going through Moca.\nThe third road begins in Moca and goes to the provinces to the east.\nMountains.\nThe Cordillera Septentrional (\"Northern mountain chain\") is in the north central part of the province but the mountains here are not very high.
