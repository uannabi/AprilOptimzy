{"id":110373,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop","text":"A drop is a small bit of liquid, such as water, which is held together by surface tension.\nIt is normally thought of as falling.\nSomething that is dropping can sometimes be called dripping.\nDrops are often circular in shape, and sometimes when light is refracted through them, it makes a rainbow effect. Rain is an example of when drops fall. Drops are also like bubbles, except they hold liquid instead of a gas, like air.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":25},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":41},{"uri":"Surface_tension","surface_form":"surface tension","offset":74},{"uri":"Drip","surface_form":"dripping","offset":180},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circular","offset":206},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":244},{"uri":"Refraction","surface_form":"refracted","offset":253},{"uri":"Rainbow","surface_form":"rainbow","offset":288},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"Rain","offset":304},{"uri":"Liquid_bubble","surface_form":"bubbles","offset":363},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":389},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":409},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":419}]}
