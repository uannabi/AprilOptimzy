{"id":11039,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Frances_Brandon","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lady Frances Brandon (16 July 1517\u201320 November 1559) was the daughter of Mary Tudor and Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. She was married to Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk and had three daughters: Jane, Mary and Katherine. Her daughter Jane became the Queen of England for nine days.\nLife.\nFrances Brandon was a cruel, abusive mother to her children and a bold wife to her husband, Henry Grey. She had spent her childhood with her mother and was very close to Catherine of Aragon, so she was against Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn. In 1533, she married Henry Grey and soon she had two children who died young before having Lady Jane Grey in 1537, Katherine in 1540, and Mary in 1545.\nIn 1554, just weeks after her daughter Lady Jane Grey's and her husband Henry Grey's execution, Frances married again. This time it was to Adrian Stokes. Many people were shocked about this marriage, because Adrian was far below Frances's status. Historians believe that Frances was pregnant at the time of their marriage because she gave birth to a child about six months later. This child did not survive and Frances had two others. None of these last three children lived past a year.\nDeath.\nFrances became increasingly large similar to her great-uncle Henry VIII. Because of this, she died in 1559 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mary_Tudor%2C_Queen_of_France","surface_form":"Mary Tudor","offset":86},{"uri":"Charles_Brandon%2C_Duke_of_Suffolk","surface_form":"Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk","offset":101},{"uri":"Henry_Gray%2C_Duke_of_Suffolk","surface_form":"Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk","offset":154},{"uri":"Lady_Jane_Grey","surface_form":"Jane","offset":207},{"uri":"Lady_Mary_Grey","surface_form":"Mary","offset":213},{"uri":"Lady_Katherine_Grey","surface_form":"Katherine","offset":222},{"uri":"Queen_of_England","surface_form":"Queen of England","offset":262},{"uri":"Henry_Grey","surface_form":"Henry Grey","offset":772},{"uri":"Adrian_Stokes","surface_form":"Adrian Stokes","offset":839},{"uri":"Henry_VIII","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":1256},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":1320}]}
