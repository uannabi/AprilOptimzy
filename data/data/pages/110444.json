{"id":110444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallimimus","text":"Gallimimus (chicken mimic) was a fast-running dinosaur. It had a long, thin, flattened, toothless, horny beak, a small head, and a relatively large brain. \"Gallimimus\" lived in the Upper Cretaceous, about 75-70 million years ago.\nDescription.\nThe bottom front part of its beak was shaped like a shovel. It had large eyes positioned on opposite sites of its head, ruling out binocular vision (depth perception). It had a long neck, long tail, and long legs. Gallimimus was about 13-20 ft (4-6 m) long, was 6.3 ft (1.9 m) tall at the hips, and may have weighed about 970 pounds (440 kg).\nThese were were probably among the fastest of all dinosaurs. Like many other coelurosaurs, the ornithomimid hide was probably feathered rather than scaly.\nIn popular culture.\nThe dinosaur appeared on-screen, in the motion picture Jurassic Park.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":12},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":46},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":119},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":148},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":181},{"uri":"Shovel","surface_form":"shovel","offset":295},{"uri":"Coelurosaur","surface_form":"coelurosaur","offset":663},{"uri":"Jurassic_Park","surface_form":"Jurassic Park","offset":816}]}
