{"id":11054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine","text":"e=\"preserve\">Eleanor of Aquitaine (c. 1122 \u2013 March 31, 1204) was the daughter of William X of Aquitaine. She had a younger sister called Petronilla of Aquitaine. She brought the province of Aquitaine to England when she married Henry II of England. It stayed under English control for 300 years.\nLife.\nThe marriage was later annulled, as there were no male children.\nEleanor was greatly known for her work in the Second Crusade, for she inspired many people to join.\nEleanor supported a revolt by her children against their father's rule in 1173. This revolt was unsuccessful, and King Henry II was so furious that he locked her away in a prison. In 1189, after King Henry II died and her son, Richard, came to be the king, Eleanor was freed. Shortly after, Richard died so she supported her son John to take the English throne against the claim of her grandson Arthur of Brittany. In 1202 during the campaign at Mairebeau, she continued to thwart Arthur. Emerging triumphant, Eleanor retired to a monastery. She died there on April 1, 1204.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"William_X_of_Aquitaine","surface_form":"William X of Aquitaine","offset":81},{"uri":"Petronilla_of_Aquitaine","surface_form":"Petronilla of Aquitaine","offset":137},{"uri":"Aquitaine","surface_form":"Aquitaine","offset":190},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":203},{"uri":"Henry_II_of_England","surface_form":"Henry II of England","offset":228},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":306},{"uri":"Annulled","surface_form":"annulled","offset":325},{"uri":"Second_Crusade","surface_form":"Second Crusade","offset":413},{"uri":"Arthur_of_Brittany","surface_form":"Arthur of Brittany","offset":862}]}
