{"id":110632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_cheese","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pecorino cheese (or simply Pecorino) is the name for a few kinds of Italian cheeses made of sheep milk. The word \"pecora\", from which the name derives, means \"sheep\". Most of these cheeses are aged for some time. They taste rather salty.\nPecorino Romano is probably the best known outside Italy, especially in the United States. The cheese has been exported to the United States since the 19th century. Most Pecorino Romano is produced on the island of Sardinia, though its production is also allowed in Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto.\nPecorino Sardo also comes from Sardinia. It is milder. Pecorino Toscano is from Tuscany, Pecorino Siciliano (or ' in Sicilian) from Sicily and Pecorino di Filiano from Basilicata. All come in a variety of styles depending on how long they have been matured. The more matured cheeses, referred to as ', are harder and have a stronger flavour. Sometimes, the cheeses are made with spices. In Sardinia, the larvae of the cheese fly are intentionally introduced into \"Pecorino Sardo\" to produce a local delicacy called \"casu marzu\".\nPecorino Romano is most often used on pasta dishes, like the better-known Parmigiano Reggiano (parmesan). Its distinctive strong, very salty flavour means that it is preferred for some pasta dishes with highly-flavoured sauces, especially those of Roman origin, such as \"pasta all'amatriciana\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":81},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":89},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":105},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":111},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":302},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":327},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":402},{"uri":"Sardinia","surface_form":"Sardinia","offset":466},{"uri":"Lazio","surface_form":"Lazio","offset":517},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscan","offset":534},{"uri":"Province_of_Grosseto","surface_form":"Province of Grosseto","offset":541},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":643},{"uri":"Sicilian_language","surface_form":"Sicilian","offset":680},{"uri":"Basilicata","surface_form":"Basilicata","offset":731},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spice","offset":942},{"uri":"Sardinia","surface_form":"Sardinia","offset":953},{"uri":"Cheese_fly","surface_form":"cheese fly","offset":981},{"uri":"Casu_marzu","surface_form":"casu marzu","offset":1079},{"uri":"Parmigiano_Reggiano","surface_form":"Parmigiano Reggiano","offset":1166},{"uri":"Parmesan","surface_form":"parmesan","offset":1187},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":1227}]}
