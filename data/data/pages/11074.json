For nearly 300 years, it was the capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. Some famous ancient Greek scientists, such as Euclid of Alexandria and Eratosthenes, lived there or studied there. It was home to the largest library in the ancient Western world, the Library of Alexandria.\nIt was a wealthy city in its heyday, and remained the main way Egyptian grain went by sea to Ancient Rome. Rome depended greatly on Egyptian grain. Much of Alexandria sank below the sea in the 4th century. Some of her history is in the Mediterranean.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, they did not want to have their capital at Alexandria, because it was too far away from Arabia. So the Islamic invaders made a new capital on the east side of the Nile, and called it Fustat. Alexandria became less important.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":12},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":54},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":62},{"uri":"Alexander_the_Great","surface_form":"Alexander the Great","offset":87},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":161},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":217},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":300},{"uri":"Stadia","surface_form":"stadia","offset":323},{"uri":"Wikimania","surface_form":"Wikimania","offset":449},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":486},{"uri":"Alexander_the_Great","surface_form":"Alexander the Great","offset":525},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":606},{"uri":"Ptolemaic_dynasty","surface_form":"Ptolemaic dynasty","offset":621},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":661},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":675},{"uri":"Euclid_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Euclid of Alexandria","offset":695},{"uri":"Eratosthenes","surface_form":"Eratosthenes","offset":720},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"Western world","offset":814},{"uri":"Library_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Library of Alexandria","offset":833},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":949},{"uri":"4th_century","surface_form":"4th century","offset":1049},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":1117},{"uri":"Arabia","surface_form":"Arabia","offset":1241},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":1316},{"uri":"Fustat","surface_form":"Fustat","offset":1336}]}
