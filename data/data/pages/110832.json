{"id":110832,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin","text":"Ursula Kroeber Le Guin () (October 21, 1929 \u2013 January 22, 2018) was an American writer. She wrote books, poetry, children's books, essays, short stories, fantasy and science fiction.\nEarly life: California.\nUrsula K. Le Guin was born Ursula Kroeber in Berkeley, California, on October 21, 1929. Her father, Alfred Louis Kroeber (1876\u20131960), was an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Le Guin's mother, Theodora Kroeber (1897\u20131979; born Theodora Covel Kracaw), had a graduate degree in psychology. She started writing in her sixties and became a successful author. Her best known work was \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" (1961). This was a biography of Ishi, an indigenous American who was the last known member of the Yahi tribe.\nUrsula had three older brothers: Karl, Theodore, and Clifton. The family had a large collection of books. Ursula and her brothers all liked to read when they were young. Le Guin read science fiction and fantasy. She and her brothers often read issues of \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" and \"Astounding Science Fiction\". She liked myths and legends. She especially liked Norse mythology and Native American legends that her father would tell her.\nMany people visited the Kroeber family. Some of the visitors were well-known academics such as Robert Oppenheimer. Le Guin used Oppenheimer as the model for her lead character in \"The Dispossessed\", a physicist named Shevek. The family lived in a summer home in the Napa valley and a house in Berkeley during the school year.\nEducation.\nLe Guin studied at Berkeley High School. She graduated with another student who became a famous science fiction author, Philip K. Dick. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Renaissance French and Italian literature from Radcliffe College in 1951. She was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Le Guin then studied at Columbia University, and earned a Master of Arts in French in 1952. Soon after, she began a Ph.D. program. She won a Fulbright grant to continue her studies in France from 1953 to 1954. Later, Le Guin also received Fulbright grants to travel to London in 1968 and 1975.\nFrance.\nIn 1953, while traveling to France aboard the \"Queen Mary\", Ursula met historian Charles Le Guin. Charles was also a Fulbright Scholar. They got married in Paris in December 1953. They returned to the United States in 1954.\nMarriage and children.\nLe Guin said that getting married meant she had to stop studying for her doctorate degree. While her husband finished his doctorate at Emory University in Georgia, and later at the University of Idaho, Le Guin taught French and worked as a secretary until the birth of her daughter Elisabeth in 1957. The couple had another daughter, Caroline, and a son, Theodore (born 1964).\nReturn to the West Coast: Portland.\nIn 1959 Charles became a history instructor at Portland State University, so they moved to Portland, Oregon. They lived there for the rest of their lives.\nWriting life.\nShe first wrote in the 1960s. She was awarded many Hugo and Nebula awards. Her agent was Virgina Kidd.\nShe was given the Gandalf Award in 1979 and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Grand Master Award in 2003. She got eighteen Locus Awards, more than any other writer. Her book \"The Farthest Shore\" won the National Book Award for Children's Books in 1973.\nLe Guin was the Professional Guest of Honor at the 1975 World Science Fiction Convention in Melbourne, Australia. She got the Library of Congress \"Living Legends\" award in the \"Writers and Artists\" area in April 2000 for her additions to America's cultural history. In 2004, Le Guin was the was given the Association for Library Service to Children's May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award.\nDeath.\nLe Guin died on January 22, 2018, at her home in Portland. She was 88 years old. Her son said that she had been sick for several months. He said that she probably had a heart attack. There was a private memorial service for her in Portland. There was also a public memorial service in June 2018. At this service, many writers gave speeches, including: Margaret Atwood, Molly Gloss, and Walidah Imarisha\nPolitical Freedom.\nIn 1975, Le Guin won a Nebula Award for her story \"The Diary of the Rose.\" She did not accept the award. This was a protest against the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. The SFWA had recently canceled Stanis\u0142aw Lem's membership in the group. Le Guin believed they kicked Lem out because he criticized American science fiction and chose to live in the Soviet Union, She said she could not take an award for a story about an unfree society from a writers' group that did not protect freedom.\nReligion.\nLe Guin said she was did not learn any religion and was not taught to be religious as a child. But, she became very interested in Taoism and Buddhism. She said that Taoism was a tool to help her understand her life as a teenager and young adult. In 1997 she published a translation of the \"Tao Te Ching\".\nAuthor's rights.\nIn December 2009, Le Guin quit the Authors Guild. She did this to protest the Guild's agreement with the Google's book digitization project. \"You decided to deal with the devil\", she wrote in her letter when she quit. She wrote that they had given control over authors' rights and copyright to a company for nothing. Le Guin made a speech at the 2014 National Book Awards. She explained that Amazon's control over the publishing industry was bad and dangerous. She was especially concerned about how Amazon blocked the Hachette Book Group from selling all books because the companies disagreed about how to sell ebooks. The speech was broadcast twice by National Public Radio. And, many other news organizations reported on it around the world.\nEarly writing-1951-1968.\nLe Guin's first published work was in her fictional country called Orsinia. These were a poem and a short story. The poem, \"Folksong from the Montayna Province,\" was published in 1959. The short story was \"An die Musik\", in 1961. Between 1951 and 1961 she also wrote five novels that all happened in Orsinia. But, publishers did not want them because they thought they were hard to read or understand. Some of her poetry from the 1950s was published in 1975 in a book called \"Wild Angels\". Le Guin was rejected by many publishers. Then she turned to science fiction because she knew that clearly labeled SF would sell well. Her first professional SF publication was the short story \"April in Paris\" in 1962 in \"Fantastic Science Fiction\". Seven more stories followed in the next few years, in \"Fantastic\" or \"Amazing Stories\". One of them was \"The Dowry of the Angyar\", which introduced the fictional Hainish universe, Two more were \"The Rule of Names\" and \"The Word of Unbinding\". These introduced the world of Earthsea. Most critics ignored these stories.\nLe Guin published her first novel in 1966. It was called \"Rocannon's World\". Ace Books published it. Two more Hainish novels, \"Planet of Exile\" and \"City of Illusions\" were published in 1966 and 1967. These three books became the Hainish trilogy. The first two were each published as half of an \"Ace Double\": two novels bound into a paperback and sold as a single low-cost volume. \"City of Illusions\" was published as a standalone volume. Le Guin was getting greater name-recognition. Critics paid more attention to these books than to Le Guin's short stories. Several science fiction magazines reviewed them, but the critical response was still muted. The books had many themes and ideas also present in Le Guin's better known later works, including the \"archetypal journey\" of a protagonist who undertakes both a physical journey and one of self-discovery, cultural contact and communication, the search for identity, and the reconciliation of opposing forces.\nGetting more attention.\nLe Guin's next two books in 1968 and 1969 brought her much more attention and praise. The Wizard of Earthsea in 1968 was a young adult fantasy novel. The Left Hand of Darkness in 1969 started her Hainish universe, explored sexuality, and won awards. These two books changed Le Guin's career and made her a major writer. \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" and \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" have been described by critic Harold Bloom as Le Guin's masterpieces.\nLe Guin had not planned to write for young adults. But, the editor of Parnassus Press asked her to write a novel for young people. He thought they could sell many books to that group. \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" published in 1968. It was a fantasy coming of age story for teenagers. In the book, Le Guin created a fictional archipelago called Earthsea. She also created the first wizarding school. Readers and reviewers in the US and the UK liked the book very much.\nHer next novel was \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" in 1969 showed the strength of her writing and won awards. It was in her Hainish universe on a fictional planet where humans have no fixed sex. Le Guin explored experiences of gender and sexuality. The book was Le Guin's first about feminist issues. The book shocked and surprised science fiction critics. It won both the Hugo and the Nebula Awards for best novel. Le Guin the first woman to win these awards.\nFor the next couple of years in the 1970s, Le Guin continued and extended the work she had started.\nLe Guin continued to develop themes of equilibrium and coming-of-age in the next two installments of the \"Earthsea\" series, \"The Tombs of Atuan\" and \"The Farthest Shore\", published in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Both books were praised for their writing, while the exploration of death as a theme in \"The Farthest Shore\" also drew praise.\nShe won the Hugo Award again in 1973 for \"The Word for World is Forest\". The book was influenced by Le Guin's anger over the Vietnam War, and explored themes of colonialism and militarism: Le Guin later described it as the \"most overt political statement\" she had made in a fictional work.\nHer 1974 novel \"The Dispossessed\" again won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards for best novel, making her the first person to win both awards for each of two books. Also set in the Hainish universe, the story explored anarchism and utopianism. Scholar Charlotte Spivack said Le Guin was making her science fiction writing more about discussing political ideas.\nSeveral of her speculative fiction short stories from the period, including her first published story, were later anthologized in the 1975 collection \"The Wind's Twelve Quarters\". The fiction of the period 1966 to 1974, which also included \"The Lathe of Heaven\", the Hugo Award-winning \"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\" and the Nebula Award-winning \"The Day Before the Revolution\", constitutes Le Guin's best-known body of work.\nLater writing.\nLe Guin published the novel \"Lavinia\" in 2008. Lavinia is a character from Virgil's \"Aeneid\",\nThe \"Annals of the Western Shore\" was a series of three books: \"Gifts\" (2004), \"Voices\" (2006), and \"Powers\" (2007). Each book has a different main character and happens in a different place. But, the books all share some characters and places.\"Gifts\" won the PEN Center USA 2005 Children's literature award. \"Powers\" won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2009.\nNear the end of her life, Le Guin wrote less fiction. She wrote essays, poems, and some translations. Her last publications included the non-fiction collections \"Dreams Must Explain Themselves\" and \"Ursula K Le Guin: Conversations on Writing\". She also wrote a book of poetry called \"So Far So Good: Final Poems 2014\u20132018\". These were released after she died.\nInfluences.\nMany other writiers influenced Le Guin.\nCultural anthropology was important to her writing.\nCarl Jung's archetypes may be seen in her work.\nTaoism was part of Le Guin's life and work.\nPolitical systems.\nThe story of \"The Dispossessed\" happens on twin planets called Urras and Anarres. Urras was richer than Anarres. But Anarres is more advanced ethically and morally. Sttlers from Urras planned the Anarres society. It is an anarcho-socialist society that is an \"ambiguous utopia\". Anarres society is neither perfect nor static, unlike classical utopias. The main character, Shevek, travels to Urras to do research. Urras society is authoritarian, hierarchical, and misogynistic. But these the anarchists on Anarres do not have those problems. In their society cooperation and individual liberty are most important.\nReception.\nLe Guin became popular and got good reviews quickly after publishing \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" in 1969. She was very well known among SF writers by the 1970s. Readers bought millions of her books. And, her writing was translated into more than 40 languages. Some of her books stayed in print many decades after their first publication. Academics studied her work carefully and discussed it often. Later in her career, mainstream literary critics wrote positively about her work. In an obituary, Jo Walton said that Le Guin \"was so good that the mainstream couldn't dismiss SF any more\".\nLe Guin earliest work stayed the most popular and got the most recognition. A reviewer in 2018 said that she often lectured the reader in her later works. John Clute, wrote in \"The Guardian\", that she felt responsible for explaining important things clearly, and that this was difficult for her. Some critics disliked some of her work. \"The Compass Rose\" had a mixed reaction. Even the critically well-received \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" was criticized by some feminists.\nOther authors liked her work. According to Zadie Smith, her prose was \"as elegant and beautiful as any written in the twentieth century\". After Le Guin's death in 2018, writer Michael Chabon called her the \"greatest American writer of her generation\", and said that she had \"awed [him] with the power of an unfettered imagination\". Author Margaret Atwood praised Le Guin's \"sane, smart, crafty and lyrical voice\", and wrote that social injustice was a powerful motivation through Le Guin's life. Literary critic Harold Bloom described Le Guin as an \"exquisite stylist\", saying that in her writing, \"Every word was exactly in place and every sentence or line had resonance\". According to Bloom, Le Guin was a \"visionary who set herself against all brutality, discrimination, and exploitation\".\nAcademic and author Joyce Carol Oates highlighted Le Guin's \"outspoken sense of justice, decency, and common sense\", and called her \"one of the great American writers and a visionary artist whose work will long endure\". China Mi\u00E9ville described Le Guin as a \"literary colossus\", and wrote that she was a \"writer of intense ethical seriousness and intelligence, of wit and fury, of radical politics, of subtlety, of freedom and yearning\".\nPraise for Le Guin frequently focused on the social and political themes her work explored. \"The New York Times\" described her as using \"a lean but lyrical style\" to explore issues of moral relevance. In the introduction to an interview in 2008, \"Vice\" magazine described Le Guin as having written \"some of the more mind-warping sf and fantasy tales of the past 40 years\".\nAwards and recognition.\nLe Guin won many annual awards for individual works. She was nominated for Hugo Awards twenty-four times and won seven times. She won six Nebula Awards from eighteen nominations. Four of her Nebula Awards were for Best Novel, more than any other writer. Le Guin won twenty-two Locus Awards. Her third Earthsea novel, \"The Farthest Shore\", won the 1973 National Book Award for Young People's Literature, She was a finalist for ten Mythopoeic Awards, nine in Fantasy and one for Scholarship. Her 1996 collection \"Unlocking the Air and Other Stories\" was one of three finalists for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Other awards won by Le Guin include three James Tiptree Jr. Awards, two World Fantasy Awards, and three Jupiter Awards. She won her final Hugo and Locus awards in the year of her death, for the essay collection \"No Time to Spare: Thinking About What Matters\", and an anthology of the Hainish cycle, respectively.\nOther awards were for Le Guin's contributions to speculative fiction. She was voted a Gandalf Grand Master Award by the World Science Fiction Society in 1979. The Science Fiction Research Association gave her its Pilgrim Award in 1989 for her \"lifetime contributions to SF and fantasy scholarship\". At the 1995 World Fantasy Convention she won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. She became a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2001. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made her its 20th Grand Master in 2003. She was the second, and as of 2019, one of only six women to receive that honor. In 2010, Le Guin was awarded the Lyman Tower Sargent Distinguished Scholar Award by the North American Society for Utopian Studies. In 2013, she was given the Eaton Award by the University of California, Riverside, for lifetime achievement in science fiction.\nLater in her career Le Guin was also recognized her contributions to literature more generally. In April 2000 the U.S. Library of Congress made Le Guin a Living Legend in the \"Writers and Artists\" category for her significant contributions to America's cultural heritage. The American Library Association granted her the annual Margaret Edwards Award in 2004, and also selected her to deliver the annual May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture. The Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work: the 2004 panel cited the first four \"Earthsea\" volumes, \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" and \"The Beginning Place\". The panel said that Le Guin \"has inspired four generations of young adults to read beautifully constructed language, visit fantasy worlds that inform them about their own lives, and think about their ideas that are neither easy nor inconsequential\". At its 2009 convention, the Freedom From Religion Foundation awarded the Emperor Has No Clothes Award to Le Guin. A collection of Le Guin's works was published by the Library of America in 2016, an honor only rarely given to living writers. The National Book Foundation awarded Le Guin its Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, stating that she had \"defied conventions of narrative, language, character, and genre, and transcended boundaries between fantasy and realism to forge new paths for literary fiction\". The American Academy of Arts and Letters made her a member in 2017.\nLegacy and influence.\nLe Guin strongly influenced the field of speculative fiction. Jo Walton argued that Le Guin was important in both making the genre more open and accepting of new ideas, and in helping genre writers get mainstream success. \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" introduced the idea of a \"wizard school\", which would later be made more famous by the \"Harry Potter\" series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in \"Harry Potter\".\nLe Guin created the word \"ansible\" for an instantaneous interstellar communication device in 1966. Several other writers, including Orson Scott Card and Neil Gaiman, used the word later. The notion that names can exert power is also present in Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film \"Spirited Away\"; critics have suggested that that idea started with Le Guin's Earthsea series.\nAdaptations of her work.\nLe Guin's works have been adapted for radio, film, television, and theater.\nMovies.\nHer 1971 novel \"The Lathe of Heaven\" has been adapted twice, in 1979 by WNET with Le Guin's participation, and the in 2002 by the A&E Network. In a 2008 interview, she said 1979 adaptation is \"the only good adaptation to\" a movie of her work to date. In the early 1980s Hayao Miyazaki asked to create an animated adaptation of Earthsea. Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and anime in general, initially turned down the offer, but later accepted after seeing \"My Neighbor Totoro\". The third and fourth Earthsea books were used as the basis of \"Tales from Earthsea\", released in 2006. Miyazaki's son, Gor\u014D Miyazaki directed the movie, not Hayao Miyazaki himself. Le Guin was disappointed by the change. Le Guin was positive about how the movie looked. She wrote that \"much of it was beautiful\", but she did not like the moral sense of the movie. She disliked the physical violence, especially the death of a villain as the movie's ending. In 2004 the Sci Fi Channel adapted the first two books of the Earthsea trilogy as the miniseries \"Legend of Earthsea\". Le Guin was highly critical of the adaptation, calling it a \"far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned\", objecting to the use of white actors for her red-, brown-, or black-skinned characters.\nTheater.\nLe Guin's novel \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" and novella \"Paradises Lost\" have both been adapted for theater. In 1995, Chicago's Lifeline Theatre presented its adaptation of \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". Reviewer Jack Helbig at the Chicago Reader wrote that the \"adaptation is intelligent and well crafted but ultimately unsatisfying\", mainly because it is extremely difficult to compress a complex 300-page novel into a two-hour stage presentation. She also said she was better pleased with stage adaptations, including \"Paradises Lost\", than screen adaptations of her work till date. In 2013, the Portland Playhouse and Hand2Mouth Theatre produced a stage adaptation of \"The Left Hand of Darkness\", directed and adapted by Jonathan Walters, with text adapted by John Schmor. The play opened May 2, 2013, and ran until June 16, 2013, in Portland, Oregon.\nOpera.\n\"Paradises Lost\" was adapted into an opera at the University of Illinois. The opera was composed by Stephen A. Taylor; the libretto has been attributed both to Kate Gale and to Marcia Johnson. Adapted in 2005, the opera premiered in April 2012. Le Guin described the effort as a \"beautiful opera\" in an interview, and expressed hopes that it would be picked up by other producers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":71},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":105},{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essay","offset":131},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short stories","offset":139},{"uri":"Fantasy","surface_form":"fantasy","offset":154},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":166},{"uri":"Berkeley%2C_California","surface_form":"Berkeley, California","offset":252},{"uri":"Alfred_L._Kroeber","surface_form":"Alfred Louis Kroeber","offset":307},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":348},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":370},{"uri":"Theodora_Kroeber","surface_form":"Theodora Kroeber","offset":424},{"uri":"Ishi_in_Two_Worlds","surface_form":"Ishi in Two Worlds","offset":611},{"uri":"Ishi","surface_form":"Ishi","offset":663},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"indigenous American","offset":672},{"uri":"Yahi","surface_form":"Yahi","offset":729},{"uri":"Karl_Kroeber","surface_form":"Karl","offset":774},{"uri":"Wonder_Stories","surface_form":"Thrilling Wonder Stories","offset":996},{"uri":"Astounding_Science_Fiction","surface_form":"Astounding Science Fiction","offset":1027},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":1066},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":1076},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":1106},{"uri":"Robert_Oppenheimer","surface_form":"Robert Oppenheimer","offset":1277},{"uri":"The_Dispossessed","surface_form":"The Dispossessed","offset":1362},{"uri":"Napa_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Napa valley","offset":1448},{"uri":"Berkeley_High_School_(California)","surface_form":"Berkeley High School","offset":1538},{"uri":"Philip_K._Dick","surface_form":"Philip K.
