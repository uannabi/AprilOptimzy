{"id":110923,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaurus","text":"\"Ichthyosaurus\" was an extinct marine reptile from the Lower Jurassic. It was the first member of the order Ichthyosauria to be discovered. The first complete skeleton was discovered in the early 19th century (1810/11) by Mary Anning in the Dorset Jurassic Coast. Many more specimens were found in Europe, especially from the limestone quarries in Holzmaden, southern Germany.\nIchthyosaurus lived from about 199 to 189 million years ago (mya).\nThis sleek animal could perhaps swim at speeds up to 25\u00A0mph (40 kph).\nLive birth.\n\"Ichthyosaurus\" bore live young. This we know from fossil evidence. It was thought at first that \"Ichthyosaurus\" laid eggs on land, but fossil evidence shows that the females gave birth to live young. Because they did, their life habit could be entirely aquatic. They were well-adapted to life as fully pelagic organisms because they never needed to come onto land. The babies were born tail first to prevent them from drowning in the water.\nHundreds of well-preserved, fossilised skeletons have been found in Jurassic rock at Holzmaden. Some of the bones were still articulated. Some fossils still had baby specimens inside them, indicating that \"Ichthyosaurus\" was viviparous. Similar finds in the related \"Stenopterygius\" also show this.\nFins.\nThe German fossils also featured the outline of \"Ichthyosaurus\" skin, showing it had a fleshy dorsal fin on its back and a large caudal fin. Other ichthyosaur fossils proved this feature was not limited to \"Ichthyosaurus\".\nSense organs.\n\"Ichthyosaurus\" ear bones were solid, probably transferring water vibrations to the inner ear. Still, hunting by sight was the creature's main feeding activity; it had huge, sensitive eyes, protected by bony shields.\nFeeding.\nCoprolites (fosillized excreta) of \"Ichthyosaurus\" show its diet consisted of fish and squid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":23},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":31},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":38},{"uri":"Lower_Jurassic","surface_form":"Lower Jurassic","offset":55},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":102},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"Ichthyosaur","offset":108},{"uri":"Mary_Anning","surface_form":"Mary Anning","offset":222},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":241},{"uri":"Jurassic_Coast","surface_form":"Jurassic Coast","offset":248},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":326},{"uri":"Holzmaden","surface_form":"Holzmaden","offset":348},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":368},{"uri":"Life_habit","surface_form":"life habit","offset":751},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":780},{"uri":"Pelagic","surface_form":"pelagic","offset":829},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":996},{"uri":"Viviparous","surface_form":"viviparous","offset":1193},{"uri":"Stenopterygius","surface_form":"Stenopterygius","offset":1235},{"uri":"Dorsal_fin","surface_form":"dorsal fin","offset":1367},{"uri":"Caudal_fin","surface_form":"caudal fin","offset":1402},{"uri":"Inner_ear","surface_form":"inner ear","offset":1594},{"uri":"Coprolite","surface_form":"Coprolite","offset":1736},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":1823}]}
