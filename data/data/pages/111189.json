{"id":111189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilcabamba%2C_Peru","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vilcabamba was founded by Manco Inca in 1539 and was the last city of the Inca Empire until it fell to the Spaniards in 1572. That meant the end of Inca resistance to Spanish rule.\nHistory.\nAfter the Incan empire fell, the city was burned and the area swiftly became a remote, not very populated or connected part of Peru. The location of Vilcabamba was forgotten.\nThe ruins of the city were rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1909 in a remote forest site 130\u00A0km west of Cuzco, but he failed to realize its significance, because he believed that Machu Picchu, which he also rediscovered, was the fabled \"Lost City of the Incas\". It was not until explorations and discoveries in the 1960s, that many came to see this site at Esp\u00EDritu Pampa as the real Vilcabamba of legend.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manco_Inca","surface_form":"Manco Inca","offset":39},{"uri":"Inca_Empire","surface_form":"Inca Empire","offset":87},{"uri":"Spaniard","surface_form":"Spaniard","offset":120},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":330},{"uri":"Cusco","surface_form":"Cuzco","offset":482},{"uri":"Machu_Picchu","surface_form":"Machu Picchu","offset":557}]}
