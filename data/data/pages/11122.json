{"id":11122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana","text":"Montana is a state in the United States. Its capital is Helena, and the largest city is Billings. Montana has many mountains in the western half of the state. Most of the eastern part of the state is prairie.\nMontana and Canada share a 545-mile (877-km) part of the world's longest undefended (which means there are no soldiers or armies on either side) border. The state borders the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, more provinces than any other U.S. state.\nTo the east of Montana is North Dakota; to the southeast is a short border with South Dakota. In the south is Wyoming, and on the west and southwest is Idaho.\nPolitics.\nAt one point, Montana was liberal in federal elections and conservative in state elections. Today, the opposite is true. Although Montana is very conservative in presidential elections (it has not voted for a Democrat since 1964), it is more liberal than most states in the upper Rocky Mountains region. As one example of this, Montana is represented by one Democrat and one Republican in the Senate. There are no Democratic senators from Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota or South Dakota. The Montana House of Representatives, which has 100 members, includes 58 Republicans and 42 Democrats, making it more liberal than any state legislature in Wyoming or Idaho.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":13},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":26},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":45},{"uri":"Helena%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Helena","offset":56},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":80},{"uri":"Billings%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Billings","offset":88},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":115},{"uri":"Prairie","surface_form":"prairie","offset":200},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":221},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":319},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"armies","offset":331},{"uri":"United_States-Canada_border","surface_form":"border","offset":354},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Canada","surface_form":"Canadian provinces","offset":384},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":406},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":424},{"uri":"Saskatchewan","surface_form":"Saskatchewan","offset":437},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":481},{"uri":"North_Dakota","surface_form":"North Dakota","offset":519},{"uri":"South_Dakota","surface_form":"South Dakota","offset":573},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":603},{"uri":"Idaho","surface_form":"Idaho","offset":645},{"uri":"Lyndon_B._Johnson","surface_form":"a Democrat","offset":869},{"uri":"1964_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"since 1964)","offset":880},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":942},{"uri":"Montana_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Montana House of Representatives,","offset":1157}]}
