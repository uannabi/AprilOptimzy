{"id":11132,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware","text":"Delaware () is a state in the United States. It is sometimes called the \"First State\" because it was the first colony to accept the new constitution in 1787. Its capital is Dover and its biggest city is Wilmington. It is the second smallest state in the United States.\nThe Dutch first settled Delaware. The Swedish then took over in the mid-1600s.\nGeography.\nDelaware is long and ranges from to across, totaling, making it the second-smallest state in the United States after Rhode Island. Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania; to the east by the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by Maryland.\nTopography.\nDelaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation. Its highest elevation, located at Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than above sea level.\nEnvironment.\nThe transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States. In the southern two-thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests. Trap Pond State Park, along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of bald cypress trees in North America.\nEnvironmental management.\nDelaware provides government subsidy support for the clean-up of property \"lightly contaminated\" by hazardous waste, the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.\nSister cities and states.\nDelaware's sister state in Japan is Miyagi Prefecture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":17},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":30},{"uri":"Thirteen_colonies","surface_form":"colony","offset":111},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":136},{"uri":"Dover%2C_Delaware","surface_form":"Dover","offset":173},{"uri":"Wilmington%2C_Delaware","surface_form":"Wilmington","offset":203},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":273},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":307},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":476},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":526},{"uri":"Delaware_River","surface_form":"Delaware River","offset":559},{"uri":"Delaware_Bay","surface_form":"Delaware Bay","offset":575},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":589},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":653},{"uri":"Ebright_Azimuth","surface_form":"Ebright Azimuth","offset":798},{"uri":"Concord_High_School_(Wilmington%2C_Delaware)","surface_form":"Concord High School","offset":820},{"uri":"Northeastern_coastal_forests","surface_form":"Northeastern coastal forests","offset":1005},{"uri":"Quercus","surface_form":"oak","offset":1044},{"uri":"Middle_Atlantic_coastal_forests","surface_form":"Middle Atlantic coastal forests","offset":1149},{"uri":"Trap_Pond_State_Park","surface_form":"Trap Pond State Park","offset":1182},{"uri":"Taxodium_distichum","surface_form":"bald cypress","offset":1302},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1324},{"uri":"Government_subsidy","surface_form":"government subsidy support","offset":1383},{"uri":"Environmental_remediation","surface_form":"clean-up","offset":1418},{"uri":"Hazardous_waste","surface_form":"hazardous waste","offset":1465},{"uri":"Miyagi_Prefecture","surface_form":"Miyagi Prefecture","offset":1613}]}
