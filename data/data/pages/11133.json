{"id":11133,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho","text":"Idaho is a state in the northwestern United States, and the 43rd admittance to the union.\nIdaho became a state in 1890, and it is the 11th largest state in land area, and the 14th largest in total area (land and water). Despite this, the population of Idaho was estimated at only 1,787,065 by the United States Census Bureau in 2019, making it ranked the 39th largest state by population.\nIdaho is bordered by Washington and Oregon on the west, Montana and Wyoming on the east, Utah and Nevada on the south and the country of Canada (British Columbia) on the north side. Idaho is known for its vast mountainous landscapes, and it is literally covered from north to south by the Rocky Mountains. Idaho is also home to the massive Snake River, which comes from the Grand Tetons in Wyoming and eventually flows to meld with the Columbia River in Washington state. This river dissects Hell's Canyon, the deepest gorge in America, which lies the state's Oregon border, and flows through south central Idaho. This river provides a fertile plain which is the base for most of the state's agricultural industries, and the production of the potatoes for which Idaho is known. Idaho's state nickname is the \"Gem State\", despite also being known as the \"Spud State\", because of a man named George M. Willing who claimed it was derived from a Shoshone term.\nIdaho's most prominent universities are Boise State University located in its capital, Idaho State University located in Pocatello, and the University of Idaho located in Moscow.\nIdaho's state motto is \"Esto perpetua\", which is Latin for \"Let it be forever\".\nHistory of Idaho.\nIdaho was formerly Idaho Territory, until July 27, 1890, when it became the 43rd state. In the 1930s, Idaho suffered a lot economically as as a result of the Great Depression. Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes was worth only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers\u00B4 annual income of $686 in 1929 fell to just $250 by 1932.\nPolitics.\nToday, Idaho is a very conservative state. In the 2016 election, just two counties in Idaho supported Hillary Clinton. Idaho as a whole last voted Democratic in 1964, and that by a narrow margin of less than 2 percent. Both of Idaho\u00B4s senators (Jim Risch and Mike Crapo) are Republican.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":11},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":37},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":410},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":445},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":478},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":487},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":526},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":534},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":678},{"uri":"Snake_River","surface_form":"Snake River","offset":729},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":779},{"uri":"Columbia_River","surface_form":"Columbia River","offset":825},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":843},{"uri":"George_M._Willing","surface_form":"George M.
