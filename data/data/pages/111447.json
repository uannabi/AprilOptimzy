They are not related to the water buffalo (which are a little bigger). Because of its aggressive behavior, it has not been domesticated like the domestic Asian water buffalo. It is related to the American bison, which are typically also referred to as simply \"buffalo.\"\nAppearance.\nThey can be up to 3.2 meters high, 6 meters long, and can weigh from 800-1200 kg. The males are bigger than the females. The African buffalo's power and size make it easy to defend itself. They have been known to kill hyenas, lions, and other wild predators, and sometimes even humans. The African buffalo is part of the African big five. The phrase \"big five\" was introduced by hunters. The big five are the hardest animals to hunt, and the African buffalo is considered the most dangerous.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bovine","surface_form":"bovine","offset":46},{"uri":"Hoof","surface_form":"hoof","offset":61},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":68},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":419},{"uri":"Defend","surface_form":"defend","offset":571},{"uri":"Hyena","surface_form":"hyena","offset":615},{"uri":"Lion","surface_form":"lion","offset":623},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":645},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":675},{"uri":"African_big_five","surface_form":"African big five","offset":718},{"uri":"Hunters","surface_form":"hunters","offset":776}]}
