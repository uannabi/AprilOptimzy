{"id":111464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">Philosophy of language is the study of how languages were created and are used. It is part of Linguistics. In continental philosophy, it is not treated as a subject by itself, but Ludwig Wittgenstein and other analytic philosophers placed particular stress on it.\nAncient Greek.\nPlato was the first philosopher we know was interested in philosophy of language (although his teacher Socrates probably was too). He believed that the smallest parts of words (phonemes) had meaning even if they were outside the words they are in. This is not a very good theory, and Plato understood that there were things wrong with it. The Stoics also made a complicated philosophy of language.\nThe Middle Ages.\nThe medieval scholars, such as William Occam also were interested in philosophy of language. Occam was the first philosopher to think about the possibility of a mental language. He also discussed how a word can refer to both its meaning and the actual word itself.\nModernity.\nPhilosophy of language only became more popular in the twentieth century, when Ferdinand de Saussure wrote his book Course in general linguistics. Since then, philosophy of language has played an important part in philosophy as a whole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"Linguistics","offset":107},{"uri":"Continental_philosophy","surface_form":"continental philosophy","offset":123},{"uri":"Ludwig_Wittgenstein","surface_form":"Ludwig Wittgenstein","offset":193},{"uri":"Analytic_philosophy","surface_form":"analytic philosophers","offset":223},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":292},{"uri":"Socrates","surface_form":"Socrates","offset":395},{"uri":"Phonemes","surface_form":"phonemes","offset":469},{"uri":"The_Stoics","surface_form":"The Stoics","offset":631},{"uri":"William_Occam","surface_form":"William Occam","offset":738},{"uri":"Mental_language","surface_form":"mental language","offset":868},{"uri":"Ferdinand_de_Saussure","surface_form":"Ferdinand de Saussure","offset":1062}]}
