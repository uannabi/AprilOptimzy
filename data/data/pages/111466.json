That was before the natural history holdings were split off to be the Natural History Museum.\nGray published several catalogues of the museum collections which discussed animal groups and described new species. He improved the collections to make them amongst the best in the world.\nDuring his life he wrote over 500 academic papers, mostly on new species.\nGray was also interested in postage stamps; on 1 May 1840, the day the Penny Black first went on sale, he bought some to keep, thus making him the world's first known stamp collector.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"FRS","surface_form":"FRS","offset":17},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":63},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":75},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":97},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":105},{"uri":"Keeper","surface_form":"Keeper","offset":125},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"Zoology","offset":135},{"uri":"British_Museum","surface_form":"British Museum","offset":150},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"natural history","offset":217},{"uri":"Natural_History_Museum","surface_form":"Natural History Museum","offset":267},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":399},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":514},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":545},{"uri":"Postage_stamp","surface_form":"postage stamp","offset":582},{"uri":"Penny_Black","surface_form":"Penny Black","offset":625},{"uri":"Stamp_collector","surface_form":"stamp collector","offset":721}]}
