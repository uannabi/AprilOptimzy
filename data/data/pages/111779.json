{"id":111779,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugiong%2C_New_South_Wales","text":"Jugiong is a small village on the bank of the Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales, Australia. It is 344\u00A0km south west of Sydney on the Hume Highway. The first people to live in the area were indigenous Australians, the Wiradjuri people. The first Europeans were the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell on their trip in 1824.\nHenry O'Brien, an Irishman, started farming sheep in 1825. His farm, called the Jugiong Run, was 125,000 acres. Explorer Charles Sturt reached the Murrumbidgee at Jugiong in 1829 at the start of his travels down the river.\nTavern.\nIn 1845 another Irishman named John Philip Sheahan (1816\u2013December 9, 1877) built the Sir George Tavern (an hotel) which made Jugiong an important resting place on the new road, the \"Great Southern Road\", to Melbourne. The building was destroyed in a flood in 1852. The flood also destroyed the buildings at the town of Gundagai. Sheahan rebuilt the hotel with walls up to 500\u00A0mm thick and it is still in use; remaining in the family throughout the preceding years. It is the oldest family owned hotel in Australia.\nThe Village.\nThe first blocks of land at Jugiong were sold at auction in 1853. Three years later a post office was opened. In 1858 a police station was built, and work started on a catholic church, \"St.John the Evangelist\". About 120 people were living at Jugiong by 1862. An Anglican church was started in 1872. The Jugiong Public [http://www.jugiong-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/] school opened in 1883 with 56 students. Australian cricket player Richie Benaud started his schooling at Jugiong in 1935.\nBushrangers.\nOn 15 November 1864 bushrangers (thieves) stopped all traffic including the mail stagecoach (a cart pulled by horses) 5\u00A0km south of Jugiong. Over 60 people were stopped by the bushrangers. They wanted to steal (take with force) gold, money and other valuables. The bushrangers were Ben Hall, John Gilbert and John Dunn. In the attack one policeman, Sergeant Edmund Parry was shot dead by John Gilbert.\nSong.\nA song called \"The Road to Jugiong\" with words by Robert John Cassidy (1880\u20131948) and music by James A.Steele was published by Allans, Melbourne, in 1940.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":19},{"uri":"Murrumbidgee_River","surface_form":"Murrumbidgee River","offset":46},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":68},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":85},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":123},{"uri":"Hume_Highway","surface_form":"Hume Highway","offset":137},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"indigenous Australians","offset":193},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":249},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":268},{"uri":"Hamilton_Hume","surface_form":"Hamilton Hume","offset":278},{"uri":"William_Hovell","surface_form":"William Hovell","offset":296},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irishman","offset":352},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":378},{"uri":"Charles_Sturt","surface_form":"Charles Sturt","offset":455},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":672},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":772},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":815},{"uri":"Gundagai%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gundagai","offset":884},{"uri":"Post_office","surface_form":"post office","offset":1179},{"uri":"Police_station","surface_form":"police station","offset":1213},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"catholic","offset":1261},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":1270},{"uri":"Anglican","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":1356},{"uri":"Richie_Benaud","surface_form":"Richie Benaud","offset":1521},{"uri":"Bushranger","surface_form":"bushranger","offset":1610},{"uri":"Theft","surface_form":"thieves","offset":1623},{"uri":"Mail","surface_form":"mail","offset":1666},{"uri":"Ben_Hall","surface_form":"Ben Hall","offset":1872},{"uri":"John_Gilbert_(bushranger)","surface_form":"John Gilbert","offset":1882},{"uri":"John_Dunn","surface_form":"John Dunn","offset":1899},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":1917},{"uri":"Policeman","surface_form":"policeman","offset":1928},{"uri":"Sergeant","surface_form":"Sergeant","offset":1939},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"published","offset":2112}]}
