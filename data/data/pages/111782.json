{"id":111782,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Gospel of Thomas (or the Gospel according to Thomas, Coptic: p.euaggelion p.kata.cwmas) is a text written during the era of the New Testament. It is considered to be an apocryphon. It was found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt in 1945.\nThe text is in the form of a codex, bound in what today is known as Coptic binding. It is almost complete. Unlike the other texts, it is not a narrative, but a collection of sayings and short dialogues attributed to Jesus. There are 114 sayings in the text. Most are compatible with the other gospels. They can also be found in one of the other gospels. Some were unknown to scholars before the codex was found. None of the big Christian groups accepts the Gospel of Thomas as canon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coptic_language","surface_form":"Coptic","offset":70},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":145},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"apocryphon","offset":186},{"uri":"Nag_Hammadi","surface_form":"Nag Hammadi","offset":214},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":227},{"uri":"Codex","surface_form":"codex","offset":271},{"uri":"Coptic_binding","surface_form":"Coptic binding","offset":310},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":458},{"uri":"Biblical_canon","surface_form":"canon","offset":719}]}
