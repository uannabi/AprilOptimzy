It was invented in 1974\u00A0by Hungarian\u00A0sculptor\u00A0and\u00A0professor\u00A0of\u00A0architecture\u00A0Ern\u0151 Rubik.\u00A0In a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, orange is opposite red, and some might replace blue with black or purple.\nTypes of Cubes.\nThe standard Rubik's Cube is 3x3x3. 3 blocks across, 3 blocks down, and 3 blocks deep. Cubes can be made in 2x2, 4x4, or larger versions. the largest cube is 33 x 33, which is also 3d printed.\nCuboids are cubes with uneven sides. Some options are the 3x2x2 or 3x5 or 4x3. Some cuboids can \"shapeshift\" or \"jumble\". That means the cube goes out of its original shape. To solve a shapeshifting cube it must return to the original shape before it is considered solved.\nGear cubes include gears which cause both sides of a cube to turn.\nOther versions include the Megaminx, Pyraminx, Rubik's clock, Mirror Cube, and Square 1.\nStructure.\nA Rubik's Cube is a cube split into a number of smaller cubes with different colored faces attached to a rotating piece of metal in the middle. Total, there are 26 small cubes. The Rubik's Cube have six sides with 9 little cubes attached to it and each side has one color: red, yellow, blue, orange, white and green are the most common colors.\nThe cubes can be rotated and twisted along rows and faces. The aim of the puzzle is to make each face of the cube have the same color. Solving a Rubik's Cube requires logic and thinking. There are many different ways to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube.\nMethods.\nThere are many methods that people use to solve a Rubik's Cube. Today the most common one is called CFOP, also called Fridrich Method, named after the popularizer Jessica Fridrich. In this method first the white cross is solved, then F2L(First 2 Layers) followed by OLL(Orientation of Last Layer) and PLL(Permutation Of Last Layer). Other methods include Petrus, ZZ, Roux, Keyhole and others.\nRecords.\nThe record for one Rubik's Cube solve is 3.47 seconds by Yusheng Du at the Wuhu Open 2018 (in China). Feliks Zemdegs holds the record for the average of 5, which is 5.53 seconds, set at Odd Day in Sydney 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puzzle","surface_form":"puzzle","offset":18},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":25},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy","offset":63},{"uri":"Gear","surface_form":"gear","offset":1017},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":1221},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":1637},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":1676}]}
