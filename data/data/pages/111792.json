{"id":111792,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level","text":"Simply defined as the different states of potential energy for electrons in an atom. A quantum mechanical system can only be in certain states, so that only certain energy levels are possible. The term energy level is most commonly used in reference to the electron configuration in atoms or molecules. In other words, the energy spectrum can be quantized (see continuous spectrum for the more general case).\nAs with classical potentials, the potential energy is usually set to zero at infinity, leading to a negative potential energy for bound electron states.\nEnergy levels are said to be degenerate, if the same energy level is obtained by more than one quantum mechanical state. They are then called degenerate energy levels.\nThe following sections of this article gives an overview over the most important factors that determine the energy levels of atoms and molecules.\nOrbital state energy level.\nwhere formula_1 is the Rydberg constant (typically between 1 eV and 103 eV), \"Z\" is the charge of the atom's nucleus, formula_1 is the principal quantum number, \"e\" is the charge of the electron, formula_1 is Planck's constant, and \"c\" is the speed of light.\nThe Rydberg levels depend only on the principal quantum number formula_1.\nFine structure splitting.\nFine structure arises from relativistic kinetic energy corrections, spin-orbit coupling (an electrodynamic interaction between the electron's spin and motion and the nucleus's electric field) and the Darwin term (contact term interaction of s-shell electrons inside the nucleus). Typical magnitude formula_1 eV.\nHyperfine structure.\nSpin-nuclear-spin coupling (\"see hyperfine structure\"). Typical magnitude formula_1 eV.\nElectrostatic interaction of an electron with other electrons.\nIf there is more than one electron around the atom, electron-electron-interactions raise the energy level. These interactions are often neglected if the spatial overlap of the electron wavefunctions is low.\nZeeman effect.\nThe interaction energy is: formula_1 with formula_1\nZeeman effect taking spin into account.\nThis takes both the magnetic dipole moment due to the orbital angular momentum and the magnetic momentum arising from the electron spin into account.\nDue to relativistic effects (Dirac equation), the magnetic moment arising from the electron spin is formula_1 with formula_1 the gyro-magnetic factor (about 2).\nformula_1\nThe interaction energy therefore gets formula_1.\nStark effect.\nInteraction with an external electric field (\"see Stark effect\").\nMolecules.\nwhere formula_1 is an eigenvalue of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian (the value of the potential energy surface) at the equilibrium geometry of the molecule.\nThe molecular energy levels are labelled by the molecular term symbols.\nThe specific energies of these components vary with the specific energy state and the substance.\nIn molecular physics and quantum chemistry, an energy level is a quantized energy of a bound quantum mechanical state.\nCrystalline materials.\nCrystalline materials are often characterized by a number of important energy levels. The most important ones are the top of the valence band, the bottom of the conduction band, the Fermi energy, the vacuum level, and the energy levels of any defect states in the crystals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanical","offset":87},{"uri":"State_(physics)","surface_form":"states","offset":136},{"uri":"Electron_configuration","surface_form":"electron configuration","offset":257},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":283},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":292},{"uri":"Quantization","surface_form":"quantized","offset":346},{"uri":"Continuous_spectrum","surface_form":"continuous spectrum","offset":361},{"uri":"Bound_states","surface_form":"bound electron states","offset":539},{"uri":"Quantum_state","surface_form":"state","offset":676},{"uri":"Degenerate_energy_level","surface_form":"degenerate energy level","offset":704},{"uri":"Rydberg_constant","surface_form":"Rydberg constant","offset":927},{"uri":"Electronvolt","surface_form":"eV","offset":965},{"uri":"Principal_quantum_number","surface_form":"principal quantum number","offset":1039},{"uri":"Planck%27s_constant","surface_form":"Planck's constant","offset":1113},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":1147},{"uri":"Fine_structure","surface_form":"Fine structure","offset":1263},{"uri":"Spin-orbit_coupling","surface_form":"spin-orbit coupling","offset":1331},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":1405},{"uri":"Hyperfine_structure","surface_form":"hyperfine structure","offset":1629},{"uri":"Dirac_equation","surface_form":"Dirac equation","offset":2240},{"uri":"Stark_effect","surface_form":"Stark effect","offset":2495},{"uri":"Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors","surface_form":"eigenvalue","offset":2544},{"uri":"Electronic_molecular_Hamiltonian","surface_form":"electronic molecular Hamiltonian","offset":2562},{"uri":"Potential_energy_surface","surface_form":"potential energy surface","offset":2613},{"uri":"Molecular_geometry","surface_form":"equilibrium geometry of the molecule","offset":2646},{"uri":"Molecular_term_symbol","surface_form":"molecular term symbol","offset":2732},{"uri":"Molecular_physics","surface_form":"molecular physics","offset":2856},{"uri":"Quantum_chemistry","surface_form":"quantum chemistry","offset":2878},{"uri":"Bound_state","surface_form":"bound","offset":2940},{"uri":"Quantum_state","surface_form":"quantum mechanical state","offset":2946},{"uri":"Valence_band","surface_form":"valence band","offset":3124},{"uri":"Conduction_band","surface_form":"conduction band","offset":3156},{"uri":"Fermi_energy","surface_form":"Fermi energy","offset":3177},{"uri":"Vacuum_level","surface_form":"vacuum level","offset":3195},{"uri":"Defect_states","surface_form":"defect states","offset":3238}]}
