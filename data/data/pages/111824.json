{"id":111824,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_Mountains","text":"Taurus Mountains (Turkish: \"Toros Da\u011Flar\u0131\") are a mountain range in Turkey, from which the Euphrates (Turkish: F\u0131rat) and Tigris (Turkish: Dicle) descend into Syria and Iraq. The Manavgat River comes from its southern slopes.\nThe mountain range extends along a curve from Lake E\u011Firdir in the west to the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris in the east. It has many peaks rising above 10,000\u201312,000 ft (3,000\u20133,700 m), with the Demirkaz\u0131k summit in the region known as Alada\u011Flar, at 3,756 meters (12,322 ft.) as the highest point. Another important peak is Medetsiz (3,524 m/11,561 ft) in the Bolkar Da\u011Flar\u0131 section.\nThis mountain range divides the Mediterranean region of southern Turkey from the central plateau.\nLimestone has eroded to form karstic landscapes of waterfalls, underground rivers, and the largest caves of Asia.\nAt Kestel is a Bronze Age archaeological site where early evidence of tin mining was found.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":18},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":50},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":68},{"uri":"Euphrates","surface_form":"Euphrates","offset":91},{"uri":"Tigris","surface_form":"Tigris","offset":122},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":159},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":169},{"uri":"Manavgat_River","surface_form":"Manavgat River","offset":179},{"uri":"Extend","surface_form":"extends","offset":245},{"uri":"Lake_E%C4%9Firdir","surface_form":"Lake E\u011Firdir","offset":272},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":654},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"Limestone","offset":720},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"eroded","offset":734},{"uri":"Karst","surface_form":"karst","offset":749},{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":771},{"uri":"Underground_river","surface_form":"underground river","offset":783},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":819},{"uri":"Kestel","surface_form":"Kestel","offset":837},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":849},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":904},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":908}]}
