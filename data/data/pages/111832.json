{"id":111832,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Hill","text":"Bull Hill, sometimes called Mount Taurus, is a mountain in the U.S. state of New York. It is north of the village of Cold Spring on the Hudson River, in Putnam County. It is part of the mountain range known as the Hudson Highlands.\nAn old quarry can be seen on its south ridge.\nThe mountain may have gotten its name from a bull that farmers chased down it. The bull's fall gave the Breakneck Ridge its name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":47},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":63},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":77},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":106},{"uri":"Cold_Spring%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Cold Spring","offset":117},{"uri":"Hudson_River","surface_form":"Hudson River","offset":136},{"uri":"Putnam_County%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Putnam County","offset":153},{"uri":"Hudson_Highlands","surface_form":"Hudson Highlands","offset":214},{"uri":"Quarry","surface_form":"quarry","offset":239},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"bull","offset":323}]}
