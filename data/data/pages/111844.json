At the same time a sort of industrial parliament was established at the Luxembourg Palace, under the presidency of Louis Blanc. Tensions between liberal Orleanist and Radical Republicans and Socialists would cause the June Days Uprising a few months later.\nMeanwhile the revolution inspired other European Revolutions of 1848.\nThe End of the Revolution in France.\nThe era of revolution in France came to an end when Louis Napoleon dissolved the National Assembly without having the constitutional right to do so, and became the sole ruler of France. In 1852 he reestablished the empire and took the title Emperors Napoleon III.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":32},{"uri":"Louis-Philippe_of_France","surface_form":"King Louis-Philippe","offset":58},{"uri":"French_Second_Republic","surface_form":"French Second Republic","offset":110},{"uri":"Right_to_work","surface_form":"right to work","offset":195},{"uri":"National_Workshops","surface_form":"National Workshops","offset":258},{"uri":"Unemployment","surface_form":"unemployed","offset":286},{"uri":"Luxembourg_Palace","surface_form":"Luxembourg Palace","offset":370},{"uri":"Louis_Blanc","surface_form":"Louis Blanc","offset":413},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberal","offset":443},{"uri":"Orleanism","surface_form":"Orleanist","offset":451},{"uri":"Radicalism_(historical)","surface_form":"Radical","offset":465},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"Socialist","offset":489},{"uri":"June_Days_Uprising","surface_form":"June Days Uprising","offset":516},{"uri":"European_Revolutions_of_1848","surface_form":"European Revolutions of 1848","offset":595},{"uri":"Louis_Napoleon","surface_form":"Louis Napoleon","offset":714},{"uri":"Constitutionalism","surface_form":"constitutional right","offset":780},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":877},{"uri":"Napoleon_III","surface_form":"Napoleon III","offset":912}]}
