{"id":11185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City","text":"Mexico City () is the capital and largest city of Mexico. It is also one of the most populous and polluted cities in the world. The Aztec people were here before the Spanish came and made Mexico City. It was founded in 1521 by Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s. Today, about 8.5 million people live in the city, and about 18 million live in the Greater Mexico City urban area. The city of Mexico City ceased to exist in 1928. Since then, there is only the Federal District.\nMexico City has 18.1 million people. It is the city with the second highest number of people in the world after Tokyo in Japan and just slightly more populated than Mumbai in India.\nHistory.\nMexico City was first built in the 1520s after Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s destroyed the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. The Spaniards then emptied the basin of Lake Texcoco to keep it from flooding. By the late 1700s, Mexico City had over 100,000 people. However, there were many slums, which caused epidemics. There were political problems in the mid 1800s after Mexico became independent. More than 40 people ruled in the 40 years after the country became independent. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, electric light and gas were brought to the city. But there was a big difference between the rich western part of the city and the poor eastern part of the city. By 1930, Mexico City had 1,000,000 people. The city kept growing quickly. In 1968, the Olympic Games were in Mexico City. In 1985, an earthquake hit the capital. In the past few decades, there have been problems with crime and corruption.\nEnvironment.\nMexico City has a high population density. It is also surrounded by mountains. This causes problems with air pollution.\nSometimes Mexico City gets earthquakes.\nGeography.\nMexico City is in the Valley of Mexico at around 2,300 meters (7,800 feet) above sea level.\nMexico City its divided by 16 boroughs: \u00C1lvaro Obreg\u00F3n, Azcapotzalco, Benito Juarez, Coyoac\u00E1n, Cuajimalpa, Cuauht\u00E9moc, Gustavo A. Madero, Iztacalco, Iztapalapa, Magdalena Contreras, Miguel Hidalgo, Milpa Alta, Tl\u00E1huac, Tlalpan, Venustiano Carranza and Xochimilco.\nMexico City was originally built on a lake, Lake Texcoco, which is now mostly drained. The ecology of the area has been much changed by the draining. Many of its native species, such as the Axolotl, are extinct, or endangered.\nThe mountains Popocat\u00E9petl and Iztacc\u00EDhuatl are nearby.\nClimate.\nMexico City is in the tropics. But because its elevation is so high, it has a subtropical highland climate (\"Cwb\" in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification). This means temperatures are warm or mild year-round. It is a lot wetter in the summer than in the winter. Some parts of the city get frost in the winter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":22},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":50},{"uri":"Aztec","surface_form":"Aztec","offset":132},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":166},{"uri":"1521","surface_form":"1521","offset":219},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":227},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":566},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"populated","offset":604},{"uri":"Mumbai","surface_form":"Mumbai","offset":619},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":629},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":692},{"uri":"Tenochtitlan","surface_form":"Tenochtitlan","offset":734},{"uri":"Basin","surface_form":"basin","offset":779},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":817},{"uri":"Slum","surface_form":"slum","offset":908},{"uri":"Epidemic","surface_form":"epidemic","offset":928},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":1153},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":1382},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1429},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":1512},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":1522},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"population density","offset":1570},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":1652},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1694},{"uri":"Valley_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Valley of Mexico","offset":1740},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1799},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":1840},{"uri":"Lake_Texcoco","surface_form":"Lake Texcoco","offset":2118},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":2165},{"uri":"Axolotl","surface_form":"Axolotl","offset":2264},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":2289},{"uri":"Popocat%C3%A9petl","surface_form":"Popocat\u00E9petl","offset":2315},{"uri":"Iztacc%C3%ADhuatl","surface_form":"Iztacc\u00EDhuatl","offset":2332},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropics","offset":2388},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":2413},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":2444},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":2487},{"uri":"Frost","surface_form":"frost","offset":2652}]}
