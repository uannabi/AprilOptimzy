{"id":111862,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)","text":"Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. It was founded by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana had many drummers, but the final and most well known drummer was Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. The band ended in 1994 after the death of Cobain. Since they formed, they have sold over 75 million records all over the world.\nNirvana were part of a rock music genre from Seattle called grunge. The genre comes from both punk rock and heavy metal. They released their first album, called \"Bleach\", for record label Sub Pop in 1989. Nirvana's style was songs with quiet verses and loud choruses. After signing to record label DGC Records, in 1991, Nirvana became very popular after releasing the song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". This song was the first single from their second album \"Nevermind\" (1991), which sold over 30 million copies worldwide. Nirvana becoming popular also made alternative rock popular. Cobain was then called by some people the \"spokesman of a generation\".\nAfter many tours and the 1992 compilation album \"Incesticide\" and EP \"Hormoaning\", Nirvana released their third studio album \"In Utero\" (1993). It was well liked by critics and sold 15 million records worldwide. Nirvana ended after the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994. Some live albums have been released since. \"MTV Unplugged in New York\" (1994) won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996.\nFormation and early years (1987-1988).\nSinger and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic met while they were at Aberdeen High School. Cobain said they didn't speak much while there. They became friends after high school while they were both often in the pracrtising space of the Melvins Cobain wanted to start a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not answer for a long time. Cobain sent him a demo of his band Fecal Matter. Three years later, Novoselic told Cobain he had listened to the tape and said they should start a band.\nAfter the band.\nAfter Nirvana broke up, Dave Grohl started a new band called the Foo Fighters. Krist Novoselic became interested in politics and also kept making music. He was the bassist for Flipper, which Kurt Cobain was a fan of, but later left the band. Novoselic later founded alternative rock band Giants in the Trees in 2017.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aberdeen%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Aberdeen, Washington","offset":44},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"singer","offset":93},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":104},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":114},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bassist","offset":130},{"uri":"Krist_Novoselic","surface_form":"Krist Novoselic","offset":138},{"uri":"Dave_Grohl","surface_form":"Dave Grohl","offset":228},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":433},{"uri":"Grunge","surface_form":"grunge","offset":448},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":482},{"uri":"Heavy_metal","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":496},{"uri":"Bleach_(Nirvana_album)","surface_form":"Bleach","offset":550},{"uri":"Sub_Pop","surface_form":"Sub Pop","offset":576},{"uri":"Verse","surface_form":"verse","offset":630},{"uri":"Chorus","surface_form":"chorus","offset":646},{"uri":"DGC_Records","surface_form":"DGC Records","offset":686},{"uri":"Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit","surface_form":"Smells Like Teen Spirit","offset":762},{"uri":"Single","surface_form":"single","offset":812},{"uri":"Nevermind","surface_form":"Nevermind","offset":844},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":943},{"uri":"Compilation_album","surface_form":"compilation album","offset":1070},{"uri":"Incesticide","surface_form":"Incesticide","offset":1089},{"uri":"Extended_Play","surface_form":"EP","offset":1106},{"uri":"Hormoaning","surface_form":"Hormoaning","offset":1110},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":1152},{"uri":"In_Utero_(album)","surface_form":"In Utero","offset":1166},{"uri":"MTV_Unplugged_in_New_York","surface_form":"MTV Unplugged in New York","offset":1350},{"uri":"Grammy","surface_form":"Grammy","offset":1390},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":1505},{"uri":"Krist_Novoselic","surface_form":"Krist Novoselic","offset":1529},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"High School","offset":1577},{"uri":"Melvins","surface_form":"Melvins","offset":1735},{"uri":"Foo_Fighters","surface_form":"Foo Fighters","offset":2069},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":2120},{"uri":"Giants_in_the_Trees","surface_form":"Giants in the Trees","offset":2292}]}
