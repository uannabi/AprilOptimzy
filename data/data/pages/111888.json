He played a career total of 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nK\u00F6lzig was born in South Africa, but he grew up in several cities across Canada and his family moved to Union Bay, British Columbia, Canada, when he was a teenager. K\u00F6lzig never applied for Canadian citizenship, which, combined with his German parentage and German passport, allows him to represent Germany internationally. In May 2008 Kolzig announced that he would not return to the Capitals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africans","surface_form":"South African","offset":38},{"uri":"German_people","surface_form":"German","offset":57},{"uri":"Retire","surface_form":"retire","offset":64},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":85},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"goaltender","offset":96},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":154},{"uri":"Washington_Capitals","surface_form":"Washington Capitals","offset":202},{"uri":"Tampa_Bay_Lightning","surface_form":"Tampa Bay Lightning","offset":230},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":270},{"uri":"Union_Bay%2C_British_Columbia","surface_form":"Union Bay, British Columbia","offset":355},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":384}]}
