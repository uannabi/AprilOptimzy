{"id":11192,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois","text":"Illinois is a state in the United States. Its capital is Springfield and its largest city is Chicago. It is bordered to the north by Wisconsin, to the west by Iowa and below that, by Missouri (both borders are along the Mississippi River). To the south-east, Illinois is bordered along the Ohio River by Kentucky and to the east by Indiana. Illinois' northeasternmost boundary is to Lake Michigan.\nPolitical Climate In Illinois Today.\nMost of Illinois outside of Chicago (its most populous city) is heavily conservative. In 2016, for example, nearly 40 counties in Illinois gave Trump 70% or more of the vote there. However, Chicago makes up over half of the state\u00B4s population, and Cook County (in which Chicago is located) gave Trump just 21% of the vote there. Therefore, the governor of Illinois is currently a Democrat, as are both its US Senators and over 70% of its representatives. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the state by 17%. In 2012, Barack Obama won the state by 17%. In 2008, Obama won the state by over 25%. Illinois has supported only Democratic candidates for president since 1992.\nHistorically Voting Republican.\nIllinois used to vote Republican. In all the presidential elections between 1856 and 1892, it supported the Republican candidate.\nFormer Swing State.\nIllinois was a swing state, but it isn\u00B4t a swing state anymore. In all the presidential elections in which it has voted, it has supported the winner 82% of the time. Out of the last 5 presidential elections, however, it has supported the winner only 40% of the time.\nHistory.\nIllinois became a state on December 3, 1818. Illinois was the first state to ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which helped abolish slavery in the United States.\nThree U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama. Additionally, Ronald Reagan, whose political career was based in California, was the only US President born and raised in Illinois.\nEconomy.\nIllinois has a diverse economy. Chicago is a major center for transportation and business. Central and northern Illinois is mostly used for agriculture. The south produces many natural resources such as coal, timber and petroleum.\nGovernment.\nIllinois was once known to be a swing state (voted for either Democratic Party or the Republican Party). Today, Illinois is known to be a blue state in which it votes for the Democratic Party. The last time Illinois voted for a Republican president was in 1988 for George H.W. Bush.\nJ. B. Pritzker (D) is the current Governor of Illinois. It has two senators; Dick Durbin (D) and Tammy Duckworth (D).\nPopulation.\nIllinois has the average population of 12,419,293 people since 2010. Most of the people living in Illinois live near the city of Chicago.\nState symbols.\nIn Illinois, school children voted to select the state bird, state flower, and state tree. The state bird is the cardinal. The state flower of Illinois is the violet. The state tree is the white oak.\nIllinois's seal has an eagle in a prairie. Across a river, behind the eagle is a rising sun. The eagle stands for the United States. The prairie reminds Illinoisans of their land. The two dates on the seal, 1818 and 1868, are the year that Illinois became a state and the year that the state seal was designed. The state flag includes the state seal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"States_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"state","offset":14},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":27},{"uri":"Springfield%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Springfield","offset":57},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":93},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":133},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":159},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":183},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":220},{"uri":"Ohio_River","surface_form":"Ohio River","offset":290},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":304},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":332},{"uri":"Lake_Michigan","surface_form":"Lake Michigan","offset":383},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":1625},{"uri":"Ratify","surface_form":"ratify","offset":1634},{"uri":"13th_amendment","surface_form":"13th Amendment","offset":1645},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":1667},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":1701},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1716},{"uri":"U.S._presidents","surface_form":"U.S. presidents","offset":1737},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":1797},{"uri":"Ulysses_S._Grant","surface_form":"Ulysses S.
