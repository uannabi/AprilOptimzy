{"id":111920,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Durnan","text":"William Ronald Durnan (January 22, 1916 \u2013 October 31, 1972) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 7 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played his entire NHL career with the Montreal Canadiens. Until Roberto Luongo was named captain of the Vancouver Canucks on September 30, 2008, Durnan was the last goaltender to be a captain in the National Hockey League, and one of only seven ever. Bill Durnan was ambidextrous, meaning he could catch with either hand. This star goalie is one of the greatest Montreal Canadiens in history. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Canadiens and was a six-time Vezina Trophy winner. Durnan was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964.\nAwards.\nFirst All-Star Team goalie in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1950.\nWon the Vezina Trophy in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1950.\nPlayed in NHL All-Star Game in 1947, 1948, 1949","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":66},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":75},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":88},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"goaltender","offset":99},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":138},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":209},{"uri":"Roberto_Luongo","surface_form":"Roberto Luongo","offset":235},{"uri":"Vancouver_Canucks","surface_form":"Vancouver Canucks","offset":275},{"uri":"Captain_(hockey)","surface_form":"captain","offset":355},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":575},{"uri":"Vezina_Trophy","surface_form":"Vezina Trophy","offset":631},{"uri":"Hockey_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Hockey Hall of Fame","offset":682},{"uri":"Vezina_Trophy","surface_form":"Vezina Trophy","offset":793},{"uri":"NHL_All-Star_Game","surface_form":"NHL All-Star Game","offset":856}]}
