{"id":111948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Jennings_Trophy","text":"The William M. Jennings Trophy is an award in the National Hockey League (NHL) given each year to \"to the goalkeeper(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it. Winners are selected based on regular-season play.\" Up until 1981, the Vezina Trophy had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. Since it began in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 25 seasons to 27 different players. The most recent winners are Corey Crawford of the Chicago Blackhawks and Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens, who both allowed only 189 team goals against for their teams in the 2014\u201315 NHL season.\nHistory.\nUntil the 1980\u201381 season, the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest goals during the regular season. However, it was discovered that this often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual, so they changed it to offer the Vezina to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL General Managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is given to the goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals scored against them.\nThe Jennings Trophy was donated by the NHL's board of governors and first handed out at the end of the 1981\u201382 season. It is named for the late William M. Jennings, who was a governor and president of the New York Rangers and who helped build ice hockey in the United States. Normally the lowest number of games a goaltender must play to be eligible for the trophy is 25, but for the lockout shortened 1994\u201395 season, the lowest was fourteen games.\nFive players have won both the Jennings and Vezina Trophy for the same season: Patrick Roy (1988\u201389 and 1991\u201392), Ed Belfour (1990\u201391 and 1992\u201393), Dominik Hasek (1993\u201394 and 2000\u201301), Martin Brodeur (2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304) and Miikka Kiprusoff (2005\u201306). Roy has won the trophy five times, the most of any goaltender. Belfour and Brodeur are tied for second, having each won the trophy four times. It has been won most often by the Montreal Canadiens, on 5 occasions. The New Jersey Devils have won four times, and Buffalo Sabres and Chicago Blackhawks have three wins each.\nWinners.\nBold Player with the fewest goals ever scored against in a season.\nNotes.\n\"For the 2002\u201303 season, there was a tie between Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils and Robert Esche and Roman Cechmanek of the Philadelphia Flyers. This is the only time that there has been a tie between players from different teams.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":50},{"uri":"Goaltender_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"goalkeeper(s)","offset":106},{"uri":"Vezina_Trophy","surface_form":"Vezina Trophy","offset":281},{"uri":"Corey_Crawford","surface_form":"Corey Crawford","offset":519},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":541},{"uri":"Carey_Price","surface_form":"Carey Price","offset":564},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":583},{"uri":"2014%E2%80%9315_NHL_season","surface_form":"2014\u201315 NHL season","offset":671},{"uri":"1980-81_NHL_season","surface_form":"1980\u201381 season","offset":710},{"uri":"Vezina_Trophy","surface_form":"Vezina Trophy","offset":730},{"uri":"Regular_season","surface_form":"regular season","offset":826},{"uri":"List_of_National_Hockey_League_general_managers","surface_form":"NHL General Managers","offset":1063},{"uri":"1981-82_NHL_season","surface_form":"1981\u201382 season","offset":1346},{"uri":"William_M._Jennings","surface_form":"William M.
