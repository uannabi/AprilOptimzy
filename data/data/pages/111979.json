{"id":111979,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language","text":"Akkadian (') or Assyro-Babylonian was a Semitic language (part of the Afro-Asiatic language family) that was spoken in ancient Iraq. The first-known Semitic language, it used the cuneiform writing system from ancient Sumer.\nThe earliest known Akkadian inscription was found on a bowl at Ur. It was addressed to a very early pre-Sargonic king of Ur by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad.\nThe Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad, introduced the Akkadian language (the \"language of Akkad\") as a written language. It used Sumerian cuneiform orthography (writing method) for the purpose. During the middle Bronze Age (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language displaced Sumerian. Sumerian probably became extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic","offset":40},{"uri":"Afro-Asiatic_languages","surface_form":"Afro-Asiatic","offset":70},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":127},{"uri":"Cuneiform_script","surface_form":"cuneiform","offset":179},{"uri":"Sumer","surface_form":"Sumer","offset":217},{"uri":"Ur","surface_form":"Ur","offset":287},{"uri":"Akkadian_Empire","surface_form":"Akkadian Empire","offset":416},{"uri":"Sargon_of_Akkad","surface_form":"Sargon of Akkad","offset":448},{"uri":"Akkadian_Empire","surface_form":"Akkad","offset":516},{"uri":"Sumer","surface_form":"Sumerian","offset":555},{"uri":"Orthography","surface_form":"orthography","offset":574},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":638}]}
