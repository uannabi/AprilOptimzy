She is best known for her roles in the movies \"The Avengers\", \"Lost in Translation\", \"Match Point\", and \"The Prestige\".\nEarly life.\nScarlett Johansson was born in New York City, New York on November 22, 1984. Her father, Karsten Johansson, is a Danish-born architect originally from Copenhagen, and her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was a screenwriter and director. Her mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from the Bronx. Melanie's ancestors emigrated to New York from Minsk, Tsarist Russia. She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; a twin brother, Hunter (who appeared with her in the film \"Manny & Lo\"); and an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage.\nPolitics.\nJohansson is registered as an independent and campaigned for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election. About George W. Bush's 2004 reelection, she said, \"[I am] disappointed. I think it was a disappointment for a large percentage of the population.\" Johansson also campaigned for Democratic candidate Barack Obama: Her efforts included appearances in Iowa during January 2008, where her efforts were targeted at younger voters; an appearance at Cornell College; and a speaking engagement at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota on Super Tuesday, 2008. Johansson appeared in the 2008 music video for The Black Eyed Peas front man will.i.am's song, \"Yes We Can\", directed by Jesse Dylan, a song inspired by Obama's speech following the 2008 New Hampshire primary. On February 7, 2012, Johansson and Anna Wintour hosted a fashion launch of pro-Obama clothing, bags and accessories, with proceeds going to the President's re-election campaign. She addressed voters at the Democratic National Convention on September 6, 2012, calling for President Obama's reelection and for more engagement from young voters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":50},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actress","offset":59},{"uri":"Model_(person)","surface_form":"model","offset":68},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":78},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":125},{"uri":"The_Avengers_(movie)","surface_form":"The Avengers","offset":133},{"uri":"Lost_in_Translation","surface_form":"Lost in Translation","offset":149},{"uri":"Match_Point","surface_form":"Match Point","offset":172},{"uri":"The_Prestige","surface_form":"The Prestige","offset":191},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":249},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":264},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":331},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":369},{"uri":"Ashkenazi_Jews","surface_form":"Ashkenazi Jewish","offset":514},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"the Bronx","offset":543},{"uri":"Minsk","surface_form":"Minsk, Tsarist Russia","offset":601},{"uri":"Manny_%26amp%3B_Lo","surface_form":"Manny & Lo","offset":760},{"uri":"Independent_(voter)","surface_form":"independent","offset":886},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic candidate","offset":917},{"uri":"John_Kerry","surface_form":"John Kerry","offset":938},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2004","surface_form":"2004 United States presidential election","offset":956},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
