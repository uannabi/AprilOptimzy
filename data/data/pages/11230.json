{"id":11230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon","text":"A polygon is a closed two-dimensional shape. It is a simple curve that is made up of straight line segments. It usually has three sides and three corners or more.\nIt could also be referred to as 'A closed plane figure bound by three or more straight line segments'. It has a number of sides, also called edges. A square is a polygon because it has four sides. The smallest possible polygon in a Euclidean geometry or \"flat geometry\" is the triangle, but on a sphere, there can be a digon and a henagon.\nIf the edges (lines of the polygon) do not intersect (cross each other), the polygon is called \"simple\", otherwise it is \"complex\".\nIn computer graphics, polygons (especially triangles) are often used to make graphics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dimension","surface_form":"dimension","offset":26},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":38},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":313},{"uri":"Euclidean_geometry","surface_form":"Euclidean geometry","offset":395},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":440},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":459},{"uri":"Digon","surface_form":"digon","offset":482},{"uri":"Henagon","surface_form":"henagon","offset":494},{"uri":"Intersection","surface_form":"intersect","offset":546},{"uri":"Computer_graphics","surface_form":"computer graphics","offset":638}]}
