{"id":112375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board","text":"The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an organization that rates video games. Rating is voluntary. Game publishers do not have to submit their games for ratings. There are seven ratings: E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10+), T (Teen), M (Mature 17+), AO (Adults Only), and RP (Rating Pending). Some retailers make people show identification to prove their age if they want to buy M-rated games. Many retailers will not buy and sell AO games so it is very hard for gamers to find AO-rated games.\nOn the back of each game's box, the ESRB also rates elements of the game. The back of \"Super Princess Peach\" has the words \"comic mischief\" on it to tell parents that it contains comic mischief.\nThe AO rating.\nSome critics come to believe that the ESRB only rates games AO if they have sex in them, regardless of how explicit the language, violence or even blood is. This also lead them to think the ESRB is not doing its job. Twenty-three games have received and kept adult ratings, but apparently twenty (almost all) games were given it for sexual themes and content. Two had violence, and the other one was given the \"Adult\" rating for real gambling.\n\"Tone Down\" controversy.\nSome publishers of games decide to tone down the game's explicitness in order to qualify for an \"M\" rather than an \"AO\" rating. For example, the game had an original M rating, but the game that could be unlocked by bypassing the patch, called \"Hot Coffee\", seemed to spark major controversy with the game, because it features sex and erotica. Thus, the ESRB decided to re-rate the game as an AO. Rockstar Games then chose to leave the game out of the release, then release an exploit fix that completely disallowed access to the game. However, other games have trouble being \"toned down\". Thrill Kill, for instance, was given an AO, and then Electronic Arts decided to purchase the publisher, Virgin Entertainment. The release of the game was then canceled, and the game never was toned down.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":77},{"uri":"Super_Princess_Peach","surface_form":"Super Princess Peach","offset":591},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":790},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":1509},{"uri":"Erotica","surface_form":"erotica","offset":1517},{"uri":"Rockstar_Games","surface_form":"Rockstar Games","offset":1579},{"uri":"Exploit","surface_form":"exploit","offset":1659},{"uri":"Thrill_Kill","surface_form":"Thrill Kill","offset":1772},{"uri":"Virgin_Entertainment","surface_form":"Virgin Entertainment","offset":1876}]}
