In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which they live the President and his family. Rafael Correa, president since 2007, considering that Carondelet Palace and its agencies are Ecuadoran heritages, converted the presidential compound into a museum accessible to all who wish to visit it.

Several rooms and spaces within the palace are used for this purpose.\nChurch of La Compa\u00F1\u00EDa de Jes\u00FAs.\nConstruction began in 1605, with Mastrilli laying the first stone.

The building was officially inaugurated in 1605. It is not known who designed the original plans for the complex, though the most-accepted theory is that they were sent from Spain, based on the topographical study of Ricke and Gosseal.

As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (\"mestizaje\") and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.\nThe Quito School (\"Escuela Quite\u00F1a\") is an artistic tradition that developed in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, from Pasto and Popay\u00E1n in the north to Piura and Cajamarca in the south, during the colonial period (1542-1824).

The congress, in accordance with the year's budget, designated 12,000 pesos for the construction - 1,000 pesos per month, beginning in 1884. By the decree of July 3, 1885, the fourth Quitense Provincial Council turned the construction of the basilica into a religious commitment in the name of the country. The basilica remains technically \"unfinished.\" & local legend says that when the Bas\u00EDlica is completed, the end of the world will come.\nMetropolitan Cathedral.\nConstruction began in 1562, seventeen years after the diocese of Quito was created (1545) and located in the heart of the historic city and its status as the main church of the city, is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city.\nChurch of San Agust\u00EDn.\nIt is one of the seven monumental churches of the 16th and 17th centuries whose main portico was built on stone in the Spanish Baroque-architecture style.\nThe church includes a small atrium (decorated by a large stone cross), an inside yard with a large garden and a large session hall where the frayers held dissertations or \"capitulations\" of faith.\nThe cloister and convent have a separate entrance which leads to the garden. The bell tower reaches a high of twenty-two meters (seventy feet) and houses two bronze bells of the period.\nClimate.\nEcuador is a country of variety.

However, it is more hot and humid along the coast and in the Amazon jungle lowlands than it is in the mountains.\nPlants and animals.\nEcuador is one of 17 megadiverse countries in the world. In addition to the mainland, Ecuador owns the Gal\u00E1pagos Islands. This is what the country is best known for.\nEcuador has 1,600 bird species and 38 more endemic in the Gal\u00E1pagos. In addition to over 16,000 species of plants, the country has 106 endemic reptiles, 138 endemic amphibians, and 6,000 species of butterfly.

There are also large banana farms. On the coast, many people eat seafood and fish. Cuy is a famous indigenous food that means guinea pig.\nEconomy.\nBesides gold, oil is one of Ecuador's natural resources.\nEcuador used to have its own currency called the sucre, which was in use from 1884 until 2000.
