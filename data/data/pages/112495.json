{"id":112495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasiatheria","text":"Laurasiatheria is a large group of placental mammals. The name comes from the area where advanced mammals evolved. This was on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia, roughly corresponding to Eurasia today plus North America. When Pangaea broke up, it split first into Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south.\nMembers of the group include shrews, hedgehogs, pangolins, bats, whales, most hoofed mammals, and carnivorans, and others.\nThere are various ideas as to how these groups are related to each other, and no tree of descent is agreed by experts so far.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Placentalia","surface_form":"placental mammals","offset":35},{"uri":"Derived_(biology)","surface_form":"advanced","offset":89},{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":106},{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":140},{"uri":"Laurasia","surface_form":"Laurasia","offset":158},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":193},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":212},{"uri":"Pangaea","surface_form":"Pangaea","offset":232},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":296},{"uri":"Shrew","surface_form":"shrew","offset":348},{"uri":"Hedgehog","surface_form":"hedgehog","offset":356},{"uri":"Pangolin","surface_form":"pangolin","offset":367},{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":378},{"uri":"Whales","surface_form":"whales","offset":384},{"uri":"Ungulate","surface_form":"hoofed mammals","offset":397},{"uri":"Carnivora","surface_form":"carnivora","offset":417}]}
