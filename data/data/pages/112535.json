It has one of the biggest seaports in the Aegean Sea region and all of Turkey. \u0130zmir is a popular destination for tourists, who come for beaches and cultural tours. It has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\" in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification). Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey.\nThis is an ancient city; many scholars think Homer was born in Smyrna. An earthquake destroyed it in 187 AD, and it was rebuilt. The Greek name for this formerly Greek city is Smyrna. That name was also used in English until the 20th century. About 30 km (20 miles) south of \u0130zmir, there is an ancient Greek city named Ephesus.\n\u0130zmir was a candidate for Expo 2015. However, Milan had more support, so \u0130zmir lost.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":11},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":31},{"uri":"Aegean_Sea","surface_form":"Aegean Sea","offset":81},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":176},{"uri":"Mediterranean_climate","surface_form":"Mediterranean climate","offset":224},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":260},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":365},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":380},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":409},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":468},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":546},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":564},{"uri":"Ephesus","surface_form":"Ephesus","offset":654},{"uri":"Expo_2015","surface_form":"Expo 2015","offset":689},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":709}]}
