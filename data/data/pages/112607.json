{"id":112607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace","text":"\"Amazing Grace\" is a poem written in 1772 by Englishman John Newton. The poem named, \"Faith's Review and Expectation\", was where the song came from. It was set to music. A seventh stanza, by an unknown author, has been added to most versions since 1829, beginning with the words, \"When we've been there ten thousand years\". In some versions, stanzas five and six to the song are cut and go directly to the seventh.\nJohn Newton and the lyrics to Amazing Grace.\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\nThat sav\u2019d a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\u2019Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\nHow precious did that grace appear,\nThro\u2019 many dangers, toils and snares,\n\u2019Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home.\nThe Lord has promis\u2019d good to me,\nHe will my shield and portion be,\nYes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\nI shall possess, within the veil,\nA life of joy and peace.\nThe earth shall soon dissolve like snow,\nBut God, who call\u2019d me here below,\nWhen we\u2019ve been there ten thousand years,\nWe\u2019ve no less days to sing God\u2019s praise","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"Englishman","offset":45},{"uri":"John_Newton","surface_form":"John Newton","offset":56}]}
