{"id":112621,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT","text":"WWE NXT\" is a professional wrestling promotion based in Winter Park, Florida. It is the official developmental territory for WWE.\nHistory.\nNXT was started as Florida Championship Wrestling, typically shortened to FCW Steve Keirn in 2007 to be WWE's second developmental territory when they ended their relationship with Deep South Wrestling in 2007. It became their only developmental territory in early 2008 when they ended their relationship with Ohio Valley Wrestling.\nFCW's first show was on June 26, 2007 in Tampa, Florida. A 21 man Battle Royal was held during the show, with Harry Smith winning to become the first ever FCW Southern Heavyweight Champion. The next year, the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship was introduced, with Jake Hager becoming the first champion at a battle royal on February 15, 2008 and defeating Ted DiBiase, Jr.. The FCW Florida Tag Team Championship was also introduced in February, with the Puerto Rican Nightmares (Eddie Col\u00F3n and Eric Perez) beating Steven Lewington and Heath Miller to win it in the finals of a tournament. The two heavyweight titles were later unified, keeping the \"Florida Heavyweight\" name.\nFCW regularly ran shows every Tuesday at Bourbon Street Nightclub, as well as shows on other nights at other venues in and around the Central Florida area. As NXT Wrestling, it now runs live shows ar several locations around Florida.\nIn August 2012, WWE retired all FCW championship belts and changed the promotion's name to \"NXT\". WWE had previously used NXT for a reality television program that featured FCW wrestlers trying to earn a WWE contract. \"WWE NXT\", which had been the name of the reality show, is now used as the title of their TV show.\nSince it started a TV show at Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, NXT has had three championships: the NXT Championship, the NXT Tag Team Championship, and the NXT Women's Championship. In January 2017, WWE held a tournament in England to determine the first ever WWE United Kingdom Champion. The original plan was to have a WWE show in the UK, but the show has not premiered yet, so the championship is on NXT for now.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling_promotion","surface_form":"professional wrestling promotion","offset":14},{"uri":"Winter_Park%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Winter Park, Florida","offset":56},{"uri":"Farm_team","surface_form":"developmental territory","offset":97},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":125},{"uri":"Steve_Keirn","surface_form":"Steve Keirn","offset":217},{"uri":"Deep_South_Wrestling","surface_form":"Deep South Wrestling","offset":320},{"uri":"Ohio_Valley_Wrestling","surface_form":"Ohio Valley Wrestling","offset":449},{"uri":"Battle_royal_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"Battle Royal","offset":538},{"uri":"Harry_Smith_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Harry Smith","offset":582},{"uri":"FCW_Southern_Heavyweight_Championship","surface_form":"FCW Southern Heavyweight Champion","offset":627},{"uri":"FCW_Florida_Heavyweight_Championship","surface_form":"FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship","offset":681},{"uri":"Jake_Hager","surface_form":"Jake Hager","offset":739},{"uri":"Ted_DiBiase%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Ted DiBiase, Jr.","offset":831},{"uri":"FCW_Florida_Tag_Team_Championship","surface_form":"FCW Florida Tag Team Championship","offset":853},{"uri":"The_Puerto_Rican_Nightmares","surface_form":"the Puerto Rican Nightmares","offset":925},{"uri":"Eddie_Col%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Eddie Col\u00F3n","offset":954},{"uri":"Eric_Perez","surface_form":"Eric Perez","offset":970},{"uri":"Steven_Lewington","surface_form":"Steven Lewington","offset":990},{"uri":"Heath_Miller_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Heath Miller","offset":1011},{"uri":"Championship_unification","surface_form":"unified","offset":1103},{"uri":"Central_Florida","surface_form":"Central Florida","offset":1286},{"uri":"Reality_television","surface_form":"reality television","offset":1518},{"uri":"Full_Sail_University","surface_form":"Full Sail University","offset":1733},{"uri":"Winter_Park%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Winter Park, Florida","offset":1757},{"uri":"NXT_Championship","surface_form":"NXT Championship","offset":1816},{"uri":"NXT_Tag_Team_Championship","surface_form":"NXT Tag Team Championship","offset":1838},{"uri":"NXT_Women%27s_Championship","surface_form":"NXT Women's Championship","offset":1873},{"uri":"WWE_United_Kingdom_Championship","surface_form":"WWE United Kingdom Champion","offset":1977}]}
