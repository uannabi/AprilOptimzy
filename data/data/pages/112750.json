{"id":112750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid","text":"Aphids are small bugs which feed on plants. Aphids cause more plant damage than any other insects. There are over 4,000 different species of aphid.\nAbout 250 species are serious pests for agriculture and forestry as well as an annoyance for gardeners. They vary in size from 1-10\u00A0mm long.\nImportant natural enemies include the predatory lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), hoverfly larvae, lacewings (Neuroptera), larvae of the aphid midge \"Aphidoletes aphidimyza\", crab spiders, and insect-eating fungi like \"Lecanicillium lecanii\".\nAphids are found many places on earth. Aphids are most common in temperate zones.\nAphids can travel far in the air. For example, the lettuce aphid spread from New Zealand to Tasmania. They have also been spread by human transportation of infested plant materials.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"bug","offset":17},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":36},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":130},{"uri":"Pest","surface_form":"pest","offset":178},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":188},{"uri":"Forestry","surface_form":"forestry","offset":204},{"uri":"Gardener","surface_form":"gardener","offset":241},{"uri":"Millimetre","surface_form":"mm","offset":280},{"uri":"Coccinellidae","surface_form":"lady beetles","offset":337},{"uri":"Coleoptera","surface_form":"Coleoptera","offset":351},{"uri":"Coccinellidae","surface_form":"Coccinellidae","offset":363},{"uri":"Hoverfly","surface_form":"hoverfly","offset":379},{"uri":"Larvae","surface_form":"larvae","offset":388},{"uri":"Neuroptera","surface_form":"Neuroptera","offset":407},{"uri":"Midge","surface_form":"midge","offset":440},{"uri":"Crab_spider","surface_form":"crab spider","offset":472},{"uri":"Temperate_zone","surface_form":"temperate zone","offset":605},{"uri":"Lettuce_aphid","surface_form":"lettuce aphid","offset":673},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":699},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":714}]}
