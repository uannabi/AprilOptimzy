{"id":112891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Freedom","text":"The \"Statue of Freedom\" is a statue of a woman that is on top of the United States Capitol. It was made in 1863 by Thomas Crawford. The woman is a symbol - she was not an actual person but stands for the idea of freedom. She is holding a shield and a laurel wreath in one hand. In the other hand, she is holding a sword that is sheathed (in its case).\nThe statue stands on the peak of the dome, beckoning ideas and statutes that will be for the good of America and humanity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":29},{"uri":"United_States_Capitol","surface_form":"United States Capitol","offset":69},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":147},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":212},{"uri":"Laurel_wreath","surface_form":"laurel wreath","offset":251}]}
