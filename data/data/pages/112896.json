{"id":112896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution","text":"A buffer solution is chemical solution which resists change to its pH or acidity.\nIt is a solution in water of a mixture of a weak acid or base and its salt. The pH of the solution changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications. Many life forms have a relatively small pH range; an example of a buffer solution is blood.\nBuffer solutions may be of two types: acidic and basic.\nIf you add acid to the solution, the concentration of H+ ions will increase; to keep equilibrium a small number of ions will be combined (forming salt and reducing the concentration of H+ ion in the solution). If you add base the concentration of H+ ion will reduce (by consumption or combining) and so a small amount of salt will break into ions and maintain the pH.\nBuffer index is the number of moles of acid or base added to 1 litre of buffer solution to change its ph by 1 unit","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":67},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":90},{"uri":"Weak_acid","surface_form":"weak acid","offset":126},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":139},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":162},{"uri":"Strong_acid","surface_form":"strong acid","offset":224},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":467}]}
