North Korea withdrew in 2003.\nTerms.\nThe treaty says that only five countries are allowed to have nuclear weapons. These are called nuclear weapons states. The five nuclear weapons states are China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia. All five of these nations have all signed the treaty. They are not supposed to help any other nation build nuclear weapons. All other nations who sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty promise not to build more nuclear weapons for themselves or others.\nThe treaty also says that every nation is able to build nuclear power plants and have nuclear technology. However, nations who sign the treaty, but are not nuclear weapons states, promise to not use their nuclear power plants to make nuclear weapons.\nThe main corporations that made this treaty happen were the United Nations and the IAEA.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":52},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapons","surface_form":"nuclear weapons","offset":81},{"uri":"1968","surface_form":"1968","offset":133},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":161},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":250},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":257},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":265},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"South Sudan","offset":274},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":287},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapons_states","surface_form":"nuclear weapons states","offset":419},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":479},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":486},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":498},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":518},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":537},{"uri":"Nuclear_power","surface_form":"nuclear power","offset":857},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1112},{"uri":"IAEA","surface_form":"IAEA","offset":1135}]}
