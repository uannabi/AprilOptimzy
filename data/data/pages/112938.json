{"id":112938,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Cape","text":"e=\"preserve\">North West Cape is a large piece of land on the north west coast of Western Australia. There are mountains called the Cape Range through the middle of the peninsula and Ningaloo Reef is on the western edge. The town of Exmouth is also on the North West Cape.\nIn 1618, Dutch East India Company captain Lenaert Jacobszoon and Willem Janszoon from the boat \"Mauritius\" landed in the area. Phillip Parker King visited in 1818 and named it \"North West Cape\". He also named Exmouth Gulf after a Royal Navy officer, Edward Pellew, First Viscount Exmouth (1758 -1833).\nLater, pearl boats visited the area from Broome.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":81},{"uri":"Cape_Range_National_Park","surface_form":"Cape Range","offset":131},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":168},{"uri":"Ningaloo_Reef","surface_form":"Ningaloo Reef","offset":182},{"uri":"Exmouth%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Exmouth","offset":232},{"uri":"1618","surface_form":"1618","offset":275},{"uri":"Dutch_East_India_Company","surface_form":"Dutch East India Company","offset":281},{"uri":"Lenaert_Jacobszoon","surface_form":"Lenaert Jacobszoon","offset":314},{"uri":"Willem_Janszoon","surface_form":"Willem Janszoon","offset":337},{"uri":"Phillip_Parker_King","surface_form":"Phillip Parker King","offset":399},{"uri":"Exmouth_Gulf","surface_form":"Exmouth Gulf","offset":481},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":502},{"uri":"Pearl","surface_form":"pearl","offset":581},{"uri":"Broome%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Broome","offset":615}]}
