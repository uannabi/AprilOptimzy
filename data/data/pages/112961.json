{"id":112961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WilliamsF1","text":"WilliamsF1, the trading name of Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd., is a Formula One (F1) motor racing team and constructor. It was founded and run by Sir Frank Williams and Patrick Head. The team was formed in 1977 after two earlier and, compared with WilliamsF1's achievements, unsuccessful F1 operations, Frank Williams Racing Cars and Walter Wolf Racing. All of WilliamsF1 chassis are called \"FW\" then a number, the FW being the initials of team owner, Frank Williams.\nWilliams' first race was the Argentine Grand Prix, and Switzerland's Clay Regazzoni won Williams' first race at the British Grand Prix. At the British Grand Prix, Canadian Jacques Villeneuve won the team's 100th race, making Williams one of only three teams in Formula One, alongside Ferrari and fellow British team McLaren, to win 100 races. Williams won nine Constructor's titles between 1980 and 1997. This stood as a record until Ferrari surpassed it in 2000.\nMany famous racing drivers have driven for Williams, including Finland's Keke Rosberg; Britain's Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill; France's Alain Prost and Brazil's Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, and Canada's Jacques Villeneuve, each of whom, with the exception of Senna, have captured one Drivers' title with the team. After Senna died in a Williams car in a crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, Frank Williams, Patrick Head and designer Adrian Newey were all accused of manslaughter. The trial finally closed in 2005, when Williams, Head and Newey were all cleared of any wrongdoing.\nWilliams have worked with many notable engine manufacturers, most successfully with Renault: Williams won five of their nine constructors' titles with the French company. Along with Ferrari, McLaren, and Renault (formerly Benetton), Williams is one of the \"Big Four\" teams that have won every constructors' championship since 1979 and every driver's championship since 1984. Williams remains the only one independently owned, as the other three are \"factory teams\" either setup or bought out by major auto manufacturers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":75},{"uri":"Motor_racing","surface_form":"motor racing","offset":92},{"uri":"Frank_Williams","surface_form":"Sir Frank Williams","offset":153},{"uri":"Patrick_Head","surface_form":"Patrick Head","offset":176},{"uri":"1977_Formula_One_season","surface_form":"1977","offset":213},{"uri":"Frank_Williams_Racing_Cars","surface_form":"Frank Williams Racing Cars","offset":310},{"uri":"Walter_Wolf_Racing","surface_form":"Walter Wolf Racing","offset":341},{"uri":"Argentine_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Argentine Grand Prix","offset":504},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":530},{"uri":"Clay_Regazzoni","surface_form":"Clay Regazzoni","offset":544},{"uri":"British_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"British Grand Prix","offset":591},{"uri":"British_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"British Grand Prix","offset":618},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":638},{"uri":"Jacques_Villeneuve","surface_form":"Jacques Villeneuve","offset":647},{"uri":"Scuderia_Ferrari","surface_form":"Ferrari","offset":759},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":778},{"uri":"McLaren","surface_form":"McLaren","offset":791},{"uri":"List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions","surface_form":"Constructor's titles","offset":836},{"uri":"1980_Formula_One_season","surface_form":"1980","offset":865},{"uri":"1997_Formula_One_season","surface_form":"1997","offset":874},{"uri":"Scuderia_Ferrari","surface_form":"Ferrari","offset":909},{"uri":"2002_Formula_One_season","surface_form":"2000","offset":933},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":1002},{"uri":"Keke_Rosberg","surface_form":"Keke Rosberg","offset":1012},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Britain's","offset":1026},{"uri":"Nigel_Mansell","surface_form":"Nigel Mansell","offset":1036},{"uri":"Damon_Hill","surface_form":"Damon Hill","offset":1054},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1066},{"uri":"Alain_Prost","surface_form":"Alain Prost","offset":1075},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1091},{"uri":"Nelson_Piquet","surface_form":"Nelson Piquet","offset":1100},{"uri":"Ayrton_Senna","surface_form":"Ayrton Senna","offset":1118},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1136},{"uri":"Jacques_Villeneuve","surface_form":"Jacques Villeneuve","offset":1145},{"uri":"List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions","surface_form":"Drivers' title","offset":1226},{"uri":"1994_San_Marino_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"1994 San Marino Grand Prix","offset":1309},{"uri":"Adrian_Newey","surface_form":"Adrian Newey","offset":1379},{"uri":"Manslaughter","surface_form":"manslaughter","offset":1412},{"uri":"Renault_F1","surface_form":"Renault","offset":1610},{"uri":"Scuderia_Ferrari","surface_form":"Ferrari","offset":1708},{"uri":"McLaren","surface_form":"McLaren","offset":1717},{"uri":"Renault_F1","surface_form":"Renault","offset":1730},{"uri":"Benetton_Formula","surface_form":"Benetton","offset":1748}]}
