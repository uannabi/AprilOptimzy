{"id":112987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport","text":"London Heathrow Airport, or Heathrow, is the main, and busiest airport serving the United Kingdom. Heathrow is also Europe's busiest airport for passenger traffic, and handles more international passenger traffic than any other airport in the world.\nHeathrow is owned and operated by BAA Limited, which also owns/operates six other UK airports and is itself owned by an international group led by the Spanish Ferrovial Group. Heathrow is the main hub of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic.\nHeathrow is in the London Borough of Hillingdon, west of Central London, England, Heathrow has two parallel main runways running east-west and five terminals. The site covers 12.14 square kilometres (4.69 square miles). Terminal 5 was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 March 2008 and opened to passengers on 27 March 2008. Terminal 2 opened in 2014, and Terminals 3 and 4 will be refurbished during this period. In November 2007 a consultation process began for the building of a new third runway.\nHeathrow Airport has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P527) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction.\nRunway use.\nCurrently, 1 runway is used for takeoff and another used for landing, depending on the approach path used at the time. Approaching planes are normally cycled between two options at 12 hour intervals in order to reduce noise and environmental impacts for residents. In the future, BAA are considering changing to \"Mixed mode\" where both runways are used for landing and takeoff. This would boost space.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_busiest_airports_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"busiest","offset":55},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":63},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":83},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":116},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":145},{"uri":"BAA_Limited","surface_form":"BAA Limited","offset":284},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":332},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":401},{"uri":"Ferrovial","surface_form":"Ferrovial Group","offset":409},{"uri":"Airline_hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":447},{"uri":"British_Airways","surface_form":"British Airways","offset":454},{"uri":"Virgin_Atlantic","surface_form":"Virgin Atlantic","offset":474},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Hillingdon","surface_form":"London Borough of Hillingdon","offset":510},{"uri":"Central_London","surface_form":"Central London","offset":548},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":564},{"uri":"Parallel","surface_form":"parallel","offset":590},{"uri":"Runway","surface_form":"runway","offset":604},{"uri":"Airport_terminal","surface_form":"terminals","offset":639},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":747},{"uri":"Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"CAA","offset":1024}]}
