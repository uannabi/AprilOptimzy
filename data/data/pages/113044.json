{"id":113044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajouri_District","text":"Rajouri () is a District in Jammu and Kashmir, Kashmir, Pakistan. Since it borders the Republic of India's side of the Line of Control, it is the site of infiltration and militant activity. Rajouri is also notable for the presence of many Gujjar and Bakerwal villages, particularly towards the Pir Panjal mountain range.\nThe District has 7 Tehsils (towns) namely Rajouri Tehsil, Darhal Tehsil, Nowshera Tehsil, Sunderbani Tehsil, Kalakote Tehsil, Budhal Tehsil and Thannamandi Tehsil and 7 Blocks of Rajouri, Manjakote, Darhal, Budhal, Kalakote, Sunderbani and Nowshera. There is diversity in the religious practices of the residents of these various towns with some being predominantly Hindu and others with Muslim majorities. The presence of militancy has affected the composition in most Muslim majority regions that are closer to the border. In overall, per official 1981 estimates, the population as divided by religion is 58% Muslim, 39% Hindu, 2% Sikh and 1% buddhist. This composition has since likely changed dramatically due to militancy having forced substantial minority communities to the Hindu dominated districts near Jammu. Rajouri district is famous for its local cheez all over the state along with milk product's, one of the famous dish in rajouri is \"makki di roti\" (i.e maize bread),most of the people's are farmer's and they do subsistence framing (edited by sachin sharma lpu).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jammu_and_Kashmir","surface_form":"Jammu and Kashmir","offset":28},{"uri":"Gujjar","surface_form":"Gujjar","offset":239},{"uri":"Rajouri_Tehsil","surface_form":"Rajouri Tehsil","offset":363},{"uri":"Darhal_Tehsil","surface_form":"Darhal Tehsil","offset":379},{"uri":"Nowshera_Tehsil","surface_form":"Nowshera Tehsil","offset":394},{"uri":"Sunderbani_Tehsil","surface_form":"Sunderbani Tehsil","offset":411},{"uri":"Kalakote_Tehsil","surface_form":"Kalakote Tehsil","offset":430},{"uri":"Budhal_Tehsil","surface_form":"Budhal Tehsil","offset":447},{"uri":"Thannamandi_Tehsil","surface_form":"Thannamandi Tehsil","offset":465}]}
