Spafford wrote the song right after his four daughters died by the sinking of the \"S.S. Ville Du Havre\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hymn","surface_form":"hymn","offset":818},{"uri":"Hymnist","surface_form":"hymnist","offset":834},{"uri":"Horatio_Spafford","surface_form":"Horatio Spafford","offset":842},{"uri":"Compose","surface_form":"compose","offset":863},{"uri":"Philip_Bliss","surface_form":"Philip Bliss","offset":875}]}
