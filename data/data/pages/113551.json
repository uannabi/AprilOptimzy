{"id":113551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistosaurus","text":"Pistosaurus is a genus of marine sauropterygian reptiles. It is a Nothosaur, a relative of the plesiosaurs.\n\"Pistosaurus\" was a advanced nothosaur-like body with a plesiosaur-like head. Is presently known only from the Middle Triassic. Even if it is a nothosaur it is acknowledged to be closely related to the ancestors of plesiosaurs.\nThe head also resembled that of a plesiosaur, but with the primitive palate of a nothosaur, and numerous, sharp teeth ideal for catching and eating fish.\nAlthough it is unlikely that \"Pistosaurus\" was a direct ancestor of the plesiosaurs, the mixture of features suggests that it was closely related to that group.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":17},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":26},{"uri":"Sauropterygia","surface_form":"sauropterygia","offset":33},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":48},{"uri":"Nothosaur","surface_form":"Nothosaur","offset":66},{"uri":"Plesiosaur","surface_form":"plesiosaur","offset":95},{"uri":"Nothosaur","surface_form":"nothosaur","offset":137},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":226},{"uri":"Palate","surface_form":"palate","offset":405}]}
