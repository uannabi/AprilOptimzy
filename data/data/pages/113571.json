It was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley for the London North Eastern Railway. 35 locomotives were built in total.\nThey were designed to be very fast and had a very sleek shape. One of them, 4468 \"Mallard\", is the fastest steam locomotive ever made. It set a world speed record of 125 mph (201.16 km/h) on July 3, 1938.\nSix A4s still exist today. The rest were scrapped when steam stopped being used to power trains in Britain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Steam","surface_form":"steam","offset":32},{"uri":"Locomotive","surface_form":"locomotive","offset":38},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":57}]}
