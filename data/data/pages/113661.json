Each player wore a patch on their jersey throughout the 1992\u201393 regular season and playoffs to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the Stanley Cup. Twenty-four teams played 84 games each. It proved, at the time, to be the highest-scoring regular season in NHL history, as a total of 7,311 goals were scored. Twenty of the twenty-four teams scored three goals or more per game, and only two teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks, allowed fewer than three goals per game. Only 63 shutouts were recorded during the regular season. The Montreal Canadiens won their league-leading 24th Cup by defeating the Los Angeles Kings four games to one. As of the end of the 2007\u201308 season, this is the last time that a Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup.\nFinal standings.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points\"\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n\"Note: x = clinched playoff berth, z = won Presidents' Trophy\"\nChicago vs. St. Louis.\n\"St. Louis wins best-of-seven series 4\u20130\"\nCalgary vs. Los Angeles.\n\"Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4\u20132\"\nPittsburgh vs. New York Islanders.\n\"New York Islanders win best-of-seven series 4\u20133\"\nVancouver vs. Los Angeles.\n\"Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4\u20132\"\nToronto vs. Los Angeles.\n\"Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4\u20133\"\nMontreal vs. Los Angeles.\n\"Montreal wins best-of-seven series 4\u20131.
