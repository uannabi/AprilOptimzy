{"id":113738,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_(currency)","text":"=\"preserve\">A mill, mil or mille is 1/10th of a US cent or 1/1000th of a US Dollar. In the United States, it is most used in gasoline prices. For example $4.119 per US gallon. $0.009 is equal to nine mils. It is also used when discussing taxes on land and prices of electricity.\nI was born in the US in 1950, and raised in the US. When I was a child probably some age less than 10, there were plastic \u2018coins\u2019 called \u2018Mils\u2019. The red \u2018Mils\u2019 were 1/10 of a cent. The green \u2018Mils\u2019 were worth 5/10 (1/2) of a cent. I have a green one. My mother with 7 children was always afraid one of us might swallow one and it would not be able to be seen on the then x-ray machines. So we would be in medical danger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":48},{"uri":"Cent_(currency)","surface_form":"cent","offset":51},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"US Dollar","offset":73},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"gasoline","offset":125},{"uri":"US_gallon","surface_form":"US gallon","offset":165},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":238},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":266}]}
