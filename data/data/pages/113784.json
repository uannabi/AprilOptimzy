{"id":113784,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor","text":"Johor (last time known as Johore, Jawi script: \u062C\u0648\u0647\u0631) is a state of Malaysia. It is one of the most developed states in Malaysia. The capital city and royal seat of Johor is Johor Bahru, once known as Tanjung Puteri. The old state capital is Johor Lama. The Arabic honorific of the state is Darul Ta'zim (\"Abode of Dignity'). Johor is surrounded by Pahang to the north, Melaka and Negeri Sembilan to the northwest, and the Straits of Johor to the south which is divided by the international border between Malaysia and the Republic of Singapore. Tanjung Piai, in the district of Pontian, is the most southerly point of mainland Asia.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Johor\" came from the Arabic word \"Jauhar\", 'gem/precious stone'. Before the name Johor was taken up, the area south of the Muar River to Singapore island was known as \"Ujung Tanah\" or 'land's end' in Malay, due to its location at the end of the Malay Peninsula. Coincidentally, Johor is the most southerly point of the Asian continental mainland.\nPorts.\nJohor has three ports: Pasir Gudang Port, Port of Tanjung Pelepas and Tanjung Langsat Port.\nAirports.\nJohor has one international airport, the Senai International Airport in Senai. It was opened on 6 June 1974 and has been expanded several times ever since. Currently, it has a 5 million passenger capacity with parallel taxiway under construction.\nThe airport is also a regional hub of AirAsia, a regional low-cost no-frills airline. Malaysia Airlines also operate flights from Senai airport to some local and international destinations.\nMonarchy.\nJohor is a constitutional monarchy. It was the first state in Malaysia which adopted the constitutional monarchy system, and its laws are stated in \"Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor\" (Johor State Establishment Constitution), written by Sultan Abu Bakar. The constitutional head of Johor is the Sultan. This position can only be passed down and held by a member of the Johor Royal Family, who is descended from Sultan Abu Bakar. The State's Sultan since 1981 has been Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj.\nJohor was the first state and currently the only state in Malaysia that has its own military force called Johor Military Force or 'Timbalan Setia Negeri'. It is a private army of the Sultan of Johor paid by the state government.\nState government.\nThe state government is led by the Chief Minister or Menteri Besar. The current Chief Minister is Dato' Abdul Ghani Othman, a former civil servant. The Chief Minister is assisted by an executive council (exco), whose members are selected from the state assembly members.\nThe legislative branch of Johor's government is the Johor State Assembly. The state assembly makes laws in matters on the state. Members of the assembly are elected every five years in an election.\nNational parks and forest reserves.\nJohor is also known for its national parks. Johor currently has five national parks, with a combined area of more than 700\u00A0km\u00B2 and several smaller recreational forest. Almost all recreational parks are based around a mountain. Johor also has the third largest mangrove forest reserve in Peninsular Malaysia (167\u00A0km\u00B2).\nPhysical.\nIn the official census of 2010, the population of Johor was 3.35 million people with 48% Malays, 40% Chinese, 8% Indians and 4% others. It is the fifth largest state (18,984\u00A0km\u00B2) of Malaysia. It is the southernmost state in Peninsular Malaysia being South of Melaka, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang and North of Straits of Johor. The highest point in Johor is Gunung (mountain) Ledang (1276 m). Gunung Ledang is also known as Mount Ophir. Johor is the only state in Malaysia which has a 400\u00A0km beach stretching on both the East and the West coast.\nJohor has 8 large islands with numerous smaller ones.\nWeather.\nJohor experiences wet equatorial weather with monsoon rain from Nov until Feb blowing from the South China Sea. Average annual rainfall is 1778\u00A0mm with average temperature of between 25.5\u00A0\u00B0C (78\u00A0\u00B0F) and 27.8\u00A0\u00B0C (82\u00A0\u00B0F). Humidity is between 82 and 86%.\nHundred Year Peak Rain Fall.\nOn 19 December 2006, continuously heavy downpour occurred in Johor. Many towns such as Muar, Kota Tinggi and Segamat were seriously flooded with water levels as high as above ground level recorded in some areas. 15 lives were lost and many possessions were destroyed and this resulted in huge financial losses in Johor. More than 100,000 victims were evacuated to flood relief centres.\nLinks to Singapore.\nJohor is connected to Singapore by two roads: the Johor-Singapore Causeway and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link.\nThe Johor-Singapore Causeway (length: 1038\u00A0m) was designed by Messrs Coode, Fizmaurice, Wilson and Mitchell of Westminster, while the construction contract was awarded to Topham, Jones & Railton Ltd of London. It started in 1909 as a railway link by Johor State Railway to connect Johor Bahru to Singapore, then the administrative headquarters of British interests in South-East Asia. Construction of the road section started in 1919 and was completed in 1923.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jawi","surface_form":"Jawi","offset":34},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":67},{"uri":"Johor_Bahru","surface_form":"Johor Bahru","offset":173},{"uri":"Pahang","surface_form":"Pahang","offset":348},{"uri":"Melaka","surface_form":"Melaka","offset":369},{"uri":"Negeri_Sembilan","surface_form":"Negeri Sembilan","offset":380},{"uri":"Straits_of_Johor","surface_form":"Straits of Johor","offset":422},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Republic of Singapore","offset":522},{"uri":"Tanjung_Piai","surface_form":"Tanjung Piai","offset":545},{"uri":"Pontian","surface_form":"Pontian","offset":578},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"mainland Asia","offset":618},{"uri":"Muar_River","surface_form":"Muar River","offset":775},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":789},{"uri":"Malay_Peninsula","surface_form":"Malay Peninsula","offset":897},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asian continental mainland","offset":971},{"uri":"Pasir_Gudang","surface_form":"Pasir Gudang","offset":1029},{"uri":"Port_of_Tanjung_Pelepas","surface_form":"Port of Tanjung Pelepas","offset":1048},{"uri":"Tanjung_Langsat_Port","surface_form":"Tanjung Langsat Port","offset":1076},{"uri":"Senai_International_Airport","surface_form":"Senai International Airport","offset":1149},{"uri":"Airline_hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":1386},{"uri":"AirAsia","surface_form":"AirAsia","offset":1393},{"uri":"Malaysia_Airlines","surface_form":"Malaysia Airlines","offset":1441},{"uri":"Constitutional_monarchy","surface_form":"constitutional monarchy","offset":1566},{"uri":"Undang-undang_Tubuh_Negeri_Johor","surface_form":"Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor","offset":1704},{"uri":"Sultan_Abu_Bakar_of_Johor","surface_form":"Sultan Abu Bakar","offset":1791},{"uri":"Sultan","surface_form":"Sultan","offset":1849},{"uri":"Johor_Royal_Family","surface_form":"Johor Royal Family","offset":1923},{"uri":"Sultan_Abu_Bakar_of_Johor","surface_form":"Sultan Abu Bakar","offset":1965},{"uri":"Iskandar_of_Johor","surface_form":"Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj","offset":2022},{"uri":"Johor_State_Assembly","surface_form":"Johor State Assembly","offset":2616},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":3308},{"uri":"Peninsular_Malaysia","surface_form":"Peninsular Malaysia","offset":3350},{"uri":"Melaka","surface_form":"Melaka","offset":3385},{"uri":"Negeri_Sembilan","surface_form":"Negeri Sembilan","offset":3393},{"uri":"Pahang","surface_form":"Pahang","offset":3413},{"uri":"Straits_of_Johor","surface_form":"Straits of Johor","offset":3433},{"uri":"South_China_Sea","surface_form":"South China Sea","offset":3827},{"uri":"19_December","surface_form":"19 December","offset":4016},{"uri":"Muar","surface_form":"Muar","offset":4100},{"uri":"Kota_Tinggi","surface_form":"Kota Tinggi","offset":4106},{"uri":"Segamat","surface_form":"Segamat","offset":4122},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":4441},{"uri":"Johor-Singapore_Causeway","surface_form":"Johor-Singapore Causeway","offset":4469},{"uri":"Malaysia-Singapore_Second_Link","surface_form":"Malaysia-Singapore Second Link","offset":4502},{"uri":"Johor-Singapore_Causeway","surface_form":"Johor-Singapore Causeway","offset":4538},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":4645},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":4736}]}
