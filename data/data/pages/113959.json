{"id":113959,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanfen","text":"Kanfen is a village in France near Thionville. It is in the Lorraine Region, in the moselle department, in north-eastern France. The population as of 2007 is about 996.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe first mention of the village is under the name \"Cantevanne\", in a 1239 text. Later it became Kaufen. In 1801, it changed to Kanfen. The name stayed the same when Alsace-Moselle became part of the German Empire in 1870.\nThe most likely etymology is a contraction of the Gaulish word \"canto\" (mountain) and the Germanic radical \"Fenn\" (marshland).\nHistory of the commune.\nKanfen and all of the Thionville region was dependent of the Duchy of Luxembourg. Le Grand Cond\u00E9 took Thionville in 1643. The village became part of the Kingdom of France. This was confirmed by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.\nAs it was part of Alsace-Moselle, the commune was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. It was annexed by the Third Reich between 1940 and 1944.\nGeography.\nKanfen is next to the Kudertsberg hill, around 230 metres high. The river Kiesel has its source in the village flows through it.\nThe commune is 12 km north of Thionville and 20\u00A0km south of the city of Luxembourg. It is only a few kilometres away from the border with Luxembourg.\nThe commune regroups Kanfen and Kanfen-sous-Bois.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["French commune"],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":23},{"uri":"Thionville","surface_form":"Thionville","offset":35},{"uri":"Lorraine_(region)","surface_form":"Lorraine Region","offset":60},{"uri":"Moselle","surface_form":"moselle","offset":84},{"uri":"Alsace-Moselle","surface_form":"Alsace-Moselle","offset":355},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":389},{"uri":"Etymology","surface_form":"etymology","offset":428},{"uri":"Gaul","surface_form":"Gaul","offset":462},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":484},{"uri":"Germanic_languages","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":502},{"uri":"Radical","surface_form":"radical","offset":511},{"uri":"Marshland","surface_form":"marshland","offset":527},{"uri":"Thionville","surface_form":"Thionville","offset":585},{"uri":"Duchy","surface_form":"Duchy","offset":624},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":633},{"uri":"Louis_de_Bourbon%2C_Prince_of_Cond%C3%A9","surface_form":"Le Grand Cond\u00E9","offset":645},{"uri":"Early_Modern_France","surface_form":"Kingdom of France","offset":716},{"uri":"Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees","surface_form":"Treaty of the Pyrenees","offset":761},{"uri":"Alsace-Moselle","surface_form":"Alsace-Moselle","offset":811},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":855},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexed","offset":895},{"uri":"Third_Reich","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":910},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":990},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1024},{"uri":"Source","surface_form":"source","offset":1045},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":1059},{"uri":"Km","surface_form":"km","offset":1103},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":1106},{"uri":"Thionville","surface_form":"Thionville","offset":1115},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":1136},{"uri":"Luxembourg_City","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":1157},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":1211},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":1223}]}
