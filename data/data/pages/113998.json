{"id":113998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Y chromosome is a chromosome that decides the sex in most mammals, including humans. It contains the gene \"SRY\", which triggers testis development, so making an animal male or female.\nNormal females have two X chromosomes, and normal males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":35},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":75},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":94},{"uri":"Testicle","surface_form":"testis","offset":145},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"egg","offset":282},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":319}]}
