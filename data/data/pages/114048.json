{"id":114048,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather_Linux","text":"Feather Linux, created by Robert Sullivan, is a Knoppix-based Linux distribution which fits in under 128 MB (while older versions were made to fit within 64 MB). It boots from either a CD or a USB Flash Drive, into a Fluxbox desktop environment. It has a wide range of desktop and rescue software, and can load entirely into RAM or be installed to a hard drive. Feather Linux contains many GTK+ applications, such as AbiWord and Pidgin. Feather linux has tried to include software that people would frequently be using on their desktop.\nWith its most recent release being on 2005-07-04, Feather Linux is now not under development. This distribution is partly inspired by Damn Small Linux.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knoppix","surface_form":"Knoppix","offset":48},{"uri":"Linux_distribution","surface_form":"Linux distribution","offset":62},{"uri":"USB_Flash_Drive","surface_form":"USB Flash Drive","offset":193},{"uri":"Fluxbox","surface_form":"Fluxbox","offset":217},{"uri":"Random_access_memory","surface_form":"RAM","offset":325},{"uri":"GTK%2B","surface_form":"GTK+","offset":390},{"uri":"AbiWord","surface_form":"AbiWord","offset":417},{"uri":"Pidgin_(software)","surface_form":"Pidgin","offset":429},{"uri":"Damn_Small_Linux","surface_form":"Damn Small Linux","offset":671}]}
