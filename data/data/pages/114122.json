{"id":114122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_(opera)","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Fate\" (in Czech: \"Osud\"), is an opera by the Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek.\nJan\u00E1\u010Dek wrote this opera between 1903 and 1905. His daughter Olga had died shortly before he began to compose it. He had also just finished his opera \"Jen\u016Ffa\" which has a tragic ending for the young girl in the story.\nThe young lady who wrote the libretto (words) for Jan\u00E1\u010Dek had been one of his daughter\u2019s close friends. She wrote using the name T\u00E1lsk\u00E1. Jan\u00E1\u010Dek thought the opera had autobiographical ideas. He also wanted a change from writing about simple, country people as he had done in \"Jen\u016Ffa\", so the people in the story of \"Fate\" belong to the upper classes, the rich people of society.\nThe story of the opera is quite strange and unbelievable. It has often been criticized for not being logical. The story consists of lots of little scenes which make the story jump about. The language of the libretto is very deliberately old-fashioned. Czech people who have worked with this opera have often felt that this formal language has made it hard for audiences to understand. Some people have felt that when the opera is sung in other languages it is sometimes better because the language sounds more real.\nNevertheless, although the opera has had these criticisms, the music is some of the best music that Jan\u00E1\u010Dek wrote.\nStory of the opera.\nThe story takes place at the beginning of the 20th century, which was the time in which Jan\u00E1\u010Dek was composing it.\nIn Act I Gentlemen, students and young girls are walking about in a health resort. The men are interested in a girl called M\u00EDla. M\u00EDla sees a young man called \u017Divn\u00FD in the crowd. \u017Divn\u00FD is a composer. He and M\u00EDla used to be lovers. They had a child. She tells \u017Divn\u00FD that it was her mother who made them split up so that she could marry someone rich. Her mother had made her move away from Prague to give birth to the child in the country. The two lovers now want to forget their unhappy past and live together with their little son Doubek.\nAct II takes place several years later. They have been living together happily. M\u00EDla\u2019s mother lives with them but has gone mad. While the lovers read the story of an opera which seems to tell of their own lives, the mother screams and \u017Divn\u00FD tears up the music of the opera. The mother grabs her daughter and throws herself and M\u00EDla down the steep staircase.\nAct III takes place in a music conservatory eleven years later. \u017Divn\u00FD\u2019s students, one of whom is their son Doubek, are singing music from an opera that \u017Divn\u00FD has composed. \u017Divn\u00FD himself is like the hero of his opera. The last part of the opera has not yet been composed. The students act out a scene from Doubek\u2019s childhood and make fun of it. \u017Divn\u00FD talks about his opera. A storm comes up and he is killed by lightning. His opera will never be finished.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":46},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":59},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":65},{"uri":"Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek","surface_form":"Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek","offset":74},{"uri":"1903","surface_form":"1903","offset":121},{"uri":"1905","surface_form":"1905","offset":130},{"uri":"Jen%C5%AFfa","surface_form":"Jen\u016Ffa","offset":239},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":335},{"uri":"Autobiographical","surface_form":"autobiographical","offset":473},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":937},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1382},{"uri":"Health_resort","surface_form":"health resort","offset":1518},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":1639},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":1837},{"uri":"Countryside","surface_form":"country","offset":1878},{"uri":"Music_conservatory","surface_form":"music conservatory","offset":2371}]}
