{"id":114124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Allosaur","text":"=\"preserve\">Dwarf Allosaur is a bone from a theropod dinosaur that lived in Australia about 106 million years ago in the Cretaceous period. It may be related to \"Allosaurus\" but is smaller and lived 30 million years after all other allosaurs had gone extinct. As it is known only from a single bone nothing more can be said.\nBesides its poor fossil record, it is famous for appearing in the BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":44},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":53},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":76},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":121},{"uri":"Period_(geology)","surface_form":"period","offset":132},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":162},{"uri":"Walking_with_Dinosaurs","surface_form":"Walking with Dinosaurs","offset":413}]}
