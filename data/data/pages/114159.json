{"id":114159,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari%C3%A8ge_(department)","text":"Ari\u00E8ge (;) is a department in the region of Occitanie in southern France; it is named after the Ari\u00E8ge river that flows through the department.\nIts capital is the city of Foix but the city with the largest population is Pamiers.\nHistory.\nThe department was inhabited in prehistoric times, as evidenced by the presence of caves with cave paintings and dolmens. In historical times it was inhabited by Basque people; they settled on the northern side of the Pyrenees and in the valleys below. In 415 it became part of the kingdom of the Visigoths, until their defeat at the hands of the king of the Franks in 507.\nAri\u00E8ge was created in 1790 during the French Revolution, when the whole of France was divided into departments, replacing the old provinces. Ari\u00E8ge was created combining the counties of Foix (Languedoc) and Couserans (Gascogne).\nGeography.\nAri\u00E8ge is part of the Occitanie region and has an area of.\nThe department is surrounded by the French departments of Haute-Garonne to the west and north, Aude to the east, and Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales in the southeast, as well as Spain (Lleida) and Andorra in the south.\nNatural regions.\nThe highest mountain in the department is the \"Pica d'Estats\" () that is high and is on the Spain-France border. Other high mountains are the \"peak of Montcalm\" (3,077 m) and the \"Pic de Sotllo\" (3,072 m).\nThe main river is the Ari\u00E8ge river, a tributary of the Garonne river. Another important river is the L\u00E8ze, a tributary of the Ari\u00E8ge.\nClimate.\nTemperatures are mild in the foothills, e.g. at the city of Foix (400\u00A0metres) the average is 5\u00A0\u00B0C in January and 19\u00A0\u00B0C in July. However, they decline rapidly with elevation, e.g. at l'Hospitalet-pr\u00E8s-l'Andorre (1,430\u00A0m) it is 0\u00A0\u00B0C in January and 14\u00A0\u00B0C in July.\nAdministration.\nThe department is managed by the \"Departamental Council of the Ari\u00E8ge\" in Foix. Ari\u00E8ge is part of the region of Occitanie.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThere are 3 \"arrondissements\" (districts), 13 \"cantons\" and 332 \"communes\" (municipalities) in Ari\u00E8ge.\nDemographics.\nThe inhabitants of Ari\u00E8ge are known, in French, as \"ari\u00E8geois\" (women: \"ari\u00E8geoises\").\nAri\u00E8ge has a population, in 2014, of 152,574, for a population density of inhabitants/km2. The \"arrondissement\" of Pamiers, with 73,702 inhabitants, is by far the one with more inhabitants. The other two, Foix and Saint-Girons, have respectively 51,473 and 27,399 inhabitants.\nEvolution of the population in Ari\u00E8ge\nAbout 25% of the population lives in the four \"communes\" with 6,000 or more inhabitants.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is an important activity in Ariege. Only a small part of its territory is used by farmers; only, 27% of its total area, are used for agriculture in the Ariege.\nThe Ari\u00E8ge plain is the most fertile area of the department; here farmers grow maize, wheat, sunflower and other crops. The other natural regions are not good for agriculture and are covered with forests or are used for pastures for sheep, cattle and horses.\nIn the Ax valleys, the mining of talc is the most typical activity. This industry is supplemented by tourism for winter sports.\nHydroelectric production is about one-fifth of the production in the Pyrenees. The hydroelectric plant at Aston has the largest annual production capacity in the Pyrenees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":16},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":34},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":44},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":66},{"uri":"Ari%C3%A8ge_(river)","surface_form":"Ari\u00E8ge river","offset":96},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":148},{"uri":"Foix","surface_form":"Foix","offset":171},{"uri":"Pamiers","surface_form":"Pamiers","offset":220},{"uri":"Pre-history","surface_form":"prehistoric times","offset":270},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":321},{"uri":"Cave_painting","surface_form":"cave painting","offset":332},{"uri":"Dolmen","surface_form":"dolmen","offset":351},{"uri":"Basque_people","surface_form":"Basque","offset":400},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":456},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":520},{"uri":"Visigoths","surface_form":"Visigoths","offset":535},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":585},{"uri":"Frank","surface_form":"Frank","offset":597},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":650},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":742},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"counties","offset":786},{"uri":"Foix","surface_form":"Foix","offset":798},{"uri":"Languedoc","surface_form":"Languedoc","offset":804},{"uri":"Couserans","surface_form":"Couserans","offset":819},{"uri":"Gascogne","surface_form":"Gascogne","offset":830},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":874},{"uri":"Haute-Garonne","surface_form":"Haute-Garonne","offset":969},{"uri":"Aude","surface_form":"Aude","offset":1006},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales","offset":1028},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1077},{"uri":"Lleida","surface_form":"Lleida","offset":1084},{"uri":"Andorra","surface_form":"Andorra","offset":1096},{"uri":"Pica_d%27Estats","surface_form":"Pica d'Estats","offset":1182},{"uri":"Pic_de_Sotllo","surface_form":"Pic de Sotllo","offset":1315},{"uri":"Ari%C3%A8ge_(river)","surface_form":"Ari\u00E8ge","offset":1363},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1379},{"uri":"Garonne_river","surface_form":"Garonne river","offset":1396},{"uri":"L%C3%A8ze","surface_form":"L\u00E8ze","offset":1442},{"uri":"Foix","surface_form":"Foix","offset":1544},{"uri":"L%27Hospitalet-pr%C3%A8s-l%27Andorre","surface_form":"l'Hospitalet-pr\u00E8s-l'Andorre","offset":1666},{"uri":"Foix","surface_form":"Foix","offset":1835},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":1873},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"\"arrondissements\"","offset":1922},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":1941},{"uri":"Cantons_in_France","surface_form":"\"cantons\"","offset":1956},{"uri":"Communes_in_France","surface_form":"\"communes\"","offset":1974},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":1986},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":2067},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"Agriculture","offset":2527},{"uri":"Fertility","surface_form":"fertile","offset":2728},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":2765},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":2778},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":2785},{"uri":"Sunflower","surface_form":"sunflower","offset":2792},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":2812},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":2895},{"uri":"Pasture","surface_form":"pasture","offset":2919},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":2932},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":2939},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":2950},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":2981},{"uri":"Talc","surface_form":"talc","offset":2991},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":3059},{"uri":"Winter_Sports","surface_form":"winter sports","offset":3071},{"uri":"Hydroelectricity","surface_form":"Hydroelectric","offset":3086},{"uri":"Aston%2C_Ari%C3%A8ge","surface_form":"Aston","offset":3192}]}
