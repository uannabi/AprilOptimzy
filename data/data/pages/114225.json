{"id":114225,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum","text":"A pendulum is a mass (any object usually metal) on an arm. The arm is attached to a \"pivot\", which is a point to swing from. The mass will naturally hang down because of gravity, but if it is pushed to one side it will \"oscillate\", which means that it will swing from side to side. The frequency of the swinging pendulum stays the same.\nformula_1\nwhere \u03C0 (a Greek letter pronounced 'pi') is a mathematical constant. This equation gives a good approximation for the period when the mass does not swing far from the middle. The period of a pendulum does not depend on the mass of the object.\nThe mechanical energy of a pendulum is constant and is the sum of the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.\nThe regular motion of the pendulum can be used for timekeeping, and pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":16},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":170},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":286},{"uri":"Pi_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"\u03C0","offset":353},{"uri":"Kinetic_energy","surface_form":"kinetic energy","offset":660},{"uri":"Gravitational_potential_energy","surface_form":"gravitational potential energy","offset":679},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clock","offset":819}]}
