The name comes from Latin \"mandibula\".\nIn bony fish the lower jaw is made of a number of bones, but these were gradually reduced in evolution.\nIn humans and other mammals the mandible is simply the jawbone or dentary, which is the largest and strongest bone of the face.\nIn mammals bones formerly in the lower jaw have become the ear ossicles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":18},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":36},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":42},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":75},{"uri":"Bony_fish","surface_form":"bony fish","offset":97},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":218},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":308},{"uri":"Face","surface_form":"face","offset":320},{"uri":"Ear_ossicles","surface_form":"ear ossicles","offset":385}]}
