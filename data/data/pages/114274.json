{"id":114274,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petal","text":"A petal is a coloured part of a flower. With bright colours and scent, they often bring insects and birds to pollinate the flowers. Petals are made of cellulose and other organic matter.\nPetals are modified leaves which surround the reproductive parts of flowers. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called a corolla.\nThe role of petals and the evolution of flowers is an important part of botany. It has been studied from the 18th century to the present day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":32},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":88},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":100},{"uri":"Pollinate","surface_form":"pollinate","offset":109},{"uri":"Cellulose","surface_form":"cellulose","offset":151},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":207}]}
