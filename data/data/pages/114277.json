{"id":114277,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer","text":"A moisturizer (or moisturiser) is a liquid that is used for softening the skin, especially for naturally dry skins. They increase the skin's water content by reducing evaporation.\nThey can be quite a complicated chemical mixture. They may contain naturally occurring skin lipids and sterols, artificial or natural oils, emollients, lubricants,etc.\nMoisturizers are not always needed or used. They are most useful for persons with dry skin.\nMoisturizers are designed to either impart or restore hydration in the stratum corneum, which is an interactive, dynamic structure, and maintenance of hydration can impact its barrier function.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":36},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":74},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":141},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"evaporation","offset":167},{"uri":"Lipids","surface_form":"lipids","offset":272},{"uri":"Sterol","surface_form":"sterol","offset":283},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":314},{"uri":"Lubricant","surface_form":"lubricant","offset":332}]}
