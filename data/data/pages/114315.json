{"id":114315,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Diamond_and_Pearl","text":"\"Pok\u00E9mon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" are two role-playing games (RPG) made by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld. They're the fourth main group of \"Pok\u00E9mon\" games in the series. In the game, the number of Pok\u00E9mon is brought up to 493.\nA third version to \"Diamond and Pearl\" called \"Pok\u00E9mon Platinum\" was released in Japan in Autumn 2008, and released in the USA and UK on March 22, 2009.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" are much the same as previous Pok\u00E9mon games. The player starts the game with one Pok\u00E9mon, and catches more Pok\u00E9mon using Pok\u00E9 Balls. The player can also use his/her Pok\u00E9mon to battle other Pok\u00E9mon. When the player spots a Pok\u00E9mon or a trainer, the battle screen appears. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch Pok\u00E9mon, or run away from battle (the last option is not available when facing trainers). All Pok\u00E9mon have hit points (HP). If a Pok\u00E9mon's HP is down to zero, it faints and cannot battle until the player revives it. If the player's Pok\u00E9mon defeats the opponent's Pok\u00E9mon, it gets experience points. After building up enough experience points, it will gain a new level. Most Pok\u00E9mon evolve into a new form with a new name when they reach a certain level.\nPlot.\nThe player gets sent by Professor Rowan to fill up the Pok\u00E9dex, and to become the champion. The head of Team Galactic, Cyrus tries to destroy the world using Dialga or Palkia to create a new world that he will rule. In \"Pok\u00E9mon Platinum\", Giratina stops him as he is about to do it, and Cyrus then wants to capture it for its power instead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Role-playing_games","surface_form":"role-playing games","offset":38},{"uri":"Game_Freak","surface_form":"Game Freak","offset":71},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":99},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":116},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":172},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Platinum","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Platinum","offset":306},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"Autumn","offset":349},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":356},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9_Ball","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9 Ball","offset":581},{"uri":"Hit_points","surface_form":"hit points","offset":895},{"uri":"Experience_points","surface_form":"experience points","offset":1068},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9dex","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9dex","offset":1303},{"uri":"Team_Galactic","surface_form":"Team Galactic","offset":1352}]}
