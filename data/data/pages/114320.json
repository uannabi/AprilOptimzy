{"id":114320,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform","text":"e=\"preserve\">The waveform is the shape of a wave as it travels. There are many different waveforms. They are usually a shape which is repeated over and over (a \"periodic waveform\"). A common waveform is the sine wave. It is normally not possible to see a waveform without some device.\nRoot mean square.\nThe amplitude of the sine wave keeps changing from -339.4 V to +339.4 V.\nRoot mean square is important. It lets us work out many useful things, like power and heating in a wire.\nThis table has information about working out the rms for some waveforms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":33},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":44},{"uri":"Sine_wave","surface_form":"sine wave","offset":207},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":277},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":462},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":475}]}
