{"id":114327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World","text":"\"Super Mario World\" is a platform game made by Nintendo for the Super NES system. It is the fifth \"Super Mario\" game. In the game, Mario travels through seven worlds to defeat his enemy Bowser. The game adds new things that were not in the previous \"Mario\" games. Yoshi appears in this game for the first time.\n\"Super Mario World\" sold very well: it sold more than 20 million copies. Many gamers think that the game is one of the best games ever made.\nThe game was remade for the Game Boy Advance. An animated television series based on the game aired in 1991 on NBC.\nPlot.\nIn this game, Bowser has kidnapped Princess Toadstool after she, Mario, and Luigi had a vacation in Dinosaur Land. Mario and Luigi must rescue her and seven Yoshi eggs from Bowser and his Koopalings.\nGameplay.\nThis game adds several new things. One such thing is the addition of Yoshi. Yoshi has been kidnapped. When Mario releases him, he can then ride on Yoshi. Yoshi also has several other colored friends \u2013 blue, red, and yellow \u2013 which Mario must also free. While on Yoshi, Mario can make Yoshi swallow things. If Yoshi holds a blue shell, he gains wings and Mario can fly for a short time before Yoshi swallows it.\nThis game also has a new item called the cape. When Mario gets a running start, he can fly in the air and hang there for a short period of time. He can twist the cape to also knock out enemies. He can also come down at a steep angle and pound the ground to knock enemies out.\nFinally, the inventory system has been changed. Mario has one box at the top of the screen where he can store one item. If Mario goes back to small Mario, the item will start dropping right away.\nMusic.\nK\u014Dji Kond\u014D made all of the music for the game. He used only an electronic keyboard to make the songs. Some melodies were used again in later \"Mario\" games.\nAlmost all of the songs in the game are different versions of the same melody.\nReception.\nReviewers really liked \"Super Mario World\" when it came out. The game is still very much liked by reviewers today.\nIt is one of the best-selling video games ever made.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Platform_game","surface_form":"platform game","offset":25},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":47},{"uri":"Super_NES","surface_form":"Super NES","offset":64},{"uri":"Yoshi","surface_form":"Yoshi","offset":264},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance","offset":480},{"uri":"Animated_series","surface_form":"animated television series","offset":501},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":563},{"uri":"Bowser_(Nintendo)","surface_form":"Bowser","offset":588},{"uri":"Princess_Peach","surface_form":"Princess Toadstool","offset":609},{"uri":"Mario_(Nintendo)","surface_form":"Mario","offset":639},{"uri":"Luigi","surface_form":"Luigi","offset":650},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"Dinosaur","offset":674},{"uri":"Yoshi","surface_form":"Yoshi","offset":731},{"uri":"K%C5%8Dji_Kond%C5%8D","surface_form":"K\u014Dji Kond\u014D","offset":1674}]}
