The maemo project is paid for by Nokia.\nmaemo SDK.\nThe maemo SDK is based around the Debian-oriented Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit, which provides a sandbox environment in which development may take place. Scratchbox uses Qemu to emulate an ARMEL processor or sbrsh to remotely execute instructions. Scratchbox-compatible rootstraps are available for both x86 and ARMEL, so the majority of development and debugging takes place on x86, with final packaging being for ARMEL.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet_Tablet_OS","surface_form":"Internet Tablet OS","offset":83},{"uri":"Nokia","surface_form":"Nokia","offset":183},{"uri":"Debian","surface_form":"Debian","offset":235},{"uri":"Scratchbox","surface_form":"Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit","offset":251},{"uri":"Sandbox_(software_development)","surface_form":"sandbox","offset":306},{"uri":"Qemu","surface_form":"Qemu","offset":379},{"uri":"Sbrsh","surface_form":"sbrsh","offset":417},{"uri":"Rootstrap","surface_form":"rootstrap","offset":479},{"uri":"X86","surface_form":"x86","offset":513},{"uri":"Armel","surface_form":"ARMEL","offset":521}]}
