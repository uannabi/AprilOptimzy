They are part of the Central Division in the National League. The Cardinals have won a National League record 11 World Series championships, second in Major League Baseball for most championships behind the New York Yankees, who have 27. They last won a World Series in 2011.\nThe Cardinals were started by the American Association in 1882 as the St. Louis Brown Stockings, who got their name from an earlier National League team. They joined the National League in 1892 and have been known as the Cardinals ever since 1900. The Cardinals began play in the current Busch Stadium in 2006, becoming the first team since 1923 to win the World Series in their first season in a new ballpark. They are the oldest current professional sports franchise west of the Mississippi River. The Cardinals have a strong rivalry with the Chicago Cubs that began in 1885.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":74},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis, Missouri","offset":110},{"uri":"National_League_Central","surface_form":"Central Division","offset":152},{"uri":"National_League","surface_form":"National League","offset":176},{"uri":"National_League","surface_form":"National League","offset":218},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":244},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":338},{"uri":"American_Association_(19th_century)","surface_form":"American Association","offset":441},{"uri":"St._Louis_Brown_Stockings","surface_form":"an earlier National League team","offset":528},{"uri":"Busch_Stadium","surface_form":"Busch Stadium","offset":695},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":888},{"uri":"Cardinals-Cubs_rivalry","surface_form":"strong rivalry","offset":928},{"uri":"Chicago_Cubs","surface_form":"Chicago Cubs","offset":952}]}
