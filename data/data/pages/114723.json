{"id":114723,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Foibe","text":"The Massacres of Foibe are the mass killings in which the majority of victims were ethnic Italians in 1943, after the capitulation of Italy on 8 September, and in 1945, when Yugoslav partisans under the command of Tito occupied parts of Venezia Giulia, Istria and Dalmatia. Historians have claimed the violence and consequent Italian Istrian-Dalmatian exodus was a planned ethnic cleansing. National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe is Italian celebration in memory of the victims.\nNumber of killed Italian citizens.\nThe estimate is several thousand killed Italian citizens. According to a report issued in 2000 by a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission established in 1993, the number of people missing from the region, most of whom finished in the \"foibe\", alias local geological clefts, range from 1,300 to 1,600 but this estimate does not include those killed in current Croatian territory. Some of them were court-martialed fascists or enemy soldiers, but many civilian persons were also killed. The great majority of the persons killed were of Italian nationality.\nThe killings beginning after the capitulation of Italy in 1943, and the massacres of 1945 occurred partly under conditions of guerrilla fighting of Slovenian and Croatian partisans with the German and remaining Italian Fascist forces, and partially after the occupation of the territory by the army formations of Yugoslavia. Killings may have included war crimes as well as civilian crimes of private or political retaliation, as well as \"political cleansing\" and planned ethnic cleansing since 1947. Also Italian communists with Slav partisans killed Italian people; in addition to the foibe, several other carnages committed by Italian communist partisans under Palmiro Togliatti's command in the resistance movement have remained unacknowledged and undiscussed for many years.\nVictims.\nVictims were not all Italians because many killed citizen were anticommunist Croats and Slovens: many women were raped before killing. Historians like Raoul Pupo or Roberto Spazzali estimated the total number of victims at about 5,000; Guido Rumici calculates from 11,000 upwards including all people died in concentration camps; Giampaolo Pansa calculates around 15,000 always including all people died in concentration camps; fascist politician and historian Giorgio Pisan\u00F2 calculated total from 10,000 upwards. It was never possible to extract all the thousands of corpses from foibes because some of them are deeper than several hundreds meters. Until few years ago it had been able to extract from the pits just a small number of bodies, less than six hundred while other sources are attempting to compile lists of locations and possible victim numbers. Almost all historians calculate hundreds of victims real assassinated by hard pushes to foibe while the estimated number of total people killed in concentration camps is disputed and varies in thousands; probably only a part of total cadavers was hided in foibe but a lot of bodies were accumulated in mass graves. Main concentration camps were in: Borovnica, Skofja Loka, Osijek, Stara Gradiska, Sisak, Zemun, Vrsac, Osseh, Aidussina, Maribor.\nInvestigations of the foibe.\nNo investigation of the crimes had been initiated either by Italy, Yugoslavia or any international bodies, until after Slovenia became an independent country in 1991. Italian-Slovene relations in the relevant period (1880s to 1950s) have been under intensive study by historians since 1990. A joint report by a commission of historians from both countries was published under the auspices of the two governments in the year 2000. The report puts the Italian-Slovenian relations in a wider context. It touches also on the question of mass killings associated with the \"foibe\". As no exact count was ascertained, the report includes a wording of \"hundreds of victims,\" referring to the territory relevant for Italo-Slovenian relations, and thus excluding the Croatian territories.\nItalian-Slovene relationships.\nEven since Slovenia joined the European Union the relations between the two nations are a matter of political debate. The debate gained high visibility after the Italian Parliament, under Prime Minister Berlusconi and his coalition partners of centre-right provenance, made 10 February a \"National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe\", first celebrated in Trieste in 2005. The 2005 celebration of the \"Memorial Day\" was accompanied by an RAI TV movie production The Heart in the Pit (It: \"Il Cuore nel Pozzo\") [http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=2005-02-07T200856Z_01_CUT759689_RTRUKOC_0_ITALY-FOIBE.xml]. The movie was viewed by 17 million spectators on its first broadcasting in Italy alone.\nExiles from Istria and Dalmatia.\nMany Italians were forced to leave the country after massacres. Economic insecurity, fear of further retaliation and the change of regime that eventually led to the Iron Curtain splitting the Trieste-Istria region, resulted in approximately 350,000 people, mostly Italians, leaving territories in Istria and Dalmatia. The inhabitants of territories that were under Italian rule since World War I according to the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, later assigned to Yugoslavia by the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947-02-10 and the London Memorandum of 1954 were given a choice of opting to leave (optants) or staying. These exiles were to be given compensation for their loss of property and other indemnity by the Italian state under the terms of the peace treaties.\nOn February 18, 1983, Yugoslavia and Italy signed a treaty in Rome where Yugoslavia agreed to pay 110 million USD for the compensation of the exiles' property which was confiscated after the war. By its breakup in 1991 Yugoslavia paid 18 million USD. Slovenia and Croatia, two Yugoslav successors, agreed to share the remainder of this debt. Slovenia assumed 62% and Croatia the remaining 38%. Italy did not want to reveal the bank account number so in 1994 Slovenia opened a fiduciary account at Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg, informed Italy about it and started paying its 55,976,930 USD share. The last payment was paid in January 2002. Until today Croatia hopes for a different solution of this matter and has not paid a dollar yet. The Italian side has not withdrawn a single dollar from the account yet.\nCharge.\nIn 1992 Italian judge Giuseppe Pittitto started a criminal trial after a complaint against suspected Slav criminals of war. Oscar Piskulic and Ivan Motika were both principal accused but they were discharged because territorial jurisdiction was rejected and they received acquittal under the amnesty of 1959. In 1997 some Italian deputies pressed their government for extradition of suspected Slav criminals but diplomatic problems stopped Italian action. All Italian historians consider Josip Broz Tito the chief of Slav criminals, but his corpse still stays in a mausoleum.\nReferences.\nReport of the Italian-Slovene commission of historians (in three languages)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":134},{"uri":"Partisans_(Yugoslavia)","surface_form":"Yugoslav partisans","offset":174},{"uri":"Josip_Broz_Tito","surface_form":"Tito","offset":214},{"uri":"Friuli-Venezia_Giulia","surface_form":"Venezia Giulia","offset":237},{"uri":"Istria","surface_form":"Istria","offset":253},{"uri":"Dalmatia","surface_form":"Dalmatia","offset":264},{"uri":"Istrian-Dalmatian_exodus","surface_form":"Istrian-Dalmatian exodus","offset":334},{"uri":"Ethnic_cleansing","surface_form":"ethnic cleansing","offset":373},{"uri":"National_Memorial_Day_of_the_Exiles_and_Foibe","surface_form":"National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe","offset":391},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"fascist","offset":940},{"uri":"Guerrilla","surface_form":"guerrilla","offset":1208},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":1230},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":1244},{"uri":"Partisans_(Yugoslavia)","surface_form":"partisans","offset":1253},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":1272},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"Italian Fascist","offset":1293},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":1395},{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":1434},{"uri":"Ethnic_cleansing","surface_form":"ethnic cleansing","offset":1554},{"uri":"Palmiro_Togliatti","surface_form":"Palmiro Togliatti","offset":1746},{"uri":"Roberto_Spazzali","surface_form":"Roberto Spazzali","offset":2036},{"uri":"Guido_Rumici","surface_form":"Guido Rumici","offset":2107},{"uri":"Giampaolo_Pansa","surface_form":"Giampaolo Pansa","offset":2201},{"uri":"Giorgio_Pisan%C3%B2","surface_form":"Giorgio Pisan\u00F2","offset":2332},{"uri":"Mass_graves","surface_form":"mass graves","offset":3032},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":3323},{"uri":"1880s","surface_form":"1880s","offset":3421},{"uri":"1950s","surface_form":"1950s","offset":3430},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":3472},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":4025},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":4045},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian Parliament","offset":4176},{"uri":"Silvio_Berlusconi","surface_form":"Berlusconi","offset":4217},{"uri":"Trieste","surface_form":"Trieste","offset":4371},{"uri":"RAI","surface_form":"RAI","offset":4453},{"uri":"The_Heart_in_the_Pit","surface_form":"The Heart in the Pit","offset":4477},{"uri":"Iron_Curtain","surface_form":"Iron Curtain","offset":4952},{"uri":"Trieste","surface_form":"Trieste","offset":4979},{"uri":"Istria","surface_form":"Istria","offset":4987},{"uri":"Istria","surface_form":"Istria","offset":5084},{"uri":"Dalmatia","surface_form":"Dalmatia","offset":5095},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian rule","offset":5152},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":5171},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Rapallo","surface_form":"Treaty of Rapallo","offset":5200},{"uri":"Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":5245},{"uri":"Treaty_of_peace_with_Italy_(1947)","surface_form":"Paris Peace Treaty","offset":5263},{"uri":"1947-02-10","surface_form":"1947-02-10","offset":5285},{"uri":"Optants","surface_form":"optants","offset":5370},{"uri":"Treaties","surface_form":"peace treaties","offset":5525},{"uri":"Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":5563},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":5578},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":5603},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":5792},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":5805},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":6055},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":6165},{"uri":"Josip_Broz_Tito","surface_form":"Josip Broz Tito","offset":6845}]}
