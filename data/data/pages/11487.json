The word \"job\" may be used when a person works for someone else \"an employer\" who pays them for the work. For example, a teacher's job is to teach children or adults. A taxi driver's job is to drive people in a taxi. A firefighter rescues people from burning buildings and puts out fires. A dermatologist's job is to diagnose and treat skin diseases. Some jobs pay very little.\nThe International Labour Organization was established to make people's job conditions better. It became an organization of the United Nations in 1946.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":335},{"uri":"Employer","surface_form":"employer","offset":410},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":463},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":489},{"uri":"Taxi","surface_form":"taxi","offset":553},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":624},{"uri":"Dermatologist","surface_form":"dermatologist","offset":633},{"uri":"Medical_diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnose","offset":659},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":678},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":683},{"uri":"International_Labour_Organization","surface_form":"International Labour Organization","offset":724},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":847}]}
