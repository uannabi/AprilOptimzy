He was the President of Pakistan from 1971 to 1973. He was Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1973 to 1977. He was the founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the largest and most influential political party in Pakistan.\nHe was educated at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States and Oxford University in the United Kingdom. Bhutto was executed by hanging in 1979 for ordering the murder of a political opponent. His execution was ordered by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Bhutto's supporters give him the honorific title Shaheed, the Urdu word for martyr. His name then becomes Shaheed-e-Azam Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (\"The Great Martyr\") or sometimes Quaid-e-Awam (The Leader the Community).\nHe was married to Nusrat Bhutto (n\u00E9e Ispahnie) from 1951 until his death. Their elder daughter, Benazir Bhutto (1953-2007), was also Prime Minister of Pakistan, twice. The couple had three other children: son Murtaza Bhutto (1954-1996) daughter Sanam Bhutto (born 1957), and son Shahnawaz Bhutto (1958-1985).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":63},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":73},{"uri":"President_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"President of Pakistan","offset":96},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Pakistan","offset":144},{"uri":"Pakistan_Peoples_Party","surface_form":"Pakistan Peoples Party","offset":216},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":331},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":373},{"uri":"Oxford_University","surface_form":"Oxford University","offset":391},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":416},{"uri":"Executed","surface_form":"executed","offset":443},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":488},{"uri":"General_Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq","surface_form":"General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq","offset":549},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":640},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":654},{"uri":"Nusrat_Bhutto","surface_form":"Nusrat Bhutto","offset":812},{"uri":"Benazir_Bhutto","surface_form":"Benazir Bhutto","offset":890}]}
