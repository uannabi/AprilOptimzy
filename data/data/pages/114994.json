{"id":114994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose-Einstein_statistics","text":"e=\"preserve\">In statistical mechanics, Bose-Einstein statistics means the statistics of a system where you can not tell the difference between any of the particles, and the particles are bosons. Bosons are fundamental particles like the photon.\nThe Bose-Einstein distribution tells you how many particles have a certain energy. The formula is\nIf formula_1, then the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics is a good approximation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistical_mechanics","surface_form":"statistical mechanics","offset":16},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":74},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":90},{"uri":"Particles","surface_form":"particles","offset":154},{"uri":"Boson","surface_form":"boson","offset":187},{"uri":"Fundamental_particle","surface_form":"fundamental particle","offset":206},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"photon","offset":237},{"uri":"Distribution","surface_form":"distribution","offset":263},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":320},{"uri":"Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_statistics","surface_form":"Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics","offset":366},{"uri":"Approximation","surface_form":"approximation","offset":405}]}
