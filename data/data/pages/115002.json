{"id":115002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong","text":"\"Pong\" is a video game made by Atari. It is believed to be the first video game ever made, although it was made after games similar to it were also made, including \"Tennis for Two\" and could be emulated by WinUaw.\nTo play the game a quarter or token must be put into the game machine's slot. Two knobs, are called \"paddles\" because they control the tennis paddle on the screen. Turn the knob one way and the paddle goes up. Turn the knob the other way and the paddle goes down. The other knob does the same thing to the other paddle on the screen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":12},{"uri":"Atari","surface_form":"Atari","offset":31},{"uri":"Tennis_for_Two","surface_form":"Tennis for Two","offset":165}]}
