{"id":11502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop","text":"Crops are living plants grown by farmers. Most crops are foods such as grain, vegetables, or fruit. Some crops are for drugs, such as quinine, or fibers such as cotton, or other materials such as rubber or wood. Farms are usually made to grow just one kind of crop. Crops are domesticated plants, most of which have been selected to improve their size, taste and other qualities. Many crops are farmed in monoculture.\nGrowing crops is a part of agriculture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":33},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":57},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":71},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":78},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":93},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":119},{"uri":"Quinine","surface_form":"quinine","offset":134},{"uri":"Fiber","surface_form":"fiber","offset":146},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":161},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":196},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":206},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"Farm","offset":212},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated plants","offset":276},{"uri":"Artificial_selection","surface_form":"selected","offset":321},{"uri":"Monoculture","surface_form":"monoculture","offset":405},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":445}]}
