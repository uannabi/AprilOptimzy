He was first in the Vuelta a Espa\u00F1a in 1978 and 1983. Hinault had the nickname \"Le Blaireau\" (the Badger). Hinault says this was a local custom with cyclists when he was young. Professional cyclists used the nickname because badgers do not let go of their prey (animals they want to eat) easily. People know him as a very independent and strong man.\nMain victories.\nHinault also won the season-long \"Super Prestige Pernod International\" competition four times from 1979 to 1982, the same as Jacques Anquetil's total.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yffiniac","surface_form":"Yffiniac","offset":43},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":57},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"cyclist","offset":64},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":84},{"uri":"Giro_d%27Italia","surface_form":"Giro d'Italia","offset":208},{"uri":"Vuelta_a_Espa%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Vuelta a Espa\u00F1a","offset":231},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":698},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":764},{"uri":"Super_Prestige_Pernod_International","surface_form":"Super Prestige Pernod International","offset":842},{"uri":"Jacques_Anquetil","surface_form":"Jacques Anquetil","offset":933}]}
