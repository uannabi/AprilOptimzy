{"id":115219,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries","text":"Hugo Marie de Vries (Haarlem, 16 February 1848 \u2013 Lunteren, 21 May 1935) was a Dutch botanist and one of the first geneticists. He suggested the concept of genes, rediscovered Gregor Mendel's laws of heredity, and introduced the term \"mutation\". He developed a mistaken mutation theory of evolution, mainly due to the peculiarities of his favourite organism, the Evening Primrose (\"Oenothera lamarckiana\").\nCarl Correns also \u2013 independently \u2013 rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Erich von Tschermak's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Haarlem","surface_form":"Haarlem","offset":21},{"uri":"Gelderland","surface_form":"Lunteren","offset":49},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":78},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":84},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":155},{"uri":"Gregor_Mendel","surface_form":"Gregor Mendel","offset":175},{"uri":"Mendelian_laws","surface_form":"laws of heredity","offset":191},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":234},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":269},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":278},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":288},{"uri":"Oenothera","surface_form":"Oenothera","offset":381},{"uri":"Carl_Correns","surface_form":"Carl Correns","offset":406},{"uri":"Gregor_Mendel","surface_form":"Gregor Mendel","offset":455},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":479},{"uri":"Erich_von_Tschermak","surface_form":"Erich von Tschermak","offset":489}]}
