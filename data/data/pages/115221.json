{"id":115221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Correns","text":"Carl Erich Correns (10 September 1864 \u2013 14 February 1933) was a German botanist and geneticist. His research into heredity led to his rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's earlier work.\nHugo de Vries also \u2013 independently \u2013 rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Erich von Tschermak's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing.\nCorrens grew hybrids of peas, and of maize, and reached the same interpretation as Mendel, in 1899.\nThe occurrence of cases in which the heterozygote is intermediate (the absence of dominance) was added in a footnote to his 1900 paper. That dominance was not always present had been seen and understood by Mendel, according to his letters to N\u00E4geli. By a quirk of history Correns was a student of N\u00E4geli, a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas. N\u00E4geli failed to understand how significant Mendel's work was.\nIn 1913 Correns became the first director of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem.\nLater work.\nCorrens produced the first evidence of cytoplasmic inheritance, in his 1909 paper on variegated leaf colour in \"Mirabilis jalapa\". The basis of this inheritance is that chloroplasts, the organelles which conduct photosynthesis, are inherited solely from the maternal parent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":64},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":71},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":84},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"heredity","offset":114},{"uri":"Gregor_Mendel","surface_form":"Gregor Mendel","offset":149},{"uri":"Hugo_de_Vries","surface_form":"Hugo de Vries","offset":179},{"uri":"Gregor_Mendel","surface_form":"Gregor Mendel","offset":229},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":253},{"uri":"Erich_von_Tschermak","surface_form":"Erich von Tschermak","offset":263},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":364},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":377},{"uri":"Heterozygote","surface_form":"heterozygote","offset":477},{"uri":"Allele","surface_form":"dominance","offset":522},{"uri":"Karl_Wilhelm_von_N%C3%A4geli","surface_form":"N\u00E4geli","offset":682},{"uri":"Wilhelm_II_of_Germany","surface_form":"Kaiser Wilhelm","offset":947},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":987},{"uri":"Cytoplasm","surface_form":"cytoplasm","offset":1053},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplast","offset":1183},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":1201},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":1226}]}
