{"id":115223,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Tschermak","text":"e=\"preserve\">Erich von Tschermak-Seysenegg (15 November 1871 \u2013 October 11 1962) was an Austrian botanist.\nVon Tschermak is one of three men \u2013 the others were Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns \u2013 who were credited with independently rediscovering Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Von Tschermak published his findings in June 1900.\nBy a quirk of history, Correns had been a student of Karl Wilhelm von N\u00E4geli. Nageli was a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas, but who failed to understand how significant Mendel's work was. Von Tschermak was a grandson of a man who taught Mendel botany during his student days in Vienna.\nReassessment.\nThough von Tschermak was originally also credited with the rediscovery, this is no longer generally accepted, because he did not understand Mendel's laws.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":87},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":96},{"uri":"Hugo_de_Vries","surface_form":"Hugo de Vries","offset":158},{"uri":"Carl_Correns","surface_form":"Carl Correns","offset":176},{"uri":"Gregor_Mendel","surface_form":"Gregor Mendel","offset":242},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":266},{"uri":"Karl_Wilhelm_von_N%C3%A4geli","surface_form":"Karl Wilhelm von N\u00E4geli","offset":380}]}
