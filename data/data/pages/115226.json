The male is black or dark brown and the female is a grey colour. It is a shy nocturnal grazer and does not live in big groups. It uses the rocky cliffs where it lives to shelter and hide from danger.\nIt is only found in a small, mountainous area in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, between South Alligator River and Nabarlek. It classified as near threatened, because it is only found in this small area. The name wallaroo means a \"rock kangaroo.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wallaroo","surface_form":"wallaroo","offset":122},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":210},{"uri":"Grazer","surface_form":"grazer","offset":220},{"uri":"Arnhem_Land","surface_form":"Arnhem Land","offset":382},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":395},{"uri":"South_Alligator_River","surface_form":"South Alligator River","offset":423},{"uri":"Nabarlek%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Nabarlek","offset":449},{"uri":"Near_threatened","surface_form":"near threatened","offset":476}]}
