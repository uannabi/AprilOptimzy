{"id":115234,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaroo","text":"A wallaroo is an Australian macropod with its size between the big kangaroos and the small wallabies. The name \"wallaroo\" is a mix of wallaby and kangaroo. Most wallaroos are smaller than a kangaroo, and live in open, rocky country. Wallaroo means \"rock kangaroo\". There are three types of wallaroo. They all stand the same way: wrists raised, elbows close into the body, and shoulders back, and all have a large, black nose.\n\"Macropus bernardus\".\nWoodward's wallaroo or black wallaroo, \"Macropus bernardus\", lives in steep, rocky ground in Arnhem Land. Between 60 to 70 cm in length (without tail) it is the smallest wallaroo and the most heavily built. Males weigh 19 to 22 kg, females about 13\u00A0kg.\n\"Macropus antilopinus\".\nThe antilopine wallaroo, \"Macropus antilopinus\", also called the antilopine kangaroo, is different to other wallaroos. It is, more like the eastern and western grey kangaroos. It lives in groups on the grassy plains and woodlands, where the other wallaroos live by themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian","surface_form":"Australian","offset":17},{"uri":"Macropod","surface_form":"macropod","offset":28},{"uri":"Kangaroo","surface_form":"kangaroo","offset":67},{"uri":"Wallaby","surface_form":"wallabies","offset":91},{"uri":"Wrist","surface_form":"wrist","offset":329},{"uri":"Elbow","surface_form":"elbow","offset":344},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":376},{"uri":"Woodward%27s_wallaroo","surface_form":"Woodward's wallaroo","offset":448},{"uri":"Arnhem_Land","surface_form":"Arnhem Land","offset":541},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"cm","offset":571},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":676},{"uri":"Antilopine_kangaroo","surface_form":"antilopine wallaroo","offset":729},{"uri":"Antilopine_kangaroo","surface_form":"antilopine kangaroo","offset":790},{"uri":"Eastern_grey_kangaroo","surface_form":"eastern","offset":865},{"uri":"Western_grey_kangaroo","surface_form":"western grey kangaroo","offset":877}]}
