They live in Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland, the \"Top End\" of the Northern Territory, and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. They live in groups feeding on the open grass lands. Antilopine kangaroos are often in groups of all males, or all females.\nThe male is a red colour and females are grey. The males can get as big as 70 kg, but the females are usually around 30 kg. It is slightly smaller than the red kangaroo (\"Macropus rufus\") and the eastern grey kangaroo (\"Macropus giganteus\"). Babies are born in the summer (February-March), and leave the mother's pouch in Novemember, at the start of the wet season\nClimate change could mean that this kangaroo could become extinct in the future.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Macropod","surface_form":"macropod","offset":126},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":185},{"uri":"Cape_York_Peninsula","surface_form":"Cape York Peninsula","offset":209},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":238},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":271},{"uri":"Kimberley","surface_form":"Kimberley","offset":299},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":319},{"uri":"Kilograms","surface_form":"kg","offset":540},{"uri":"Kilograms","surface_form":"kg","offset":582},{"uri":"Red_kangaroo","surface_form":"red kangaroo","offset":618},{"uri":"Eastern_grey_kangaroo","surface_form":"eastern grey kangaroo","offset":658},{"uri":"Wet_season","surface_form":"wet season","offset":816},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"Climate change","offset":827},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":885}]}
