{"id":115273,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide","text":"=\"preserve\">Peptides are organic chemical molecules. They are polymers made from linking amino acids together in a certain order. The link between one amino acid residue and the next is known as an amide bond or a peptide bond.\nLinking peptides together gives proteins, which are also known as \"Polypeptides\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemical","offset":25},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":42},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":62},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":89},{"uri":"Amide","surface_form":"amide","offset":198},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":204},{"uri":"Peptide_bond","surface_form":"peptide bond","offset":214},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":260}]}
