{"id":115310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_LeMond","text":"Gregory James \"Greg\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961 in Lakewood, California) is an American road racing cyclist who raced as a professional from 1981 to 1994.\nHe became the first American to win the Tour de France in 1986. In 1987 he was injured in a shooting accident, and could not race again until 1989, when he won the Tour de France again. He beat the French cyclist Laurent Fignon in an individual time trial using aero bars, which made him more aerodynamic (able to move through air easily). He won the Tour de France again in 1990. He now runs a bicycle company, and works to help people who are victims of sexual abuse. He has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"June_26","surface_form":"June 26","offset":34},{"uri":"1961","surface_form":"1961","offset":43},{"uri":"Lakewood%2C_California","surface_form":"Lakewood","offset":51},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":61},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":79},{"uri":"Road_bicycle_racing","surface_form":"road racing cyclist","offset":88},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":123},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":195},{"uri":"Shotgun","surface_form":"shooting","offset":247},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":353},{"uri":"Laurent_Fignon","surface_form":"Laurent Fignon","offset":368},{"uri":"Individual_time_trial","surface_form":"individual time trial","offset":389},{"uri":"Aero_bars","surface_form":"aero bars","offset":417},{"uri":"Aerodynamics","surface_form":"aerodynamic","offset":448},{"uri":"Victim","surface_form":"victim","offset":600},{"uri":"Abuse","surface_form":"abuse","offset":618},{"uri":"Diagnose","surface_form":"diagnose","offset":637},{"uri":"Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","surface_form":"attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","offset":652}]}
