{"id":115311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton","text":"Sir Francis Galton FRS (Birmingham, 16 February 1822 \u2013 Surrey, 17 January 1911), half-cousin of Charles Darwin, was an English scientist. His main field of work was human biology and inheritance of mental characteristics.\nGalton was a polymath: an anthropologist, a eugenicist, a tropical explorer, geographer, inventor, meteorologist, proto-geneticist, psychometrician, and statistician. He was knighted in 1909.\nGalton produced over 340 papers and books in his lifetime. He created the statistical concepts of normal distribution, correlation and regression toward the mean. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and inheritance of intelligence.\nHe was the first person to do twin studies. His method was to trace twins through their life-history, making many kinds of measurement. Unfortunately, though he knew about monozygotic (identical twins) and dizygotic twins, he did not appreciate the real genetic difference. Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s.\nHe also introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys to collect data on human communities. He needed such data for genealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies. He was a pioneer in eugenics, coining the very term itself and the phrase \"nature versus nurture\". As an investigator of the human mind, he founded psychometrics (the science of measuring mental faculties) and differential psychology.\nGalton created a method for classifying fingerprints that proved useful in forensic science. As the initiator of scientific meteorology, he devised the first weather map, proposed a theory of anticyclones, and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale. He also invented the Galton Whistle for testing differential hearing ability.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":19},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":96},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":119},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":127},{"uri":"Human_biology","surface_form":"human biology","offset":165},{"uri":"Inheritance","surface_form":"inheritance","offset":183},{"uri":"Polymath","surface_form":"polymath","offset":235},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":248},{"uri":"Eugenics","surface_form":"eugenicist","offset":266},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":289},{"uri":"Geographer","surface_form":"geographer","offset":299},{"uri":"Inventor","surface_form":"inventor","offset":311},{"uri":"Meteorologist","surface_form":"meteorologist","offset":321},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":342},{"uri":"Psychometrics","surface_form":"psychometrician","offset":354},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistician","offset":375},{"uri":"Normal_distribution","surface_form":"normal distribution","offset":512},{"uri":"Correlation","surface_form":"correlation","offset":533},{"uri":"Regression","surface_form":"regression","offset":549},{"uri":"Mean","surface_form":"mean","offset":571},{"uri":"Inheritance","surface_form":"inheritance","offset":661},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"intelligence","offset":676},{"uri":"Twin","surface_form":"twin","offset":720},{"uri":"Identical_twins","surface_form":"identical twins","offset":875},{"uri":"Questionnaire","surface_form":"questionnaire","offset":1058},{"uri":"Statistical_survey","surface_form":"surveys","offset":1077},{"uri":"Anthropometry","surface_form":"anthropometric","offset":1195},{"uri":"Eugenics","surface_form":"eugenics","offset":1239},{"uri":"Psychometrics","surface_form":"psychometrics","offset":1367},{"uri":"Differential_psychology","surface_form":"differential psychology","offset":1429},{"uri":"Fingerprint","surface_form":"fingerprint","offset":1494},{"uri":"Forensic_science","surface_form":"forensic science","offset":1529},{"uri":"Meteorology","surface_form":"meteorology","offset":1578},{"uri":"Weather_map","surface_form":"weather map","offset":1612},{"uri":"Anticyclone","surface_form":"anticyclone","offset":1646}]}
