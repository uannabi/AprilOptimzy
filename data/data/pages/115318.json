{"id":115318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_Festival","text":"The Candle Festival (known in Thai as Haetian) is held in Ubon Ratchathani, Isan, Thailand.\nAt the start of rainy season, it is traditional for the devout to donate to monks items of personal use, such as candles. This part of the festival became the core of the Ubon Ratchathani version of the event. It is now a major event both for residents and for tourists: giant candles are paraded through the town, each representing a local temple, district or other institution. The more elaborate versions are accompanied by scenes of Hindu and Buddhist mythology sculpted in wood or plaster and coated with wax.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thai_language","surface_form":"Thai","offset":30},{"uri":"Ubon_Ratchathani","surface_form":"Ubon Ratchathani","offset":58},{"uri":"Isan","surface_form":"Isan","offset":76},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":82}]}
