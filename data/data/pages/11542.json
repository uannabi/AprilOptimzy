{"id":11542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad","text":"Chad (;, officially called the Republic of Chad), is a landlocked country in Central Africa. The capital is N'Djamena.\nIt was a French colony until 1960. It suffers from poverty, illness, drought, and armed conflicts. In 2011, the population of Chad was 11,525,000.\nArabic and French are the official languages. Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced religions.\nChad has one of the highest levels of hunger in the world. Food insecurity is common in the country. 80% live in total poverty on less than a dollar a day, and 90% are unemployed in Chad. Chad has a low life expectancy. Life expectancy is 54 years old in Chad.\nChad is home to 134 kinds of mammals, 141 bird species, 52 kinds of reptiles, 30 amphibians and 130 kinds of fish. Many animals such as elephants, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, warthogs, giraffes, antelopes, lions, leopards, and cheetahs live in Chad.\nGeography.\nChad is the world's 21st-largest country. It is slightly smaller than Peru and slightly larger than South Africa. To the north is Libya, to the south is the Central African Republic, to the east is Sudan, and to the west are Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger.\nThe country's capital is from the nearest seaport Douala, Cameroon. Due to this distance from the sea and the country's largely desert climate, Chad is sometimes called the \"Dead Heart of Africa\".\nLake Chad is the largest wetland in Chad and the second largest in Africa. Lake Chad was 7000 years ago. Now it is. Chad's highest peak is the Emi Koussi in the Sahara.\nThe region's tall grasses and large amount of marshes make it good for birds, reptiles, and large mammals. Chad's major rivers are the Chari and Logone.\nRegions.\nSince 2002, the Republic of Chad has been divided into regions. It was previously divided into prefectures, and then departments.\nBelow is a list of the 23 regions as of 2012.\nLanguages.\nChad's official languages are Arabic and French, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to the important role of Arab traders and merchants, Chadian Arabic has become a lingua franca, a language for all to use.\nEducation.\nAttending primary school is required in Chad, though only about 50% of children attend school. Adult literacy is only 35%.\nThe University of N'Djamena provides higher education.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landlocked_country","surface_form":"landlocked country","offset":55},{"uri":"Central_Africa","surface_form":"Central Africa","offset":77},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":97},{"uri":"N%27Djamena","surface_form":"N'Djamena","offset":108},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":135},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":231},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":266},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":277},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":312},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":322},{"uri":"Hunger","surface_form":"hunger","offset":414},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"Food","offset":435},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":495},{"uri":"Life_expectancy","surface_form":"life expectancy","offset":579},{"uri":"Elephants","surface_form":"elephants","offset":773},{"uri":"Hippopotamuses","surface_form":"hippopotamuses","offset":784},{"uri":"Rhinoceroses","surface_form":"rhinoceroses","offset":800},{"uri":"Warthogs","surface_form":"warthogs","offset":814},{"uri":"Antelopes","surface_form":"antelopes","offset":834},{"uri":"Lions","surface_form":"lions","offset":845},{"uri":"Leopards","surface_form":"leopards","offset":852},{"uri":"Cheetahs","surface_form":"cheetahs","offset":866},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":970},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1000},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":1030},{"uri":"Central_African_Republic","surface_form":"Central African Republic","offset":1057},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":1098},{"uri":"Cameroon","surface_form":"Cameroon","offset":1125},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":1135},{"uri":"Niger","surface_form":"Niger","offset":1148},{"uri":"Douala","surface_form":"Douala","offset":1205},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1283},{"uri":"Lake_Chad","surface_form":"Lake Chad","offset":1352},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"wetland","offset":1377},{"uri":"Emi_Koussi","surface_form":"Emi Koussi","offset":1495},{"uri":"Sahara","surface_form":"Sahara","offset":1513},{"uri":"Chari_River","surface_form":"Chari","offset":1656},{"uri":"Logone_River","surface_form":"Logone","offset":1666},{"uri":"Prefectures_of_Chad","surface_form":"prefectures","offset":1778},{"uri":"Departments_of_Chad","surface_form":"departments","offset":1800},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1900},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1911},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1946},{"uri":"Chadian_Arabic","surface_form":"Chadian Arabic","offset":2024},{"uri":"Lingua_franca","surface_form":"lingua franca","offset":2052},{"uri":"Primary_school","surface_form":"primary school","offset":2115},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":2206},{"uri":"University_of_N%27Djamena","surface_form":"University of N'Djamena","offset":2232}]}
