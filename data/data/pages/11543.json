{"id":11543,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex","text":"e=\"preserve\">Anal sex is a sex act performed on the anus. Anal sex can involve a penis inserted in the anus, oral stimulation of the anus, using fingers for penetration and using different objects for stimulation.\nOverview.\nThe anus is a part of the body that is tight and cannot lubricate itself. Because of this, a person should be careful when inserting something without damaging the walls of this organ. Lubrication is often used which can be oil or water-based and is sold commercially.\nFor a man, pleasure can come from the stimulation of the prostate that is found near the anus. For women, it can come from indirect stimulation of the clitoral legs/G-Spot or the cervix. Both men and women can get pleasure from anal sex because the anus has a lot of nerve endings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex act","offset":27},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":52},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":81},{"uri":"Oral_sex","surface_form":"oral","offset":109},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimulation","offset":114},{"uri":"Fingers","surface_form":"fingers","offset":145},{"uri":"Prostate","surface_form":"prostate","offset":550},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoral legs","offset":644},{"uri":"G-Spot","surface_form":"G-Spot","offset":658},{"uri":"Cervix","surface_form":"cervix","offset":672}]}
