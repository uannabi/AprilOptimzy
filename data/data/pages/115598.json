{"id":115598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency","text":"e=\"preserve\">Allele frequency refers to the different forms of a gene at a single position on a chromosome. It is the proportion of a given allele to all alleles at the same locus. It is usually expressed as a percentage.\nAllele frequencies may be used to describe genetic diversity in a population. If the frequency of any allele is above 1% it is probable that natural selection is maintaining it at this level. This is because the natural mutation rate of an allele is almost always much lower than 1%.\nA fixed allele is one allele that exists for a particular population. A fixed allele is homozygous for all members of the population.\nThe term \"allele\" refers to one variant gene out of several possible for a particular locus in the DNA. When all but one allele go away, one only remains. That allele is said to be fixed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":65},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":96},{"uri":"Allele","surface_form":"allele","offset":140},{"uri":"Locus","surface_form":"locus","offset":174},{"uri":"Percentage","surface_form":"percentage","offset":210},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":265},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":288},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":363},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":442},{"uri":"Homozygous","surface_form":"homozygous","offset":594}]}
