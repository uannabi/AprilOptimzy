She was the number 1 player for 12 weeks from June to September 2008. She won the French Open in 2008 and came second there in 2007. She also came second at the Australian Open in 2008. She has also played tennis for Serbia in the international tournament called the Fed Cup.\nIvanovi\u0107 is tall, and is famous for the way she plays. She is best known for her powerful serve. Although she is Serbian, Ivanovi\u0107 currently lives in Basel, Switzerland. As of January 2015, she has earned over $13 million during her tennis career. Outside tennis, she is interested in clothes and fashion, and is an ambassador for the worldwide charity for children, UNICEF.\nIn December 2016, Ivanovi\u0107 announced her retirement from pro tennis.\nEarly and personal life.\nIvanovi\u0107 was born in Belgrade in Serbia (which used to be in Yugoslavia). She watched tennis on television when she was five years old, and said, \"I loved watching tennis on television, particularly Monica Seles.\" While she was growing up, the country was bombed by NATO, so she had to arrange her training to avoid this. She would even practice tennis in an empty swimming pool during the winter. When she was 14 years old, she was asked what she dreamed of in tennis, she replied \"To become the No. 1 magic player in the world.\" Her Serbian tennis teacher introduced her to a Swiss businessman who agreed to hire a coach and pay for Ivanovi\u0107's training in Switzerland.\nHer father, Miroslav, and brother, Miros, watch some of Ana's matches on television, but her mother, Dragana, goes to all of them. Ivanovi\u0107 and her mother, who Ivanovi\u0107 describes as her \"best friend,\" live in Basel, Switzerland. Her uncle lives in Australia where Ivanovi\u0107 is very popular. She is studying for a degree in finance at a Belgrade university, and is learning to speak Spanish.\nIn 2007 she became an ambassador for the international charitable organization UNICEF, saying \"I'm also looking forward to going into the classroom and meeting many kids\". Ivanovi\u0107 is also interested in fashion\u2013she has modelled clothes and says \"...I love to shop...\"\nIn September 2014, she began to date German professional footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger. The couple married on 12 July 2016 in Venice and has two sons.\nPlaying style.\nIvanovi\u0107 plays tennis holding her racket in her right hand. She also uses both hands on the racket when hitting her backhand shots. She can hit her shots from the baseline (the back of the tennis court) but is also good at volleys. Because she is very tall () she can serve the ball very fast. She hit a serve at the French Open in 2007, the fifth fastest serve of all time on the WTA Tour. However, her serve has become unreliable, mostly because of problems with her toss of the ball. She also has a strong wrist which means she can hide what kind of serve she is going to use until the last moment. She will often shout \"Ajde!\" (\"Come on!\" in Serbian) during her matches.\nProfessional career.\nIvanovi\u0107 played in the junior version of Wimbledon in 2004. She lost the game to Ukrainian player Kateryna Bondarenko. She became a professional tennis player in August 2003.

Ivanovi\u0107 won her third WTA title by beating Russian player Svetlana Kuznetsova in the German Masters tournament in Berlin in May 2007.\nShe got to the final of her first Grand Slam tournament in 2007 in the French Open, but she lost to Justine Henin from Belgium.

In the following season, she got to the final of the Australian Open where she lost to Maria Sharapova. After the final she was the second best female player in the world.
