Hamilton started kart racing when he was six. His father bought him his first go-kart as a Christmas present. His father said he would support his racing as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son Anthony had to take extra jobs, but he found enough time to attend all of Hamilton's races.\nIn October 2007, Hamilton announced his intention to live in Switzerland. He said this was to avoid the media scrutiny in the United Kingdom. Hamilton later admitted on the television show \"Parkinson\", that taxation was part of the reason for his decision. Hamilton was publicly criticised by UK MPs, including Liberal Democrat MP Bob Russell, for avoiding UK taxes. He settled in Luins in Vaud canton on Lake Geneva.\nOn 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for one month. He had been caught speeding at on a French motorway.

He would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for the season. He was told of McLaren's decision on 30 September. The news was not made public until 24 November. McLaren was afraid the news would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.\n2007 season.\nHamilton would be the team-mate of defending double World Champion Fernando Alonso. Alonso had joined McLaren after leaving Renault. On his debut at the Australian Grand Prix, he qualified fourth and finished third in the race.

He was unable to complete qualifying and started the race in tenth position. During a heavy rainstorm which caused the race to be temporally stopped, Hamilton slid off into a gravel trap. He was able to rejoin the race after the restart. His ninth place finish in this race was his first non-podium and non-points finish.\nHamilton won the Hungarian Grand Prix from pole position. At first, Alonso had set the fastest time, but he received a five-place grid penalty for blocking Hamilton in the pit lane; an action that prevented Hamilton from running his final qualifying lap. McLaren was also penalised and earned no constructor's points for the race.\nAfterwards, Hamilton said he had restored his relationship with Alonso. He went on to qualify second in Turkey.

He had lost 40\u00A0seconds while his car was coasting.\nFor most of the race, Massa was leading and R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen was in second. If the race had ended this way, Hamilton would have become world champion. During the second round of pit stops, R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen the lead from Massa. R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen won the race to become the 2007 Formula One World Champion.\nHamilton finished the season with four wins, and second place in the World Drivers' Championship with 109 points, ahead of teammate Fernando Alonso.\nTeam tensions.\nThe first sign that Hamilton was unhappy with his team appeared after he finished second at Monaco. His post-race comments suggested he had been forced into a supporting role. The FIA looked to see if McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. FIA determined that McLaren did not break any rules. During qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix, Alonso held Hamilton up in the pits. This caused Hamilton to miss one last lap to try and earn the pole position. Alonso was moved back to the sixth starting position. This moved Hamilton to the pole. McLaren was docked constructors championship points. Hamilton said he thought Alonso's penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of constructors' points. As a result of these events, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso temporarily collapsed. The pair were not on speaking terms for a short period.\nAfter the Japanese Grand Prix, Alonso felt that a race stewards' verdict had settled the championship in Hamilton's favor. He said: \"I'm not thinking of this championship anymore, it's been decided off the track. The drivers' briefing has no purpose. You go there to hear what Charlie Whiting and the other officials say. Twenty one drivers have an opinion, Charlie and the officials another, and so it's like talking to a wall\".\nAfter the season was over, Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract on 2 November 2007. Both sides agreed to the departure of Alonso.\n2008 season.\nIn January 2008, Hamilton signed a new five-year contract to stay with McLaren-Mercedes until the end of the 2012 season.

Hamilton finished second in Turkey, and won the Monaco Grand Prix a two weeks later, putting him back into the championship lead.\nHe qualified on the pole in Montreal but he crashed into the back of Kimi R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen during the race. There was a red light at the end of the pit lane. Hamilton did not see that R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen was stopped at the light. Hamilton was given a 10 position starting grid penalty for the next race, the French Grand Prix. Hamilton went on to win the British Grand Prix in difficult, wet conditions. This was called one of his best performance to date. Hamilton himself said in the post race press conference that it was his most difficult and most meaningful win.\nIn the next race at Hockenheim, Hamilton started from pole position, and won by 9\u00A0seconds.\nHamilton won the Belgian Grand Prix, but this win was called into question. He was left the race track in a chicane avoid hitting Kimi R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen. The race officials said that gave Hamilton an unfair advantage.

Hamilton ran wide at the first corner. This forced some of the drivers behind him to go off the track. Hamilton was given a drive-through penalty for his actions. On the second lap, when Hamilton tried to pass Massa at turn 10, Hamilton pulled alongside and made a move to pass him. Massa then ran wide and both cars hit. Hamilton car went into a spin.
