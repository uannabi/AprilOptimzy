Its schools generally have the biggest budgets, the best facilities, and offer more their students more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III.\nOther conferences.\nThe only Division I all-sports conference that plays either men's or women's ice hockey is the Big Ten. It started a men's hockey league in 2013\u201314.\nThese conferences only play water polo. All three run men's and women's leagues.\nIn some sports, the NCAA does not split schools into divisions because only a small number of schools play a given sport. Technically, conferences in these sports are not Division I. However, most of the schools in these conferences are in Division I in other sports.\n__FORCETOC__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":35},{"uri":"Sports","surface_form":"sports","offset":43},{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"National Collegiate Athletic Association","offset":57},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":112},{"uri":"Budget","surface_form":"budget","offset":166},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":240},{"uri":"NCAA_Division_II","surface_form":"Divisions II","offset":258},{"uri":"NCAA_Division_III","surface_form":"III","offset":275},{"uri":"Water_polo","surface_form":"water polo","offset":476}]}
