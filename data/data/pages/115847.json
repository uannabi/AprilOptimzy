{"id":115847,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is one of the major college sports conferences in the United States. It was formed in 1953 by a group of seven colleges and universities that left the Southern Conference.\nMembers.\nThe 15 schools in the conference are split into two groups\u2014the Atlantic and Coastal Divisions\u2014in football and baseball. Notre Dame does not play football in the ACC; in that sport, it remains an \"independent\" school that does not play in a conference. However, it has agreed to play five of its 12 regular-season games each year against other ACC schools. Syracuse does not have a baseball team; Notre Dame takes its place in the Atlantic Division for that sport.\nSports.\nAs of the 2014\u201315 school year, the ACC holds championships in 26 sports. Twelve of these are men's sports and 13 are women's sports. One sport, fencing, has separate ACC men's and women's team championships, but has a single coeducational (men's and women's) NCAA team championship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":160},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":173},{"uri":"Southern_Conference","surface_form":"Southern Conference","offset":200},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":327},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":340}]}
