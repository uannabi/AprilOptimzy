{"id":115853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fausto_Coppi","text":"Angelo Fausto Coppi (15 September 1919 \u2013 2 January 1960) was an Italian racing cyclist. He was born in Castellania. He was one of the most successful and most popular cyclists of all time. He won the Tour de France twice, in 1949 and 1952. He won the Giro d'Italia five times, in 1940, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953. He also held the World Hour record (the farthest cycled in one hour) from 1942 to 1956.\nHe fought in the Second World War. He was a prisoner of war of the British. It is possible that Coppi could have won many more races in the five years that were lost because of the war. Coppi died of malaria in Tortoni in 1960 at the age of 40.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":64},{"uri":"Castellania","surface_form":"Castellania","offset":103},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":200},{"uri":"Giro_d%27Italia","surface_form":"Giro d'Italia","offset":251},{"uri":"Hour_record","surface_form":"World Hour record","offset":330},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"the Second World War","offset":414},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":468},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":601},{"uri":"Tortoni","surface_form":"Tortoni","offset":612}]}
