{"id":115859,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Indur%C3%A1in","text":"Miguel \u00C1ngel Indurain Larraya (born July 16, 1964) is a Spanish retired road racing cyclist. He was a professional cyclist from 1985 to 1996. He was the first person to win the Tour de France five times in a row from 1991 to 1995. He also won the Giro d'Italia two times, in 1992 and 1993. In 1994, he cycled 53.040 kilometres in one hour, which was a new hour record. He also won the Olympic Gold medal for the time trial in 1996.\nIndurain was very good at time trials. In the five Tours de France that he won, he only won two stages that were not time trials. He finished time trials much quicker than other cyclists, so he did not need to attack in mountain stages. In the 1996 Tour de France, he had a bad cold and he could not win. He retired later in 1997.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_people","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":56},{"uri":"Retire","surface_form":"retire","offset":64},{"uri":"Road_bicycle_racing","surface_form":"road racing","offset":72},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":177},{"uri":"Giro_d%27Italia","surface_form":"Giro d'Italia","offset":247},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":316},{"uri":"Hour_record","surface_form":"hour record","offset":356},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic","offset":385},{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"Gold medal","offset":393},{"uri":"Time_trial","surface_form":"time trial","offset":412},{"uri":"Common_cold","surface_form":"cold","offset":710},{"uri":"Retire","surface_form":"retired","offset":740}]}
