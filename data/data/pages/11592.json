{"id":11592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson","text":"Willie Hugh Nelson (; born April\u00A029,\u00A01933) is an American country music singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist.\nEarly life.\nWillie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression to Myrle Marie (n\u00E9e Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April\u00A029,\u00A01933, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April\u00A030. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. Nelson's ancestry includes English, Irish, and Cherokee. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson's grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic. His mother left soon after he was born, and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, and when he was nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson didn't like picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age thirteen, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.\nPersonal life.\nNelson is the co-chair of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advisory board.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":58},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":222},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":597},{"uri":"Bobbie_Nelson","surface_form":"Bobbie","offset":843},{"uri":"Hank_Williams","surface_form":"Hank Williams","offset":1515},{"uri":"Bob_Wills","surface_form":"Bob Wills","offset":1530},{"uri":"Lefty_Frizzell","surface_form":"Lefty Frizzell","offset":1541},{"uri":"Ray_Price_(musician)","surface_form":"Ray Price","offset":1557},{"uri":"Ernest_Tubb","surface_form":"Ernest Tubb","offset":1568},{"uri":"Hank_Snow","surface_form":"Hank Snow","offset":1581},{"uri":"Django_Reinhardt","surface_form":"Django Reinhardt","offset":1592},{"uri":"Frank_Sinatra","surface_form":"Frank Sinatra","offset":1610},{"uri":"Louis_Armstrong","surface_form":"Louis Armstrong","offset":1628},{"uri":"National_Organization_for_the_Reform_of_Marijuana_Laws","surface_form":"National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws","offset":1690}]}
