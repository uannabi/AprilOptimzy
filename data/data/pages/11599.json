{"id":11599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide","text":"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound. It is a gas at room temperature. It is made of one carbon and two oxygen atoms. People and animals release carbon dioxide when they breathe out. Also, every time something organic is burnt (or a fire is made), it makes carbon dioxide. Plants use carbon dioxide to make food. This process is called photosynthesis. The properties of carbon dioxide were studied by the Scottish scientist Joseph Black in the 1750s.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat energy. Greenhouse gases change the climate and weather on our planet, Earth. This is called climate change. Greenhouse gases are a cause of global warming, the rise of Earth surface temperature.\nBiological role.\nCarbon dioxide is an end product in organisms that obtain energy from breaking down sugars, fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism. This is a process known as cellular respiration. This includes all plants, animals, many fungi and some bacteria. In higher animals, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the lungs where it is breathed out. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use in photosynthesis.\nDry ice.\nDry ice, or solid carbon dioxide, is the solid state of CO2 gas below -109.3\u00A0\u00B0F (-78.5\u00B0C). Dry ice does not occur naturally on earth but is man made. It is colorless. People use dry ice to make things cold, and to make drinks fizzy, kill gophers, and freeze warts. The vapor of dry ice causes suffocation and eventually, death. Caution and professional assistance is recommended whenever dry ice is in use.\nAt usual pressure it will not melt from a solid to a liquid but instead changes directly from a solid to a gas. This is called sublimation. It will change directly from a solid to a gas at any temperature higher than extremely cold temperatures. Dry ice sublimates at normal air temperature. Dry ice exposed to normal air gives off carbon dioxide gas that has no color. Carbon dioxide can be liquified at pressure above 5.1 atmospheres.\nCarbon dioxide gas that comes off of dry ice is so cold that when it mixes with air it cools the water vapour in the air to fog, which looks like a thick white smoke. It is often used in the theater to create the appearance of fog or smoke.\nIsolation and production.\nThe carbonic acid (H2CO3) then decomposes to water and CO2. Such reactions cause foaming or bubbling, or both. In industry, such reactions are used many times to neutralize waste acid streams.\nCarbon dioxide is soluble in water, in which it spontaneously interconverts between CO2 and (carbonic acid). The relative concentrations of, and the deprotonated forms (bicarbonate) and (carbonate) depend on the acidity (pH). In neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH > 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (>50%) becoming the most prevalent (>95%) at the pH of seawater, while in very alkaline water (pH > 10.4) the predominant (>50%) form is carbonate. The bicarbonate and carbonate forms are very soluble. So, air-equilibrated ocean water (mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2\u20138.5) contains about 120\u00A0mg of bicarbonate per liter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":26},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":53},{"uri":"Room_temperature","surface_form":"room temperature","offset":60},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":96},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":111},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":118},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":240},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"Plant","offset":280},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":314},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":343},{"uri":"Scots","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":412},{"uri":"Joseph_Black","surface_form":"Joseph Black","offset":431},{"uri":"Greenhouse_gas","surface_form":"greenhouse gas","offset":478},{"uri":"Thermal_energy","surface_form":"heat energy","offset":516},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":557},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":569},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":584},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":592},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":614},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":662},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":704},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":835},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":852},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":876},{"uri":"Cellular_respiration","surface_form":"cellular respiration","offset":915},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":955},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":963},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":977},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":992},{"uri":"Tissue_(biology)","surface_form":"tissues","offset":1077},{"uri":"Lungs","surface_form":"lungs","offset":1092},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":1163},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":1184},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":1221},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid state","offset":1250},{"uri":"%C2%B0C","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":1295},{"uri":"Colorless","surface_form":"colorless","offset":1365},{"uri":"Pocket_gopher","surface_form":"gophers","offset":1447},{"uri":"Wart","surface_form":"wart","offset":1467},{"uri":"Vapor","surface_form":"vapor","offset":1478},{"uri":"Suffocation","surface_form":"suffocation","offset":1502},{"uri":"Melt","surface_form":"melt","offset":1646},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":1669},{"uri":"Sublimation","surface_form":"sublimation","offset":1743},{"uri":"Atmosphere_(unit)","surface_form":"atmospheres","offset":2040},{"uri":"Fog","surface_form":"fog","offset":2280},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoke","offset":2287},{"uri":"Carbonic_acid","surface_form":"carbonic acid","offset":2324},{"uri":"Decomposes","surface_form":"decomposes","offset":2351},{"uri":"Soluble","surface_form":"soluble","offset":2531},{"uri":"Carbonic_acid","surface_form":"carbonic acid","offset":2606},{"uri":"Bicarbonate","surface_form":"bicarbonate","offset":2682},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":2700},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":2734},{"uri":"Seawater","surface_form":"seawater","offset":2878},{"uri":"Alkaline","surface_form":"alkaline","offset":2902},{"uri":"Air-equilibrated","surface_form":"air-equilibrated","offset":3029},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":3046}]}
