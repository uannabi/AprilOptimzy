{"id":116084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenedyk","text":"Wenedyk (in English: Venedic) is a made-up language. Jan van Steenbergen, a linguist and translator from the Netherlands, made it in 2002. The idea behind it is this: what would have happened if the Polish language had developed from Latin instead of Old Slavic? Wenedyk is a possible answer to that question. It is a Romance language, so almost all words are family of words in French, Italian, Romanian, and so on. But they look very different and much more like Polish. The rules for spelling and pronunciation are completely based on Polish. Other parts of the language, like grammar and sentence structure, are a mixture of Polish and Romance.\nTogether with other made-up languages like Brithenig (which does the same thing with Welsh), Wenedyk is part of the group of so-called \"alternative languages\", languages that could have existed if history had been different. With Brithenig, it is the best known example of this sort of languages. Wenedyk became known in Poland after it was written about on the Internet and in the monthly paper \"Wiedza i \u017Bycie\" (\"Knowledge and Life\").\nWenedyk is used in Ill Bethisad, a made-up world in which the Roman Empire was stronger than in real history. It is the most important language of the Republic of the Two Crowns, a country similar to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but not broken up by partitions like Poland was.\nSpelling and pronunciation.\nWenedyk is pronounced just like Polish. Stress almost always falls on the second-last syllable. A preposition and a pronoun are treated as one word, so when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.\nGrammar.\nWenedyk does not have articles, words like \"a\" and \"the\". This is an important difference with the other Romance languages and also with made-up languages like Esperanto and Ido. The reason is that Polish and most other Slavic languages do not have those words, and even in Vulgar Latin they were not so strong yet.\nWenedyk also has a \"vocative\" (used for calling someone). Often it has the same form as the direct case, but not always: O potrze! \"Oh father!\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constructed_language","surface_form":"made-up language","offset":35},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguist","offset":76},{"uri":"Translator","surface_form":"translator","offset":89},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":109},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish language","offset":199},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":234},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":255},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance","offset":318},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":379},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":387},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":396},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":487},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":500},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":580},{"uri":"Brithenig","surface_form":"Brithenig","offset":692},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":734},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":970},{"uri":"Ill_Bethisad","surface_form":"Ill Bethisad","offset":1105},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":1148},{"uri":"Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth","surface_form":"Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth","offset":1290},{"uri":"Partitions_of_Poland","surface_form":"partitions","offset":1343},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":1485},{"uri":"Preposition","surface_form":"preposition","offset":1497},{"uri":"Pronoun","surface_form":"pronoun","offset":1515},{"uri":"Article_(grammar)","surface_form":"articles","offset":1651},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":1789},{"uri":"Ido","surface_form":"Ido","offset":1803},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic languages","offset":1849},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1910}]}
