{"id":116090,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EastLink%2C_Melbourne","text":"e=\"preserve\">EastLink is a tollway (meaning people have to pay to drive on it) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was opened on June 28, 2008. It links the Frankston Freeway to the Eastern Freeway, and includes two tunnels, the Mullum Mullum tunnel and the Melba tunnel.\nThe interchange with the Monash Freeway, the largest in Victoria, is known as the Tom Wills interchange. This was announced on February 27, 2008. This particular interchange was chosen because it was within a short distance from Waverely Park, and the home of the Hawthorn Football Club.\nTolls are paid by either a bill sent in the mail, buying a pass from a shop or creating an account and using an electronic Breeze tag or another tollways type of electronic tag in the car to keep track of tolls. The cost of the tolls is charged against the owner's account.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tollway","surface_form":"tollway","offset":27},{"uri":"Melbourne%2C_Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","offset":82},{"uri":"June_28","surface_form":"June 28","offset":131},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":140},{"uri":"Frankston_Freeway","surface_form":"Frankston Freeway","offset":159},{"uri":"Eastern_Freeway","surface_form":"Eastern Freeway","offset":184},{"uri":"Mullum_Mullum_tunnel","surface_form":"Mullum Mullum tunnel","offset":231},{"uri":"Melba_tunnel","surface_form":"Melba tunnel","offset":260},{"uri":"Monash_Freeway","surface_form":"Monash Freeway","offset":299},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":330},{"uri":"Tom_Wills","surface_form":"Tom Wills","offset":356},{"uri":"Waverely_Park","surface_form":"Waverely Park","offset":503},{"uri":"Hawthorn_Football_Club","surface_form":"Hawthorn Football Club","offset":538},{"uri":"Breeze_tag","surface_form":"Breeze tag","offset":685}]}
