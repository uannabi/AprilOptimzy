It is often abbreviated as \"KU\".\nKU held its first classes in 1866. As of Spring 2011, over 30,000 students attended school there.\nHistory.\nThere was a plan to build a university in Kansas in 1855, but it didn't happen until Kansas became a state in 1861. The Kansas government needed to decide where to build the university. Their choices were Manhattan, Emporia, or Lawrence. On January 13, 1863, Kansas State University was built in Manhattan. The only cities left were Emporia and Lawrence. Amos A. Lawrence gave $10,000 and more than 40 acres (160,000\u00A0m2) of land for a university in Lawrence. The Kansas government liked that, so the government chose Lawrence.\nOn February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was made if Lawrence gave a gift of a $15,000 endowment fund and a place for the university. The place would need to be in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 ha) of land.\nOn November 2, 1863, Governor Carney said Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university. In 1864, the university was officially organized.\nThe university opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873.\nSchool of Business.\nThe University of Kansas School of Business is a public business school on the main campus in Lawrence.
