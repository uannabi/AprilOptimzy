{"id":11616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery","text":"Pottery is the ceramic material which makes up potteryware. Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made is also called a \"pottery\" (plural \"potteries\"). Pottery also refers to the art or craft of a potter or the making of pottery. A dictionary definition is simply clay fired in a kiln.\nPottery objects are made from damp clay mixed with other materials. They are then fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures. Firing makes the clay hard. The potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again. The fired glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny, decorative and water-tight.\nSome potters make objects which are not useful and are really artistic objects or sculpture. Bare pottery objects without a glaze are called \"bisque\" or just earthenware. The finest pottery objects, made of porcelain or bone china are quite strong, yet are translucent.\nHistory of pottery.\nPottery originated before the Neolithic period. The earliest example we have is from eastern Europe, dating to 25,000 years ago or earlier. It is a female figurine known as the Venus of Doln\u00ED V\u011Bstonice, from a palaeolithic site in Moravia, Czech Republic. It may have been made as part of a fertility ritual. There are some similar figures from other nearby sites.\nSince the invention of agriculture, and the building of cities, containers for food and drink have been found at almost all archaeological sites.\nThe Potteries.\nThis means the area of Stoke-on-Trent in England, sometimes called the Staffordshire potteries. There were six towns, Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton, which now make up Stoke-on-Trent.\nThe area was the centre of the English pottery industry. The area had local supplies of clay, salt, lead and coal. Canals were used to transport the product inland. It was a large exporter of pottery for about 200 years: roughly from 1760 to about 1960. Plastic crockery after World War II and cheap ceramic production in China largely destroyed the Stoke pottery industry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":15},{"uri":"Earthenware","surface_form":"earthenware","offset":80},{"uri":"Stoneware","surface_form":"stoneware","offset":93},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":107},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":230},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":237},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":315},{"uri":"Kiln","surface_form":"kiln","offset":331},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":372},{"uri":"Oven","surface_form":"oven","offset":438},{"uri":"Glaze","surface_form":"glaze","offset":535},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":754},{"uri":"Earthenware","surface_form":"earthenware","offset":830},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":879},{"uri":"Bone_china","surface_form":"bone china","offset":892},{"uri":"Translucent","surface_form":"translucent","offset":929},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":992},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"palaeolithic","offset":1172},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1185},{"uri":"Moravia","surface_form":"Moravia","offset":1193},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":1202},{"uri":"Stoke-on-Trent","surface_form":"Stoke-on-Trent","offset":1511},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1529},{"uri":"Tunstall%2C_Staffordshire","surface_form":"Tunstall","offset":1606},{"uri":"Burslem","surface_form":"Burslem","offset":1616},{"uri":"Hanley%2C_Staffordshire","surface_form":"Hanley","offset":1625},{"uri":"Stoke-upon-Trent","surface_form":"Stoke","offset":1633},{"uri":"Fenton%2C_Staffordshire","surface_form":"Fenton","offset":1640},{"uri":"Longton%2C_Staffordshire","surface_form":"Longton","offset":1651},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":1741},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":1788},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":1794},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":1803},{"uri":"Canals","surface_form":"Canals","offset":1809},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":1874},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"Plastic","offset":1948},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1971},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":1994},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":2016}]}
