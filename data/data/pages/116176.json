{"id":116176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine","text":"The bean machine, also known as the quincunx or Galton box, is a machine invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal distribution.\nThe machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins. Balls are dropped from the top, and bounce left and right as they hit the pins. Eventually, they are collected into one-ball-wide bins at the bottom. The height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve.\nOverlaying Pascal's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each pin.\nA large-scale working model of this device can be seen at the Museum of Science, Boston.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quincunx","surface_form":"quincunx","offset":36},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":65},{"uri":"Francis_Galton","surface_form":"Francis Galton","offset":89},{"uri":"Law_of_error","surface_form":"law of error","offset":123},{"uri":"Normal_distribution","surface_form":"normal distribution","offset":144},{"uri":"Normal_distribution","surface_form":"bell curve","offset":441},{"uri":"Pascal%27s_triangle","surface_form":"Pascal's triangle","offset":464},{"uri":"Museum_of_Science%2C_Boston","surface_form":"Museum of Science, Boston","offset":632}]}
