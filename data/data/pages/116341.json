The district is the oldest British district of Punjab. It was created in 1833 as district headquarters and was part of the earstwhile Lahore Division (now in Pakistan).\nFerozepur has easy access by road and rail to other places such as Lahore, Okara, Kasur, Multan. The area is a center of many holy shrines and historic places. At the city of Zira, a Jain Swetambar Temple with very old brass icons and beautiful wall murals is located.\nIn addition to cotton and grain cultivation and agriculture-related services, Firozpur has some light manufacturing. Commercial progress is limited because it is very near the border between India and Pakistan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Firuz_Shah_Tughluq","surface_form":"Firuz Shah Tughluq","offset":37},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":61},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":77},{"uri":"States_of_India","surface_form":"state","offset":84},{"uri":"Punjab_(India)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":93},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":128},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":191},{"uri":"Lahore_Division","surface_form":"Lahore Division","offset":235},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":299},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"rail","offset":308},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":337},{"uri":"Okara_District","surface_form":"Okara","offset":345},{"uri":"Kasur_District","surface_form":"Kasur","offset":352},{"uri":"Multan","surface_form":"Multan","offset":359},{"uri":"Holy","surface_form":"holy","offset":396},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":401},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historic","offset":413},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":437},{"uri":"Zira_Tehsil","surface_form":"Zira","offset":445},{"uri":"Jainism","surface_form":"Jain","offset":453},{"uri":"Swetambar_Temple","surface_form":"Swetambar Temple","offset":458},{"uri":"Brass","surface_form":"brass","offset":489},{"uri":"Icon","surface_form":"icon","offset":495},{"uri":"Beauty","surface_form":"beautiful","offset":505},{"uri":"Mural","surface_form":"mural","offset":520},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":554},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":565},{"uri":"Cultivation","surface_form":"cultivation","offset":571},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":587},{"uri":"Manufacture","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":641},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"Commercial","offset":656},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":740}]}
