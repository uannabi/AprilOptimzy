{"id":11635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge","text":"David Howell Evans (born 8 August 1961), more widely known as The Edge, is an English-born musician. He is known best as the guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist for the Irish rock band U2.\nPersonal life.\nDavid Howell Evans was born at the Barking Maternity Hospital, in Essex, England. His parents, Garvin and Gwenda Evans, are Welsh. When he was one, his family moved to County Dublin, Ireland. There, he attended St. Andrew's National School. He received piano and guitar lessons with his brother, Dik Evans. At Mount Temple Comprehensive School, they both answered an advertisement posted by Larry Mullen Jr. wanting musicians to form a band. The band accepted both of them. This band went through several major changes before emerging as U2 in March 1978. Dik Evans left the band just before the name change. U2 began performing in various venues in Ireland and eventually began developing a following. Their first album, \"Boy\", was released in 1980.\nIn 1981, Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he was persuaded to stay. During this time, he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers. Bono and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved in this group. Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". The Edge married his high school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983. The couple had three daughters together: Hollie in 1984, Arran in 1985 and Blue Angel in 1989. The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get officially divorced until 1996 because of Irish laws regarding marriage; divorce was made legal in 1995.\nDuring U2's Zoo TV Tour, The Edge began to date Morleigh Steinberg. The couple began dating in 1993, and had their daughter, Sian, and a son, Levi. They were married on June 22, 2002.\nThe Edge appeared in the 2009 music documentary film \"It Might Get Loud\". He is also a Methodist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":91},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":125},{"uri":"Keyboardist","surface_form":"keyboardist","offset":136},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"backing vocalist","offset":152},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":177},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock","offset":183},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":188},{"uri":"U2","surface_form":"U2","offset":193},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":278},{"uri":"Welsh_people","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":336},{"uri":"County_Dublin","surface_form":"County Dublin","offset":380},{"uri":"St._Andrew%27s_National_School","surface_form":"St. Andrew's National School","offset":423},{"uri":"Mount_Temple_Comprehensive_School","surface_form":"Mount Temple Comprehensive School","offset":522},{"uri":"Larry_Mullen_Jr.","surface_form":"Larry Mullen Jr.","offset":603},{"uri":"Boy_(album)","surface_form":"Boy","offset":935},{"uri":"Bono","surface_form":"Bono","offset":1133},{"uri":"Sunday_Bloody_Sunday_(song)","surface_form":"Sunday Bloody Sunday","offset":1286},{"uri":"Zoo_TV_Tour","surface_form":"Zoo TV Tour","offset":1654},{"uri":"Methodist","surface_form":"Methodist","offset":1913}]}
