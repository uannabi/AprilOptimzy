{"id":11639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrology","text":"=\"preserve\">Andrology is the study of male health, especially male sexual organs and reproduction.\nIt is similar to the study of women's health, called gynaecology. Andrology has only been studied since the late 1960s. The first specialist journal on the subject was the German periodical \"Andrologie\", published from 1969 onwards.\nMen are more susceptible to heart disease than women. They also usually have a slightly shorter natural average life span. However, men get many conditions, such as osteoporosis, less than women.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gynaecology","surface_form":"gynaecology","offset":152},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":212},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":271},{"uri":"1969","surface_form":"1969","offset":318},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":360},{"uri":"Average_life_span","surface_form":"average life span","offset":436},{"uri":"Osteoporosis","surface_form":"osteoporosis","offset":497}]}
