{"id":116479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism_in_Pakistan","text":"Sikhism is a very small minority religion in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan but has many cultural, historical and political ties to the country, and to the historical region of the Punjab.\nToday, Pakistan, a nation of over 170 million, is 97% Muslim, with Christians and Hindus making up the largest minority faiths, each absorbing about 1.5% of the population. Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, members of heterodox (according to Pakistani law) Islamic faiths and some adherents to animist religions make up the remainder. Information is scarce on minority adherents. According to the CIA Fact File, there are no more than 20,000 Sikhs in Pakistan now. To put this in perspective had there not been a partition in 1947 then the region that is called Pakistan to day would have had around 13 million Sikhs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sikhism","surface_form":"Sikhism","offset":0},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan","offset":49},{"uri":"Punjab_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"the Punjab","offset":179},{"uri":"Sikhs","surface_form":"Sikhs","offset":364},{"uri":"Zoroastrians","surface_form":"Zoroastrians","offset":371},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":385}]}
