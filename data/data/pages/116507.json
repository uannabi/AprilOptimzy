{"id":116507,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph","text":"=\"preserve\">A glyph is an element of writing. Example: the ligature \u00E6 in arch\u00E6ology represents a and e letters.\nMore exactly, a glyph is an element in an agreed set of symbols. A mark used in a language is a glyph, but in another language it may not be a glyph. For example, an n with tilde, \u00F1, is used only in Spanish, as in pi\u00F1ata. It is not a glyph in English.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ligature_(typography)","surface_form":"ligature","offset":59},{"uri":"Tilde","surface_form":"tilde","offset":285},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":311},{"uri":"Pi%C3%B1ata","surface_form":"pi\u00F1ata","offset":326}]}
