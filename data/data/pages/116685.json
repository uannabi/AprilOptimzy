{"id":116685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Texas Rangers are an American Major League Baseball team from Arlington, Texas. The team plays in Arlington, but it also represents the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth and the surrounding area. The Rangers are part of the Western Division of Major League Baseball's American League.\nTheir first home field in Texas was Arlington Stadium. They built Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, later known as Globe Life Park in Arlington, next door, and tore down Arlington Stadium when they moved in to the new stadium. After the 2019 season, they left Globe Life Park for the new Globe Life Field, located across the street. Globe Life Park was then rebuilt into a football and soccer stadium.\nThe team began in 1961 as the Washington Senators. The Senators played poorly and had too few fans to support them. The team moved to Arlington, Texas, in 1972. They were renamed in honor of the famous state police force called the Texas Rangers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had also been a minor league baseball team called the Dallas Rangers.\nPostseason.\nOn October 22, 2010, the Rangers won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) for the first time. They beat the then-defending champion New York Yankees four games to two in the series. This was their first trip to the World Series, but they lost the San Francisco Giants in five games.\nIn 2011, the Rangers again reached the World Series, and again lost, this time to the St. Louis Cardinals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"American","offset":38},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":47},{"uri":"Arlington%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Arlington","offset":79},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":90},{"uri":"Dallas%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":163},{"uri":"Fort_Worth%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Fort Worth","offset":174},{"uri":"American_League_West","surface_form":"Western Division","offset":239},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":283},{"uri":"Globe_Life_Park_in_Arlington","surface_form":"Globe Life Park in Arlington","offset":412},{"uri":"Globe_Life_Field","surface_form":"Globe Life Field","offset":585},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":670},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":683},{"uri":"Texas_Ranger_Division","surface_form":"Texas Rangers","offset":931},{"uri":"Minor_league_baseball","surface_form":"minor league baseball","offset":1003},{"uri":"American_League_Championship_Series","surface_form":"American League Championship Series","offset":1110},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":1211},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":1294},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Giants","surface_form":"San Francisco Giants","offset":1326},{"uri":"St._Louis_Cardinals","surface_form":"St. Louis Cardinals","offset":1448}]}
