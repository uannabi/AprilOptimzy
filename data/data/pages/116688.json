{"id":116688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_suite","text":"In computing, an office suite, sometimes called an office software suite or productivity suite is a software suite for use by workers. The parts of an office suite are usually come together, have a standard user interface and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways operating systems would not normally allow.\n20th century office suites operated \"offline,\" not using the Internet. Examples that are still widely used include Microsoft Office and LibreOffice. Some can operate \"online\", including Microsoft Office Online, Google Docs, and LibreOffice Online.\nCurrent suites.\nThe most used office suite is Microsoft Office, which is available for Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh. It has become a proprietary standard in office software.\nAnother office suite is any of the OpenDocument suites, which use the free OpenDocument file format. The most used one was OpenOffice.org, open-source software that can be used in Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and has created several other office suites similar to it, such as the Mac-native NeoOffice. Other free or less expensive office suites include LibreOffice, StarOffice, SoftMaker Office, KOffice and WPS Office. These programs support many of the features of Microsoft Office, and can open the files it creates and save new documents in those formats.\nApple computers have iWork, which is a office suite created specially for Mac OS X. It includes Pages, for word-processing, Numbers for spreadsheets, and Keynote, for presentations. They can also use Microsoft Office for Mac, or StarOffice, KOffice, NeoOffice and OpenOffice.org, which all can be used on Apple computers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computing","surface_form":"computing","offset":3},{"uri":"Software_suite","surface_form":"software suite","offset":100},{"uri":"User_interface","surface_form":"user interface","offset":207},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":282},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office","surface_form":"Microsoft Office","offset":441},{"uri":"LibreOffice","surface_form":"LibreOffice","offset":462},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office_Online","surface_form":"Microsoft Office Online","offset":512},{"uri":"Google_Docs","surface_form":"Google Docs","offset":537},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office","surface_form":"Microsoft Office","offset":620},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":661},{"uri":"Apple_Macintosh","surface_form":"Apple Macintosh","offset":687},{"uri":"Proprietary_software","surface_form":"proprietary","offset":720},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":751},{"uri":"OpenDocument","surface_form":"OpenDocument","offset":796},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free","offset":831},{"uri":"OpenDocument","surface_form":"OpenDocument","offset":836},{"uri":"OpenOffice.org","surface_form":"OpenOffice.org","offset":884},{"uri":"Open-source_software","surface_form":"open-source software","offset":900},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":950},{"uri":"Apple_Macintosh","surface_form":"Macintosh","offset":957},{"uri":"Apple_Macintosh","surface_form":"Mac","offset":1039},{"uri":"NeoOffice","surface_form":"NeoOffice","offset":1050},{"uri":"LibreOffice","surface_form":"LibreOffice","offset":1112},{"uri":"StarOffice","surface_form":"StarOffice","offset":1125},{"uri":"KOffice","surface_form":"KOffice","offset":1155},{"uri":"IWork","surface_form":"iWork","offset":1340},{"uri":"Mac_OS_X","surface_form":"Mac OS X","offset":1393},{"uri":"Pages","surface_form":"Pages","offset":1415},{"uri":"Numbers_(software)","surface_form":"Numbers","offset":1443},{"uri":"Keynote_(software)","surface_form":"Keynote","offset":1473},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office","surface_form":"Microsoft Office","offset":1519}]}
