{"id":11671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Rundgren","text":"Todd Harry Rundgren (born June 22, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Two of his best-known songs are \"I Saw The Light\" and \"Hello It's Me\". Both were on his 1971 album \"Something/Anything?\". Most of the songs on that album were performed by Rundgren alone, using multitrack recorders and playing many musical instruments.\nApple Records hired Rundgren to produce an album, \"Straight Up\", for the band Badfinger during 1971. Badfinger had not heard of Rundgren and did not know his music, until they bought copies of some of his records. They liked what they heard, and when Rundgren met the band, they got along well, and worked well together.\nIn the early 2000s, Rundgren replaced Ric Ocasek as bandleader of The Cars, when they reunited to tour.\nActress Liv Tyler used to believe that Rundgren was her father.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":47},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":56},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":64},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"record producer","offset":80},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":119},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":190},{"uri":"Multitrack_recording","surface_form":"multitrack recorder","offset":291},{"uri":"Apple_Records","surface_form":"Apple Records","offset":350},{"uri":"Badfinger","surface_form":"Badfinger","offset":428},{"uri":"Ric_Ocasek","surface_form":"Ric Ocasek","offset":709},{"uri":"The_Cars","surface_form":"The Cars","offset":737},{"uri":"Liv_Tyler","surface_form":"Liv Tyler","offset":783}]}
