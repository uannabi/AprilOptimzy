He also went on four main expeditions to explore south eastern Australia.\nEarly life.\nThomas Mitchell was born in Craigend, now part of Glasgow, Scotland on June 15, 1792. He worked in his uncle's colliery (coal mine) business. He joined the British Army in 1811 with the rank of lieutenant. He fought in the Peninsula War in Spain against Napoleon. As well as actual fighting, he worked as a surveyor and made maps. After the war he made maps of the battlefields. He was made a Major in 1826, but was then put on half pay.\nSurveyor-General.\nMitchell was given a job as a surveyor in New South Wales in September 1827. His job was to map roads, and join existing small maps into one big map that showed all of New South Wales. After John Oxley died in 1828, Mitchell was made the Surveyor-General, in charge of all the survey work. He planned and improved the layout of roads, bridges, towns, and public reserves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"June_15","surface_form":"June 15","offset":42},{"uri":"1792","surface_form":"1792","offset":51},{"uri":"October_5","surface_form":"October 5","offset":58},{"uri":"1855","surface_form":"1855","offset":69},{"uri":"Surveyor","surface_form":"Surveyor","offset":82},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":102},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":136},{"uri":"Craigend","surface_form":"Craigend","offset":278},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":300},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":309},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":371},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mine","offset":376},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":406},{"uri":"1811","surface_form":"1811","offset":422},{"uri":"Lieutenant","surface_form":"lieutenant","offset":444},{"uri":"Peninsula_War","surface_form":"Peninsula War","offset":473},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":490},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":504},{"uri":"Surveyor","surface_form":"surveyor","offset":557},{"uri":"1826","surface_form":"1826","offset":652},{"uri":"Surveyor","surface_form":"surveyor","offset":736},{"uri":"1827","surface_form":"1827","offset":777},{"uri":"John_Oxley","surface_form":"John Oxley","offset":897},{"uri":"1828","surface_form":"1828","offset":916}]}
