{"id":116806,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron","text":"e=\"preserve\">Baron is a title of honour in many European peerage systems. It is often a hereditary title that ranks as the one of the lower titles in a peerage. In the UK peerage system, the five peerage titles from highest to lowest are duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. Baronets and knights are not members of the peerage although a baron may also be a knight. In the feudalism of medieval England a baron was a tenant-in-chief who held his lands directly from the king. During the 13th century barons were summoned by royal writ to attend Parliament.\nThe word baron comes from Old French \"baron\", itself from Frankish \"baro\" meaning \"freeman, warrior\". It later merged with Old English \"beorn\" meaning \"nobleman.\" The lands of a baron are called a barony. The female title for a baron is \"baroness\". The form of address for a baron is \"Lord\" and for a baroness \"Lady\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Title","surface_form":"title","offset":24},{"uri":"Honor","surface_form":"honour","offset":33},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"European","offset":48},{"uri":"Peerage","surface_form":"peerage","offset":57},{"uri":"Hereditary","surface_form":"hereditary","offset":88},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":168},{"uri":"Duke","surface_form":"duke","offset":238},{"uri":"Marquess","surface_form":"marquess","offset":244},{"uri":"Earl","surface_form":"earl","offset":254},{"uri":"Viscount","surface_form":"viscount","offset":260},{"uri":"Baronet","surface_form":"Baronet","offset":280},{"uri":"Knight","surface_form":"knight","offset":293},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudalism","offset":378},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":391},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":400},{"uri":"Tenant-in-chief","surface_form":"tenant-in-chief","offset":422},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":475},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":492},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"royal","offset":529},{"uri":"Writ","surface_form":"writ","offset":535},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":550},{"uri":"Old_French","surface_form":"Old French","offset":588},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Frankish","offset":620},{"uri":"Warrior","surface_form":"warrior","offset":654},{"uri":"Old_English_language","surface_form":"Old English","offset":685}]}
