It gave its name to the Battle of Carrhae (53 BC), fought between the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire.\nHarran's ruins are from Roman, Sabian, and Islamic times. T. E. Lawrence surveyed the site, and an Anglo-Turkish excavation was begun in 1951.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa_Province","surface_form":"\u015Eanl\u0131urfa Province","offset":48},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":87},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":133},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":277},{"uri":"Canaan","surface_form":"Canaan","offset":309},{"uri":"Sin_(mythology)","surface_form":"Sin","offset":374},{"uri":"Neo-Babylonian_Empire","surface_form":"Babylonians","offset":389},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":415},{"uri":"Battle_of_Carrhae","surface_form":"Battle of Carrhae","offset":519},{"uri":"Roman_Republic","surface_form":"Roman Republic","offset":565},{"uri":"Parthian_Empire","surface_form":"Parthian Empire","offset":588},{"uri":"Sabian","surface_form":"Sabian","offset":636},{"uri":"Caliphate","surface_form":"Islamic","offset":648},{"uri":"T._E._Lawrence","surface_form":"T.
