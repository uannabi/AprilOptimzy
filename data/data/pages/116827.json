{"id":116827,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays","text":"The\u00A0Toronto Blue Jays\u00A0(nicknamed the\u00A0Jays) is a\u00A0Major League Baseball\u00A0team in\u00A0Toronto,\u00A0Ontario, Canada. They are part of the Eastern Division\u00A0of Major League Baseball's\u00A0American League. This means that they use the designated hitter rule in most of their games. Its president & CEO is Mark Shapiro, its general manager is Ross Atkins, and its coach and manager is John Gibbons. The team plays 162 games every year, which can be seen on television and heard on radio all across Canada.\nThe Blue Jays were founded in 1977 and are the only MLB team from Canada\u00A0or anywhere outside of the\u00A0United States, but they have not been the only one or even the first. There were also the\u00A0Montreal Expos, which was formed in 1969, eight years before the Jays. However, the Expos moved to\u00A0Washington, D.C.\u00A0in 2004 (becoming the\u00A0Washington Nationals). As part of the National League, which does not use the designated hitter rule, the Expos became rivals\u00A0to the Blue Jays. People loved to see the two teams play against each other, since they were the only two MLB teams from Canada.\nThe first stadium used by the Blue Jays was Exhibition Stadium, part of Exhibition Place, in Downtown Toronto, near the waterfront. The team became popular, and in 1989 they moved to a larger stadium to the east, the \"SkyDome\". It was the first in the world to have a retractable roof, and is just a few blocks away from the Air Canada Centre and Union Station. The SkyDome hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1991. It is now called Rogers Centre, taking its name from Rogers Communications, a telecommunications company who owns the team.\nThe Blue Jays won the\u00A0World Series\u00A0twice, first in 1992 against the Atlanta Braves and again the next year, in 1993. They won their second World Series on Joe Carter's walk-off home run against the Philadelphia Phillies in the last\u00A0inning\u00A0of Game 6 on October 23, 1993, for a final score of 7-6. In both of those years, the team won American League East division titles (having the best win-loss record in their division). Others years in which the Jays won division titles were in 1985, 1989, 1991, and most recently in 2015. They also went to the playoffs as a wild card team in 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":48},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":78},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":87},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":96},{"uri":"American_League_East","surface_form":"Eastern Division","offset":125},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":169},{"uri":"Designated_hitter","surface_form":"designated hitter","offset":215},{"uri":"CEO","surface_form":"CEO","offset":278},{"uri":"Mark_Shapiro","surface_form":"Mark Shapiro","offset":285},{"uri":"Ross_Atkins","surface_form":"Ross Atkins","offset":322},{"uri":"Coach_(sport)","surface_form":"coach","offset":343},{"uri":"Manager_(baseball)","surface_form":"manager","offset":353},{"uri":"John_Gibbons","surface_form":"John Gibbons","offset":364},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":436},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":460},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":551},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":585},{"uri":"Montreal_Expos","surface_form":"Montreal Expos","offset":675},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":774},{"uri":"Washington_Nationals","surface_form":"Washington Nationals","offset":813},{"uri":"National_League","surface_form":"National League","offset":851},{"uri":"Rival","surface_form":"rival","offset":932},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":1078},{"uri":"Exhibition_Stadium","surface_form":"Exhibition Stadium","offset":1112},{"uri":"Exhibition_Place","surface_form":"Exhibition Place","offset":1140},{"uri":"Downtown_Toronto","surface_form":"Downtown Toronto","offset":1161},{"uri":"SkyDome","surface_form":"SkyDome","offset":1286},{"uri":"Retractable_roof","surface_form":"retractable roof","offset":1336},{"uri":"Air_Canada_Centre","surface_form":"Air Canada Centre","offset":1393},{"uri":"Union_Station_(Toronto)","surface_form":"Union Station","offset":1415},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","surface_form":"Major League Baseball All-Star Game","offset":1453},{"uri":"Rogers_Centre","surface_form":"Rogers Centre","offset":1515},{"uri":"Rogers_Communications","surface_form":"Rogers Communications","offset":1551},{"uri":"Telecommunication","surface_form":"telecommunication","offset":1576},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":1644},{"uri":"Atlanta_Braves","surface_form":"Atlanta Braves","offset":1690},{"uri":"Joe_Carter","surface_form":"Joe Carter","offset":1777},{"uri":"Walk-off_home_run","surface_form":"walk-off","offset":1790},{"uri":"Home_run","surface_form":"home run","offset":1799},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Phillies","surface_form":"Philadelphia Phillies","offset":1820},{"uri":"Inning","surface_form":"inning","offset":1854},{"uri":"Playoffs","surface_form":"playoffs","offset":2171},{"uri":"Wild_card_(sports)","surface_form":"wild card team","offset":2185}]}
