{"id":116865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11","text":"Apollo 11 was the first flight to send people to the moon. It was done by NASA, the American space group.\nIt went up to space on July 16, 1969, carrying three astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon, while Collins stayed in orbit around the Moon.\nThe flight was part of the Space Race. It finished the plan set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 to \"land a man on the moon, and return him safely to the Earth\", before the 1960s ended.\nGoing to and from space.\nMillions of people around the world viewed the flight of Apollo 11 on television. When the rocket was sent to space it was a world-wide event. Richard Nixon, who was then President, watched it from the White House as the rocket went up. A Saturn V rocket took flight from the Kennedy Space Center in America.\nAbout two hours after leaving Earth the passenger module departed the main rocket. The passenger module had two main parts, the Apollo command and service module called \"Columbia\" and the Apollo Lunar Module called \"Eagle\". \"Columbia\" was the space ship that stayed in space, and \"Eagle\" was the moon-landing space ship. 3 days later the team entered Lunar Orbit (orbit around the moon). A day later the \"Eagle\" went away from \"Columbia\". The \"Eagle\" landed safely on the moon with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin inside. During the landing there were several problems with the computer. To land safely Armstrong had to fly the \"Eagle\" himself. They landed with only 25\u00A0seconds of fuel left.\nLeaving the moon and returning to Earth.\nOn July 24 the three astronauts returned to Earth and were immediately placed into quarantine (kept away from other people), in case they brought back some disease from the moon. They stayed in quarantine for three weeks. When they got out the men were heroes around the world. They had dinner with President Nixon, a parade in New York City and another one in Chicago. The three were also on many television shows.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/Dock","spaceflight/Dock"],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":53},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":74},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"American","offset":84},{"uri":"Astronaut","surface_form":"astronaut","offset":159},{"uri":"Neil_Armstrong","surface_form":"Neil Armstrong","offset":171},{"uri":"Buzz_Aldrin","surface_form":"Buzz Aldrin","offset":187},{"uri":"Michael_Collins_(astronaut)","surface_form":"Michael Collins","offset":203},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":328},{"uri":"Space_Race","surface_form":"Space Race","offset":378},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
