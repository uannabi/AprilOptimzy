It is the largest business group and family of record labels in the world. It started in 1934 as \"Decca Records USA\" and had some other names, before it became \"Universal Music Group\" in 1996. The company is based in Santa Monica, California.\nUMG controls 25.5% of the market share. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of French company Vivendi; Universal Studios, the movie studio, was sold in part to NBC, which itself is part of GE. UMG owns the largest music publishing business in the world, Universal Music Publishing Group, following the acquisition of BMG Music Publishing in May 2007. Vivendi's headquarters are in Paris, France. In the United States, UMG is in Santa Monica, California, and New York City, along with Universal Music Group Nashville; in the UK the group has a number of offices in London and Romford.\nHistory of the company.\n\"Universal Music\" was once the music company for the movie studio Universal Pictures. MCA Inc. bought American Decca in 1962. Seagram, the owner of MCA, would buy PolyGram in 1998 to form Universal Music Group (which had been MCA before 1996).\nThe branches of \"UMG\" now count Capitol Records, Virgin Records, Interscope Records, A&M Records, Geffen Records, Island Records and Def Jam Recordings.\nIn 2007, Universal bought BMG's music publishing branch and folded it into the \"Universal Music Publishing\" division.\nIn 2012, Universal bought most of EMI's music recordings. After the buyout, Universal then sold some labels such as V2, Sanctuary, Mute, and Parlophone.\nUniversal Music has announced that it will develop an online site for music videos inspired by Hulu.com, the site setup by News Corp and NBC that allows free streaming of television shows. This website is named Vevo, and its music videos have been watched billions of times on YouTube.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":27},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":50},{"uri":"Music_industry","surface_form":"music industry","offset":71},{"uri":"Business_group","surface_form":"business group","offset":105},{"uri":"Santa_Monica%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Monica, California","offset":304},{"uri":"Vivendi","surface_form":"Vivendi","offset":420},{"uri":"Universal_Studios","surface_form":"Universal Studios","offset":429},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":486},{"uri":"General_Electric","surface_form":"GE","offset":515},{"uri":"Music_publisher_(popular_music)","surface_form":"music publishing","offset":540},{"uri":"Universal_Music_Publishing_Group","surface_form":"Universal Music Publishing Group","offset":580},{"uri":"Bertelsmann_Music_Group","surface_form":"BMG Music Publishing","offset":643},{"uri":"Vivendi","surface_form":"Vivendi's","offset":677},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":707},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":714},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":729},{"uri":"Santa_Monica%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Monica","offset":754},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":768},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":784},{"uri":"Universal_Music_Group_Nashville","surface_form":"Universal Music Group Nashville","offset":810},{"uri":"Romford","surface_form":"Romford","offset":901},{"uri":"Universal_Pictures","surface_form":"Universal Pictures","offset":1000},{"uri":"MCA","surface_form":"MCA","offset":1020},{"uri":"Seagram","surface_form":"Seagram","offset":1060},{"uri":"PolyGram","surface_form":"PolyGram","offset":1097},{"uri":"Capitol_Records","surface_form":"Capitol Records","offset":1210},{"uri":"Virgin_Records","surface_form":"Virgin Records","offset":1227},{"uri":"Interscope_Records","surface_form":"Interscope Records","offset":1243},{"uri":"A%26amp%3BM_Records","surface_form":"A&M Records","offset":1263},{"uri":"Geffen_Records","surface_form":"Geffen Records","offset":1276},{"uri":"Island_Records","surface_form":"Island Records","offset":1292},{"uri":"Def_Jam_Recordings","surface_form":"Def Jam Recordings","offset":1311},{"uri":"BMG","surface_form":"BMG","offset":1357},{"uri":"EMI","surface_form":"EMI","offset":1483},{"uri":"News_Corp","surface_form":"News Corp","offset":1725},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":1739},{"uri":"Vevo","surface_form":"Vevo","offset":1813},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":1879}]}
