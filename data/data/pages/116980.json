{"id":116980,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible","text":"The Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible or the Mazarin Bible) is a printed version of the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible that was printed by Johannes Gutenberg, in Mainz, Germany in the 15th century. Although it is not the first book to be printed by Gutenberg's new movable type system, it is his major work, and of central importance for the start of the \"Gutenberg Revolution\" and the \"Age of the Printed Book\". It is a very rare and expensive book. Fewer than 200 were made, and 49 complete or nearly complete ones are known. It has 1286 pages.\nThe earliest known book with movable type was published 78 years before in Korea and is known as the Jikji.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vulgate","surface_form":"Vulgate","offset":109},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":136},{"uri":"Johannes_Gutenberg","surface_form":"Johannes Gutenberg","offset":162},{"uri":"Mainz","surface_form":"Mainz","offset":185},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":192},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th century","offset":207},{"uri":"Jikji","surface_form":"Jikji","offset":671}]}
