{"id":117005,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain","text":"Marie-Sophie Germain (April 1, 1776 \u2013 June 27, 1831) was a French mathematician who made important contributions to differential geometry and number theory.\nEarly life.\nGermain identified prime numbers. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by one and itself. She was not allowed to learn math as a child. She secretly read books that were in her father\u2019s library, even though this was not allowed. She also stole notes from lectures at the \u00C9cole Polytechnique. She first sent her work to other mathematicians under a male name. She did this because she wanted a better opportunity. She also did not want to be laughed at for being female. She was inspired by reading Archimedes.\nWork.\nShe won a prize from the French Academy of Sciences. She won this because she solved an elasticity math problem. Her discoveries helped develop important buildings. She contributed to the making of the Eiffel Tower. Germain became the first women not related to a member by marriage to attend a Academies Science Meeting.\nThe Sophie Germain prime and Crater Germain on Venus are named after her.\nLater life.\nGermain died of breast cancer on June 27, 1831 in Paris.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":59},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":66},{"uri":"Differential_geometry","surface_form":"differential geometry","offset":116},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":142},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":188},{"uri":"French_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"French Academy of Sciences","offset":723},{"uri":"Elasticity_(physics)","surface_form":"elasticity","offset":786},{"uri":"Eiffel_Tower","surface_form":"Eiffel Tower","offset":900},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus","offset":1067}]}
