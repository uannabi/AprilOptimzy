{"id":11702,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn","text":"Tallinn is the capital of Estonia. It is on the north-eastern coast of Estonia and borders the Gulf of Finland. The city is next to many lakes. The largest of these lakes is called Lake \u00DClemiste, and most Tallinnites get their drinking water from this lake.\nTallinn's Old Town, which is the historic town center, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nTallinn first appeared on a map in 1154, when the cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, calling the city \"Qlwn\", added it to his map of the world. After being conquered by the Danes, the city was known as \"Reval\" until Estonia became an independent nation in the 1920s.\nIn 1285, the city became a part of the Hanseatic League. As a result, in the Middle Ages Tallinn was an important stop on the trade routes between Europe and Russia. During its history Estonia has been ruled at times by Sweden and by Russia. It became independent in 1918 after World War I, but after World War II it was ruled by the USSR. In March 1944 Tallinn was bombed by Soviet Air Force, killing 436 civilians and totally destroying 5073 buildings. Since 1991, Tallinn has been the capital of an independent Estonia.\nToday more than 400,000 people live in Tallinn, which is one third of the population of Estonia. It is a big sea port. Its food and textile industries are important. The town has many pretty, old buildings.\nClimate.\nThe chart below shows the climate of Tallinn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":15},{"uri":"Estonia","surface_form":"Estonia","offset":26},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Finland","surface_form":"Gulf of Finland","offset":95},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":137},{"uri":"Lake_%C3%9Clemiste","surface_form":"Lake \u00DClemiste","offset":181},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":318},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":325},{"uri":"Cartography","surface_form":"cartographer","offset":405},{"uri":"Muhammad_al-Idrisi","surface_form":"Muhammad al-Idrisi","offset":418},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danes","offset":526},{"uri":"1285","surface_form":"1285","offset":623},{"uri":"Hanseatic_League","surface_form":"Hanseatic League","offset":659},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":697},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":767},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":778},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":840},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":898},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":921},{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"USSR","offset":954},{"uri":"1944","surface_form":"1944","offset":969},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":1266},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":1275}]}
