{"id":117084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg_Cathedral","text":"Strasbourg Cathedral (official French: Notre-Dame de Strasbourg,German: Liebfrauenm\u00FCnster zu Stra\u00DFburg, Our Lady of Strasbourg) is the Cathedral in Strasbourg. The cathedral was built in Gothic style. The belltower is 142 m high. It was the highest building in the world from 1647 to 1874. It is currently the second-highest cathedral in France, after Rouen Cathedral, which is 9m higher, at 151m. In 1880, Cologne Cathedral was finished (157m), and later Ulm minster (at 161m), the highest Cathedral in the World.\nConsiderable parts of it are still in Romanesque architecture. Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be among the finest examples of high, or late, Gothic architecture. Erwin von Steinbach is credited for major contributions from 1277 to his death in 1318.\nVictor Hugo described it as a \"gigantic and delicate marvel\". The cathedral is visible far across the plains of Alsace and can be seen from as far off as the Vosges mountains or the Black Forest on the other side of the Rhine.\nAn Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the adjacent Christmas market was prevented in 2000 by French and German police.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"Cathedral","offset":135},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":148},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic style","offset":187},{"uri":"Rouen_Cathedral","surface_form":"Rouen Cathedral","offset":352},{"uri":"Cologne_Cathedral","surface_form":"Cologne Cathedral","offset":407},{"uri":"Ulm_minster","surface_form":"Ulm minster","offset":456},{"uri":"Romanesque_architecture","surface_form":"Romanesque architecture","offset":553},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic architecture","offset":666},{"uri":"Erwin_von_Steinbach","surface_form":"Erwin von Steinbach","offset":687},{"uri":"Victor_Hugo","surface_form":"Victor Hugo","offset":775},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":887},{"uri":"Vosges_mountains","surface_form":"Vosges mountains","offset":933},{"uri":"Black_Forest","surface_form":"Black Forest","offset":957},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":995},{"uri":"Strasbourg_cathedral_bombing_plot","surface_form":"Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the adjacent Christmas market","offset":1005}]}
