{"id":117122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_Chapel_at_Windsor_Castle","text":"St George's Chapel is the church at Windsor Castle in England. The chapel is governed by the Dean and Canons of Windsor and is found in the Lower Ward of the castle.\nThe status of the Abbey is that of a Royal Peculiar. This means it is place of worship that falls directly under the jurisdiction of the British monarch, rather than under a bishop. The concept dates from Anglo-Saxon times, when a church could ally itself with the monarch and therefore not be subject to the bishop of the area. Technically speaking, it is not a cathedral, though it has a similar status. Many Royal weddings and other ceremonies with the British Crown have taken place there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":26},{"uri":"Windsor_Castle","surface_form":"Windsor Castle","offset":36},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":54},{"uri":"Dean","surface_form":"Dean","offset":93},{"uri":"Canon","surface_form":"Canon","offset":102},{"uri":"Ward","surface_form":"Ward","offset":146},{"uri":"Royal_Peculiar","surface_form":"Royal Peculiar","offset":203},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":311},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":340},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":371},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":529},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":583}]}
