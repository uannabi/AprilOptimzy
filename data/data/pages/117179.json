{"id":117179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Hockey_America","text":"e=\"preserve\">College Hockey America (CHA) is a group of American colleges and universities who play NCAA Division I women's ice hockey against one another every season. It was founded in 1999 as a men's hockey conference, with women's teams joining in 2002. The men's side of CHA folded after the 2009\u201310 season. As of the current 2013\u201314 season, CHA has six members, which is the minimum needed to earn an automatic place in the NCAA women's tournament. However, because three of these schools only joined in July 2012, CHA will not get an automatic tournament place until at least the 2014\u201315 season.\nCHA has close ties with Atlantic Hockey, a men's hockey-only conference. Although the conferences do not share offices, they have the same commissioner, and three current CHA members are also in Atlantic Hockey.\nCurrent members.\nOf the current members, Mercyhurst, RIT, and Robert Morris have varsity men's teams in Atlantic Hockey. Penn State has a men's varsity team that plays in the school's all-sports conference, the Big Ten. Syracuse has a men's team, but it plays at club level, outside the NCAA structure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":56},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":65},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":78},{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":100},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":124},{"uri":"Atlantic_Hockey","surface_form":"Atlantic Hockey","offset":627},{"uri":"Big_Ten_Conference","surface_form":"Big Ten","offset":1026}]}
