{"id":117265,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file","text":"A text file is a computer file structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text. Each line is a sequence of printable characters.\nThey can be opened and edited with Wordpad, Notepad, and other text editors. Text files usually contain plain text and not binary data. Whether it be a story, recipe, or even directions to Grandma's house, you can put it in a text file.\nWhen text is stored with Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org the file is no more called a text file, but a word processor file or document file.\nText files are commonly encountered with an extension of.doc.txt, and many others, depending on the software and hardware you choose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"computer file","offset":17},{"uri":"Edit","surface_form":"edit","offset":157},{"uri":"Wordpad","surface_form":"Wordpad","offset":169},{"uri":"Notepad","surface_form":"Notepad","offset":178},{"uri":"Text_editor","surface_form":"text editor","offset":197},{"uri":"Plain_text","surface_form":"plain text","offset":238},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":257},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":264},{"uri":"Microsoft_Word","surface_form":"Microsoft Word","offset":396},{"uri":"OpenOffice.org","surface_form":"OpenOffice.org","offset":414}]}
