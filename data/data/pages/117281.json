{"id":117281,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Pakistan","text":"The 2001 Local Government Ordinance provides for devolution of government to district administrations. (Districts are the third tier of government, being sub-divisions of provinces. Prior to the Local Government Ordnance they were known as \"sub-divisions\".) Each district administration is headed by a District Coordinating Officer (\"DCO\"] and a \"Zila Nazim\".\nThe District Coordination Officer is the administrative head of the District Administration. They have wide-ranging responsibility for overseeing, improving and directing the approved plans of the District Government.\nThe Zila Nazim is the executive head of the District Administration. Their role is similar to district governor or prefect, with responsibility for implementing government strategy and developing initiatives arising out of it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Districts","surface_form":"Districts","offset":104},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"provinces","offset":171},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":681},{"uri":"Prefect","surface_form":"prefect","offset":693}]}
