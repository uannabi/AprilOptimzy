He was a philospher as well. He was also a social reformer. He founded the school that would later become Aligarh Muslim University.\nIn 1857 there was a rebellion in India. This is known as the First Indian War of Independence. During this time, Sir Syed kept loyal to the British; He also saved many European lives. After the rebellion he wrote a book where he said the British were in fact those who caused the rebellion.In order to settle the question of whether Sir Syed was a communitarian or a communalist, we need to assess the speeches and articles which he wrote.

He said,\nSir Syed Ahmed Khan played a vital role in improving the Muslim status. He worked tirelessly to restore relations between the Muslims and the British. He brought the Muslim revival through the Aligarh movement and showed the importance of education.
