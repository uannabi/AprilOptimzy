It became a symbol of resistance to the English rule of British-occupied India. The poem exists in different versions. Saare Jahan Se Achchha () is one of the enduring patriotic poems of the Urdu language. Written originally for children in the ghazal style of Urdu poetry by poet Muhammad Iqbal, the poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 14 August 1931. Recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, now in Pakistan, it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British rule in India.\n\"s\u0101re jah\u0101\u00F1 se achch\u0101 hindustan ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"ham bulbule\u00F1 hai\u00F1 us k\u012B vuh gulsit\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"\u0121hurbat me\u00F1 ho\u00F1 agar ham, raht\u0101 hai dil vat\u0324an me\u00F1\"\n\"samjho vuh\u012B\u00F1 hame\u00F1 bh\u012B dil ho jah\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"parbat vuh sab se \u016B\u00F1ch\u0101, hams\u0101yah \u0101sm\u0101\u00F1 k\u0101\"\n\"vuh santar\u012B ham\u0101r\u0101, vuh p\u0101sb\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"god\u012B me\u00F1 khelt\u012B hai\u00F1 jis k\u012B haz\u0101ro\u00F1 nadiy\u0101\u00F1\"\n\"gulshan hai jin ke dam se rashk-e jan\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"ay \u0101b-r\u016Bd-e Ganga! vuh din hai\u00F1 y\u0101d tujh ko?\"\n\"utar\u0101 tire kin\u0101re jab k\u0101rav\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"ma\u017Chab nah\u012B\u00F1 sikh\u0101t\u0101 \u0101pas me\u00F1 bair rakhn\u0101\"\n\"Hindi hai\u00F1 ham, vat\u0324an hai hindust\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"y\u016Bn\u0101n-o-mi\u1E63r-o-rum\u0101 sab mi\u1E6D ga\u02BEe jah\u0101\u00F1 se\"\n\"ab tak magar hai b\u0101q\u012B n\u0101m-o-nish\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"kuchh b\u0101t hai kih hast\u012B mi\u1E6Dt\u012B nah\u012B\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u012B\"\n\"sadiyo\u00F1 rah\u0101 hai dushman daur-e zam\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101\"\n\"iqb\u0101l! ko\u02BE\u012B ma\u1E25ram apn\u0101 nah\u012B\u00F1 jah\u0101\u00F1 me\u00F1\"\n\"ma\u02BFl\u016Bm ky\u0101 kis\u012B ko dard-e nih\u0101\u00F1 ham\u0101r\u0101!\"\nBetter than the entire world, is our Hindustan,\nWe are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode\nIf we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland,\nKnow us to be only there where our heart is.\nThat tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky,\n(It) is our sentry, (it) is our watchman\nIn its lap frolic those thousands of rivers,\nWhose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise.\nO the flowing waters of the Ganges, do you remember that day\nWhen our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront?\nReligion does not teach us to bear ill-will among ourselves\nWe are of Hindi, our homeland is Hindustan.\nIn a world in which ancient Yunan, Misr, and Roma have all vanished without trace\nOur own attributes (name and sign) live on today.\nSuch is our existence that it cannot be erased\nEven though, for centuries, the cycle of time has been our enemy.\nIqbal!
