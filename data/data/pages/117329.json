{"id":117329,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECAC_Lacrosse","text":"e=\"preserve\">ECAC Lacrosse, in full the ECAC Lacrosse League, was an American college sports conference that only played men's lacrosse. The conference, a member of NCAA Division I, was founded in 1999 with play beginning in 2000 (both events were in the same school year).\nECAC Lacrosse disbanded after the 2014 season. This came after the Big Ten Conference, home to two of the final five members, said it would start a men's lacrosse league in the 2015 season. Two of the other three final members soon announced moves to other conferences.\nFinal members.\nThese schools were members in the league's last season of 2014. Because NCAA lacrosse is a spring sport, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of play.\nOther members.\nThese schools left ECAC Lacrosse before 2014. As in the previous table, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of play.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":69},{"uri":"Lacrosse","surface_form":"lacrosse","offset":127},{"uri":"NCAA","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":165},{"uri":"Big_Ten_Conference","surface_form":"Big Ten Conference","offset":341}]}
