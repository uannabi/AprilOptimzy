{"id":117646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lower Manhattan (or downtown Manhattan) is the southernmost part of the island of Manhattan, the main island and center of business and government of the City of New York. Lower Manhattan or \"downtown\" is defined most commonly as the area delineated on the north by 14th Street, on the west by the Hudson River, on the east by the East River, and on the south by New York Harbor (also known as Upper New York Bay).\nWhen referring specifically to the lower Manhattan business district such as Wall Street and its immediate environs, the northern border is commonly designated by thoroughfares approximately a mile-and-a-half (3 km) south of 14th Street and a mile (2 km) north of the island's southern tip: Chambers Street from near the Hudson east to the Brooklyn Bridge entrances and overpass. Two other major arteries are also sometimes identified as lower Manhattan's northern border: Canal Street, half a mile north of Chambers Street, and 23rd Street, half a mile north of 14th Street.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":95},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"City of New York","offset":167},{"uri":"Downtown","surface_form":"downtown","offset":205},{"uri":"14th_Street_(Manhattan)","surface_form":"14th Street","offset":279},{"uri":"Hudson_River","surface_form":"Hudson River","offset":311},{"uri":"East_River","surface_form":"East River","offset":344},{"uri":"New_York_Harbor","surface_form":"New York Harbor","offset":376},{"uri":"Upper_New_York_Bay","surface_form":"Upper New York Bay","offset":407},{"uri":"Wall_Street","surface_form":"Wall Street","offset":505},{"uri":"Chambers_Street_(Manhattan)","surface_form":"Chambers Street","offset":719},{"uri":"Brooklyn_Bridge","surface_form":"Brooklyn Bridge","offset":768},{"uri":"Canal_Street_(Manhattan)","surface_form":"Canal Street","offset":901},{"uri":"23rd_Street_(Manhattan)","surface_form":"23rd Street","offset":957}]}
