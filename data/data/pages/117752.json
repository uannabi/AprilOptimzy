{"id":117752,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternoster","text":"A Paternoster is a type of elevator. Its design is different from that of other elevators. It has several cabins that constantly move up and down. They are linked on a chain. People can stop on or off at any floor they like.\nPaternosters have advantages and disadvantages. As an advantage, it is always possible to take them in either direction. Since the elevator moves at a slow speed, it is slower than a modern elevator. It takes longer to get to distant floors. Also, using a paternoaster takes some training. Paternosters are nearly impossible to use for disabled people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Elevator","surface_form":"elevator","offset":27}]}
