It was formed in 1993 as part of league realignment. The Pacific Division is the surviving successor of the Smythe Division; the now-defunct Northwest Division was the other successor. Of Pacific Division teams that existed in 1993, only the Anaheim Ducks never played in the Smythe Division (the Arizona Coyotes played in the Smythe when they were the original Winnipeg Jets).\nThe Pacific Division is centered around the Southwestern United States and Western Canada, with three teams based in California, two in Alberta, and one each in Arizona, British Columbia, and Nevada.\nThe San Jose Sharks have the most Pacific Division titles, with six. Five Stanley Cup winners have come from the Pacific Division: the Stars in 1999, the Colorado Avalanche in 1996, the Anaheim Ducks in 2007, and the Los Angeles Kings in 2012 and 2014.\nPacific Division titles won by team.\n\"Teams in bold are currently in the division.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":18},{"uri":"Western_Conference_(NHL)","surface_form":"Western Conference","offset":101},{"uri":"Smythe_Division","surface_form":"Smythe Division","offset":229},{"uri":"Northwest_Division_(NHL)","surface_form":"Northwest Division","offset":262},{"uri":"Anaheim_Ducks","surface_form":"Anaheim Ducks","offset":363},{"uri":"Arizona_Coyotes","surface_form":"Arizona Coyotes","offset":418},{"uri":"Winnipeg_Jets_(1972%E2%80%9396)","surface_form":"original Winnipeg Jets","offset":474},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":556},{"uri":"Western_Canada","surface_form":"Western Canada","offset":574},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":616},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":635},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":660},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":669},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":691},{"uri":"San_Jose_Sharks","surface_form":"San Jose Sharks","offset":703},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":773},{"uri":"Colorado_Avalanche","surface_form":"Colorado Avalanche","offset":853},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Kings","surface_form":"Los Angeles Kings","offset":916}]}
