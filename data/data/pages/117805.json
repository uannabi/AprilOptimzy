{"id":117805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Female ejaculation, also known as gushing or squirting, happens when a woman has an orgasm and clear fluid comes out of her. Scientists are not sure how the fluid is produced, but think it is produced by the Skene's glands (also called the paraurethral glands or female prostate). Female ejaculation was mentioned in ancient times by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.), and by doctors and people who study anatomy. However, in much of the 20th century there were people who did not believe that female ejaculation existed, and it was not studied in detail. More people found out about the matter after a book called \"The G Spot\" came out in 1982 and became popular. After that, more research was done on female ejaculation.\nNot accepted by others.\nThe theory advanced by these authors has been dismissed by many other authors, such as physiologist Joseph Bohlen, for not being based on rigorous scientific procedures, and psychiatrist Helen Singer Kaplan (1983).\nAt present, the issue is not decided.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"Scientists","offset":138},{"uri":"Skene%27s_gland","surface_form":"Skene's gland","offset":221},{"uri":"Prostate","surface_form":"prostate","offset":283},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":351},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":357},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":369},{"uri":"Anno_Domini","surface_form":"B.C.","offset":388},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":431},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":708}]}
