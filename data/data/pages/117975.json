{"id":117975,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills%2C_90210","text":"\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" is an American primetime television drama series that aired from October 4, 1990, to May 17, 2000 on FOX in the United States and subsequently on various networks around the world. The show followed the lives of a group of teenagers living in the upscale, star-studded community of Beverly Hills, California and attending the fictitious West Beverly Hills High School and then-fictitious California University. The show was created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling and Spelling Television. The \"90210\" in the title refers to one of the suburb's postal ZIP codes.\nThe original premise of the show was based around the adjustment and culture shock that twins Brandon (played by Jason Priestley) and Brenda Walsh (played by Shannen Doherty) had after they and their parents, Jim and Cindy moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Beverly Hills. The show addressed several topical issues, including: date rape, alcoholism, domestic violence, gay rights, drug abuse, teenage suicide, AIDS, and teenage pregnancy.\nThe show gained popularity during the summer of 1991, when FOX aired a special \"summer season\" of the show while most other series were in reruns. The series became one of FOX's top shows when it began its next season that fall. Viewership increased dramatically and the cast members, particularly Jason Priestley and Luke Perry, became teen idols, while the series would make actresses Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth and Tori Spelling household names.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":29},{"uri":"Primetime","surface_form":"primetime","offset":38},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"FOX","offset":124},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":135},{"uri":"Beverly_Hills%2C_California","surface_form":"Beverly Hills, California","offset":305},{"uri":"California_University","surface_form":"California University","offset":411},{"uri":"Darren_Star","surface_form":"Darren Star","offset":458},{"uri":"Aaron_Spelling","surface_form":"Aaron Spelling","offset":486},{"uri":"Spelling_Television","surface_form":"Spelling Television","offset":505},{"uri":"ZIP_code","surface_form":"ZIP code","offset":588},{"uri":"Jason_Priestley","surface_form":"Jason Priestley","offset":712},{"uri":"Shannen_Doherty","surface_form":"Shannen Doherty","offset":757},{"uri":"Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","offset":833},{"uri":"Date_rape","surface_form":"date rape","offset":928},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":939},{"uri":"Domestic_violence","surface_form":"domestic violence","offset":951},{"uri":"Gay_rights","surface_form":"gay rights","offset":970},{"uri":"Drug_abuse","surface_form":"drug abuse","offset":982},{"uri":"Teenage_suicide","surface_form":"teenage suicide","offset":994},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":1011},{"uri":"Teenage_pregnancy","surface_form":"teenage pregnancy","offset":1021},{"uri":"Reruns","surface_form":"reruns","offset":1179},{"uri":"Jason_Priestley","surface_form":"Jason Priestley","offset":1338},{"uri":"Luke_Perry","surface_form":"Luke Perry","offset":1358},{"uri":"Teen_idol","surface_form":"teen idol","offset":1377},{"uri":"Shannen_Doherty","surface_form":"Shannen Doherty","offset":1427},{"uri":"Jennie_Garth","surface_form":"Jennie Garth","offset":1444},{"uri":"Tori_Spelling","surface_form":"Tori Spelling","offset":1461}]}
