{"id":117978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Americans","text":"Mexican Americans are Americans of Mexican ancestry. They account for 9% of the country's population: about 28.3 million Americans listed their ancestry as Mexican as of 2006. They form the largest Hispanic or Latino group in the United States and contain the largest group of White Hispanics. Mexican Americans trace their ancestry to the modern day country of Mexico or the Southwestern United States.\nMost Mexican Americans live in the four states that border Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. The areas in and around Los Angeles is home to over six million Mexican Americans. Many of these live in mainly Hispanic neighborhoods such as East Los Angeles. Cities and suburbs with a large Mexican population in California are Montebello, Azusa, South Gate, La Puente, Baldwin Park, El Monte and Pico Rivera. There are also a number of large Mexican American communities in other areas of the Western and Southwestern United States. Though Chicago is not in the Western or Southwestern United States, it has 1.4 million Mexican Americans, more Mexican Americans than any city except Los Angeles. The metro areas of Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix each have more than one million Mexicans. There are a growing number of Mexican Americans in the Midwest and South.\nMost Mexican Americans are \"mestizos\", or of more than one ethnicity. Most of their heritage is the indigenous \"indios\" of Mexico, but it often contains other groups, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Irish and Native American tribes from the U.S. such as Apache. Mexican Americans also have 4.2% African ancestry. Some Mexican Americans are gypsies, Jews, Europeans, Arabs, Asians and black Mexicans who immigrated from Mexico to the United States.\nThey are the fourth largest ethnic group in the United States after German Americans, African Americans and Irish Americans.\nMexican American celebrities include Eva Longoria, Jessica Alba, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Oscar De La Hoya, Baby Bash, Mario Lopez, George Lopez, Selena Quintanilla, Becky G and Fergie.\nCholo is a Mexican American gang subculture. Cholo style includes clothing, makeup, speech patterns, hand signals, tattoos, and graffiti. Cholo slang is called Cal\u00F3, a term derived from the slang of Roma gypsies from Spain, whose dialect is called Cal\u00F3.\n27% of Mexican Americans live in poverty, which is higher than the national average.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"Americans","offset":22},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":35},{"uri":"Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans","surface_form":"Hispanic or Latino","offset":198},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":230},{"uri":"White_Hispanic","surface_form":"White Hispanic","offset":277},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":362},{"uri":"Southwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Southwestern United States","offset":376},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":471},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":483},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":490},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":502},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":538},{"uri":"East_Los_Angeles","surface_form":"East Los Angeles","offset":657},{"uri":"Montebello%2C_California","surface_form":"Montebello","offset":744},{"uri":"Azusa%2C_California","surface_form":"Azusa","offset":756},{"uri":"South_Gate%2C_California","surface_form":"South Gate","offset":763},{"uri":"La_Puente","surface_form":"La Puente","offset":775},{"uri":"Baldwin_Park","surface_form":"Baldwin Park","offset":786},{"uri":"El_Monte","surface_form":"El Monte","offset":800},{"uri":"Pico_Rivera","surface_form":"Pico Rivera","offset":813},{"uri":"Western_United_States","surface_form":"Western","offset":910},{"uri":"Southwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Southwestern United States","offset":922},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":957},{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":1132},{"uri":"Houston","surface_form":"Houston","offset":1140},{"uri":"Phoenix%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Phoenix","offset":1153},{"uri":"Indigenous","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":1377},{"uri":"Spanish_people","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1452},{"uri":"Portuguese","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":1461},{"uri":"Italian","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1473},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":1482},{"uri":"Apache","surface_form":"Apache","offset":1537},{"uri":"African","surface_form":"African","offset":1578},{"uri":"Romani_people","surface_form":"gypsies","offset":1623},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":1632},{"uri":"Europeans","surface_form":"Europeans","offset":1638},{"uri":"Arabs","surface_form":"Arabs","offset":1649},{"uri":"Asians","surface_form":"Asians","offset":1656},{"uri":"German_Americans","surface_form":"German Americans","offset":1799},{"uri":"African_Americans","surface_form":"African Americans","offset":1817},{"uri":"Irish_Americans","surface_form":"Irish Americans","offset":1839},{"uri":"Eva_Longoria","surface_form":"Eva Longoria","offset":1893},{"uri":"Jessica_Alba","surface_form":"Jessica Alba","offset":1907},{"uri":"Demi_Lovato","surface_form":"Demi Lovato","offset":1921},{"uri":"Selena_Gomez","surface_form":"Selena Gomez","offset":1934},{"uri":"Oscar_De_La_Hoya","surface_form":"Oscar De La Hoya","offset":1948},{"uri":"Baby_Bash","surface_form":"Baby Bash","offset":1966},{"uri":"Mario_Lopez","surface_form":"Mario Lopez","offset":1977},{"uri":"George_Lopez","surface_form":"George Lopez","offset":1990},{"uri":"Selena_Quintanilla","surface_form":"Selena Quintanilla","offset":2004},{"uri":"Becky_G","surface_form":"Becky G","offset":2024},{"uri":"Fergie","surface_form":"Fergie","offset":2036},{"uri":"Romani_people","surface_form":"Roma gypsies","offset":2243},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":2331}]}
