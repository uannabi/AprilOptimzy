{"id":117991,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_South","text":"\"Brooklyn South\" is a short-lived American television police drama. It aired from 1997-1998 on CBS for only one season. It was cancelled due to poor ratings.\nOne of the producers of the series was Steven Bochco, creator of many well-known police dramas such as \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"NYPD Blue\". \"Brooklyn South\" was also created and produced by David Milch. The series tried to create a setting of a gritty, realistic police station similar to that of \"NYPD Blue\", but differed by focusing on the uniformed police officers rather than the detectives. The pilot of \"Brooklyn South\" was noted as the first TV-MA rated episode on broadcast television.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":34},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television","offset":43},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":54},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":61},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":95},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":169},{"uri":"Steven_Bochco","surface_form":"Steven Bochco","offset":197},{"uri":"Hill_Street_Blues","surface_form":"Hill Street Blues","offset":262},{"uri":"NYPD_Blue","surface_form":"NYPD Blue","offset":286},{"uri":"David_Milch","surface_form":"David Milch","offset":348},{"uri":"Setting","surface_form":"setting","offset":390},{"uri":"Grit","surface_form":"grit","offset":403},{"uri":"Reality","surface_form":"realistic","offset":411},{"uri":"Uniform","surface_form":"uniform","offset":500},{"uri":"Police_officer","surface_form":"police officer","offset":510},{"uri":"Detectives","surface_form":"detectives","offset":542},{"uri":"TV-MA","surface_form":"TV-MA","offset":607},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":619},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":630}]}
