{"id":118037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp","text":"A training camp is a place where soldiers or sports players go to learn skills. Often, they go there to learn physical action, rather than book subjects they would learn at a school. In major sports like the National Football League, training camp refers to the time before the season starts.\nIn the military, Recruit training (also called \"basic training\" or \"boot camp\") helps new military personnel get the mental and physical fitnesss they need for their military career. Each military branch in a country usually has its own training program. There are also civilian boot camps for those who want to experience military training without joining the military.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":33},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sports players","offset":45},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":72},{"uri":"Physical_action","surface_form":"physical action","offset":110},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":139},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":175},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":208},{"uri":"Season_(sports)","surface_form":"season","offset":278},{"uri":"Recruit_training","surface_form":"Recruit training","offset":310},{"uri":"Boot_camp","surface_form":"boot camp","offset":361},{"uri":"Physical_fitness","surface_form":"physical fitness","offset":421},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":468},{"uri":"Military_branch","surface_form":"military branch","offset":481},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":502},{"uri":"Program","surface_form":"program","offset":539},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":563}]}
