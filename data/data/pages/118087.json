{"id":118087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_stripes","text":"Pin stripes are a pattern of very thin stripes running in parallel found in cloth.\nAlthough pin stripes are found in mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pin striped. In baseball, the Chicago Cubs baseball uniforms have had pin stripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to have pin striping onto a baseball uniform. Many other Major League Baseball teams like the Montreal Expos and New York Yankees later put pin stripes on their own uniforms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thin","surface_form":"thin","offset":34},{"uri":"Stripe","surface_form":"stripes","offset":39},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":76},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":182},{"uri":"Chicago_Cubs","surface_form":"Chicago Cubs","offset":196},{"uri":"Baseball_uniform","surface_form":"baseball uniform","offset":209},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":296},{"uri":"Montreal_Expos","surface_form":"Montreal Expos","offset":417},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":436}]}
