To the west Dajab\u00F3n borders the Republic of Haiti.\nHistory.\nFor a very long time, very few people lived in this region because it was on the border between two countries: first, between the French colony of \"Saint-Domingue\" and the Spanish colony of \"Santo Domingo\" and later between the two independent countries of Haiti and Dominican Republic. There were many fights here between the armies of the two parts of the island and some important battles were held close to the city of Dajab\u00F3n during the Dominican Independence War.\nIn 1861, the Dominican Republic became again a colony of Spain. The Restoration War, or just the \"Restoration\", started on 16 August 1863, in a hill near the hamlet of \"Capotillo\". The Spanish army left the country in 1865.\nAfter the \"Restoration\", people came to live in this area and several towns were created.\nWhen the province was created in 1938, it had three municipalities: Dajab\u00F3n, Loma de Cabrera and Restauraci\u00F3n. In 1996, Partido was made a municipality and later, in 2002, El Pino became another municipality.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Dajab\u00F3n province, and 38,225 () living in towns and cities.

The northern part is flat, with many savannas; it is part of the \"Yaque del Norte Valley\" (or \"L\u00EDnea Noroeste\").\nThere are two main roads in the province. One, from north to south, comes from the Monte Cristi province and goes through the cities of Dajab\u00F3n, Loma de Cabrera and Restauraci\u00F3n and then goes into the El\u00EDas Pi\u00F1a province. In some parts, the road marks the border with Haiti.\nThe second main road begins in Santiago de la Cruz and goes to the east through Partido and El Pino and then through the Santiago Rodr\u00EDguez and Valverde provinces to end in the \"Carretera Duarte\" (Duarte National Road), one of the most important road of the country and that goes from Santo Domingo to Monte Cristi.\nRivers.\nThe only important river in the province is the Dajab\u00F3n River, also known as \"Masacre\" (from French \"Massacre\").

Other rivers are very short and they are tributaries of the Dajabon or the Artibonite rivers.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains..\nEconomy.\nAs in all provinces on the Dominican Republic-Haiti border, there is little economic development.
