{"id":118486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro","text":", or \"My Neighbour Totoro\" on UK DVD box titles, is a 1988 animated movie written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. It won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 1988. This movie was originally released in the United States in VHS format with the title, \"My Friend Totoro\".\nTroma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, produced a 1993 dub of the movie co-produced by Jerry Beck. It was released on VHS and DVD by Fox Video. Troma's and Fox's rights to this version expired in 2004. The movie was re-released by Disney on March 7, 2006. It features a new dub cast. This DVD release is the first version of the movie in the United States to include both Japanese and English language tracks, as Fox did not have the rights to the Japanese audio track for their version.\nStory.\nSatsuki, Mei and their father live in the field, where Mei discovers a giant creature living in the forest near the house. When Mei leaves in her attempt to save her hospitalized mother, she and Satsuki take a ride on the cat-bus. The movie ends with the girls delivering an ear of corn to their mother.\nFamily.\nOne of the most significant things to point out in My Neighbor Totoro is that the mother is absent from the home. According to Takie Sugiyama Lebra, \u201Cthe [Japanese] mother is characterized as having suffered hardships\u201D (154). This is true in Totoro, as Mei and Satsuki\u2019s mother is hospitalized with an unnamed illness.\nThe mother\u2019s absence is significant because \u201Cat home, the husband depends upon the wife for domestic care. The husband is helpless in housekeeping tasks, such as doing the laundry, cooking, cleaning, and child rearing\u201D (52). In the absence of her mother, it is then Satsuki\u2019s job to take over household tasks with Nanny\u2019s help. This is illustrated several times throughout the movie.\nOne such illustration is when Satsuki prepares breakfast and lunch for her father and Mei before she leaves for school. This is a task that would normally fall to the mother. Also, the various cleaning and garden tasks that Satsuki and Mei often had the help of Nanny to complete would have also normally been the main responsibility of the mother to complete.\nMei and Satsuki\u2019s father demonstrates both typical and atypical characteristics of a traditional Japanese father. According to Peter Tasker, \u201CJapanese children are accustomed to never seeing their father on the weekdays, and only for short periods at weekends. A husband\u2019s proper field of endeavor is the company\u201D (101). This is only somewhat accurate in Mei and Satsuki\u2019s relationship with their father. Although their father is often away working at the university or visiting their mother in the hospital, he is by no means an absentee father. He is seen working at a desk while Mei plays outside and spending time with his daughters before their bedtime. Many scholarly critiques of Japanese culture would lead one to believe that this is not the norm.\nSetting.\n\"My Neighbor Totoro\" exhibits several important cultural points through the setting and passive details.\nThe house into which the Kusakabe family moves is an accurate portrayal of a typical, rural, Japanese home. The sliding doors that the father opens when they first move into the house are common architectural features. These doors are meant to be opened during the day, weather permitting, and closed at night. Another feature to point out about the house itself is the way the foundation is constructed. \u201CJapanese houses do not have cellars but are built with a foundation of shallow concrete, or a single row of cement blocks. On top of this type of foundation is placed a row of heavy timbers\u201D (33). This can be seen clearly when Mei crawls under the house in pursuit of one of the smaller totoros.\nAs for Totoro, he lives in a tree demarcated by a shimenawa (braided straw rope for shinto). The tree is called shinboku (sacred tree). Shinto is the traditional religion of Japan and some consider many of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s movies\u2014including Totoro\u2014to have Shintoist themes. and interpret Totoro as a kami spirit of the Shinto religion. But Miyazaki says \"this movie [Totoro] has nothing to do with that [Shinto] or any other religion.\"\nThe community in which Satsuki and her family have moved is a typical agricultural town. The rice paddies are visible throughout the movie. Rice cultivation is one of the most important industries in Japan, as rice is a staple of the Japanese diet. The home that Satsuki and Mei live in is more spacious than what would be available in a city. Also, the scene where Nanny, Mei, and Satsuki are washing vegetables shows the near self-sufficiency of these farming communities.\nThe bath scene is also demonstrative of archetypal Japanese life. \u201CThe bathtub is more like a small swimming pool than a tub\u201D (38). As seen in the movie, several people bathe together at once. It is considered rude to enter the tub without first washing, as shown by Satsuki before she enters the tub with her father and Mei. These bathtubs are heated usually by small, well-tended coal burners under the tub.\nAnother cultural manifestation is the scene that shows the family sleeping. Often, the living room is converted into a bedroom where the whole family sleeps together on mats called futon. This sleeping arrangement is space-efficient and accommodates for smaller housing in a country where living space is severely limited. Mei is sleeping between Satsuki and her father, which is the usual arrangement\u2014with the youngest in the middle.\nIn one scene, Satsuki is shown preparing the family's lunch in traditional bento style. A bento is a compartmentalized lunch box usually with only one or two tiers. Food is arranged to be aesthetically pleasing. Bentos are extremely common as lunch boxes for children, adults, and even those who stay at home, as Mei does when Satsuki goes to school.\nRelease history.\n\"My Neighbor Totoro\" was released by Studio Ghibli as a double feature with Isao Takahata's \"Grave of the Fireflies\" in August 1988. There are two theories for this: one was that \"Totoro\" would not be successful. Another theory is that \"Grave of the Fireflies\" was believed to be too depressing for audiences by itself, and thus needed a lighter animation to accompany it. The late Yoshifumi Kondo provided character designs for both movies.\nIn 1993, Fox released the first English-language version of \"My Neighbor Totoro\", produced by John Daly and Derek Gibson (the producers of \"The Terminator\") with co-producer Jerry Beck. Fox and Troma's rights to the movie expired in 2004. Disney's English language version premiered on October 23, 2005; it then appeared at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The Turner Classic Movies cable television network held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on January 19, 2006, as part of the network's salute to Hayao Miyazaki. (TCM aired the dub as well as the original Japanese with English subtitles.) The Disney version was released on DVD on March 7, 2006.\nAs is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki movies, the Disney version of \"Totoro\" features a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retained the same translation as the previous dub, but were sung by Sonya Isaacs.\nReception.\nThe movie has an 8.1 rating on IMDb,and a 94% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes.com. Reviews were very positive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film |"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":30},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":33},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":59},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":68},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"written","offset":74},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":86},{"uri":"Hayao_Miyazaki","surface_form":"Hayao Miyazaki","offset":98},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"produced","offset":117},{"uri":"Studio_Ghibli","surface_form":"Studio Ghibli","offset":129},{"uri":"Animage","surface_form":"Animage","offset":155},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":237},{"uri":"Video_cassette","surface_form":"VHS format","offset":254},{"uri":"Troma_Entertainment","surface_form":"Troma Films","offset":301},{"uri":"Jerry_Beck","surface_form":"Jerry Beck","offset":397},{"uri":"Fox_Video","surface_form":"Fox Video","offset":443},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Pictures","surface_form":"Disney","offset":541},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"shinto","offset":3838},{"uri":"Bento","surface_form":"bento","offset":5584},{"uri":"Grave_of_the_Fireflies","surface_form":"Grave of the Fireflies","offset":5970},{"uri":"Yoshifumi_Kondo","surface_form":"Yoshifumi Kondo","offset":6259},{"uri":"John_Daly_(producer)","surface_form":"John Daly","offset":6413},{"uri":"The_Terminator","surface_form":"The Terminator","offset":6459},{"uri":"Jerry_Beck","surface_form":"Jerry Beck","offset":6493},{"uri":"Turner_Classic_Movies","surface_form":"Turner Classic Movies","offset":6681},{"uri":"Dakota_Fanning","surface_form":"Dakota","offset":7128},{"uri":"Elle_Fanning","surface_form":"Elle Fanning","offset":7139},{"uri":"Tim_Daly","surface_form":"Timothy Daly","offset":7172},{"uri":"Pat_Carroll_(actress)","surface_form":"Pat Carroll","offset":7202},{"uri":"Lea_Salonga","surface_form":"Lea Salonga","offset":7225},{"uri":"Frank_Welker","surface_form":"Frank Welker","offset":7259},{"uri":"Catbus","surface_form":"Catbus","offset":7286},{"uri":"Sonya_Isaacs","surface_form":"Sonya Isaacs","offset":7388},{"uri":"IMDb","surface_form":"IMDb","offset":7444},{"uri":"Rotten_Tomatoes","surface_form":"Rotten Tomatoes","offset":7478}]}
