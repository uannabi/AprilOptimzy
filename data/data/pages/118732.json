{"id":118732,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V","text":"Saturn V was the kind of launch vehicle used by NASA in a space program named after a god that ancient people liked (the Apollo program). The Saturn V carried Apollo 11 and the people in it to the Moon in 1969. Much of the rocket was planned by German engineer and scientist Wernher von Braun. 32 Saturn rockets were sent up to space, and the Saturn V was the largest. 15 Saturn V rockets were made and 13 were sent up to space. There were two Saturn V launches with no people in them, and the first manned Apollo flight using a Saturn V was Apollo 8 sent around the Moon on December 21, 1968.The Saturn V rocket was a three part machine. It stood high and weighed. The first rockets were able to carry. This was went up to for the later Apollo flights. The first and second stages gave the power to lift the rocket off the Earth. The first and second stages each had five engines. The first stage burned kerosene and liquid oxygen together. The other stages burned liquid oxygen with liquid hydrogen.\nThe first stage engines burned for 168 seconds which was able to lift Apollo to a height of and about away from the launch pad. The second stage burned for about 8 minutes to take Apollo through the upper atmosphere. At this time it was going.\nThe third stage was used for 2 minutes and 30 seconds to put Apollo into an Earth orbit. This was at a height of above the Earth. The third stage was started again and burned for 6 minutes to make the speed go up to needed to send Apollo off to the Moon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["rocket/payload","rocket/Stage","rocket/Stage","rocket/Stage"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Launch_vehicle","surface_form":"launch vehicle","offset":25},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":48},{"uri":"Apollo_program","surface_form":"Apollo program","offset":121},{"uri":"Apollo_11","surface_form":"Apollo 11","offset":159},{"uri":"The_Moon","surface_form":"the Moon","offset":193},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":245},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":252},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":265},{"uri":"Wernher_von_Braun","surface_form":"Wernher von Braun","offset":275},{"uri":"Apollo_8","surface_form":"Apollo 8","offset":542},{"uri":"Kerosene","surface_form":"kerosene","offset":905},{"uri":"Liquid_oxygen","surface_form":"liquid oxygen","offset":918},{"uri":"Liquid_hydrogen","surface_form":"liquid hydrogen","offset":985},{"uri":"Launch_pad","surface_form":"launch pad","offset":1118},{"uri":"Thermosphere","surface_form":"upper atmosphere","offset":1201},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":1328}]}
