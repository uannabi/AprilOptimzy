{"id":119110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retie","text":"Retie is a municipality in the Belgian province of Antwerp.\nIn 2007, 10485 people lived there.\nIt is at 51\u00B0 16 North, 05\u00B0 05 East.\nThe town is near the Dutch border and is in fact closer to the city of Eindhoven than Antwerp.\nThe official language of the area is Dutch, but many people especially in the hospitality industry speak English and French.\nServices are basic in Retie, some banks have branches including ING and AXA. Supermarket shopping is available. Bakeries in Retie are very good. Like most of Belgium the shops are generally closed on Sunday.\nThe Gemeente (local council) official website (in Dutch) is http://www.retie.be/\nThings to do in and around Retie\nThere is a pretty town hall in the centre of the town, but unlike many Belgian towns it is not organised around a town square (well it is now just a large intersection) and therefore does not have the quaint village feel as many other small towns in this part of Belgium (for example Lommel, Mol).\nThe main attraction of the town is Prinsenpark - a public forest that is popular with families and walking/jogging groups. Dogs on leads are allowed. There are picnic tables and toilets.\nhttp://www.provant.be/vrije_tijd/domeinen/prinsenpark/","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":11},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":31},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":39},{"uri":"Antwerp_(province)","surface_form":"Antwerp","offset":51}]}
