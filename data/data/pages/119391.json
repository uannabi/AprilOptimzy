{"id":119391,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiwani_Tehsil","text":"e=\"preserve\">Jiwani port is along the Arabian Sea in Gwadar District, Balochistan, Pakistan. It is near the Iranian border. 25,000 people live there. It is expected to become a major commercial center in concert with the development of the port of Gwadar nearly to the east.\nJiwani is at the eastern end of Gwadar Bay, which is shared between Iran and Pakistan. The area around the bay includes a mangrove forest extending across the international border, and is an important habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, especially the endangered Olive Ridley and Green turtles. Plans to grant fishing concessions and offshore drilling rights are potentially a threat to the wildlife of the area.\nJiwani holds strategic importance in the region, because it is next to the shipping lanes to and from the Persian Gulf. This is the main reason that the town hosts a small naval base and an airport with a 5,500-foot runway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabian_Sea","surface_form":"Arabian Sea","offset":38},{"uri":"Gwadar_District","surface_form":"Gwadar District","offset":53},{"uri":"Balochistan_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Balochistan","offset":70},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":83},{"uri":"Gwadar_Bay","surface_form":"Gwadar Bay","offset":307},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":397},{"uri":"Olive_Ridley","surface_form":"Olive Ridley","offset":542},{"uri":"Green_turtle","surface_form":"Green turtle","offset":559},{"uri":"Persian_Gulf","surface_form":"Persian Gulf","offset":798}]}
