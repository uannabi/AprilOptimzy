They are made up of two Reformed (Calvinist), 9 Lutheran and 9 United (Lutheran-Reformed) churches.\nThe Moravian Church and the Federation of Evangelical Reformed Congregations are associate members.\nThe Evangelical Church in Germany is not a church like the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. This is because it is not one big church which share the same system of beliefs, instead it is a collection of churches which allow its members to share in church services and worship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":133},{"uri":"Reformed_churches","surface_form":"Reformed","offset":167},{"uri":"Calvinist","surface_form":"Calvinist","offset":177},{"uri":"Lutheran","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":191},{"uri":"Moravian_Church","surface_form":"Moravian Church","offset":247},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Church of England","offset":402},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":427}]}
