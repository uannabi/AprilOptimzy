{"id":119642,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Smith","text":"Walter Smith, OBE (born 24 February 1948 in Lanark) is a Scottish former football player, but is better known as a football manager. He is currently the manager of Scottish Premier League club Rangers, his second spell in that capacity with the club.\nEarly life and career.\nWalter Smith was born in Lanark, South Lanarkshire, and grew up in Carmyle in the east end of Glasgow as a boyhood fan of Rangers. He trained as an electrician and gained employment at the South of Scotland Electricity Board before launching his football career in the 1960s with Junior League team Ashfield.\nSmith signed as a defender with Dundee United in 1966, joining as a part-timer while working as an electrician. He was a decent player rather than a gifted one. In September 1975 he moved to Dumbarton, but returned to United in 1977. At the age of 29, a pelvic injury threatened his career and he was invited to join the Dundee United coaching staff by Jim McLean. His first team appearances were limited thereafter, but he remained a signed player and his final club match was in September 1980. In total, he made over 250 senior appearances, scoring three goals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"OBE","offset":14},{"uri":"24_February","surface_form":"24 February","offset":24},{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":36},{"uri":"Lanark","surface_form":"Lanark","offset":44},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":57},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":73},{"uri":"Coach_(sports)","surface_form":"manager","offset":124},{"uri":"Scottish_Premier_League","surface_form":"Scottish Premier League","offset":164},{"uri":"Rangers_F.C.","surface_form":"Rangers","offset":193},{"uri":"Lanark","surface_form":"Lanark","offset":299},{"uri":"South_Lanarkshire","surface_form":"South Lanarkshire","offset":307},{"uri":"Carmyle","surface_form":"Carmyle","offset":341},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":368},{"uri":"Rangers_F.C.","surface_form":"Rangers","offset":396},{"uri":"Scottish_Junior_Football_Association","surface_form":"Junior League","offset":554},{"uri":"Ashfield_F.C.","surface_form":"Ashfield","offset":573},{"uri":"Dundee_United_F.C.","surface_form":"Dundee United","offset":615},{"uri":"Electrician","surface_form":"electrician","offset":682},{"uri":"Dumbarton_F.C.","surface_form":"Dumbarton","offset":774},{"uri":"Jim_McLean","surface_form":"Jim McLean","offset":936}]}
