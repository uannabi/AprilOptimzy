In 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon, the eastern part (Eupen, Malmedy, Saint-Vith and four other German municipalities) was given to the Prussian empire.\nWhile maintaining the French administrative borders, King William I of the Netherlands gave back the more traditional names of the provinces instead of the names used by the French. He named the province as Li\u00E8ge, remembering the old principality of Li\u00E8ge, although the region did not correspond much to the old principality.\nIn 1919, after the Prussian defeat, the cantons Eupen, Malmedy and Saint-Vith were again part of the province of Li\u00E8ge.\nGeography.\nThe province of Li\u00E8ge is in southeastern Belgium and borders on (clockwise from the North) the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and in Belgium the provinces of Luxembourg, Namur, Walloon Brabant (Wallonia), and those of Flemish Brabant and Limburg (Flanders).\nThe province has an area of, with a population of and a density of inhabitants per km\u00B2.
