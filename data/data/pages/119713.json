This is the most used substance in the game\nKryptonite is used for almost all types of ships and buildings. It's also used for research.\nSpice is a mostly a rare raw material. As a result, it is that much more valuable. Spice provides a good performance in ship drives, in research and also in alloys. Spice even plays a vital role in food production. It is essential for an up-and-coming empire.\nIn this game you can trade the various resources with the rule of thumb being 6:3:4:1 in the order Pig Iron, Metal, Kryptonite, Spice.\ne.g. 6k Pig Iron would be traded for 3k Metal, or 4k Kyrptonite, or 1k Spice.\nMining.\nMining is the first task you start in the game. In order to mine the four resources you must upgrade each mine. Every upgrade increases the amount of resources the mine produces every hour. But every upgrade uses more energy. So accordingly you must also upgrade the Fusion Plant, which produces energy for the mines.\nEvery upgrade uses another field. On your first planet there is 230 fields.\nBuilding.\nThis is the second possibility after mining. You can build and upgrade the Development Center which decreases your building times for factories and such. The research lab unlocks different types of research, and decreases research times. The weapons factory is needed for all ships and defenses. With every level the weapons factory decreases production time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
