Many articles are written in a satirical way to upset those who take the content seriously.\nContent.\nThis wiki has been described as \"an online compendium of troll humor and lore\". Its articles relate to news, current events, gossip and other \"drama\" topics from across the Internet, controversial article content, forums, fansites, Internet subculture, users of web services, and online catchphrases are satirized in a manner described variously as coarse, offensive and frequently obscene. Articles at Encyclop\u00E6dia Dramatica are notably critical of MySpace and administrators of Wikipedia.\nClosed.\nIt was closed on April 16, 2011, and relaunched as \"Oh Internet\".
