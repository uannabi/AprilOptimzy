Its value is equal to. The constant was named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro.\nThe measurement of Avogadro's constant was refined in 2011 to \u00B1.\nAn old term closely related to the Avogadro constant is Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is the number of atoms in 12 grams of the carbon isotope carbon-12. Avogadro's number is a dimensionless quantity and has the numerical value of the Avogadro constant given in base units.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":23},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":75},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":84},{"uri":"Mole_(unit)","surface_form":"mole","offset":102},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":185},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":193},{"uri":"Amedeo_Avogadro","surface_form":"Amedeo Avogadro","offset":203},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":385},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":395},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":407},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":420},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":427},{"uri":"Carbon-12","surface_form":"carbon-12","offset":435}]}
