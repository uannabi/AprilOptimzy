{"id":119934,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi%27s_Children","text":"\"Bambi's Children, The Story of a Forest Family\" () is a book written by Felix Salten, first printed and translated from German to English in 1939. It is a sequel to Salten's book \"Bambi, A Life in the Woods\". It was first published in German only in the following year.\nThe main characters are Bambi's twin fawns, Geno, male, and Gurri, female; it also stars their friends, another pair of fawns named Lana and Boso. Lana and Boso are the children of Aunt Rolla, a doe met later in the course of the novel. Two more new characters are introduced\u2014Nello and Membo, the orphans. The overall storyline is how Geno and Gurri learn the pleasures as well as downsides of nature and their forest home. \"Bambi, A Life in the Woods\", the original story of Bambi, is much darker than the sequel. Unlike its predecessor, \"Bambi's Children\" ends when Geno begins to grow his antlers, whereas \"Bambi, A Life in the Woods\" continues until Bambi's children are born. In the end, Faline, knowing the time is right, sends off her children to live their own lives.\nWhat may be interesting to readers is that it is not possible to determine whether \"Bambi's Children\" is a sequel to the book \"Bambi\" or a midquel as there are no references to the former which makes one able to place the latter. The language of \"Bambi's Children\" is more gentle than that of \"Bambi, A Life in the Woods\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["book"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Felix_Salten","surface_form":"Felix Salten","offset":73},{"uri":"Bambi%2C_A_Life_in_the_Woods","surface_form":"Bambi, A Life in the Woods","offset":181},{"uri":"Bambi_(character)","surface_form":"Bambi","offset":295},{"uri":"Faline","surface_form":"Faline","offset":964},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":1154},{"uri":"Midquel","surface_form":"midquel","offset":1186}]}
