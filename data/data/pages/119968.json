{"id":119968,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill_(music)","text":"=\"preserve\">A fill in popular music is a short instrumental passage, between melody lines of a song. (A longer passage between verses is called a solo.)\nFills are usually played with a keyboard instrument or a guitar, but other instruments (such as a saxophone) may also be used. Drum fills are sometimes called \"drum rolls\", but a roll is actually a steady beat on a single drum, while a fill may use more than one drum or beat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Popular_music","surface_form":"popular music","offset":22},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrumental","offset":47},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":77},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":95},{"uri":"Solo_(music)","surface_form":"solo","offset":146},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboard instrument","offset":185},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":210},{"uri":"Saxophone","surface_form":"saxophone","offset":251},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"Drum","offset":280},{"uri":"Drum_roll","surface_form":"drum roll","offset":313}]}
