{"id":12,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain","text":"e=\"preserve\">Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. \"Autonomous\" means that each of these autonomous communities has its own executive, legislative judicial powers. These are similar to, but \"not\" the same as, states in the United States of America, for example.\nSpain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities.\nBefore then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called \"historic communities\": Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.\nSpain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: Ceuta and Melilla. They are called \"autonomous cities\" and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":13},{"uri":"Executive_(government)","surface_form":"executive","offset":146},{"uri":"Legislative","surface_form":"legislative","offset":157},{"uri":"Judicial","surface_form":"judicial","offset":169},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":245},{"uri":"Provinces","surface_form":"provinces","offset":321},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonia","offset":547},{"uri":"Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)","surface_form":"Basque Country","offset":558},{"uri":"Galicia","surface_form":"Galicia","offset":574},{"uri":"Andalusia","surface_form":"Andalusia","offset":586},{"uri":"Ceuta","surface_form":"Ceuta","offset":653},{"uri":"Melilla","surface_form":"Melilla","offset":663}]}
