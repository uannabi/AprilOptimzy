App Runner was also subject of an article by Lifehacker, saying \"App Runner would come in handy\" and \"there's plenty of scripts and closed-source apps that this would be useful for\".\nLive USB.\nThere is also a Windows tool called \"cd2usb\" to create Ubuntu and \"Super OS\" Live USBs. The program is already included in the DVD of \"Super OS\".\nRUNZ Framework.\nThe \"RUNZ Framework\" is a tool that allows the use of portable apps and something called \"SuperDebs\" (an installer with a.deb file + its dependencies that can be installed offline) in \"Super OS\".
