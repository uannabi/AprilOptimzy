{"id":120206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop","text":"Indie pop is a genre of alternative rock which originated in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Originally and often still a form of independent music, it is closely associated with indie rock, both genres are similar, yet there are differences between both. Indie rock tends to be edgier, rougher and harsher-sounding, contrasting the more melodious indie pop. Indie pop additionally takes influences from 1960s girl group music and power pop, often giving it retro elements, and makes usage of jangly guitars.\nIn 1986, British music magazine \"NME\" released a cassette called \"C86\", which included indie pop and indie rock music; the artists in \"C86\" made music which was described by About.com as \"a twee, amateurish form of home-made music drawing deeply from sunny '60s acts like The Byrds and the Velvet Underground.\"\nEarly indie pop bands include The Shop Assistants or The Pastels. More recent bands in the genre include Point blank, Travis, The Research and Maritime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":24},{"uri":"Indie_(music)","surface_form":"independent music","offset":131},{"uri":"Indie_rock","surface_form":"indie rock","offset":180},{"uri":"Power_pop","surface_form":"power pop","offset":432},{"uri":"The_Shop_Assistants","surface_form":"The Shop Assistants","offset":851},{"uri":"The_Pastels","surface_form":"The Pastels","offset":874},{"uri":"Point_blank","surface_form":"Point blank","offset":926},{"uri":"Travis","surface_form":"Travis","offset":939},{"uri":"The_Research","surface_form":"The Research","offset":947},{"uri":"Maritime","surface_form":"Maritime","offset":964}]}
