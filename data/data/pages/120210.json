Joseph Sheehan compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the bumpy parts you can hear (overt parts) of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger block of how the person feels (covert parts) invisible below the surface. These people may feel embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt. These feelings may increase stress and effort making the person stammer more. Such negative feelings may be an important part of a treatment program.\nStammers affect peoples lives as they may not have the confidence to apply for job interviews or make friends.\nFluency shaping therapy.\nThis therapy is also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\" or \"connected speech.\" It trains stutterers to speak fluently (without the \u2018bumpy bits\u2019) by controlling their breathing and how they move their lips, jaw, and tongue.\nStutterers are trained to slow down their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants. Other methods include soft speech contacts. This helps to make very slow but non bumpy speech used only in the speech clinic. To make more normal sounding speech for daily life speed of speech is increased. Many people find their speech does not sound natural at the end of therapy. Fluency shaping approaches are normally taught in groups therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete. More recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to work well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["medical condition (new)"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":55},{"uri":"Hands_All_Over","surface_form":"Hands All Over","offset":77}]}
