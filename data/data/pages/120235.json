{"id":120235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick","text":"A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles is the analog stick.\nThe joystick has been the principal flight control in the cockpit of many aircraft, particularly military fast jets, where center stick or side-stick location may be employed.\nJoysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as mobile phones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Input_device","surface_form":"input device","offset":17},{"uri":"Video_game_consoles","surface_form":"video game consoles","offset":330},{"uri":"Cockpit","surface_form":"cockpit","offset":429},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":798}]}
