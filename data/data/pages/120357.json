{"id":120357,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_town","text":"A ghost town is a name for a city or town in which no one lives anymore. It can happen because of economical reasons (for instance, a town of gold miners who cannot find gold anymore), a natural disaster (a flood, a very long drought) or even a man- made disaster (for example, the nuclear fallout that emptied the town of Prypiat, Ukraine).\nSome ghost towns are kept intact as tourist attractions. For example Craco, in the Italian region of Basilicata, is a destination for tourists and pilgrims, as well as a famous film set for movies like \"The Passion of the Christ\" by Mel Gibson and \"Quantum of Solace\" by Marc Forster.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":29},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":37},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economical","offset":98},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":142},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"miners","offset":147},{"uri":"Disaster","surface_form":"disaster","offset":195},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":207},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":226},{"uri":"Nuclear_fallout","surface_form":"nuclear fallout","offset":282},{"uri":"Prypiat%2C_Ukraine","surface_form":"Prypiat, Ukraine","offset":323},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist attractions","offset":378},{"uri":"Craco","surface_form":"Craco","offset":411},{"uri":"Basilicata","surface_form":"Basilicata","offset":443},{"uri":"The_Passion_of_the_Christ","surface_form":"The Passion of the Christ","offset":545},{"uri":"Mel_Gibson","surface_form":"Mel Gibson","offset":575},{"uri":"Quantum_of_Solace","surface_form":"Quantum of Solace","offset":591},{"uri":"Marc_Forster","surface_form":"Marc Forster","offset":613}]}
