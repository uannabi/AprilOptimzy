{"id":120453,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impala","text":"The impala (\"Aepyceros melampus\") is a medium-sized African antelope. The name \"impala\" comes from the Zulu language.\nDescription.\nThe impala is reddish-brown with white hair inside the ears, over each eye and on the chin, upper throat, underparts and buttocks. A narrow black line runs along the middle of the lower back to the tail, and a vertical black stripe appears on the back of each thigh. Impalas have unique brushlike tufts of black hair that cover a scent gland located just above the heel on each hind leg.\nThe impala can jump more than 10 meters distance and 3 meters high, and can reach running speeds of about 80 to 90\u00A0km/h, to escape from predators.\nHabitat.\nImpalas are found at grassland and woodland edges, usually very close by water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":52},{"uri":"Antelope","surface_form":"antelope","offset":60},{"uri":"Zulu_language","surface_form":"Zulu language","offset":103},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":164},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":350},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":748}]}
