{"id":120498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design","text":"e=\"preserve\">Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a way for the designer of a computer program to specify what a computer program will do, using the way that people think and not using the way that computers think. People think in terms of classes and objects. For example, fruit is a class, and there are different kinds of fruits such as bananas and pineapples. If a computer program designer were specifying to a computer programmer how to create a computer program to manage the fruits in a supermarket, then he or she would specify the program in terms of classes and objects which is how people think.\nA computer program called a compiler and/or an interpreter would take the program that the programmer typed in and convert it into a form that a computer can run. Computers really only understand things that are encoded as numbers. Object-Oriented-Design (OOD) uses the power and speed of a computer to allow humans to be more productive in making computer programs, by letting human computer programmers think in terms of how humans think.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_program_designer","surface_form":"computer program designer","offset":364},{"uri":"Computer_programmer","surface_form":"computer programmer","offset":411},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":447},{"uri":"Classes_(computer_science)","surface_form":"classes","offset":556},{"uri":"Objects_(computer_science)","surface_form":"objects","offset":568},{"uri":"Compiler","surface_form":"compiler","offset":631},{"uri":"Interpreter","surface_form":"interpreter","offset":650}]}
