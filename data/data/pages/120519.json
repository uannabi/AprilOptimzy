{"id":120519,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radovan_Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87","text":"Radovan Karad\u017Ei\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043E\u0432\u0430\u043D \u041A\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045F\u0438\u045B; born 19 June 1945 in Petnjica, Montenegro, Yugoslavia) used to be a Bosnia and Herzegovinian politician. He was in charge of part of the Bosnian Genocide. From 1995 to 2008, he was a fugitive. He was arrested on 21 July 2008 in Serbia. In 2016, he was convicted of war crimes.\nEarly life.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 was the child of Vuko and Jovanka Karad\u017Ei\u0107. His father, Vuko (1912\u20131987), was a shoemaker. His mother, Jovanka (1922\u20132005), was a peasant girl from northern Montenegro. Her maiden name was Jovanka Jaki\u0107. She married Karad\u017Ei\u0107's father in 1943, at age twenty.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107's father was in prison for most of his son's childhood. During World War II, Yugoslavia had been taken over by Nazi Germany and the other Axis countries. Karad\u017Ei\u0107's father had been a member of the Chetniks. This was an army that supported Yugoslavia's original government. Because he was in this army, he was put in prison after the war.\nEducation.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 moved to Sarajevo in 1960 to study psychiatry at the Sarajevo University School of Medicine. In 1970, he studied anxiety and depression at N\u00E6stved Hospital in Denmark. From 1974 to 1975, he got more medical training at Columbia University in New York City.\nAfter he returned to Yugoslavia, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 worked in the Ko\u0161evo Hospital (the main hospital in Sarajevo). He was also a poet. Another Serbian writer encouraged him to go into politics.\nPrison for fraud.\nWhile he was working in the Ko\u0161evo Hospital, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 made extra money in illegal ways. For example, healthcare workers who wanted to retire early would pay him to say they were disabled. Karad\u017Ei\u0107 would also lie for prisoners who wanted to avoid punishment by saying they were insane when they committed their crimes.\nIn 1983, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 started working at a hospital in a suburb of Belgrade called Vo\u017Edovac. With his partner, Mom\u010Dilo Kraji\u0161nik, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 got a loan that was meant to be used for improving agriculture. Instead, he and his partner used the money to build themselves houses in Pale. Pale was a Serb town above Sarajevo that the government had turned into a ski resort.\nOn 1 November 1984, the two were arrested for fraud. They spent 11 months in jail before their friend Nikola Koljevi\u0107 paid their bail so they could get out. On 26 September 1985, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and fraud. However, since he had already spent over a year in prison, the court did not make Karad\u017Ei\u0107 spend the rest of his sentence in prison.\nPolitical life.\nIn 1989, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 helped create the Serb Democratic Party () in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The party's goal was to bring together the country's Bosnian Serbs.\nIn September 1991, the \"Srpska Demokratska Stranka\" (SDS) began to create areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina that were ruled only by Serbs. On 15 October 1991, the Bosnian parliament voted that they wanted to rule themselves. Nine days later, a separate Serb Assembly was created, to represent only the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nPresident of Republika Srpska.\nOn 6 and 7 April 1992, Europe and the United States accepted that Bosnia was an independent country. Bosnia became a member of the United Nations on 22 May 1992. Karad\u017Ei\u0107 was voted President of this Bosnian Serb government around 13 May 1992. His powers included being in charge of the country's army.\nWar crimes charges.\nAs the head of the Bosnian Serb army, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 was in charge of a campaign to get rid of all the Bosnian Muslims and Croats from villages that the Serbs wanted for themselves.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 ran away so he could not be tried for these crimes. Until 2008, he hid. The United States government offered a $5\u00A0million reward for his arrest.\nArrest.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 was arrested on 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He had been pretending to be a doctor of alternative medicine, mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria. Karad\u017Ei\u0107 was sent to an ICTY jail in the Hague on 30 July.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 said that the United States government had protected him while he was hiding, and this was why it took over ten years for him to be found.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 first appeared before a judge at the ICTY began on 31 July 2008. At that time, the ICTY had found 64 people guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide during the Yugoslav Wars.\nThe film \"The Hunting Party\" was based on Karad\u017Ei\u0107's life as a fugitive.\nConviction and sentence.\nOn 24 March 2016, Karad\u017Ei\u0107 was found guilty of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.\nKarad\u017Ei\u0107 was found guilty of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre. He was also convicted of persecution, extermination, deportation, ethnic cleansing, and murder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["President"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serbian_Cyrillic","surface_form":"Serbian
