{"id":120605,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronis_True_Image","text":"Acronis True Image is a program to make disk images. It is made by Acronis. True Image can create an image of a disk while it is running Microsoft Windows or Linux, or offline by booting from CD/DVD, USB flash drives, PXE, or other bootable media. As a disk imaging solution, True Image can restore the previously captured image to another disk, effectively replicating the structure and contents to the new disk, also allowing partition resizing if the new disk is of different capacity.\nSupported filesystems.\nIn addition to the officially supported filesystems, Acronis True Image also provides raw sector backup and restore options for all other filesystems. 'Raw' mode provides support for a file system that is corrupt, or that is not officially supported, by capturing a complete image of all sectors on the disk. This method results in a larger image file as it is not able to compress, resize, or selectively restore files on the unrecognized filesystem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disk_image","surface_form":"disk image","offset":40},{"uri":"Acronis","surface_form":"Acronis","offset":67},{"uri":"Disk_image","surface_form":"image","offset":101},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":137},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":158},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CD","offset":192},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":195},{"uri":"USB_flash_drive","surface_form":"USB flash drive","offset":200},{"uri":"Preboot_Execution_Environment","surface_form":"PXE","offset":218},{"uri":"Bootable","surface_form":"bootable","offset":232}]}
