{"id":120633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napol%C3%A9on_III","text":"Napol\u00E9on III, also known as Louis-Napol\u00E9on Bonaparte (1808\u20131873) was the first President of the French Republic and the last monarch of France. Made president by popular vote in 1848, Napoleon III ascended to the throne on 2 December 1852, the forty-eighth anniversary of his uncle, Napoleon I's, coronation. He ruled as Emperor of the French until September 1870, when he was captured in the Franco-Prussian War.\nEarly life.\nNapoleon III, generally known as \"Louis Napol\u00E9on\" before he became emperor, was the son of Louis Bonaparte. He married Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter by the first marriage of Napoleon's wife Josephine de Beauharnais. Louis-Napol\u00E9on was a second son and a replacement child. His older brother, Napol\u00E9on Charles Bonaparte, died at age four. During Napoleon I's reign, Louis-Napol\u00E9on's parents had been made king and queen of a French puppet state, the Kingdom of Holland. After Napoleon I's military defeats and deposition in 1815 and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, all members of the Bonaparte dynasty were forced into exile. He was quietly exiled to the United States of America, and spent four years in New York. He also sailed to Central America. Then he secretly returned to France and attempted yet another coup in August 1840, sailing with some hired soldiers into Boulogne. In 1844, his uncle Joseph died, making him the direct heir apparent to the Bonaparte claim. Two years later, his father Louis died, making Louis-Napol\u00E9on the clear Bonapartist candidate to rule France.\nLouis-Napol\u00E9on lived within the borders of the United Kingdom until the revolution of February 1848 in France deposed Louis-Philippe and established a Republic. He was now free to return to France, which he immediately did.\nRuler of France.\nIn 1848, he was elected President of France in a land slide victory. He won the election because of his popular name and French people hoped that he would return his uncle's glory. He used his rank as stepping stone to greater power. Finally in 1852, he crowned himself as Emperor Napoleon III and the Second French Empire was born.In 1856, Eugenie gave birth to a legitimate son and heir, Louis Napol\u00E9on, the Prince Imp\u00E9rial.\nOn 28 April 1855 Napoleon survived an attempted assassination. On 14 January 1858 Napoleon and his wife escaped another assassination attempt, plotted by Felice Orsini.\nUntil about 1861, Napoleon's regime exhibited decidedly authoritarian characteristics, using press censorship to prevent the spread of opposition, manipulating elections, and depriving the Parliament of the right to free debate or any real power.\nA far more dangerous threat to Napoleon, however, was looming. France saw its dominance on the continent of Europe eroded by Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in the Austro-Prussian War in June\u2013August 1866. To prevent Prussia under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck becoming even more powerful, Napoleon began the Franco-Prussian War. This war proved disastrous, and was instrumental in giving birth to the German Empire, which would take France's place as the major land power on the continent of Europe. In the 1870 Battle of Sedan Prussian forces captured the Emperor. The forces of the Third Republic deposed his government in Paris two days later.\nDeath.\nNapoleon spent the last few years of his life in exile in England, with Eugenie and their only son. The family lived at Camden Place Chislehurst (then in Kent), where he died on 9 January 1873. He was haunted to the end by bitter regrets and by painful memories of the battle at which he lost everything.\nNapoleon was originally buried at St. Mary's, the Catholic Church in Chislehurst. However, after his son died in 1879 fighting in the British Army against the Zulus in South Africa, the bereaved Eugenie decided to build a monastery. The building would house monks driven out of France by the anti-religious laws of the Third Republic, and would provide a suitable resting place for her husband and son.\nLegacy.\nAn important legacy of Napoleon III's reign was the rebuilding of Paris under the supervision of Georges-Eug\u00E8ne Haussmann. One purpose was reduce the ability of future revolutionaries to challenge the government by blocking the small, medieval streets of Paris with barricades. However, the main reason for the complete transformation of Paris was Napoleon III's desire to modernize Paris based on what he had seen of the modernizations of London during his exile there in the 1840s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_the_French_Republic","surface_form":"President of the French Republic","offset":79},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":125},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":136},{"uri":"Napoleon_I","surface_form":"Napoleon I","offset":283},{"uri":"Emperor_of_the_French","surface_form":"Emperor of the French","offset":321},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":393},{"uri":"Replacement_child","surface_form":"replacement child","offset":688},{"uri":"Napol%C3%A9on_Charles_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Napol\u00E9on Charles Bonaparte","offset":726},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":894},{"uri":"1815","surface_form":"1815","offset":957},{"uri":"Bourbon_monarchy","surface_form":"Bourbon monarchy","offset":989},{"uri":"Bonaparte_dynasty","surface_form":"Bonaparte dynasty","offset":1036},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":1107},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":1157},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1185},{"uri":"Coup","surface_form":"coup","offset":1264},{"uri":"Joseph_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Joseph","offset":1352},{"uri":"Heir_apparent","surface_form":"heir apparent","offset":1387},{"uri":"Louis_Napol%C3%A9on%2C_the_Prince_Imp%C3%A9rial","surface_form":"Louis Napol\u00E9on, the Prince Imp\u00E9rial","offset":2166},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":2776},{"uri":"Otto_von_Bismarck","surface_form":"Otto von Bismarck","offset":2868},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":2934},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":3027},{"uri":"Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne_Haussmann%2C","surface_form":"Georges-Eug\u00E8ne Haussmann","offset":4093}]}
