{"id":120765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel","text":"Linux is an operating system kernel used by a group of Unix-like operating systems. These are known as Linux operating systems.\nThe Linux kernel is released with the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) and developed by programmers worldwide.\nHistory.\nAfter the post, many people contributed code to the project. By September 1991, Linux version 0.01 was released. It had 10,239 lines of code. In October 1991, Linux version 0.02 was released.\nA newsgroup \"alt.os.linux\" was started, and on January 19, 1992, the first post to alt.os.linux was made. On March 31, 1992, alt.os.linux became \"comp.os.linux\".\nThe X Window System was soon moved to Linux. In March 1992, Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running X. This large version number jump (from 0.1x to 0.9x) was because of a feeling that a version 1.0 with no major missing parts would be released soon.\nOn March 14, 1994, Linux 1.0.0 was released, with 176,250 lines of code. In March 1995, Linux 1.2.0 was released (310,950 lines of code).\nLinus decided, on May 9, 1996, to adopt Tux the penguin as mascot for Linux.\nCurrently a new kernel version is released in every 2 3/4 months.\nLicensing terms.\nIn the start, Torvalds released Linux under a license which did not allow anyone to sell it. This was soon changed to the GNU General Public License (GPL), during version 0.12. This license allows distribution and sale of modified and unmodified versions of Linux but requires that all those copies be released under the same license and be accompanied by the complete corresponding source code.\nTorvalds has said licensing Linux under the GPL as the \"best thing I ever did.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":12},{"uri":"Kernel_(computer_science)","surface_form":"kernel","offset":29},{"uri":"Unix-like","surface_form":"Unix-like","offset":55},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":65},{"uri":"Linux_operating_system","surface_form":"Linux operating system","offset":103},{"uri":"GNU_General_Public_License","surface_form":"GNU General Public License","offset":166},{"uri":"Delete_link","surface_form":"X Window System","offset":618},{"uri":"Tux","surface_form":"Tux","offset":1060},{"uri":"GNU_General_Public_License","surface_form":"GNU General Public License","offset":1302}]}
