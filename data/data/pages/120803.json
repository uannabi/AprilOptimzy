The district is part of the Dhaka Division, more than half of the district is made up of Dacca - the capital of the district and of Bangladesh too.\nHistory.\nDhaka has a very old history, the city area of Dhaka was ruled by the Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms century.\nAfter the Sena dynasty, Dhaka was ruled first by the Turkish and the Afghan governors from the Delhi Sultanate before the arrival of the Mughals in 1608.\nDuring the rule of the Mughal the district was famous for its textile products - especially the Muslin. The Mughal governor Islam Khan was the first administrator of the city. Khan named the town \"Jahangir Nagar\" (\"City of Jahangir\") in honour of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, although this name was dropped soon after Jahangir's death.\nThe city grew in size quite a lot under Mughal general Shaista Khan. The city then measured 19 by 13\u00A0kilometres (12 by 8\u00A0mi), with almost a million people. The city then passed to the control of the British East India Company in 1765 after the Battle of Plassey. The number of people in the city fell very much as the prominence of Kolkata rose, but development eventually followed. A modern civic water supply system was introduced in 1874 and electricity supply launched in 1878. The Dhaka Cantonment was established near the city, serving as a base for British and Indian soldiers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":49},{"uri":"Dhaka_Division","surface_form":"Dhaka Division","offset":89},{"uri":"Dhaka","surface_form":"Dacca","offset":150},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":162},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":288},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":301},{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":378},{"uri":"Delhi_Sultanate","surface_form":"Delhi Sultanate","offset":420},{"uri":"Muslin","surface_form":"Muslin","offset":575},{"uri":"Islam_Khan","surface_form":"Islam Khan","offset":603},{"uri":"Jahangir","surface_form":"Jahangir","offset":745},{"uri":"Shaista_Khan","surface_form":"Shaista Khan","offset":870},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":916},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mi","offset":936},{"uri":"British_East_India_Company","surface_form":"British East India Company","offset":1014},{"uri":"Battle_of_Plassey","surface_form":"Battle of Plassey","offset":1059},{"uri":"Kolkata","surface_form":"Kolkata","offset":1147},{"uri":"Dhaka_Cantonment","surface_form":"Dhaka Cantonment","offset":1301}]}
