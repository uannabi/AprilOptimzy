The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on high ground, and the outer area.\nKot Diji is located about 22 kilometres south of Khairpur in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. The site is at the foot of the hills. There a fort (Kot Diji Fort) was built around 1790 by the Talpur ruler of Upper Sindh, Mir Suhrab, who ruled from 1783 to 1830. This fort built on the ridge of a steep narrow hill is well preserved.\nRecent developments.\nToday, Kot Diji is on the way to becoming a more developed area.
