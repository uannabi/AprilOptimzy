{"id":120880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicu%C3%B1a","text":"The vicu\u00F1a (\"Vicugna vicugna\") is one of two wild South American camelids. The vicu\u00F1a is the smallest of the camelids. It has had an interesting relationship with humans over time.\nGeneral characteristics.\nThe main colour of the soft, wooly coat (hair) is ochre, light cinnamon, or reddish brown. The lower part of the body, the inside of the legs, and the underside of the head are white. On the chest, at the base of the neck, there is a 'mane' of white hairs. They can be 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) in length. The vicu\u00F1a is very slender (slim). It has long neck and skinny limbs. The head is small and wedge shaped. The ears are small and triangular. The incisors (front teeth) of the vicu\u00F1a are always growing. It is the only even toed-ungulate with teeth that always grow. The enamel is on only one side. This is because of the tough grasses which they eat.\nDistribution.\nThe vicu\u00F1a lives in grasslands at elevations of 3,500-5,800 meters (11,700-19,300 feet) in the Andes mountains of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":50},{"uri":"Camelid","surface_form":"camelid","offset":65},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wooly","offset":235},{"uri":"Ochre","surface_form":"ochre","offset":256},{"uri":"Cinnamon","surface_form":"cinnamon","offset":269},{"uri":"Leg","surface_form":"legs","offset":343},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":397},{"uri":"Neck_(body_part)","surface_form":"neck","offset":423},{"uri":"Limb","surface_form":"limbs","offset":572},{"uri":"Wedge","surface_form":"wedge","offset":601},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":619},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangular","offset":638},{"uri":"Incisor","surface_form":"incisors","offset":654},{"uri":"Artiodactyl","surface_form":"even toed-ungulate","offset":726},{"uri":"Tooth_enamel","surface_form":"enamel","offset":778},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grasses","offset":835},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grasslands","offset":893},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevations","offset":907},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":968},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":987},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":993},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1002},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1017}]}
