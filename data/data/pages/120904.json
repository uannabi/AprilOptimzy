{"id":120904,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets_(NBA)","text":"The Charlotte Hornets are a team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. They play their home games at the Time Warner Cable Arena. Most of the team is owned by Michael Jordan, who was a star player for the Chicago Bulls in the 1980s and 1990s. The team started playing in 2004 as the Charlotte Bobcats, and was the second NBA team to play in Charlotte (the New Orleans Pelicans had played in Charlotte as the Hornets from 1988 to 2002). In 2010, the Bobcats made the playoffs for the first time.\nAfter the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans in 2013, they gave the \"Hornets\" name back to the NBA. The Bobcats soon announced they would rename themselves the Hornets beginning with the 2014\u201315 NBA season, and the name change became official on May 20, 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"National Basketball Association","offset":40},{"uri":"Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Charlotte, North Carolina","offset":81},{"uri":"Time_Warner_Cable_Arena","surface_form":"Time Warner Cable Arena","offset":142},{"uri":"Michael_Jordan","surface_form":"Michael Jordan","offset":196},{"uri":"Chicago_Bulls","surface_form":"Chicago Bulls","offset":242},{"uri":"New_Orleans_Pelicans","surface_form":"New Orleans Pelicans","offset":393}]}
