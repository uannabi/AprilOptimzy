{"id":120949,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","text":"The First Amendment to the United States Constitution is a part of the United States Bill of Rights that protects freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and right to petition.\nThe Establishment Clause does not allow the government to support one religion more than any other religion. The government also can not say that a religion or a god is true. This is often described as \"separation of church and state\", where \"state\" means \"The Government\". It also does not allow the government to establish a national religion. It allows people to debate religion freely without the federal government of the United States getting involved. The clause did not stop the various states from supporting a particular religion, and several states did.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":27},{"uri":"United_States_Bill_of_Rights","surface_form":"United States Bill of Rights","offset":71},{"uri":"Freedom_of_speech","surface_form":"freedom of speech","offset":114},{"uri":"Freedom_of_religion","surface_form":"freedom of religion","offset":133},{"uri":"Freedom_of_assembly","surface_form":"freedom of assembly","offset":154},{"uri":"Freedom_of_the_press","surface_form":"freedom of the press","offset":175},{"uri":"Right_to_petition","surface_form":"right to petition","offset":201},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":290},{"uri":"Separation_of_church_and_state","surface_form":"separation of church and state","offset":423},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":521},{"uri":"National_religion","surface_form":"national religion","offset":547},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"federal government of the United States","offset":621}]}
