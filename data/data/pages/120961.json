{"id":120961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure","text":"Parliamentary procedure is a commonly accepted way in which a group of people work together to discuss and make decisions. It is a set of rules for meetings.\nHistory.\nThe term gets its name from its use in the Parliamentary system of government.\nIn the 16th century, there were rules of order in the early British Parliaments. In the 1560s, Sir Thomas Smith published a book about the procedures in the House of Commons in 1583. Early rules included\nWestminster procedures.\nThe Westminster parliamentary procedures are followed in several Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa. In Canada, for example, Parliament uses [\"House of Commons Procedure and Practice\" as its primary procedural authority.\nAmerican procedures.\nThe rules of the United States Congress were developed from the parliamentary procedures used in Britain. Variations of the American parliamentary procedures are followed in many nations, including Indonesia, the Phillipines, Mexico and South Korea.\nOther.\nIn contrast, the procedures of the Diet of Japan have moved away from the British parliamentary model. After the end of World War II, there were efforts to bring Japanese parliamentary procedures more in line with American congressional practices. In Japan, informal negotiations are more important than formal procedures.\nRobert's Rules.\nIn the US, the most widely used set of rules is \"Robert's Rules of Order\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":138},{"uri":"Parliamentary_system","surface_form":"Parliamentary system","offset":210},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":306},{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Parliaments","offset":314},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":539},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":577},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":593},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":601},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":612},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":625},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":636},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":808},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":989},{"uri":"Phillipines","surface_form":"Phillipines","offset":1004},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1017},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":1028},{"uri":"Diet_of_Japan","surface_form":"Diet of Japan","offset":1083},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1168}]}
