{"id":120996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-12","text":"=\"preserve\">Carbon-12 (also written 12C) is an isotope of carbon. It is the most common isotope of carbon, as 98.89% of all carbon is this type of carbon. It is one of two stable (non-radioactive) isotopes of carbon. The other is carbon-13.\nCarbon-12 is important in chemistry as it is the benchmark from which all other relative atomic masses are worked out. Its relative atomic mass is exactly 12.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":47},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":58},{"uri":"Radioactive","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":184},{"uri":"Carbon-13","surface_form":"carbon-13","offset":230},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":267},{"uri":"Relative_atomic_mass","surface_form":"relative atomic mass","offset":321}]}
