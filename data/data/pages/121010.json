{"id":121010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(magazine)","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Blender\" is an American music magazine that self-identifies as \"the ultimate guide to music and more.\" It is also known for sometimes having pictures of female celebrities that shows them with a lot of their body uncovered. It puts together lists of albums, artists, and songs, including both \"best of\" lists and \"worst of\" lists. In each issue, there is a review of an artist's entire discography, with a review of each album. The magazine teamed up with VH1 to create the \"50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs\".\n\"Blender\" is published by Dennis Publishing. The magazine was started in 1994 as the first digital CD-ROM magazine by Jason Pearson, David Cherry & Regina Joseph, acquired by Felix Dennis/Dennis Publishing, UK. It published 15 digital CD issues, and launched on the web in 1997. It started publishing a print edition again in 1999 in the same form that it does today. Blender CD-ROM showcased the earliest digital editorial (paper) formats, as well as the first forms of digital advertising. The first digital advertisers included: Calvin Klein, Apple Computer, Toyota and Nike.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":29},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":44},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":264},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":272},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":285},{"uri":"Discography","surface_form":"discography","offset":400},{"uri":"VH1","surface_form":"VH1","offset":470},{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":610},{"uri":"CD-ROM","surface_form":"CD-ROM","offset":618},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CD","offset":754},{"uri":"Calvin_Klein","surface_form":"Calvin Klein","offset":1051},{"uri":"Apple_Computer","surface_form":"Apple Computer","offset":1065},{"uri":"Toyota","surface_form":"Toyota","offset":1081},{"uri":"Nike","surface_form":"Nike","offset":1092}]}
