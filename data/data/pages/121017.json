{"id":121017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discography","text":"e=\"preserve\">Discography is the study and listing of sound recordings. The word comes from the word \"disc\", which is the most commonly used term for describing the format used most for sound recordings in the 20th century, and the \"-graph\" suffix meaning something written.\nA listing of all recordings of a musician or singer is usually called their \"discography\". Discographies may also be created based on a particular musical genre or record label, for example, so that all artists in a genre, or that have contracts with a certain label, are listed together.\nThe term \"discography\" became popular in the 1930s by collectors of jazz records. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records, as record companies did not commonly include that information on/with the records at that time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sound_recording","surface_form":"sound recording","offset":53},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":209},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":240},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":307},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":319},{"uri":"Musical_genre","surface_form":"musical genre","offset":421},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":438},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":631}]}
