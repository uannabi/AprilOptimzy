{"id":121029,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal","text":"Progressive metal (often called prog metal) is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that mixes the powerful, guitar-driven sound of metal with the complexity of progressive rock, which includes odd time signatures and complicated instrumental playing. Some progressive metal bands are also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music. Like progressive rock songs, progressive metal songs are usually much longer than other metal songs, and they are often themed in concept albums. As a result, progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs.\nHistory.\nThe origins of progressive metal started with progressive rock bands from the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s such as Yes, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Genesis, Kansas and Rush. However, progressive metal did not evolve into a genre of its own until the mid-1980s. Bands such as Queensr\u00FFche, Fates Warning and Dream Theater took certain aspects of progressive rock music and mixed them with heavy metal styles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Music genre"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":53},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal music","offset":62},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":105},{"uri":"Progressive_rock","surface_form":"progressive rock","offset":157},{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"time signature","offset":194},{"uri":"Jazz_fusion","surface_form":"jazz fusion","offset":300},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":316},{"uri":"Concept_album","surface_form":"concept album","offset":463},{"uri":"Progressive_rock","surface_form":"progressive rock","offset":621},{"uri":"Yes_(band)","surface_form":"Yes","offset":695},{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":700},{"uri":"Jethro_Tull_(band)","surface_form":"Jethro Tull","offset":712},{"uri":"King_Crimson","surface_form":"King Crimson","offset":725},{"uri":"Genesis_(band)","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":739},{"uri":"Kansas_(band)","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":748},{"uri":"Rush_(band)","surface_form":"Rush","offset":759},{"uri":"Queensr%C3%BFche","surface_form":"Queensr\u00FFche","offset":866},{"uri":"Fates_Warning","surface_form":"Fates Warning","offset":879},{"uri":"Dream_Theater","surface_form":"Dream Theater","offset":897},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":978}]}
