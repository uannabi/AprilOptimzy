{"id":121035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver_(magazine)","text":"\"Revolver\" is a monthly hard rock and heavy metal magazine published by Future US. It started as a magazine that was about more popular styles of music, but then changed to what it is now. The magazine is put together a lot like \"Spin\", and also writes about the heavy metal and punk subcultures. It has cover stories (usually centering on a band's new album, song, or upcoming tour), album reviews, instrument reviews, and a section for readers to get advice from a celebrity.\nAnother notable feature of the magazine is its coverage of underground and up-and-coming bands from all over the world. Instead of focusing only on the most popular bands, \"Revolver\" introduces a lot that are not played on the radio or on MTV.\nIts slogan is: \"The World's Loudest Rock Magazine!\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hard_rock","surface_form":"hard rock","offset":24},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":38},{"uri":"Publisher","surface_form":"published","offset":59},{"uri":"Spin_(magazine)","surface_form":"Spin","offset":230},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk","offset":279},{"uri":"Subculture","surface_form":"subculture","offset":284},{"uri":"Tour","surface_form":"tour","offset":378},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"celebrity","offset":467},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":717}]}
