{"id":121126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenab_River","text":"'Moon(Chan) \u0686\u0646 River(aab)) \u0622\u0628', is formed by the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi in the upper Himalayas in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, Republic of India. In its upper reaches it is also known as the Chandrabhaga. It is a tributary of the Indus River.\nIt flows through the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir into the plains of the Punjab, forming the boundary between the Rechna and Jech interfluves (Doabs in Persian). It is joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu \u062A\u0631\u06CC\u0645\u0648 and then by the Ravi River Ahmadpur Siyaal \u0627\u062D\u0645\u062F\u067E\u0648\u0631\u0633\u06CC\u0627\u0644. It then merges with the Sutlej River near Uch Sharif to form the Panjnad or the 'Five Rivers', the fifth being the Beas River which joins the Satluj near Ferozepur, India. The Chenab then joins the Indus at Mithankot. The total length of the Chenab is about 960 kilometres.\nThe waters of the Chenab are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty.\nThe Baglihar hydropower dam is being built (as of 2006) on the Chenab River in the Doda district. This is about 110 kilometers eastward of the Pakistan border in the Jammu division of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The dam is one of 9 hydro-electric projects on the Chenab River.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":114},{"uri":"Himachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"Himachal Pradesh","offset":159},{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":177},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":263},{"uri":"Indus_River","surface_form":"Indus River","offset":280},{"uri":"Jammu_region","surface_form":"Jammu region","offset":314},{"uri":"Jammu_and_Kashmir","surface_form":"Jammu and Kashmir","offset":330},{"uri":"Jhelum_River","surface_form":"Jhelum River","offset":480},{"uri":"Ravi_River","surface_form":"Ravi River","offset":525},{"uri":"Sutlej_River","surface_form":"Sutlej River","offset":589},{"uri":"Beas_River","surface_form":"Beas River","offset":680},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":881},{"uri":"Baglihar_hydropower_dam","surface_form":"Baglihar hydropower dam","offset":938},{"uri":"Hydro-electric","surface_form":"hydro-electric","offset":1177}]}
