{"id":121176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panjnad_River","text":"Panjnad River (, Sanskrit: panj = five, nadi = river) is a river in Punjab, Pakistan. Panjnad River is formed by successive confluence of the five rivers of Punjab, namely Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Jhelum and Ravi join Chenab, Beas joins Sutlej, and then Sutlej and Chenab join to form Panjnad near Uch Sharif. The combined stream runs southwest for approximately 45 miles and joins Indus River at Mithankot. The Indus continues into the Arabian Sea. A dam on Panjnad has been erected; it provides irrigation channels for Punjab and Sind provinces south of the Sutlej and east of the Indus rivers.\nBeyond the meeting of Indus and Panjnad rivers, the Indus river was known as Satnad (Sat = seven) carrying the waters of seven rivers including Indus river, which is believed to be in ealrlier times the Saraswati River/Ghaggar-Hakra River river which eventually dried and became a seasonal river due to seismic shifts in the glacial region of Himachal Pradesh where it originated and later on Kabul river and the five rivers of Punjab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punjab_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":68},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":76},{"uri":"Punjab_region","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":157},{"uri":"Jhelum_River","surface_form":"Jhelum","offset":172},{"uri":"Chenab_River","surface_form":"Chenab","offset":180},{"uri":"Ravi_River","surface_form":"Ravi","offset":188},{"uri":"Beas_River","surface_form":"Beas","offset":194},{"uri":"Sutlej_River","surface_form":"Sutlej","offset":203},{"uri":"Indus_River","surface_form":"Indus River","offset":396},{"uri":"Mithankot","surface_form":"Mithankot","offset":411},{"uri":"Arabian_Sea","surface_form":"Arabian Sea","offset":451},{"uri":"Sind","surface_form":"Sind","offset":546},{"uri":"Saraswati_River","surface_form":"Saraswati River","offset":814},{"uri":"Ghaggar-Hakra_River","surface_form":"Ghaggar-Hakra River","offset":830},{"uri":"Himachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"Himachal Pradesh","offset":954}]}
