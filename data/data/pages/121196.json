It is the main river in the eastern part of Afghanistan. It flows 700\u00A0km before joining the Indus River near Attock. It passes through the cities of Kabul, Chaharbagh, Jalalabad, and (flowing into Pakistan some 30\u00A0km north of the Khyber Pass) Nowshera. The major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Kunar and Alingar and Bara rivers.\nTributaries.\nThe Kabul river itself is little more than a trickle for most of the year, but swells in summer due to melting snows. Its largest tributary is the Kunar River, which starts out as the Mastuj River, flowing from the Chiantar glacier in Chitral, Pakistan and once it flows south into Afghanistan it is met by the Bashgal river flowing from Nurestan. The Kunar meets the Kabul near Jalalabad. In spite of the Kunar carrying more water than the Kabul, the river continues as the Kabul River after this confluence, mainly for the political and historical significance of the name.\nIt is also called Sardryab near Distt: Charsadda where it provides a fine avenue for recreation and refreshment. Sardryab is famous for its fishing annd having a worthy fish economy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":79},{"uri":"Indus_River","surface_form":"Indus River","offset":246},{"uri":"Attock","surface_form":"Attock","offset":263},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":351},{"uri":"Khyber_Pass","surface_form":"Khyber Pass","offset":384},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":651},{"uri":"Kunar_River","surface_form":"Kunar River","offset":668},{"uri":"Mastuj_River","surface_form":"Mastuj River","offset":705},{"uri":"Chitral","surface_form":"Chitral","offset":756},{"uri":"Nurestan","surface_form":"Nurestan","offset":859},{"uri":"Jalalabad","surface_form":"Jalalabad","offset":900}]}
