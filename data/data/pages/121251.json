For instance, standards for encoding data (e.g. country codes), but more significantly some encryption standards, such as the Data Encryption Standard ([http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips46-3/fips46-3.pdf FIPS 46]) and the Advanced Encryption Standard ([http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf FIPS 197]).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Standardization","surface_form":"standards","offset":65},{"uri":"United_States_Federal_government","surface_form":"United States Federal government","offset":87},{"uri":"American_National_Standards_Institute","surface_form":"ANSI","offset":317},{"uri":"Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers","surface_form":"IEEE","offset":323},{"uri":"International_Organization_for_Standardization","surface_form":"ISO","offset":329},{"uri":"Country_codes","surface_form":"country codes","offset":481},{"uri":"Encryption_standards","surface_form":"encryption standards","offset":525},{"uri":"Data_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"Data Encryption Standard","offset":559},{"uri":"Advanced_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"Advanced Encryption Standard","offset":665}]}
