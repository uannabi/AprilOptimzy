{"id":121254,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertow_(Tool_album)","text":"\"Undertow\" is Tool's first full-length album, released in 1993. When this album was released, grunge music was at its most popular, and pop punk was slowly beginning to become popular. \"Undertow\" helped heavy metal music continue as a leading mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. Allmusic saw the album's success in the \"striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.\" It was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA on May 14, 2001.\nThe album was recorded between October and December 1992 at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, California, and includes songs that the band decided to not release on their previous EP, \"Opiate\".\nCD.\nAll songs written by Tool unless otherwise noted.\n\"Disgustipated\" is track 69 on most pressings in North America (causing most CD players upon reaching the end of track 9 to advance through tracks 10-68, which contain no data, at a rate of about 2 per second until track 69 is reached). It also appears as track 39, track 10 (mostly in Europe) or as a hidden track following \"Flood\" on track 9.\nOn certain Japanese imports, \"Disgustipated\" is track 70, with a short live version of \"Flood\" as track 71.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool_(band)","surface_form":"Tool","offset":14},{"uri":"Grunge_music","surface_form":"grunge music","offset":94},{"uri":"Pop_punk","surface_form":"pop punk","offset":136},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal music","offset":203},{"uri":"Mainstream","surface_form":"mainstream","offset":243},{"uri":"Allmusic","surface_form":"Allmusic","offset":337},{"uri":"Music_recording_sales_certification","surface_form":"double platinum","offset":493},{"uri":"Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","surface_form":"RIAA","offset":516},{"uri":"May_14","surface_form":"May 14","offset":524},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":532},{"uri":"Hollywood%2C_California","surface_form":"Hollywood, California","offset":620},{"uri":"Opiate_(EP)","surface_form":"Opiate","offset":722}]}
