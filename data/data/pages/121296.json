{"id":121296,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun","text":"=\"preserve\">In Irish mythology, a leprechaun () is a type of male faerie said to live in the island Ireland. They are a class of \"faerie folk\" in Irish mythology and folklore, as with all faeries, with the Tuatha D\u00E9 Danann.\nThey usually form into the look of old men and who enjoy doing trouble. They are said to be very rich, having many treasure crocks buried during war-time. Legend says, if someone looks at one of them, the leprechaun cannot escape, but the moment the person looks away, he disappears.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irish_mythology","surface_form":"Irish mythology","offset":15},{"uri":"Faerie","surface_form":"faerie","offset":66},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":100},{"uri":"Faerie","surface_form":"faerie","offset":130},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":152},{"uri":"Folklore","surface_form":"folklore","offset":166},{"uri":"Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann","surface_form":"Tuatha D\u00E9 Danann","offset":206},{"uri":"Form","surface_form":"form","offset":237},{"uri":"Treasure","surface_form":"treasure","offset":339},{"uri":"Crock_(dishware)","surface_form":"crock","offset":348},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"Legend","offset":379},{"uri":"Disappear","surface_form":"disappear","offset":496}]}
