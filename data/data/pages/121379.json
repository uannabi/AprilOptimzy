{"id":121379,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function","text":"In calculus, a branch of mathematics, the limit of a function is the behavior of a certain function near a selected input value for that function. Limits are one of the main calculus topics, along with derivatives, integration, and differential equations.\nDefinition of the limit.\nThe notation for the limit above is read as \"The limit of formula_1 as formula_1 approaches formula_1 is formula_1\", or alternatively, formula_1 as formula_1 (reads \"formula_1 tends to formula_1 as formula_1 tends to formula_1\"). Informally, this means that we can make formula_1 as close to formula_1 as possible\u2014by making formula_1 sufficiently close to formula_1 from both sides (without making formula_1 equal to formula_1).\nRight and left limits.\nFor the function formula_1, we can get as close to formula_1 in the formula_1-values as we want, so long as we do \"not\" make formula_1 equal to formula_1. For instance, we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001, but never 0. Therefore, we can get formula_1 as close as we want to formula_1, but without reaching it. The left limit is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number, and the right limit is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number. For instance, in the function formula_1, since the limit for formula_1 is 0, if formula_1, it approaches the limit from the right. If we instead choose -1, we say it approaches the limit from the left.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":91},{"uri":"Derivative","surface_form":"derivative","offset":202},{"uri":"Integration","surface_form":"integration","offset":215},{"uri":"Differential_equation","surface_form":"differential equation","offset":232}]}
