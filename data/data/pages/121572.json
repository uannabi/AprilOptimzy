{"id":121572,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badjcinus","text":"\"Badjcinus\" (\"expert hunter dog\") was an animal that belonged to the extinct marsupial family Thylacinidae.\nIt was one of the most primitive members of its group, living 33 to 32 million years ago in the early Oligocene. It was quite small, averaging 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg) in weight.\nIts diet probably consisted of small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and insects.\nAlthough \"Badjcinus\" was successful in its period, it probably was pushed out by other, better developed thylacinids. The fossils were found at Riversleigh in north-west Queensland, Australia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":77},{"uri":"Thylacinidae","surface_form":"Thylacinidae","offset":94},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":210},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":316},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":325},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":337},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":350},{"uri":"Australian_Fossil_Mammal_Sites_(Riversleigh)","surface_form":"Riversleigh","offset":503},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":529},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":541}]}
