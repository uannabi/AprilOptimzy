{"id":121792,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals","text":"Greek numerals are a system of representing numbers using letters of the Greek alphabet. They are also known by the names \"Milesian numerals\", \"Alexandrian numerals\", or \"alphabetic numerals\". In modern Greece, they are still in use for ordinal numbers, and in much of the same way that Roman numerals are in the West; for ordinary (cardinal) numbers, Arabic numerals are used.\nAt first, before it was used more, the Greek alphabet, Linear A and Linear B had used a different system with symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 operating with the following formula: | = 1, \u2013 = 10, \u25E6 = 100, \u00A4 = 1000, \u263C = 10000.\nThe earliest alphabet-related system of numerals used with the Greek letters was a set of the acrophonic Attic numerals, operating much like Roman numerals (which derived from this scheme), with the following formula: \u0399 = 1, \u03A0 = 5, \u0394 = 10, \u03A0\u0394 = 50, \u0397 = 100, \u03A0\u0397 = 500, \u03A7 = 1000, \u03A0\u03A7 = 5000, \u039C = 10000 and \u03A0\u039C = 50000.\nThe acrophonic system was replaced by a new alphabetic system, sometimes called the Ionic numeral system, from the 4th century BC. Each unit (1, 2, \u2026, 9) was assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, \u2026, 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, \u2026, 900) a separate letter. This requires 27 letters, so the 24-letter Greek alphabet was extended by using three obsolete letters: fau \u03DD, (also used are [Sigma (letter)|sigma] \u03DB or, in modern Greek, \u03A3\u03A4) for 6, koppa \u03DF for 90, and sampi \u03E1 for 900. To distinguish numerals from letters they are followed by the \"keraia\" (Greek \"\u2014insect antenna\"), a symbol similar to an acute sign (Unicode U+0374).\nThis alphabetic system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 241 is represented as \u03A3\u039C\u0391\u02B9 (200 + 40 + 1).\nTo represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999 the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. A \"left keraia\" (Unicode U+0375, \u2018Greek Lower Numeral Sign\u2019) is put in front of thousands to distinguish\nHigher numbers.\nThe Greeks also used the myriad to denote 10,000 (\u039C\u02B9) and the myriad myriad for one hundred million (\u039C\u039C\u02B9).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"system of representing numbers","offset":21},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":73},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":203},{"uri":"Ordinal_number","surface_form":"ordinal number","offset":237},{"uri":"Roman_numerals","surface_form":"Roman numerals","offset":287},{"uri":"Cardinal_numbers","surface_form":"cardinal","offset":333},{"uri":"Arabic_numerals","surface_form":"Arabic numerals","offset":352},{"uri":"Linear_A","surface_form":"Linear A","offset":433},{"uri":"Linear_B","surface_form":"Linear B","offset":446},{"uri":"Acrophonic","surface_form":"acrophonic","offset":704},{"uri":"Attic_numerals","surface_form":"Attic numerals","offset":715},{"uri":"4th_century_BC","surface_form":"4th century BC","offset":1040},{"uri":"Fau","surface_form":"fau","offset":1316},{"uri":"Koppa_(letter)","surface_form":"koppa","offset":1395},{"uri":"Sampi","surface_form":"sampi","offset":1415},{"uri":"Antenna_(biology)","surface_form":"insect antenna","offset":1512},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":1565},{"uri":"Myriad","surface_form":"myriad","offset":2063}]}
