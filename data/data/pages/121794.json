{"id":121794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_numerals","text":"The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.\nIn this system, zero does not have a place, and the number values for each letter are added together. Each unit (1, 2..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20..., 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200..., 900) a separate letter.\nMain table.\nHebrew has masculine and feminine ways of saying the words. For just counting, feminine is used. Otherwise, the gender is used (ex. two boys, two girls).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"numeral system","offset":60},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":85},{"uri":"Hebrew_alphabet","surface_form":"Hebrew alphabet","offset":100},{"uri":"0_(number)","surface_form":"zero","offset":133},{"uri":"Masculine","surface_form":"masculine","offset":397},{"uri":"Feminine","surface_form":"feminine","offset":411}]}
