{"id":121852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Parker","text":"Edna Ruth Scott Parker (April 20, 1893 \u2013 November 26, 2008) was an American woman who was the oldest living documented person from the death of Yone Minagawa on August 13, 2007 until November 26, 2008.\nParker was born on a farm in Morgan County, Indiana. She got a teaching certificate at Franklin College, and was a teacher for a few years until she married Earl Parker, who was her next door neighbor. He died on February 23, 1939. They had two sons, Clifford and Earl Jr., both of whom died before her.\nAfter Earl's death, Parker lived by herself on a farm on Blueridge Road. She stayed there until she was 100, when she moved in to live with one of her sons. On a winter night, she was alone while her son and his wife went to a basketball game. When they came back, they found her in the back yard, in poor health, in the snow, and could only be seen as she had been wearing a red sweater that she liked a lot. Her family feared that she would die, but her health got much better. After that, the family thought that she needed to move to a nursing home.\nParker lived at Heritage House Convalescent Center, a retirement home in Shelbyville, Indiana. She remained in good health and was still able to walk. In April 2007, at age 114, she met with 113-year-old Bertha Fry, who was at the time the second-oldest person living in Indiana and the fifth-oldest living person. This set the highest total age for a meeting of two people.\nParker reached the age of 115 on April 20, 2008. There were two birthday parties held, the first of which was public, and the second private. The public one was celebrated on April 18, 2008, and the private on April 20. At both parties, one hundred fifteen balloons of many colors floated in the air, because she liked to see balloons in the air. This was Parker's final year, as she lived until November 26 of that year at age 115 years, 220 days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":67},{"uri":"Yone_Minagawa","surface_form":"Yone Minagawa","offset":144},{"uri":"Morgan_County%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Morgan County, Indiana","offset":231},{"uri":"Certificate","surface_form":"certificate","offset":274},{"uri":"Franklin_College","surface_form":"Franklin College","offset":289},{"uri":"Neighbor","surface_form":"neighbor","offset":394},{"uri":"Retirement","surface_form":"retirement","offset":1114},{"uri":"Shelbyville%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Shelbyville, Indiana","offset":1133},{"uri":"Bertha_Fry","surface_form":"Bertha Fry","offset":1264},{"uri":"Balloon","surface_form":"balloon","offset":1692}]}
