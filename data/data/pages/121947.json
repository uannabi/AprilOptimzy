{"id":121947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6neberg","text":"Sch\u00F6neberg is a locality of Berlin. Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was a separate borough including the locality of Friedenau. Together with the former borough of Tempelhof it is now part of the new borough of Tempelhof-Sch\u00F6neberg.\nHistory.\nThe village was first documented in 1264 by Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. In 1751 Bohemian weavers founded Neu-Sch\u00F6neberg also known as B\u00F6hmisch-Sch\u00F6neberg, along the current Hauptstra\u00DFe.\nDuring the Seven Years' War on 7 October 1760 Sch\u00F6neberg and its village church were completely destroyed by a fire due to the joint attack on Berlin by Austrian and Russian troops.\nAlt & Neu Sch\u00F6neberg were combined as one entity in 1874 and received town privileges in 1898. In 1920 Sch\u00F6neberg became a part of Greater Berlin. Its town hall Rathaus Sch\u00F6neberg was completed in 1914. Subsequent to World War II it served as the city hall of West Berlin until 1991 when the administration of the reunited City of Berlin moved back to the Rotes Rathaus in Mitte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Locality","surface_form":"locality","offset":16},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":28},{"uri":"Berlin%27s_2001_administrative_reform","surface_form":"Berlin's 2001 administrative reform","offset":42},{"uri":"Friedenau","surface_form":"Friedenau","offset":130},{"uri":"Tempelhof","surface_form":"Tempelhof","offset":177},{"uri":"Boroughs_of_Berlin","surface_form":"borough","offset":213},{"uri":"Tempelhof-Sch%C3%B6neberg","surface_form":"Tempelhof-Sch\u00F6neberg","offset":224},{"uri":"Rulers_of_Brandenburg","surface_form":"Margrave","offset":299},{"uri":"Margraviate_of_Brandenburg","surface_form":"Brandenburg","offset":320},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":341},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"weavers","offset":350},{"uri":"Seven_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Seven Years' War","offset":458},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":600},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":613},{"uri":"Town_privileges","surface_form":"town privileges","offset":699},{"uri":"Greater_Berlin_Act","surface_form":"Greater Berlin","offset":760},{"uri":"Rathaus_Sch%C3%B6neberg","surface_form":"Rathaus Sch\u00F6neberg","offset":790},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":846},{"uri":"West_Berlin","surface_form":"West Berlin","offset":889},{"uri":"Rotes_Rathaus","surface_form":"Rotes Rathaus","offset":985},{"uri":"Mitte","surface_form":"Mitte","offset":1002}]}
