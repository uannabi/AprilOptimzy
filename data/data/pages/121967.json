{"id":121967,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Niemeyer","text":"Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho (December 15, 1907 December 5, 2012) was a Brazilian architect who is thought to be an important name in worldwide modern architecture. He was a pioneer in the idea of using reinforced concrete for buildings.\nBuildings made by Niemeyer often have a lot of empty space, making odd patterns. The biggest work he made was the plan for the city of Bras\u00EDlia.\nPolitically, Niemeyer was a communist, which sometimes had a bad effect for him: When the military dictatorship of Brazil happened in 1964, Niemeyer was forced into exile in Paris. Fidel Castro once said \"Niemeyer and I are the last Communists of this planet.\"\nIn 1988, Niemeyer won the Pritzker Prize.\nIn 2012, he died of cardiac arrest due to a respiratory tract infection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":90},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":100},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":169},{"uri":"Reinforced_concrete","surface_form":"reinforced concrete","offset":221},{"uri":"Bras%C3%ADlia","surface_form":"Bras\u00EDlia","offset":391},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":429},{"uri":"Military_dictatorship","surface_form":"military dictatorship","offset":491},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":566},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":575},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":582},{"uri":"Pritzker_Architecture_Prize","surface_form":"Pritzker Prize","offset":688},{"uri":"Respiratory_tract_infection","surface_form":"respiratory tract infection","offset":748}]}
