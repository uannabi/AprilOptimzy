{"id":122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester","text":"Colchester is a town in the northern part of the English county of Essex. It has a population of 104,000 people. People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England.\nHistory.\nBefore Roman times, Colchester was \"Camulodunon\". This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos. Camulos was the Celtic god of war. The Romans called Colchester \"Camulodunum\" (written \"CAMVLODVNVM\") and made it the capital of Roman Britain. Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD. The Romans moved their capital of Britannia to Londinium (now London), but Camulodunum remained an important city until the fifth century, when the Saxons conquered the region.\nThe Roman town of \"Camulodunum\", officially known as \"Colonia Victricensis\", reached its peak in the Second and Third centuries AD. It may have reached a population of 30,000 in those centuries, but when the Romans withdrew from Britannia in 410 AD it probably had fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.\nThe church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539. This action was part of the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII. Only a gate remains, that people still go to visit.\nKing Cunobelinus (or \"Cunobelin\") was from Colchester.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":16},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":49},{"uri":"Counties_of_England","surface_form":"county","offset":57},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":67},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":83},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":158},{"uri":"Celtic_languages","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":250},{"uri":"Camulos","surface_form":"Camulos","offset":277},{"uri":"Celt","surface_form":"Celt","offset":302},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"god","offset":309},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":316},{"uri":"Roman_Britain","surface_form":"Roman Britain","offset":415},{"uri":"Boudicca","surface_form":"Boudicca","offset":467},{"uri":"61","surface_form":"61","offset":479},{"uri":"Benedictine","surface_form":"Benedictine","offset":976},{"uri":"Abbey","surface_form":"abbey","offset":988},{"uri":"John_the_Baptist","surface_form":"Saint John the Baptist","offset":997},{"uri":"1539","surface_form":"1539","offset":1037},{"uri":"Dissolution_of_the_monasteries","surface_form":"dissolution of the monasteries","offset":1071},{"uri":"Henry_VIII","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":1110},{"uri":"Cunobelinus","surface_form":"Cunobelinus","offset":1179}]}
