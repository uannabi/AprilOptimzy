{"id":122118,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysprosium","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dysprosium () is a chemical element with the symbol Dy and atomic number 66. It has a very high melting temperature of 1,407\u00B0C. It can also absorb neutrons. This makes it very suitable for use with nuclear reactors and lasers.\nDysprosium is a rare earth element that has a metallic, bright silver luster.\nDysprosium was first identified in Paris in 1886 by French chemist Paul \u00C9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":32},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":72},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":160},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactor","surface_form":"nuclear reactor","offset":211},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":232},{"uri":"Rare_earth_element","surface_form":"rare earth element","offset":256},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":353},{"uri":"Paul_%C3%89mile_Lecoq_de_Boisbaudran","surface_form":"Paul \u00C9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran","offset":385}]}
