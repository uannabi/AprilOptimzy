{"id":122243,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Synonyms in taxonomy are similar to normal synonyms, there are two (or more than two) names for the same thing in a scientific classification. For example, the cat has a few scientific names in: \"Felis silvestris catus\", \"Felis catus\", and \"Felis catus domestica\".\nIn botany, the word \"synonym\" has a special meaning. There is one \"correct name\", and the other names are synonyms. For example, \"Daemonorops draco\" is the correct name of a species of palm trees, and \"Calamus draco\" is a synonym for the same species.\nIn zoology, there is one \"valid name\" and the others are \"junior synonyms\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":25},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":56},{"uri":"Scientific_classification","surface_form":"scientific classification","offset":129},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":173},{"uri":"Felis_silvestris_catus","surface_form":"Felis silvestris catus","offset":209},{"uri":"Felis_catus","surface_form":"Felis catus","offset":235},{"uri":"Felis_catus_domestica","surface_form":"Felis catus domestica","offset":254},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":281},{"uri":"Palm_tree","surface_form":"palm tree","offset":463},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoology","offset":533}]}
