The commune changed its name many times. Before the French Revolution the name was \"Saint-Maurice-Terlin\" (contraction of \"Terre \u00E0 lin\" - Land of Flax) because the inhabitants grew flax. The village then became \"Saint Maurice Torsinet\" in 1793. Eight years later, in 1801, the name was changed again, first to \"Saint-Maurice-en-Lanas\" then\n\"Saint-Maurice-et-Lanas\". In 1846 it was simply \"Saint-Maurice\". The current name, \"Saint-Maurice-d'Ard\u00E8che\" appeared between 1846 and 1861. It is because the commune is close to the river \"Ard\u00E8che\".\nGeography.\nThe village is between the communes of Aubenas and Ruoms. It is close to the river \"Ard\u00E8che\". There are many vineyards there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communes_of_the_Ard%C3%A8che_department","surface_form":"commune","offset":29},{"uri":"Ard%C3%A8che","surface_form":"Ard\u00E8che","offset":44},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"d\u00E9partement","offset":53},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":78},{"uri":"Benedictine","surface_form":"Benedictine","offset":128},{"uri":"Convent","surface_form":"convent","offset":140},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":155},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":221},{"uri":"Contraction","surface_form":"contraction","offset":276},{"uri":"Flax","surface_form":"Flax","offset":315},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":692},{"uri":"Aubenas","surface_form":"Aubenas","offset":759},{"uri":"Ruoms","surface_form":"Ruoms","offset":771},{"uri":"Vineyard","surface_form":"vineyard","offset":829}]}
