{"id":122280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethium","text":"=\"preserve\">Promethium is a chemical element that has the symbol Pm on the periodic table. It has the atomic number 61 which means it has 61 protons in its atom. It is a Lanthanide. All its isotopes are radioactive. Together with Technetium, these are the only two radioactive elements below lead. Most Promethium is artificially produced. The longest-living promethium is 145Pm, with a half-life of 17.7 years.\nPromethium is used in the illuminated digits of some clocks, its Beta Radiation may be used to measure thickness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":28},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"element","offset":37},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":75},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":141},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":156},{"uri":"Lanthanide","surface_form":"Lanthanide","offset":170},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":190},{"uri":"Radioactive_decay","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":203},{"uri":"Technetium","surface_form":"Technetium","offset":230},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":292},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half-life","offset":387},{"uri":"Beta_Radiation","surface_form":"Beta Radiation","offset":477}]}
