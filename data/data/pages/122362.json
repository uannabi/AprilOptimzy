{"id":122362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_Quo","text":"Status Quo, also known as The Quo or just Quo, is a rock band from England. They were called \"The Status Quo\" in late 1967, and settled on the name \"Status Quo\" in 1970. They have recorded over 60 chart hits in the UK, and have sold a total of 118 million records worldwide. They have also had a total of 33 hit albums in the UK charts - more than any other band other than the Rolling Stones. Their hayday was in the early to mid '70's with hits like Caroline, Whatever You Want, and Down Down. They formed in 1962, changed their name to The Status Quo in 1967 and to Status Quo in 1969.\nAlthough sometimes criticized for a repetitive and apparently simple guitar riff sequence and harmonies on many of their numbers, their musical versatility can be heard in some of their earlier or less well-known numbers, such as Ice in the Sun, Pictures of Matchstick Men and Forty-Five Hundred Times. The latter probably highlights, more than any other, Rossi and Parfitt's talent for close vocal and guitar harmonies, which owe much to the English folk and folk/rock genres. Whether intentional or not this has become their hallmark.\nStatus Quo famously opened the Live Aid concert in 1985 with 'Rocking All Over the World' - the then largest live television broadcast ever.\nRick Parfitt died in 2016 from sepsis in Spain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock band","offset":52},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":67},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":215},{"uri":"Rick_Parfitt","surface_form":"Rick Parfitt","offset":1267},{"uri":"Sepsis","surface_form":"sepsis","offset":1298},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1308}]}
