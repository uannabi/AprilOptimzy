{"id":12263,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas","text":"Caracas is the capital city of Venezuela. Santiago de Le\u00F2n de Losada founded the city in 1567. It is where Simon Bolivar was born. The city has nearly 6 million people, who live in the metropolitan area. Caracas is the center of the economical activity of the country and also hosts the main government offices of Venezuela.\nAfter WW2 the city has experienced a huge growth, thanks to the oil revenues of the country. Nearly half a million Europeans immigrated to the city in the 1950s (that had in those years only one million inhabitants) and so Caracas developed a typical western-European look in the new modern areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":15},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":31},{"uri":"Santiago_de_Le%C3%B2n_de_Losada","surface_form":"Santiago de Le\u00F2n de Losada","offset":42},{"uri":"Simon_Bolivar","surface_form":"Simon Bolivar","offset":107},{"uri":"WW2","surface_form":"WW2","offset":331}]}
