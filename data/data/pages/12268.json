It usually gets updated every Monday (but, except for an update on April Fools' Day of 2014 and a few cartoons since, it has not been actively updated since December 2010) with a cartoon, a game, or a Strong Bad Email. The people that made the website are Mike Chapman and Matt Chapman. They are brothers and are called The Brothers Chaps. The cartoons on the website normally show Homestar Runner or Strong Bad, who are the main characters on the cartoon.\nVideo games.\nTelltale Games, the makers of video games based on the Sam & Max comic book, made a game called \"Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People\" for Windows and the Wii's WiiWare. It's an episodic game with five episodes, and it is made with 3 dimensions instead of 2 dimensions like Homestar Runner is. The first episode was called \"Homestar Ruiner\", and ended with \"8-Bit is Enough\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":53},{"uri":"Macromedia_Flash","surface_form":"Macromedia Flash","offset":90},{"uri":"Monday","surface_form":"Monday","offset":138},{"uri":"April_Fools%27_Day","surface_form":"April Fools' Day","offset":175},{"uri":"Electronic_mail","surface_form":"Email","offset":320},{"uri":"The_Brothers_Chaps","surface_form":"The Brothers Chaps","offset":428},{"uri":"Cartoons","surface_form":"cartoons","offset":452},{"uri":"Telltale_Games","surface_form":"Telltale Games","offset":578},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":608},{"uri":"Sam_%26amp%3B_Max","surface_form":"Sam & Max","offset":633},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":643},{"uri":"Strong_Bad%27s_Cool_Game_for_Attractive_People","surface_form":"Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People","offset":675},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":725},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":741},{"uri":"WiiWare","surface_form":"WiiWare","offset":747},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episodic","offset":764},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3 dimensions","offset":818},{"uri":"2D","surface_form":"2 dimensions","offset":842}]}
