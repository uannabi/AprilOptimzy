He went to the west where the bullet which killed the god was made.\nOn his journey, he met a man called Jikobo. Jikobo told him where the Forest of Shishigami was. Ashitaka decided to go there. On his way to the forest, he met the girl raised by the wolf god, Moro. She was with her family. Ashitaka thought they must know about the forest. He called out to them. She and three big wild wolves disappeared into the forest.\nAshitaka rescues the injured men. They reach the village Tatara, where they live. Eboshi Gozen organized there. People made iron weapons there. She wanted to get the Forest of Shishigami, turn all Gods in the forest out, and make it a men-centered place.\nIt was said that Shishigami had a power of immortality.
