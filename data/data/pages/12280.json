{"id":12280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia","text":"\"Camellia\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae, native to eastern and southern Asia from the Himalaya east to Japan and Indonesia. Scientists are still discussing how many species there are. The number of species varies between 100 and 250. Linnaeus named the genus inhonour of Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel, a Jesuit botanist. amel brought C. japonica from Manila to Spain.\nThey are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2\u201320 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3\u201317 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1\u201312 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5\u20139 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1\u20135 compartments, each containing 1\u20138 seeds.\nThe genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought.\n\"Camellia\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of butterfly species.\nCultivation and uses.\n\"Camellia sinensis\" is very important commercially since tea is made from its leaves. Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of \"Camellia sinensis\" or \"Camellia oleifera\".\nMany other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery below. \"Camellia japonica\" (often simply called Camellia) is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are \"C. reticulata\", with over 400 named cultivars, and \"C. sasanqua\", with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include \"C. \u00D7 hiemalis\" (\"C. japonica\" \u00D7 \"C. sasanqua\") and \"C. \u00D7 williamsii\" (\"C. japonica\" \u00D7 \"C. salouenensis\"). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers.\nCamellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location.\n\"Camellia japonica\" is the state flower of Alabama as well as the city flower of the Chinese municipality Chongqing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":25},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":49},{"uri":"Theaceae","surface_form":"Theaceae","offset":56},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":97},{"uri":"Himalaya","surface_form":"Himalaya","offset":111},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":128},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":138},{"uri":"Carolus_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Linnaeus","offset":259},{"uri":"Georg_Joseph_Kamel","surface_form":"Georg Joseph Kamel","offset":300},{"uri":"Jesuit","surface_form":"Jesuit","offset":322},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":369},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":379},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":395},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":405},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":422},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":450},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":546},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":715},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":792},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":833},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":840},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":873},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":888},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":938},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":981},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":1040},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterfly","offset":1062},{"uri":"Camellia_sinensis","surface_form":"Camellia sinensis","offset":1104},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":1160},{"uri":"Tea_oil","surface_form":"Tea oil","offset":1189},{"uri":"Camellia_oleifera","surface_form":"Camellia oleifera","offset":1288},{"uri":"Cultivar","surface_form":"cultivar","offset":1391},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":1405},{"uri":"Frost","surface_form":"frost","offset":1995},{"uri":"Camellia_japonica","surface_form":"Camellia japonica","offset":2184},{"uri":"List_of_U.S._state_flowers","surface_form":"state flower","offset":2210},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":2226},{"uri":"Municipality_of_China","surface_form":"Chinese municipality","offset":2268},{"uri":"Chongqing","surface_form":"Chongqing","offset":2289}]}
