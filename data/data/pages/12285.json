{"id":12285,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It can be thought of as repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition.\nIn general, given two numbers formula_1 and formula_1, the exponentiation of formula_1 and formula_1 can be written as formula_1, and read as \"formula_1 raised to the power of formula_1\", or \"formula_1 to the formula_1th power\". Other methods of mathematical notation have been used in the past. When the upper index cannot be written, people can write powers using the ^ or ** signs, so that 2^4 or 2**4 means formula_1.\nHere, the number formula_1 is called base, and the number formula_1 is called exponent. For example, in formula_1, 2 is the base and 4 is the exponent.\nTo calculate formula_1, one simply multiply 4 copies of 2. So formula_1, and the result is formula_1. The equation could be read out loud as \"2 raised to the power of 4 equals 16.\"\nIf the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square, because the area of a square is calculated using formula_1. So\nSimilarly, if the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube, because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_1. So\nIf the exponent is equal to -1, then the power is simply the reciprocal of the base. So\nIt is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. In this case, the matrix must be square. For example, formula_1.\nCommutativity.\nBoth addition and multiplication are commutative. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, and 2 \u00B7 3 is the same as 3 \u00B7 2. Although exponentiation is repeated multiplication, it is not commutative. For example, 2\u00B3=8, but 3\u00B2=9.\nInverse Operations.\nAddition has one inverse operation: subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: division.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":82},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":124},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":193},{"uri":"Mathematical_notation","surface_form":"mathematical notation","offset":449},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":1034},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":1044},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":1170},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":1182},{"uri":"Reciprocal","surface_form":"reciprocal","offset":1282},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrices","offset":1355},{"uri":"Commutative_property","surface_form":"commutative","offset":1482}]}
