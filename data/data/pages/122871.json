In a review for \"The Seattle Times\", Mary Brennan talks about the book as \"A sweeping story that provides both a harrowing history lesson and an engagingly human narrative\". \"The Guardian's\" Kate Kellaway said \"An immense achievement, \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" has a ramshackle freedom and exuberant ambition,\" after reading the book. \"The New York Times\" did a review of the book, saying some good and some bad things about the book.\nPolitical importance.\nThe Nigerian Civil War began on July 6, 1967 and lasted until January 15, 1970. The war began because of political struggles caused by the numerous attempts to secede from the southeastern provinces of Nigeria and create the Republic of Biafra. Political conflict between the Igbo\u2019s, Yoruba\u2019s, and the Hausa-Fulani ended up with two military coups. The Igbo tried to leave Nigeria to become the Republic of Biafra, but did not have very much support. From 1968 onward, the war was mostly a tie, with Nigerian forces unable to get an advantage over the Republic of Biafra. Many people died in the war, and even today there is still anger between the different ethnic and religious groups of Nigeria.\nThe story in \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" is centered around the war. The author has stated that many of the issues that caused the war remain today. She also said that the war is very talked about \"in uninformed and unimaginative ways,\" and that the war is as important to the people today as it was in her book. Because none of the major political events were changed in the book, Adichie said that the book had \"emotional truth,\" and that the book showed the war had a large impact on the people of Nigeria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"book","offset":28},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":53},{"uri":"Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie","surface_form":"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie","offset":69},{"uri":"Biafran_War","surface_form":"Biafran War","offset":208},{"uri":"Orange_Prize_for_Fiction","surface_form":"Orange Prize for Fiction","offset":265},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"book","offset":379},{"uri":"Purple_Hibiscus","surface_form":"Purple Hibiscus","offset":444},{"uri":"The_Seattle_Times","surface_form":"The Seattle Times","offset":826},{"uri":"The_Guardian","surface_form":"The Guardian","offset":984},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":1142},{"uri":"Nigerian_Civil_War","surface_form":"Nigerian Civil War","offset":1267},{"uri":"July_6","surface_form":"July 6","offset":1295},{"uri":"1967","surface_form":"1967","offset":1303},{"uri":"January_15","surface_form":"January 15","offset":1325},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":1337},{"uri":"Secede","surface_form":"secede","offset":1423}]}
