{"id":122910,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babusar_Pass","text":"=\"preserve\">Babusar Pass is above sea level. It connects Gilgit with Kaghan via Chilas. Prior to construction of Karakoram highway, this route was very important, because this was the only route leading to Gilgit and Baltistan from Pakistan.\nPresently a road by the name of Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad-Chilas MNJCroad is being constructed through Babusar Pass that will shorten the distance between Mansehra and Chilas by around. Work on the route is expected to conclude sometime in mid 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gilgit","surface_form":"Gilgit","offset":57},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":232},{"uri":"MNJC","surface_form":"MNJC","offset":304},{"uri":"Chilas","surface_form":"Chilas","offset":407}]}
