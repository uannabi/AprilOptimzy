{"id":12308,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport","text":"Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles, made to run on railway tracks. In most countries, this transportation method helps trade and economic growth. Railways (UK) or railroads (North America) provide an energy-efficient way to transport material over land. The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction. Also, the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads.\nRail transport started to be important in the Industrial Revolution. The first railroads were built in England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway_tracks","surface_form":"railway tracks","offset":94},{"uri":"Energy_efficiency","surface_form":"energy-efficient","offset":243},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":397},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":411},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":436},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":546},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":557},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"Industrial Revolution","offset":610}]}
