He was born in Copenhagen and grew up in Aalborg. He is most well known for designing the Sydney Opera House in Australia. He won a contest for designing the Sydney Opera House in 1957. However, he left Australia in 1966 and never returned and saw his completed work. He thought of his design of the Sydney Opera House to be like peeling an orange, as he said putting the shells of the building together would make a perfect sphere. In 2001, he was invited back to restore the building and change it back toward his original designs, but he did not return.\nIn 2003, Utzon won the Pritzker Prize.\nUtzon died of a heart attack in Copenhagen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":62},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":69},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":95},{"uri":"Aalborg","surface_form":"Aalborg","offset":121},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":156},{"uri":"Sydney_Opera_House","surface_form":"Sydney Opera House","offset":170},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":192},{"uri":"Orange_(fruit)","surface_form":"orange","offset":421},{"uri":"Perfect","surface_form":"perfect","offset":497},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":505},{"uri":"Pritzker_Architecture_Prize","surface_form":"Pritzker Prize","offset":660},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":692}]}
