Most of his books are about modern society, the effects of modern science and, later, on mysticism and psychedelic drugs like LSD.\nHuxley is probably best known for his book \"Brave New World\". In the book, which was written in 1932, he writes about a world in the far future, where the whole social hierarchy is based on genetic traits, and not on the personal effort of individual people to learn and improve themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":61},{"uri":"Huxley_family","surface_form":"Huxley family","offset":129},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":165},{"uri":"Mysticism","surface_form":"mysticism","offset":281},{"uri":"Psychedelic_drug","surface_form":"psychedelic drug","offset":295},{"uri":"LSD","surface_form":"LSD","offset":318},{"uri":"Brave_New_World","surface_form":"Brave New World","offset":367},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchy","offset":491}]}
