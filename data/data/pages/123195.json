{"id":123195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsimik_La","text":"Marsimik La, elevation 5,582 metres (18,314 ft), is a high mountain pass in the Chang-Chemno Range in northern Kashmir (India). There is a road over this pass, over which suitably adapted vehicles have been driven, but it is not a motorable pass in the sense that the road is not in good enough condition to permit transit by normal vehicles.\nIf it were motorable, it would be the highest motorable pass in Kashmir, but reports suggest that there are probably higher motorable passes in Tibet.\nLocated 16 km northeast of the northwest tip of Pangong Lake, the pass is on the shortest route from there to the contested Kongka La (Pass) area 42 km farther northeast on the China - Occupied Kashmir line of actual control. Marsimik La is four km west of the sharp 6000 to 6500 meter ridge line forming the line of actual control.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":487},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":671}]}
