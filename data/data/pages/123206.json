{"id":123206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorah_Pass","text":"Dorah Pass, also spelled and pronounced Durah Pass, connects Badakshan in Afghanistan with Chitral in Pakistan. The Dorah Pass is more than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) high. It crosses the Hindu Kush mountains. The pass became important during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan because the Soviets could not stop the flow of arms and men back and forth across the pass. Almost all the Munji-speaking people of Afghanistan fled across the border to Chitral during the War in Afghanistan.\nPamir is a high plateau sometimes called \"The roof of the world\" that joins Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, China and Kashmir. Marco Polo is believed to have crossed the Pamir Mountains on his way to China.\nThe Dorah Pass is one of the four major mountain passes that enter Chitral. The others are the Broghol Pass from the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, Shandur Top from Gilgit, and Lowari Top from Dir in Pakistan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Badakshan","surface_form":"Badakshan","offset":61},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":74},{"uri":"Chitral","surface_form":"Chitral","offset":91},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":102},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"m","offset":159},{"uri":"Hindu_Kush","surface_form":"Hindu Kush","offset":183},{"uri":"Soviet_invasion_of_Afghanistan","surface_form":"Soviet invasion of Afghanistan","offset":242},{"uri":"Pamir","surface_form":"Pamir","offset":482},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":498},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":558},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":568},{"uri":"Tajikistan","surface_form":"Tajikistan","offset":581},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":593},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":603},{"uri":"Marco_Polo","surface_form":"Marco Polo","offset":612},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":685},{"uri":"Broghol_Pass","surface_form":"Broghol Pass","offset":787}]}
