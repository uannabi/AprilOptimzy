{"id":123270,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation","text":"e=\"preserve\">In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit array at the level of its individual bits.\nBitwise operators.\nIn the explanations below, any indication of a bit's position is counted from the right side, moving left. For example, the binary value 0001 (decimal 1) has zeroes at every position but the first (i.e. the rightmost) one.\nXOR.\nA bitwise XOR is an operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of bits. If both bits are 0 the result 0, if one bit is 1 and the other is zero the result is 1, and if both bits are 1 the result is 0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"computer programming","offset":16}]}
