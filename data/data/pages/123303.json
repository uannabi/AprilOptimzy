Since 22 July 2018, the current oldest verified living person is Kane Tanaka.\nJiroemon Kimura (1897\u20132013) is the longest lived documented man at 116 years 54 days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aging","surface_form":"age","offset":51},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":62},{"uri":"Centenarian","surface_form":"centenarian","offset":122},{"uri":"Jeanne_Calment","surface_form":"Jeanne Calment","offset":309},{"uri":"Oldest_people","surface_form":"oldest verified living person","offset":426},{"uri":"Kane_Tanaka","surface_form":"Kane Tanaka","offset":459},{"uri":"Jiroemon_Kimura","surface_form":"Jiroemon Kimura","offset":472}]}
