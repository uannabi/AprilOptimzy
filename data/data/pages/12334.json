{"id":12334,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic","text":"The Central African Republic (CAR) (, or \"Centrafrique\"; Sango \"K\u00F6d\u00F6r\u00F6s\u00EAse\" \"t\u00EE B\u00EAafr\u00EEka\"), is a landlocked country in Central Africa. It is mostly a plateau or high, flat piece of land about 941\u00A0metres above the sea. The CAR covers a land area of about, and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008. Bangui is the capital city.\nThere are thick forests in the south, and these are home to rare gorillas. This part of Africa also has Pygmies.\nOther important towns are Bouar, Zinga, and Ouadda. Its southern border is the Ubangi River. There are 3.8 million people in the C.A.R. Most of them belong to the Banda and Baya tribes. The main language is French but some people speak the national language of Sango.\nThe people mostly grow their own food, but sometimes droughts (long spells without any rain) make this difficult. The C.A.R. also has diamond and uranium mines. It sells these, as well as cotton, coffee, and timber to other countries to make money.\nThe currency used is the CFA Franc - 1 US Dollar is worth 590.3 CFA Francs.\nThe country was ruled by France until 1960 when it became independent.\nThe country has not been very stable since then, with multiple wars with itself, and corruption.\nGeography.\nThe Central African Republic is a landlocked nation. It is bordered by the countries of Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.\nMuch of the Central African Republic is flat, or rolling plateau savanna. It is typically about above sea level. Most of the northern half is in the World Wildlife Fund's East Sudanian savanna ecoregion. In the northeast are the Fertit Hills. There are scattered hills in the southwest part of the country. To the northwest is the Yade Massif, a granite plateau with an altitude of.\nAt, the Central African Republic is the world's 42nd-largest country. It is about the size of the Ukraine, and is somewhat smaller than the US state of Texas.\nMuch of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the Congo River. The Mbomou River in the east merges with the Uele River to form the Ubangi River. In the west, the Sangha River flows through part of the country. The eastern border is along the edge of the Nile River watershed.\nForest covers up to 8% of the land. The densest parts are in the south. The forest is highly diverse. It includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapelli and Sipo. The deforestation rate is 0.4% per year, and lumber poaching is commonplace.\nPrefectures.\nThe Central African Republic is divided into 14 administrative prefectures. There are also 2 economic prefectures and one autonomous commune. The prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures.\nThe two economic prefectures are Nana-Gr\u00E9bizi and Sangha-Mba\u00E9r\u00E9. The commune is Bangui.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sango","surface_form":"Sango","offset":57},{"uri":"Landlocked","surface_form":"landlocked","offset":97},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Central Africa","offset":119},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":150},{"uri":"Bangui","surface_form":"Bangui","offset":320},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":334},{"uri":"Gorilla","surface_form":"gorilla","offset":413},{"uri":"Pygmies","surface_form":"Pygmies","offset":452},{"uri":"Bouar","surface_form":"Bouar","offset":487},{"uri":"Zinga","surface_form":"Zinga","offset":494},{"uri":"Ouadda","surface_form":"Ouadda","offset":505},{"uri":"Ubangi_River","surface_form":"Ubangi River","offset":540},{"uri":"Banda_people","surface_form":"Banda","offset":624},{"uri":"Baya","surface_form":"Baya","offset":634},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":668},{"uri":"Sango_language","surface_form":"Sango","offset":722},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":863},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"uranium","offset":875},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":917},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":925},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1079},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"wars with itself","offset":1188},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":1210},{"uri":"Landlocked","surface_form":"landlocked","offset":1267},{"uri":"Cameroon","surface_form":"Cameroon","offset":1321},{"uri":"Chad","surface_form":"Chad","offset":1331},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":1337},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"South Sudan","offset":1344},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":1361},{"uri":"Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Republic of the Congo","offset":1402},{"uri":"Savanna","surface_form":"savanna","offset":1490},{"uri":"World_Wildlife_Fund","surface_form":"World Wildlife Fund","offset":1574},{"uri":"Ecoregion","surface_form":"ecoregion","offset":1618},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":1771},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":1906},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":1960},{"uri":"Congo_River","surface_form":"Congo River","offset":2027},{"uri":"Mbomou_River","surface_form":"Mbomou River","offset":2044},{"uri":"Uele_River","surface_form":"Uele River","offset":2085},{"uri":"Ubangi_River","surface_form":"Ubangi River","offset":2108},{"uri":"Sangha_River","surface_form":"Sangha River","offset":2139},{"uri":"Nile_River","surface_form":"Nile River","offset":2231},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"watershed","offset":2242},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":2390},{"uri":"Ayous","surface_form":"Ayous","offset":2401},{"uri":"Sapele","surface_form":"Sapelli","offset":2408},{"uri":"Sipo_(timber)","surface_form":"Sipo","offset":2420},{"uri":"Poach","surface_form":"poach","offset":2478},{"uri":"Prefecture","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":2579},{"uri":"Autonomous","surface_form":"autonomous","offset":2638},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":2649},{"uri":"Nana-Gr%C3%A9bizi","surface_form":"Nana-Gr\u00E9bizi","offset":2752},{"uri":"Sangha-Mba%C3%A9r%C3%A9","surface_form":"Sangha-Mba\u00E9r\u00E9","offset":2769},{"uri":"Bangui","surface_form":"Bangui","offset":2799}]}
