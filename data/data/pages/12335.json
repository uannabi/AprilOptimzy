{"id":12335,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-nam","text":"Kim Jong-nam (May 10, 1971 - February 13, 2017) was the eldest son of Kim Jong-il, the former leader of North Korea.\nHe tried to enter Japan using a fake passport in May 2001. This was to visit Disneyland. This caused his father to not approve of him. Kim Jong-nam's younger half-brother Kim Jong-un was made the heir in September 2010.\nIn June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the \"Associated Press\" in Macau. He told the reporter that he had \"no plans\" to defect to Europe. The press had recently said this. Kim Jong-nam lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau's Coloane Island until 2007. An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for \"months\", and now goes between China and \"another country.\"\nWhen his father died, Kim Jong-nam did not attend the funeral. This was to avoid rumours on the succession.\nHe died on February 13, 2017 at 45 years old. He was killed in Malaysia.\nPersonal life.\nThe South Korean newspaper \"The Chosun Ilbo\" said that Kim Jong-nam has two wives, at least one mistress, and several children. His first wife Shin Jong-hui (born c. 1980) and their son Kum-sol (born c. 1996) live at a home called Dragon Villa on the northern outskirts of Beijing. His second wife Lee Hye-kyong (born c. 1970), their son Han-sol (born c. 1995) and their daughter Sol-hui (born c. 1998) live in an apartment building in Macau. Jong-nam's mistress, former Air Koryo flight attendant So Yong-la (born c. 1980), also lives in Macau.\nJong-nam is often given attention by the media for his gambling and extravagant spending.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":42},{"uri":"Kim_Jong-il","surface_form":"Kim Jong-il","offset":70},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":104},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":135},{"uri":"Passport","surface_form":"passport","offset":154},{"uri":"Tokyo_Disneyland","surface_form":"Disneyland","offset":194},{"uri":"Kim_Jong-un","surface_form":"Kim Jong-un","offset":288},{"uri":"Heir","surface_form":"heir","offset":313},{"uri":"Associated_Press","surface_form":"Associated Press","offset":395},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":416},{"uri":"Defect","surface_form":"defect","offset":470},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":480},{"uri":"Coloane_Island","surface_form":"Coloane Island","offset":588},{"uri":"Succession","surface_form":"succession","offset":872},{"uri":"2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":908},{"uri":"The_Chosun_Ilbo","surface_form":"The Chosun Ilbo","offset":1000},{"uri":"Polygamy","surface_form":"two wives","offset":1044},{"uri":"Mistress_(lover)","surface_form":"mistress","offset":1068},{"uri":"Circa","surface_form":"c.","offset":1135},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":1245},{"uri":"Apartment_building","surface_form":"apartment building","offset":1386},{"uri":"Air_Koryo","surface_form":"Air Koryo","offset":1443},{"uri":"Flight_attendant","surface_form":"flight attendant","offset":1453},{"uri":"Extravagant","surface_form":"extravagant","offset":1586}]}
