To the north is Morocco, to the east is Algeria, to the south is Mauritania, and to the west is the Atlantic Ocean. Its surface is. It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world. Most of the territory is made of desert flatlands. The largest city is La\u00E2youne. More than half the population live there. The territory has a population estimated at just more than 500,000.\nWestern Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since the 1960s when it was a Spanish colony. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front independence movement, with its Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) government, both want control of the territory.\nSince 1975, most of the territory has been controlled by Morocco. In 1973, the local people, the Sahrawis, said the Moroccans and Mauritanians were occupying their land and started a movement. The movement turned violent, and the United Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1991. Many Sahrawis became refugees in Algeria. The rest of Western Sahara is controlled by the Polisario/SADR, backed by Algeria. Many important countries have pressed both parties to agree to a peaceful solution. Both Morocco and Polisario have tried to get recognition from other countries. Polisario has won formal recognition for SADR from 81 states, and was extended membership in the African Union, while Morocco has won recognition for its position from the Arab League. In both instances, recognitions have over the past two decades been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends.\nSome countries say that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic should be the government in Western Sahara. Morocco says that they own it. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was made by the \"Polisario Front\" a group of people who wanted Spain to leave, but now want Morocco to leave also.\nThe United Nations calls all of the Western Sahara a dependency of Spain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Amazigh","offset":41},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":87},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":102},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":111},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":127},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":135},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":151},{"uri":"Mauritania","surface_form":"Mauritania","offset":160},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":183},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":195},{"uri":"List_of_countries_by_population_density","surface_form":"most sparsely populated territories in the world","offset":244},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":327},{"uri":"La%C3%A2youne","surface_form":"La\u00E2youne","offset":365},{"uri":"United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories","surface_form":"United Nations list of non-self-governing territories","offset":516},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":631},{"uri":"Polisario_Front","surface_form":"Polisario Front","offset":647},{"uri":"Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic","offset":695},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":1174},{"uri":"African_Union","surface_form":"African Union","offset":1443},{"uri":"Arab_League","surface_form":"Arab League","offset":1518},{"uri":"Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic","offset":1694},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1741},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1958},{"uri":"Dependent_territory","surface_form":"dependency","offset":2007},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":2021}]}
