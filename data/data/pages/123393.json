{"id":123393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose","text":"The White Rose was a German group that opposed the Nazis in World War II. They distributed pamphlets denouncing Adolf Hitler's regime from June 1942 until February 1943. The group consisted of students from the University of Munich along with a professor.\nThe members of the White Rose were caught due to an informant in 1943. They were then executed by the Nazi government. However, the Allied powers acquired one of their pamphlets. The pamphlet was copied and dropped over Germany by bombers, spreading the message of resistance. After World War II, Germany looked back on the White Rose as heroes who saw the crimes of the Nazis better than most.\nMembers.\nThe core of the White Rose was comprised of five students: Sophie Scholl, her brother Hans Scholl, Alex Schmorell, Willi Graf, and Christoph Probst. All were slightly older than twenty years. Other members of the White Rose were Hans' and Sophie's sister Inge Scholl and professor of philosophy, Kurt Huber.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":51},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":60},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":112},{"uri":"University_of_Munich","surface_form":"University of Munich","offset":211},{"uri":"Allied_powers","surface_form":"Allied powers","offset":388},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":476},{"uri":"Sophie_Scholl","surface_form":"Sophie Scholl","offset":719},{"uri":"Hans_Scholl","surface_form":"Hans Scholl","offset":746},{"uri":"Alex_Schmorell","surface_form":"Alex Schmorell","offset":759},{"uri":"Willi_Graf","surface_form":"Willi Graf","offset":775},{"uri":"Christoph_Probst","surface_form":"Christoph Probst","offset":791},{"uri":"Inge_Scholl","surface_form":"Inge Scholl","offset":915},{"uri":"Kurt_Huber","surface_form":"Kurt Huber","offset":956}]}
