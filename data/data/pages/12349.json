{"id":12349,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure","text":"The Cure are a British rock band. They formed in Salford, Manchester, England in 1975.\nHistory.\nThe Cure began in 1976 as 'Easy Cure'. It was formed by Robert Smith (vocals, guitar) together with schoolmates Michael Dempsey (bass), Lol Tolhurst (drums), and local guitarist Porl Thompson.\nThey began writing and demoing their own songs almost immediately, playing throughout 1977 in Southern England to an ever growing army of fans. In 1978 the 'Easy' was dropped, along with Porl, and an eager trio now known simply as The Cure were quickly signed to Chris Parry's new Fiction label.\nFirst album.\nIn August 1978 their debut album \"Three Imaginary Boys\" was released to great acclaim, and as the band toured extensively around the UK, the singles \u201CBoys Don't Cry\u201D and \u201CJumping Someone Else's Train\u201D were released. Michael left the band at the end of the year, and Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) joined. In early 1979 the 4-piece Cure embarked on an exploration of the darker side of Robert's songwriting, and emerged with the minimalist classic Seventeen Seconds, along with their first real 'hit single' \u201CA Forest.\u201D\nResults and second album.\nAfter an intense world tour Matthieu left the group, and in early 1980 the trio recorded an album of mournful atmospheric soundscapes entitled \"Faith\", which included another successful single in \u201CPrimary.\u201D\nThird album.\nThe band then set out on a second trip around the world, named \u201CThe Picture Tour,\u201D and they put out the single \u201CCharlotte Sometimes.\u201D In 1982 The Cure went back into the studio to record the album \u201CPornography\u201D which had a dark mood. The trip was difficult for the band members, and the single \u201CThe Hanging Garden\u201D came out just as Simon left the band.\nFirst dance single.\nRobert Smith and Lol Tolhurst were now the only band members. To feel better, the band chose to change the dark mood of the band into a more fun \u201Cpop\u201D mood. So they recorded a dance single called \u201CLet's Go To Bed,\u201D and became good friends with the song's film-clip director, Tim Pope. The band continued into 1983 with two more fun singles: \u201CThe Walk\u201D and \u201CThe Lovecats.\u201D\nFourth album.\nIn 1984 \"The Top\" was released, a strange hallucinogenic mix, which contained the infectiously psychedelic single \u201CThe Caterpillar.\u201D\nExpansion of the band.\nThe world \u2018Top Tour\u2019 saw the band expand to a 5-piece, with the addition of Andy Anderson (drums) and Phil Thornalley (bass), and the return of Porl Thompson (guitar).\nThe new Cure sound was captured live for the album \"Concert\". Andy and Phil left soon after the end of the tour, and were replaced by Boris Williams (drums) and further returnee Simon Gallup (bass). This new incarnation started work on 1985's The Head On The Door with a very real sense of 'something happening'... The vibrant hit single \u201CInbetween Days\u201D was followed up by \u201CClose To Me,\u201D and the ensuing world tour paved the way for the massive success of the singles collection \"Standing On A Beach\" in 1986. That summer saw the band headline the Glastonbury Festival for the first time, and a year of extensive gigs and festivals was crowned by Tim Pope's live concert film The Cure In Orange.\nFirst double album.\nIn 1987 The Cure brought out \"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\", an immense double album of extreme and extraordinary stylistic range, and with the arrival of Roger O'Donnell on keyboards the 6-piece Cure traveled the world with the 'Kissing Tour', enjoying four more hit singles along the way. The wonderfully atmospheric \"Disintegration\" was demoed in 1988 and released in 1989, and despite being a work of powerful brooding grandeur, it too gave rise to four hit singles. The 'Prayer Tour' followed, with the band back down to a five-piece following the departure of Lol Tolhurst. It was captured live for the album \"Entreat\".\nReplacing Roger O'Donnell.\nIn early 1990 Roger O'Donnell left the group, and was replaced by long-time band friend Perry Bamonte, just in time for a series of headlining European festival shows that included the band's second Glastonbury headline slot. The album \"Mixed Up\" was released, supported by the re-mixed singles \u201CNever Enough,\u201D \u201CClose To Me\u201D and \u201CA Forest,\u201D and in 1991 The Cure at last won some long overdue \u201Chome\u201D recognition with a Brit Award for \u201CBest British Group.\u201D\nSixth album.\nIn 1992 they recorded \"Wish\", a richly diverse multi-faceted guitar driven album hailed by some as their best work to date. It spawned 3 fabulous hit singles, and the glorious \u2018Wish Tour' that followed was a worldwide sell out. The sheer power of the shows inspired the release of two live works in 1993, Paris and Show. Immediately after the tour ended, guitarist Porl Thompson left the band again (this time with a smile!), and The Cure headlined the XFM 'Great Xpectations Show' in London's Finsbury Park as a 4-piece. The band also contributed \u201DBurn\u201D to the film \u201CThe Crow\u201D and covered \u201CPurple Haze\u201D for the Hendrix tribute album 'Stone Free'.\nSeventh album.\nIn 1994 Boris Williams decided to move on, and in early 1995 Jason Cooper took up residency behind the drum kit, with Roger O'Donnell rejoining once more on keyboards. Work on the next album was interspersed with recording \u201CDredd Song\u201D for the film \u201CJudge Dredd,\u201D a cover of Bowie's \u201CYoung Americans\u201D for an XFM album, and headlining several major European festivals, including the 25th Glastonbury. \"Wild Mood Swings\" was released in 1996, and went straight into almost every top ten around the world. The Cure hit the road once more with 'The Swing Tour', their longest to date, and released 4 more singles.\nEighth album.\nGalore, the follow up singles and video compilation to\" Standing On A Beach\", was released in 1997, after which work took place in 1998 on a variety of projects, including \u201CMore than This\u201D for the \u201CX Files\u201D album, and a memorable appearance by Robert in \u201CSouth Park\u201D In 1999 the band completed the recording and mixing of what many regard as their best studio album so far, the Grammy Nominated\" Bloodflowers\". With its release in 2000 the band set off on the massive world-wide 'Dreamtour' - playing to more than a million people in 9 months.\nNinth album.\n2001 saw the long-awaited release of the Cure's \u201CGreatest Hits\u201D album, which featured all the band's biggest selling singles along with 2 new songs, the elegiac \u201CCut Here\u201D and the ebullient \u201CJust Say Yes,\u201D a duet with Saffron. This year also saw the end of the group's relationship with Fiction Records, the label they had been instrumental in starting 23 years before.\nFestivals in Europe.\nIn 2002 the band spent the summer headlining a number of European festivals before going into rehearsals for two very special nights in November at the Tempodrom Berlin, where they performed all the tracks from \"Pornography, Disintegration\" and \"Bloodflowers\" plus encores. Both performances were shot in Hi-Def video on 12 cameras, and Trilogy DVD was released in 2003 as another chapter of The Cure story opened, the band signing a 3 album global deal with the Geffen label.\nTenth album.\n2004 saw the release of 'Join the Dots', a 4cd Boxset of all the B-sides and Rarities, followed by the widely acclaimed new album \u2018The Cure\u2019, and another hugely successful world tour.\nIn 2005 Perry Bamonte and Roger O\u2019Donnell left the band and Porl Thompson joined for a third time. The quartet\u2019s debut show was headlining Live 8 Paris, followed by a number of other summer European Festivals. The first 4 Cure albums (Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography) were re-released, with Robert providing 'rarities' for Deluxe Edition extras CD's, as part of an ongoing campaign to remaster and re-issue all the Cure albums. Immediately after closing a week of Teenage Cancer Trust Shows at the Royal Albert Hall in April 2006, the band started recording their 13th studio album.\nEleventh album.\nIn August 2006, the second set of re-releases (\"The Top, The Head On The Door, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\") was released, each album as a 2CD Deluxe Edition, along with 1983\u2019s Glove album Blue Sunshine, while in the studio The Cure passed the 30 new songs mark. In November \u2018Festival 2005\u2019, a 155\u00A0minute 5.1 DVD comprising a 30 song selection of live performances captured the previous summer by a mix of fans, crew and \u2018on-the-night-big-screen cameras\u2019, was released.\nThirteenth album.\nIn 2006 The Cure started writing and recording 4:13 Dream. It was released in 2008. It was going to be a double album but featured 13 songs.\nPresent.\nIn 2013 the band started The Great Circle Tour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":15},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":23},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":28},{"uri":"Salford","surface_form":"Salford","offset":49},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":58},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":70},{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":81},{"uri":"1976","surface_form":"1976","offset":114},{"uri":"Robert_Smith","surface_form":"Robert Smith","offset":152},{"uri":"Vocal","surface_form":"vocal","offset":166},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":174},{"uri":"Michael_Dempsey","surface_form":"Michael Dempsey","offset":208},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":225},{"uri":"Drums","surface_form":"drums","offset":246},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":264},{"uri":"Southern_England","surface_form":"Southern England","offset":383},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":731},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"\u201Cpop\u201D","offset":1903},{"uri":"Tim_Pope","surface_form":"Tim Pope","offset":2033},{"uri":"Saffron_(singer)","surface_form":"Saffron","offset":6363}]}
