{"id":123512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley","text":"Tornado Alley is a colloquial term most often used to refer to the area of the United States in which tornadoes happen more than in any other part of the country. The 1974 super tornado outbreak with 148 tornadoes, took place in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\nStates such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio are sometimes included in Tornado Alley. Research suggests that tornadoes are happening more often in the northern parts of Tornado Alley where it reaches the Canadian prairies.\nTornado alley geographical area.\nOver the years, the location(s) of Tornado Alley have not been clearly defined. No definition of tornado alley has ever been officially chosen by the National Weather Service (NWS). Thus, differences in the place are because of the different criteria used.\nThe National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) FAQ says that \"Tornado Alley\" is a term used by the media as a reference to areas that have mroe tornadoes. A study of 1921\u20131995 tornadoes concluded almost one-fourth of all significant tornadoes happen in this area.\nNo state has no tornadoes; however, they happen more often in the Central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains.\nAnother criterion for the location of Tornado Alley (or Tornado Alleys) can be where the strongest tornadoes happen more often.\nOrigin of the term.\nThe term \"tornado alley\" was first used in 1952 by U.S. Air Force meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush (1915\u20131982) and Captain Robert C. Miller (1920\u20131998). They used it as the title of a research project to study severe weather in parts of Texas and Oklahoma.\nHow many tornadoes.\nThe average tornado stays on ground for only 5 minutes. These figures, reported by the National Climatic Data Center for the period between 1991 and 2010, show the seventeen U.S. states with the most average number of tornadoes per per year.\nCanadian tornadoes.\nAbout half of all Canadian tornadoes hit the Canadian prairies and Northern Ontario as far east as Lake Superior. Together, these areas make up the northernmost border of the U.S. Tornado Alley. Tornadoes up to EF5 in strength have been found in this region.\nSchools in Tornado Alley often have tornado drills, and many homes may have tornado shelters where people can go for safety.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colloquial","surface_form":"colloquial","offset":19},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":79},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":102},{"uri":"Tornado_outbreak","surface_form":"tornado outbreak","offset":178},{"uri":"Georgia_(US_State)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":229},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":238},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":248},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":257},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":267},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":277},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":290},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":306},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":312},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":328},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":339},{"uri":"West_Virginia","surface_form":"West Virginia","offset":353},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":383},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":394},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":405},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":415},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":428},{"uri":"Canadian_prairies","surface_form":"Canadian prairies","offset":592},{"uri":"National_Weather_Service","surface_form":"National Weather Service","offset":794},{"uri":"National_Severe_Storms_Laboratory","surface_form":"National Severe Storms Laboratory","offset":905},{"uri":"Central_United_States","surface_form":"Central United States","offset":1229},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":1264},{"uri":"Appalachian_Mountains","surface_form":"Appalachian Mountains","offset":1284},{"uri":"Robert_C._Miller","surface_form":"Robert C.
