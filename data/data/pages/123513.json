{"id":123513,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistletoe","text":"\"Mistletoe\" is the common name for a group of semi-parasitic plants in the order Santalales. They grow attached to and inside the branches of a tree or shrub.\nSpecies.\nThe name was first given to \"Viscum album\" (European mistletoe, Santalaceae), the only species native in Great Britain and much of Europe. Later the name was given to other related species, including \"Phoradendron serotinum\" (the eastern mistletoe of eastern North America, also Santalaceae).\nThe largest family of mistletoes, Loranthaceae, has 73 genera and over 900 species.\nIn culture and myths.\nEuropean mistletoe played a large role in Greek mythology, and is believed to be The Golden Bough of Aeneas, ancestor of the Romans. The Norse god Baldr was killed with mistletoe.\nIn Romanian traditions, mistletoe (\"v\u00E2sc\" in Romanian) is considered a source of good fortune.\nWilliam Shakespeare mentions it in \"Titus Andronicus\", Act II, Scene I: \"Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe\".\nMistletoe is often used as a Christmas decoration. \"Viscum album\" is used in Europe and \"Phoradendron serotinum\" is used in North America. According to custom, the mistletoe must not touch the ground between its cutting and its removal as the last of Christmas greens at Candlemas; it may remain hanging through the year, often to preserve the house from lightning or fire, until it was replaced the following Christmas Eve.\nMistletoe (\"Phoradendron flavescens\") is the state floral emblem for the State of Oklahoma.\nKissing under mistletoe at Christmas.\nAccording to a custom during Christmas, any two people who meet under a hanging of mistletoe are urged to kiss. The custom started in Scandinavia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":51},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":61},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":75},{"uri":"Santalales","surface_form":"Santalales","offset":81},{"uri":"Viscum_album","surface_form":"Viscum album","offset":197},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":273},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":299},{"uri":"Phoradendron","surface_form":"Phoradendron serotinum","offset":369},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":427},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":609},{"uri":"The_Golden_Bough","surface_form":"The Golden Bough","offset":648},{"uri":"Aeneas","surface_form":"Aeneas","offset":668},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":692},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse god","offset":704},{"uri":"Baldr","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":714},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":792},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":842},{"uri":"Titus_Andronicus","surface_form":"Titus Andronicus","offset":878},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":987},{"uri":"Beauty","surface_form":"decoration","offset":997},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1035},{"uri":"Phoradendron","surface_form":"Phoradendron","offset":1047},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1082},{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":1110},{"uri":"Candlemas","surface_form":"Candlemas","offset":1229},{"uri":"Preserve","surface_form":"preserve","offset":1289},{"uri":"Phoradendron","surface_form":"Phoradendron","offset":1395},{"uri":"Floral_emblem","surface_form":"floral emblem","offset":1434},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":1465},{"uri":"Kiss","surface_form":"kiss","offset":1619},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":1647}]}
