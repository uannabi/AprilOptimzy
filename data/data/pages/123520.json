{"id":123520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gambon","text":"Sir Michael John Gambon, CBE (born 19 October 1940), is an acclaimed Irish-born English actor with a career that spans nearly five decades and includes a variety of roles in theater, television and movie.\nEarly life.\nGambon was born in Dublin during World War II. His father, Edward Gambon, was an engineer and his mother, Mary (n\u00E9e Hoare), was a seamstress. His father decided to seek work in the rebuilding of London, and so the family moved to Mornington Crescent in north London, when Gambon was five. His father had him made a British citizen \u2014 a decision that would later allow Michael to receive an actual, rather than honorary, knighthood and CBE. (although, under the British Nationality Act 1981 anyone born in Ireland before 1949 can still register as a British subject and, after five years' UK residence, as a British citizen).\nRaised a strict Catholic, he attended St Aloysius Boys' School in Somers Town and served at the altar. He then moved to St Aloysius' College in Hornsey Lane, Highgate, London, whose former pupils included Peter Sellers. He later attended a school in Kent, before leaving with no qualifications at fifteen. He then gained an apprenticeship with Vickers Armstrong as a toolmaker. By the time he was 21 he was a fully qualified engineer. He kept the job for a further year \u2013 acquiring a fascination and passion for collecting antique guns, clocks and watches, as well as classic cars.\nEarly acting career.\nAged 19 he joined the Unity Theatre in Kings Cross. Five years later he wrote a letter to Michael MacLiammoir, the Irish theatre impresario who ran Dublin's Gate Theatre. It was accompanied by a CV describing a rich and wholly imaginary theatre career \u2013 and he was taken on.\nGambon made his professional stage d\u00E9but in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin's 1962 production of \"Othello\", playing \"Second Gentleman\", followed by a European tour. A year later, cheekily auditioning with the opening soliloquy from Richard III, he caught the eye of star-maker Laurence Olivier who was recruiting promising spear-carriers for his new National Theatre Company. Gambon, along with Robert Stephens, Derek Jacobi and Frank Finlay, was hired as one of the \u2018to be renowned\u2019 and played any number of small roles. The company initially performed at the Old Vic, their first production being \"Hamlet\", directed by Olivier and starring Peter O'Toole. He played for four years in many NT productions, including named roles in \"The Recruiting Officer\" and \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\", working with directors William Gaskill and John Dexter.\nWork in the theatre.\nAfter three years at the Old Vic, Olivier advised Gambon to gain experience in provincial rep. In 1967, he left the NT for the Birmingham Repertory Company which was to give him his first crack at the title roles in \"Othello\" (his favourite), \"Macbeth\" and \"Coriolanus\".\nHis rise to stardom began in 1974 when Eric Thompson cast him as the melancholy vet in Alan Ayckbourn's \"The Norman Conquests\" at Greenwich. A speedy transfer to the West End established him as a brilliant comic actor, squatting at a crowded dining table on a tiny chair and sublimely agonising over a choice between black or white coffee.\nBack at the National, now on the South Bank, his next turning point was Peter Hall's premiere staging of Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal\", an unexpectedly subtle performance \u2014 a production photograph shows him embracing Penelope Wilton with sensitive hands and long slim fingers (the touch of a master clock-maker). He is also one of the few actors to have mastered the harsh demands of the vast Olivier Theatre. As Simon Callow once said: \u201CGambon's \u2018iron lungs and overwhelming charisma are able to command a sort of operatic full-throatedness which triumphs over hard walls and long distances.\u201D\nThis was to serve him in good stead in John Dexter's masterly staging of \"The Life of Galileo\" in 1980, the first Brecht to become a popular success. Hall called him \u2018unsentimental, dangerous and immensely powerful\u2019, even the Sunday Times\u2019 curmudgeonly critic of the day called his performance \u2018a decisive step in the direction of great tragedy...great acting\u2019, while fellow actors paid him the rare compliment of applauding him in the dressing room on the first night.\nFrom the first Ralph Richardson dubbed him The Great Gambon, an accolade which stuck, outshining his 1990 CBE, even the later knighthood, although Gambon dismisses it as a circus slogan. But as Sheridan Morley perceptively remarked in 2000, when reviewing \"Cressida\": \u2018Gambon's eccentricity on stage now begins to rival that of his great mentor Richardson\u2019. Also like Richardson, interviews are rarely given and raise more questions than they answer. Gambon is a very private person, a \u2018non-starry star\u2019 as Ayckbourn called him. Off-stage he prefers to back out of the limelight, an unpretentious guy sharing laughs with his fellow cast and crew.\nWhile he has won screen acclaim, no-one who saw his ravaged \"King Lear\" at Stratford, while still in his early forties, will forget his superb double act with a red-nosed Antony Sher as the Fool sitting on his master's knee like a ventriloquist's doll. There were also notable appearances in \"Old Times\" at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, and as \"Volpone\" and the brutal sergeant in Pinter's \"Mountain Language\".\nDavid Hare's \"Skylight\", with Lia Williams, which opened to rave reviews at the National in 1995, transferred first to Wyndhams Theatre and then on to Broadway for a four-month run which left him in a state of advanced exhaustion. \u201C\"Skylight\" was ten times as hard to play as anything I\u2019ve ever done\u201D he told Michael Owen in the Evening Standard. \u201CI had a great time in New York but couldn\u2019t wait to get back\u201D.\nGambon is almost the only leading actor not to grace Yasmina Reza's \"ART\" at Wyndham's. But together with Simon Russell Beale and Alan Bates he gave a deliciously droll radio account of the role of Marc. And for the RSC he shared Reza's two-hander \"The Unexpected Man\" with Eileen Atkins, first at The Pit in the Barbican and then at the Duchess Theatre, a production also intended for New York but finally delayed by other commitments.\nIn 2001 he played what he described as \u201Ca physically repulsive\u2019\u2019 Davies in Patrick Marber's revival of Pinter's \"The Caretaker\", but he found the rehearsal period an unhappy experience, and felt that he had let down the author. A year later, playing opposite Daniel Craig, he portrayed the father of a series of cloned sons in Caryl Churchill's \"A Number\" at the Royal Court, notable for a recumbent moment when he smoked a cigarette, the brightly lit spiral of smoke rising against a black backdrop, an effect which he dreamed up during rehearsals.\nIn 2004 he finally achieved a life-long ambition to play Sir John Falstaff, in Nicholas Hytner's National Theatre production of \"Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2\", co-starring with Matthew Macfadyen as Prince Hal.\nScreen success and acceptance.\nHe made his movie debut in the Laurence Olivier \"Othello\" in 1965. He then played romantic leads, notably in the early 1970s BBC television series, \"The Borderers\", in which he was swashbuckling Gavin Ker. As a result, Gambon was asked by James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli to audition for the role in 1970, to replace George Lazenby. His craggy looks soon made him into a character actor, although he won critical acclaim as Galileo in John Dexter's production of \"The Life of Galileo\" by Brecht at the National Theatre in 1980. But it was not until Dennis Potter's \"The Singing Detective\" (1986) that he became a household name. After this success, for which he won a BAFTA, his work includes movies such as \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\" which also starred Helen Mirren.\nIn 1992 he played a psychotic general in the Barry Levinson movie \"Toys\" and he also starred as Georges Simenon's detective Inspector Jules Maigret in an ITV adaptation of Simenon's series of books. He starred as Fyodor Dostoevsky in the Hungarian director K\u00E1roly Makk's movie \"The Gambler\" (1997) about the writing of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novella \"The Gambler\".\nRecent career.\nIn recent years, movies such as \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" (1998) and \"Plunkett & Macleane\" (1998), as well as television appearances in series such as \"Wives and Daughters\" (1999) (for which he won another BAFTA), a made-for-TV adaptation of Samuel Beckett's \"Endgame\" (2001) and \"Perfect Strangers\" (2001) have revealed a talent for comedy. In 2004, he appeared in five movies, including Wes Anderson's quirky comedy \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\"; the British gangster flick \"Layer Cake\"; theatrical drama \"Being Julia\"; and CGI action fantasy \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\".\nPerhaps his most significant role in 2004, however, was Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' headmaster in the third installment of J. K. Rowling's franchise, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", taking over from fellow Irish actor Richard Harris, who had died of Hodgkins disease. (Harris had also played Maigret on television four years before Gambon took that role.) Gambon reprised the role of Albus Dumbledore in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", which was released in November 2005 in the UK and U.S. He returned to the role again in the fifth movie, \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", which was released in 2007. He will once again return to portray Dumbledore in movie the sixth \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\". Gambon admits not having read the \"Harry Potter\" novels and says that this is because he does not want to be upset by an extremely large change or death in the books. Similarly, he has also stated in an interview that, when playing Dumbledore, \"I don't have to play anyone really. I just stick on a beard and play me, so it's no great feat. I never ease into a role \u2013 every part I play is just a variant of my own personality. I\u2019m not really a character actor at all...\"\nIn an Ironic twist, Gambon also played a British spy in \"The Good Shepherd\" (2006). His codename was \"The headmaster\".\nMost recently, he was Joe in Beckett's \"Eh Joe\", giving two performances a night at the Duke of York's Theatre in London. He currently does the voice over to the new Guinness ads with the penguins. In 2007 he played major roles in Stephen Poliakoff's \"Joe's Palace\", and the five-part adaptation of Mrs Gaskell's \"Cranford\" novels, both for BBC TV.\nPersonal life.\nGambon married Anne Miller when he was 22, but has always been secretive about his personal life. The couple live together in a country house in Kent. Gambon was invested by Prince Charles as a Knight Bachelor on 17 July 1998 for services to drama (Queen Elizabeth II's approval for the award was notified in the 1998 New Year Honours List) and his wife thus became Lady Gambon. The couple have a son, Fergus, who appears as an expert on the BBC's \"Antiques Roadshow\".\nGambon is a qualified amateur pilot, and his love of cars led to his appearance on the BBC's \"Top Gear\" programme. Gambon raced the Suzuki Liana and was driving so aggressively that it was launched into the air on the last corner of his timed lap. The final corner of the Dunsfold Park track has been named \"Gambon\" in his honour. He reappeared on the programme on the 4 June 2006, and set a time in the Chevrolet Lacetti of 1:50.3, a significant improvement on his previous time of 1:55. He clipped his namesake corner the second time, and when asked why by Jeremy Clarkson, replied that 'I dunno - I just do not like it'.\nIn February 2015 Gambon spoke for the first time of the \"frightening memory loss\" that had forced him to retire from the stage after 50 years. He said he has taken the \"heartbreaking\" decision to stop after finding he could no longer remember his lines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["actor"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"CBE","offset":25},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":69},{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"theater","offset":174},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":183},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":198},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":236},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World
