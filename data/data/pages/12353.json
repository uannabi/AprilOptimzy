{"id":12353,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival","text":"Creedence Clearwater Revival (often made shorter as CCR or Creedence) was an American rock band from California, United States. They were popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. CCR was inducted into (became part of) the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\nMany people thought they were from the Southeastern United States because the group's music sounded like the country, folk, and blues music of that place. They liked to sing about bayous, the Mississippi River, catfish, and other things people in the south liked. They also used instruments and styles that were common in the southeast.\nThe members of the group were John Fogerty (born 1945), his brother Tom Fogerty (1941-1990), Doug Clifford (born 1945), and Stu Cook (born 1945).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"made shorter","offset":36},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":77},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock","offset":86},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":91},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":101},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":113},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popular","offset":138},{"uri":"Induction","surface_form":"inducted","offset":253},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame","offset":288},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":376},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country","offset":433},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk","offset":442},{"uri":"Blues_music","surface_form":"blues music","offset":452},{"uri":"Bayou","surface_form":"bayou","offset":504},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":516},{"uri":"Catfish","surface_form":"catfish","offset":535},{"uri":"John_Fogerty","surface_form":"John Fogerty","offset":691}]}
