{"id":123632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Classification_Board","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Australian Classification Board is a government agency in Australia that controls censorship and classifications. It rates video games, movies, and publications. It was originally created in 1970 as the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). The name was changed in 2006.\nRefused Classification means that the Classification Board has banned the item from being released in Australia. Any movie or video game under this rating can not be shown in Australia. RC would be the strongest rating by the Australian Classification Board.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government_agency","surface_form":"government agency","offset":54},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":75},{"uri":"Censorship","surface_form":"censorship","offset":99},{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":114},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":140},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":153},{"uri":"Publication","surface_form":"publication","offset":165},{"uri":"Ban","surface_form":"banned","offset":366}]}
