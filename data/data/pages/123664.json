It separates Ladakh from the valleys of Kashmir and the Chenab River.\nIn other words it serves as a boundary line between Ladakh region of Kashmir and the remaining two regions of the state i.e. Jammu region and Vale of Kashmir. 23000 feet high peak Nunkun is within this range. Marbal Pass and many other passes which connect Ladakh with Kashmir are in this area, 13000 feet high Zojila Pass is in the extreme northwest of Zanskar range. This range, in fact is a branch of the great Himalayan range of mountains. Many rivers start in different branches of this range flow northward, and join the great Indus River. These rivers include Hanle River, Khurna River, Zanskar River, Suru River (Indus), and Shingo River.\nIt also separates Kinnaur from Spiti in Himachal Pradesh. The highest peaks of Himachal are in Zanskar range.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":90},{"uri":"Baltistan","surface_form":"Baltistan","offset":162},{"uri":"Ladakh","surface_form":"Ladakh","offset":186},{"uri":"Chenab_River","surface_form":"Chenab River","offset":229},{"uri":"Ladakh","surface_form":"Ladakh","offset":295},{"uri":"Jammu_region","surface_form":"Jammu region","offset":368},{"uri":"Vale_of_Kashmir","surface_form":"Vale of Kashmir","offset":385},{"uri":"Marbal_Pass","surface_form":"Marbal Pass","offset":452},{"uri":"Zojila_Pass","surface_form":"Zojila Pass","offset":554},{"uri":"Himalaya","surface_form":"Himalaya","offset":657},{"uri":"Indus_River","surface_form":"Indus River","offset":776},{"uri":"Hanle_River","surface_form":"Hanle River","offset":810},{"uri":"Khurna_River","surface_form":"Khurna River","offset":823},{"uri":"Zanskar_River","surface_form":"Zanskar River","offset":837},{"uri":"Suru_River_(Indus)","surface_form":"Suru River (Indus)","offset":852},{"uri":"Shingo_River","surface_form":"Shingo River","offset":876},{"uri":"Kinnaur_District","surface_form":"Kinnaur","offset":908},{"uri":"Lahaul_and_Spiti_district","surface_form":"Spiti","offset":921},{"uri":"Himachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"Himachal Pradesh","offset":930},{"uri":"List_of_peaks_in_Himachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"highest peaks of Himachal","offset":952}]}
