{"id":123680,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulaiman_Mountains","text":"The Sulaiman Mountains (; Balochi/Urdu/), or the Kesai Mountains are a major feature of southeastern Afghanistan (Zabul, most of Loya Paktia and northeastern Kandahar province), South Waziristan, and most of northern Balochistan province of Pakistan. They are one of the bordering ranges between the Iranian Plateau and the South Asia. Bordering the Sulaiman Range to the north are the arid highlands of the Hindu Kush Range, with more than 50 percent of the lands there lying above 2,000 m (6,500 feet). The Sulaiman Range, and the high plateau to the west and southwest of it, helps form a natural barrier against the humid winds that blow from the Indian Ocean, creating arid conditions across Southern Afghanistan to the north. In contrast, the relatively flat and low-lying Indus River Delta is situated due east and south of the Sulaiman Mountains. This lush delta is prone to heavy flooding and is mostly uncultivated wilderness.\nRivers that flow from the Sulaiman mountain system include the Dori River and the Gomal River.\nThere are very few plants on the southern slope. In the central part, there are wild olives, pistachios and orchards of apples and cherries, as well as wild almonds and junipers. Ziarat District is a tourist attraction, famous for its large juniper forests.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Balochi_language","surface_form":"Balochi","offset":26},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":34},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":101},{"uri":"Zabul_province","surface_form":"Zabul","offset":114},{"uri":"Loya_Paktia","surface_form":"Loya Paktia","offset":129},{"uri":"Kandahar_province","surface_form":"Kandahar province","offset":158},{"uri":"South_Waziristan","surface_form":"South Waziristan","offset":178},{"uri":"Balochistan_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Balochistan province","offset":217},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":241},{"uri":"Iranian_Plateau","surface_form":"Iranian Plateau","offset":300},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":324},{"uri":"Highland","surface_form":"highland","offset":391},{"uri":"Hindu_Kush_Range","surface_form":"Hindu Kush Range","offset":408},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":651},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":706},{"uri":"Indus_River_Delta","surface_form":"Indus River Delta","offset":779},{"uri":"Flooding","surface_form":"flooding","offset":889},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"wilderness","offset":925},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"River","offset":937},{"uri":"Dori_River","surface_form":"Dori River","offset":1000},{"uri":"Gomal_River","surface_form":"Gomal River","offset":1019},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":1051},{"uri":"Olive_(fruit)","surface_form":"olive","offset":1117},{"uri":"Pistachio","surface_form":"pistachio","offset":1125},{"uri":"Orchard","surface_form":"orchard","offset":1140},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":1152},{"uri":"Almond","surface_form":"almond","offset":1189},{"uri":"Juniper","surface_form":"juniper","offset":1201},{"uri":"Ziarat_District","surface_form":"Ziarat District","offset":1211},{"uri":"Tourist_attraction","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":1232}]}
