{"id":12374,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants","text":"\"SpongeBob SquarePants\" is an American animated comedy TV show made by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. It started on May 1, 1999 on Nickelodeon.\nIt is one of Nickelodeon's most popular shows. It has been made into two movies, a Broadway musical that was nominated for twelve Tony Awards, and many pieces of merchandise. The main character, SpongeBob is an adult sea sponge that acts a human child. He lives in a pineapple under the sea.\nTheme Song.\nThe SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song is the song sung at the beginning of every episodes. It is sung by Painty the Pirate and many children.\nCharacters.\nThe show gets its name from its main character, SpongeBob SquarePants, a male sponge. He looks more like a kitchen sponge used for cleaning dishes. His best friend is a starfish named Patrick Star. His grumpy neighbor is an octopus named Squidward Tentacles.\nSpongeBob and Squidward work as employees at a restaurant called the Krusty Krab in the underwater town of Bikini Bottom. The Krusty Krab, which is run by a greedy crab named Mr. Krabs, is famous for its Krabby Patty burgers. The recipe for Krabby Patties is top secret. The owners of a competing restaurant called the Chum Bucket, Plankton and Karen, often try to steal the recipe.\nControversies.\nIn 2005, several groups, including the American Family Foundation, attacked SpongeBob for being a representative of homosexual people. The character had recently appeared on a music video with other kids characters to promote diversity and tolerance. However, the creator said in 2002 that SpongeBob is asexual, meaning that he does not seek sexual partners at all.\nDecreasing quality.\nMany fans and critics believe that, after the first movie, the series started to decline in quality because many writers from the first three seasons seasons left (although Doug Lawrence, Aaron Springer, Erik Wiese and C.H. Greenblatt still stayed). Some of the later episodes were received poorly because the characters did not act the way they acted in the first three seasons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":39},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":48},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"TV show","offset":55},{"uri":"Marine_biology","surface_form":"marine biologist","offset":71},{"uri":"Animator","surface_form":"animator","offset":92},{"uri":"Stephen_Hillenburg","surface_form":"Stephen Hillenburg","offset":101},{"uri":"Nickelodeon","surface_form":"Nickelodeon","offset":150},{"uri":"The_SpongeBob_SquarePants_Movie","surface_form":"movies","offset":236},{"uri":"Broadway","surface_form":"Broadway","offset":246},{"uri":"Tony_Award","surface_form":"Tony Award","offset":293},{"uri":"SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)","surface_form":"SpongeBob","offset":358},{"uri":"Sponge","surface_form":"sponge","offset":384},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":409},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":598},{"uri":"SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)","surface_form":"main character","offset":652},{"uri":"Sponge_(tool)","surface_form":"kitchen sponge","offset":727},{"uri":"Starfish","surface_form":"starfish","offset":789},{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"octopus","offset":844},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":911},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":926},{"uri":"Krusty_Krab","surface_form":"Krusty Krab","offset":948},{"uri":"Crab","surface_form":"crab","offset":1043},{"uri":"Recipe","surface_form":"recipe","offset":1109},{"uri":"Chum_Bucket","surface_form":"Chum Bucket","offset":1198},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":1393},{"uri":"Stephen_Hillenburg","surface_form":"creator","offset":1541},{"uri":"Asexuality","surface_form":"asexual","offset":1580}]}
