{"id":123853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity","text":"e=\"preserve\">Associative property is a property of mathematical operations (like addition and multiplication). It means that if you have more than one of the same associative operator (like +) in a row, the order of operations does not matter.\nThe answer comes out the same both ways because addition is associative.\nAlso, associativity is different from commutativity, which lets you move the numbers around.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":51},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":81},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":94},{"uri":"Order_of_operations","surface_form":"order of operations","offset":207},{"uri":"Commutativity","surface_form":"commutativity","offset":355}]}
