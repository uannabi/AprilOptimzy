{"id":123856,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Nine_Old_Men","text":"e=\"preserve\">Disney's Nine Old Men were a group of animators who were very important names for Disney. They made many important works of Disney, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Fox and the Hound. Although the men of the group were all young, Walt Disney called them Nine Old Men as a reference to Franklin D. Roosevelt calling the US Supreme Court nine old men.\nBy the time \"Robin Hood\" was released, only four of the Nine Old Men were still animating at Disney. They were Milt Kahl, John Lounsbery, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, although Eric Larson and Wolfgang Reitherman were both working for Disney, but not as animators. Lounsbery died in 1976, Kahl retired the same year and died in 1987. Thomas and Johnston retired in 1978, and both later enjoyed cameo appearances in the Brad Bird-directed movies \"The Iron Giant\" (Warner Bros., 1999) and \"The Incredibles\" (Pixar, 2004). Thomas died shortly after that, in 2004, leaving Johnston as the last living \"Old Man.\" He died on April 14, 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animators","offset":51},{"uri":"Important","surface_form":"important","offset":75},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":95},{"uri":"Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_movie)","surface_form":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","offset":150},{"uri":"The_Fox_and_the_Hound","surface_form":"The Fox and the Hound","offset":185},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":254},{"uri":"Reference","surface_form":"reference","offset":296},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
