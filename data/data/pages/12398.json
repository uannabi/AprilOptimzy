{"id":12398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young","text":"Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian-American musician. He is known for his country and rock songs. Sometimes, people call him the Godfather of Grunge because the style of some of his songs led to the kind of music called grunge music that started to be popular in the early 1990s. Many of his songs have a political and/or personal message. He was also a member of the groups Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\nSome of his best-known songs are \"Heart of Gold\", \"Helpless\", \"After the Gold Rush\", \"Rockin' in the Free World\", \"Cinnamon Girl\", \"Southern Man\" and \"Like a Hurricane\".\nYoung has explored many different styles of music during his career, and not all his records have been popular. During the 1980s, he was sued by his record company, Geffen Records, who believed he was making records that would not sell very many copies on purpose. Young won out over Geffen in court.\nPersonal life.\nFrom 1978 until their divorce in 2014, he was married to singer-songwriter Pegi Young. They had two children.\nHe became a United States citizen, taking dual citizenship on January 22, 2020.\nPolitical views.\nYoung is known as an environmental and political activist and his views can sometimes be found in the lyrics of his songs. He is a long-time supporter of the family farmer. In 1985 Young, along with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp, co-founded the benefit concert called Farm Aid which has continued every year to help raise money to keep farmers in business. He also did not support George W. Bush when he was the president of the United States, and even wrote a song called \"Let's Impeach the President\" about how he thought Bush should lose his powers.\nIn the 1970s, Young released two songs (on his \"After The Gold Rush\" and \"Harvest\" albums) critical of racism in the Southern United States. These songs were called \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama\". Lynyrd Skynyrd, a band from the Southern United States, made a song in response called \"Sweet Home Alabama\" that has become a very popular rock classic. Young's name is said in the lyrics of \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\nIn 2016 and in 2020, Young supported Bernie Sanders for President of the United States.\nAwards.\nNeil Young has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, first as a solo artist in 1995 and again as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":50},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":59},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":68},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country","offset":98},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":110},{"uri":"Grunge_music","surface_form":"grunge music","offset":244},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":297},{"uri":"Buffalo_Springfield","surface_form":"Buffalo Springfield","offset":399},{"uri":"Crosby%2C_Stills%2C_Nash_%26amp%3B_Young","surface_form":"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young","offset":423},{"uri":"Lawsuit","surface_form":"sue","offset":760},{"uri":"Geffen_Records","surface_form":"Geffen Records","offset":788},{"uri":"Pegi_Young","surface_form":"Pegi Young","offset":1014},{"uri":"Multiple_citizenship","surface_form":"dual citizenship","offset":1091},{"uri":"Willie_Nelson","surface_form":"Willie Nelson","offset":1345},{"uri":"John_Mellencamp","surface_form":"John Mellencamp","offset":1363},{"uri":"Farm_Aid","surface_form":"Farm Aid","offset":1418},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
