{"id":124016,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millvina_Dean","text":"Elizabeth Gladys Millvina Dean (February 2, 1912 - May 31, 2009) was, at age 97, the last living survivor of the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" that occurred April 15, 1912. She was the youngest person to be on the ship, and did not remember anything about the sinking.\nShe was two months old when she went on the Titanic with her mother, father, and brother. When the Titanic hit an iceberg, her father felt it and told his wife to get her children dressed and go to the deck, or front, of the ship. Dean, her mother, and her brother all got into a lifeboat and got away from the sinking Titanic. Her father did not survive.\nDean started to take part in Titanic-related activities when she was in her seventies, and did not like it when forms of entertainment use the Titanic. The only Titanic movie she watched was \"A Night to Remember\", and she hated it as it was too painful for her to watch.\nShe became the last living Titanic survivor when Barbara West died on 16 October 2007. West, unlike Dean, did not want any publicity from the Titanic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Survivor","surface_form":"survivor","offset":97},{"uri":"RMS_Titanic","surface_form":"RMS \"Titanic\"","offset":128},{"uri":"Iceberg","surface_form":"iceberg","offset":382},{"uri":"Activity","surface_form":"activities","offset":669},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":745},{"uri":"A_Night_to_Remember","surface_form":"A Night to Remember","offset":816},{"uri":"Barbara_West","surface_form":"Barbara West","offset":944},{"uri":"Publicity","surface_form":"publicity","offset":1018}]}
