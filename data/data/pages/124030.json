Neither state has been diplomatically recognised by any member of the United Nations. The conflict began on August 8, 2008, after Georgia claimed South Ossetian separatists had broken a ceasefire by attacking villages, although South Ossetian officials deny that they attacked villages. Georgia launched a military offensive to surround and capture the capital of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali.\nRussian military troops entered the war at the side of South Ossetia and won the conflict. Georgia launched the Georgia versus Russia (Hague court application, 2008)\nin the International Court of Justice.\nThe war ended on Saturday August 16th, 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":89},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":98},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":147},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":280},{"uri":"Diplomatic_recognition","surface_form":"diplomatically recognised","offset":357},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":404},{"uri":"Ceasefire","surface_form":"ceasefire","offset":520},{"uri":"Republic_of_South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":698},{"uri":"Tskhinvali","surface_form":"Tskhinvali","offset":713},{"uri":"International_Court_of_Justice","surface_form":"International Court of Justice","offset":898}]}
