{"id":12408,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod","text":"The iPod is a range of portable music players designed by the company Apple Inc. in California, but made mostly by the Chinese. The iPod comes with computer cables so that the user can put music from their computer onto the iPod, and play music from it using headphones. Newer iPods allow a user to play games, view pictures, watch videos and use the internet, too.\nThe first iPod was simply named the iPod. This was released in 2001. Apple still makes iPods like this today, but they are now called \"iPod classic\".\nApple makes a smaller iPod called the iPod nano. It is much smaller than the iPod, but does not hold as many songs. It uses flash memory, a special kind of memory for very small electronics, instead of a hard drive. It replaced a version of the iPod called the iPod mini.\nAnother type of iPod, called the iPod shuffle, is very small, and it uses flash memory, like the iPod nano but it has no screen. It is the least expensive iPod.\nThe most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. The first iPod touch was released in 2007.\niPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.) Songs are sold in AAC file format, not MP3 or WMA. These are popular formats for compressing (making smaller) music until it does not take up much space and can easily be put on a media player such as the iPod.\nThe App Store is an online shop that is run by Apple Inc. where people can buy software for their iPhone or iPod Touch. It opened on July 11, 2008. Over 100,000 applications (or apps for short) are available for people to buy. Some apps are available for free.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portable","surface_form":"portable","offset":23},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple Inc.","offset":70},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":119},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":239},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":351},{"uri":"IPod_classic","surface_form":"iPod classic","offset":501},{"uri":"Flash_memory","surface_form":"flash memory","offset":640},{"uri":"IPod_touch","surface_form":"iPod touch","offset":987},{"uri":"IPhone","surface_form":"iPhone","offset":1031},{"uri":"ITunes","surface_form":"iTunes","offset":1170},{"uri":"ITunes_Store","surface_form":"iTunes Store","offset":1228},{"uri":"AAC","surface_form":"AAC","offset":1261},{"uri":"MP3","surface_form":"MP3","offset":1282},{"uri":"WMA","surface_form":"WMA","offset":1289},{"uri":"Data_compression","surface_form":"compressing","offset":1324},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple Inc.","offset":1501},{"uri":"IPhone","surface_form":"iPhone","offset":1552},{"uri":"IPod_Touch","surface_form":"iPod Touch","offset":1562},{"uri":"Applications","surface_form":"applications","offset":1615}]}
