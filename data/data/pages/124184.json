{"id":124184,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Boosh","text":"\"The Mighty Boosh\" is a British comedy television series that was shown on BBC Three. It was also a radio programme. Since the television series, there have been live tours of it.\nThe first series is about two zookeepers called Howard and Vince. The second series is also about them but is set in a flat. The third is set in a shop.\nHistory.\nFielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up performance at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the Wycombe Swan theatre. The pair soon found that they shared comic interests, formed a double act, and \"decided to be the new Goodies\". After their first performance together at a bar in London in April 1998, Barratt and Fielding developed their zookeeper characters - Howard Moon and Vince Noir, respectively - in a series of sketches for Paramount Comedy\u2019s \"Unnatural Acts\". It was here that they also met Rich Fulcher, who would become Bob Fossil. Fielding\u2019s friend Dave Brown and Fielding's own brother Michael also became regular collaborators.\nThe Boosh soon produced three stage shows - \"The Mighty Boosh\" (1998), \"Arctic Boosh\" (1999) and \"Autoboosh\" (2000) - all of them were at the Edinburgh Fringe. With the success of \"Autoboosh\", a radio series was commissioned by the BBC. Produced by Danny Wallace, \"The Boosh\" was first broadcast in 2001 on BBC London Live, later moving to BBC Radio 4, from which the team were given a half-hour television show of the same name.\nThe first eight-part series, directed by Paul King, was then commissioned for BBC Three and broadcast in 2004, with a second of six episodes the following year. The second series moved away from the zoo setting, and instead Howard, Vince, Naboo the shaman and Bollo the talking ape living in a flat in Dalston. In 2006, the Boosh returned to theatre with \"The Mighty Boosh Live\", which featured a new story entitled \"The Ruby of Kukundu\".\nAfter two years, the Boosh returned to the television in November 2007. Set in Naboo\u2019s second-hand shop below the flat, the third series drew in approximately one million viewers with its first episode, and in light of its success, BBC Three broadcast an entire night of \"The Mighty Boosh\" on March 22, 2008, which included a new documentary and six of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from all three series.\nThere will not be a fourth series till at least 2010 because they will be working upon a movie. This movie has been confirmed by the BBC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Comedian"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":24},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":32},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":39},{"uri":"BBC_Three","surface_form":"BBC Three","offset":75},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":100},{"uri":"Zookeeper","surface_form":"zookeeper","offset":210},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"flat","offset":299},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":327},{"uri":"Double_act","surface_form":"double act","offset":544},{"uri":"The_Goodies","surface_form":"Goodies","offset":583},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":644},{"uri":"Zookeeper","surface_form":"zookeeper","offset":703},{"uri":"Paramount_Comedy","surface_form":"Paramount Comedy","offset":797},{"uri":"Unnatural_Acts_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Unnatural Acts","offset":817},{"uri":"Rich_Fulcher","surface_form":"Rich Fulcher","offset":865},{"uri":"Dave_Brown_(comedian)","surface_form":"Dave Brown","offset":926},{"uri":"Michael_Fielding","surface_form":"Michael","offset":964},{"uri":"Edinburgh_Fringe","surface_form":"Edinburgh Fringe","offset":1149},{"uri":"The_Boosh_(radio_series)","surface_form":"radio series","offset":1202},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":1239},{"uri":"Danny_Wallace_(humorist)","surface_form":"Danny Wallace","offset":1256},{"uri":"BBC_London_94.9","surface_form":"BBC London Live","offset":1314},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_4","surface_form":"BBC Radio 4","offset":1347},{"uri":"Television_show","surface_form":"television show","offset":1403},{"uri":"The_Mighty_Boosh_(series_1)","surface_form":"first eight-part series","offset":1441},{"uri":"Paul_King_(director)","surface_form":"Paul King","offset":1478},{"uri":"The_Mighty_Boosh_(series_2)","surface_form":"second","offset":1555},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"shaman","offset":1686},{"uri":"Anthropomorphism","surface_form":"talking","offset":1707},{"uri":"Ape","surface_form":"ape","offset":1715},{"uri":"The_Mighty_Boosh_(2006_stage_show)","surface_form":"The Mighty Boosh Live","offset":1793},{"uri":"Thrift_store","surface_form":"second-hand shop","offset":1963},{"uri":"The_Mighty_Boosh_(series_3)","surface_form":"third series","offset":2000},{"uri":"March_22","surface_form":"March 22","offset":2169},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":2179}]}
