From the 1600s until 1858 these areas were run by the English East India Company. After 1858 until 1947 they became the British Raj. Some areas were under the direct rule of the Governor-General of India. He was appointed by the Government of the United Kingdom in London, and was a Viceroy, meaning, the deputy of Queen Victoria. In princely states where an agreement was reached, the traditional rule continued, but the British had an influence.\nAfter 1876 when Queen Victoria become Empress of India, British India was part of the British Indian Empire, which also included hundreds of Indian princely states which had never been conquered by the British and still had control of their own affairs. These were each ruled by local rulers under the protection of the British. This empire is sometimes called the British Raj.\nBritish India ruled from the east included the regions of the present-day of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Republic of India, Burma and Pakistan (185813th August 1947).\nProvinces.\nAt independence in 1947, British India had seventeen provinces.\nIndia was split into Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. Twelve provinces (Ajmer-Merwara-Kekri, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Assam, Bihar, Bombay, Central Provinces and Berar, Coorg, Delhi, Madras, Panth-Piploda, Orissa, and the United Provinces) became provinces within India. Three (Baluchistan, North-West Frontier, and Sindh) were in Pakistan. Two (Bengal and Punjab) were shared between India and Pakistan.\nIn 1950, after the new Indian Constitution, the provinces in India were replaced by states and union territories. Pakistan kept its five provinces. East Bengal, which was renamed East Pakistan in 1956, became the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":43},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":52},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":205},{"uri":"East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":213},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":271},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_India","surface_form":"Governor-General of India","offset":329},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":398},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":416},{"uri":"Viceroy","surface_form":"Viceroy","offset":434},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":466},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"princely state","offset":485},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":740},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"princely state","offset":747},{"uri":"Protection","surface_form":"protection","offset":901},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":933},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":964},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_Bangladesh","surface_form":"People's Republic of Bangladesh","offset":1058},{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":1091},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":1110},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":1120},{"uri":"Provinces","surface_form":"provinces","offset":1217},{"uri":"Union_of_India","surface_form":"Union of India","offset":1249},{"uri":"Dominion_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Dominion of Pakistan","offset":1268},{"uri":"Constitution_of_India","surface_form":"Indian Constitution","offset":1668},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":1880}]}
