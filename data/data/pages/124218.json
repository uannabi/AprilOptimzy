{"id":124218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin","text":"Vulgar Latin, or Common Latin, is one of the two types of Latin. Latin is an old language that was spoken by the Romans. Vulgar Latin is not spoken anymore, but its many dialects eventually became what are now Romance languages (such as Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Romanian). Vulgar Latin was spoken by the regular people (\"vulgus\" in Latin means \"common\"): farmers, workers and those without a great deal of education\nOrigin.\nClassical Latin is the type of Latin that was first spoken by the Romans. As time went by, fewer and fewer people spoke Classical Latin, and in the end the language changed to become Vulgar Latin. After a while, only scholars spoke Classical Latin. Books were still written in it. Nobody speaks Latin anymore except for people who study it and the Roman Catholic Church's officials.\nGrammar.\nVulgar Latin is similar to Classical Latin but has some differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. Latin has 5 basic noun cases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":81},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":113},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialects","offset":170},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":210},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":237},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":246},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":255},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":263},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":279},{"uri":"Classical_Latin","surface_form":"Classical Latin","offset":561},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":789},{"uri":"Case_(grammar)","surface_form":"cases","offset":957}]}
