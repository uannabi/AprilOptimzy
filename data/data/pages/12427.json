{"id":12427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A mathematical constant is a number, which has a special meaning for calculations. For example, the constant \u03C0 (pronounced \"pie\") means the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This value is always the same for any circle. A mathematical constant is often a real, non-integral number of interest.\nIn contrast to physical constants, mathematical constants do not come from physical measurements.\nConstants and series.\n\"Note that the list can be ordered correspondingly by clicking on the header title at the top of the table.\"\n!
