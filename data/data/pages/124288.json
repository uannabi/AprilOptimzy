Nirvana wanted the album to be very different from their last album \"Nevermind\" and have a less clean sound. The album was recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota over two weeks with the producer Steve Albini. Producer Scott Litt also made small changes to the sound that Albini had produced.\nWhen the album was released, it went into the \"Billboard\" 200 at number one and was well liked by critics. Since its release, the album has sold over 15 million copies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":53},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":62},{"uri":"Nirvana_(band)","surface_form":"Nirvana","offset":72},{"uri":"DGC_Records","surface_form":"DGC Records","offset":123},{"uri":"Nevermind","surface_form":"Nevermind","offset":205},{"uri":"Pachyderm_Studio","surface_form":"Pachyderm Studio","offset":271},{"uri":"Cannon_Falls%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Cannon Falls, Minnesota","offset":291},{"uri":"Steve_Albini","surface_form":"Steve Albini","offset":348},{"uri":"Scott_Litt","surface_form":"Scott Litt","offset":371},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":491}]}
