{"id":124303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy","text":"Pedagogy is the art or science of being a teacher and of learning.\nThe word pedagogy comes from the Greek word \"paidag\u014Dge\u014D\", which means \"to lead the child.\" In Ancient Greece, rich men had a slave to instruct their sons as a tutor, or to take them to the academy. Girls were almost entirely home schooled, but many boys went to school even if they had a tutor.\nAcademic degree.\nAn academic degree is sometimes given for pedagogy. In the United States of America and Great Britain, you can earn a degree in education at the Bachelor's (undergraduate; BA or BS) or Master's (graduate; MA or MS) level. You can also earn an advanced degree called either a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), or a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.); you can also get a degree for specific things, like a Doctor of Music degree in piano pedagogy.\nCriticism.\nSome people do not like the idea of pedagogy. They say that learning is something that a person does for themselves, not something that a person imposes on a person. Pedagogy is mainly credited and acknowledged in Western society, but it is not regarded as a good thing in some Eastern secular and fundamentalist societies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":16},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":23},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":42},{"uri":"Learning","surface_form":"learning","offset":57},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":100},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":161},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":192},{"uri":"Tutor","surface_form":"tutor","offset":226},{"uri":"Academy","surface_form":"academy","offset":256},{"uri":"Home_school","surface_form":"home schooled","offset":292},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"academic degree","offset":382},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":438},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":467},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":507},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Education","surface_form":"Doctor of Education","offset":654},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Doctor of Philosophy","offset":688},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Music","surface_form":"Doctor of Music","offset":772},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":798}]}
