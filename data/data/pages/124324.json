{"id":124324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_clitoridis","text":"The corpus cavernosum clitoridis is one of two sponge-like tissue found in the body of the clitoris. It is similar to the corpus cavernosum penis in the male.\nThe female has no corpus spongiosum, but instead two vestibular bulbs beneath the skin at the entrance to the vagina, which expand at the same time as the glans clitoris.\nEach corpus is connected to the blood vessels of the pubic bone and hip bone by the clitoris.\nPhysiology.\nSometimes, release of nitric oxide relaxes muscles around the vagina, called sexual arousal. More blood flows in through the corpus cavernosum and the clitoris is filled with blood. This leads to better sensitivity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sponge","surface_form":"sponge","offset":47},{"uri":"Boilogical_tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":59},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoris","offset":91},{"uri":"Corpus_cavernosum_penis","surface_form":"corpus cavernosum penis","offset":122},{"uri":"Corpus_spongiosum","surface_form":"corpus spongiosum","offset":177},{"uri":"Vestibular_bulbs","surface_form":"vestibular bulbs","offset":212},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":241},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":269},{"uri":"Blood_vessel","surface_form":"blood vessel","offset":362},{"uri":"Pubic_bone","surface_form":"pubic bone","offset":383},{"uri":"Hip","surface_form":"hip","offset":398},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":402},{"uri":"Nitric_oxide","surface_form":"nitric oxide","offset":458},{"uri":"Sexual_arousal","surface_form":"sexual arousal","offset":513},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":611},{"uri":"Sensitivity","surface_form":"sensitivity","offset":639}]}
