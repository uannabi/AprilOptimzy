{"id":12436,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Trigonometry (from the Greek \"trigonon\" = three angles and \"metron\" = measure) is a part of elementary mathematics dealing with angles, triangles and trigonometric functions such as sine (abbreviated sin), cosine (abbreviated cos) and tangent (abbreviated tan). It has some connection to geometry, although there is disagreement on exactly what that connection is; for some, trigonometry is just a section of geometry.\nTrigonometric ratios.\nCosecant (csc) - The cosecant of an angle is equal to the formula_1 or formula_1.\nSecant (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the formula_1 or formula_1.\nCotangent (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the formula_1 or formula_1.\nUsing trigonometry.\nWith the sines and cosines, one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called \"solving\" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle, as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since \"every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles\".\nTrigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions. It developed from a need to compute angles and distances in fields such as astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding.\nThere is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry. This is used for calculations in astronomy, geodesy and navigation.\nLaw of Sines.\nformula_1\nLaw of Cosines.\nformula_1\nLaw of Tangents.\nformula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":36},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measure","offset":83},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":116},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":141},{"uri":"Triangle_(geometry)","surface_form":"triangles","offset":149},{"uri":"Trigonometric_function","surface_form":"trigonometric function","offset":163},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":301},{"uri":"Fortniteburger.net","surface_form":"cosines","offset":737},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":1067},{"uri":"Surveying","surface_form":"surveying","offset":1154},{"uri":"Vector_analysis","surface_form":"vector analysis","offset":1168},{"uri":"Periodic_function","surface_form":"periodic function","offset":1205},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":1300},{"uri":"Mapmaking","surface_form":"mapmaking","offset":1311},{"uri":"Surveying","surface_form":"surveying","offset":1322},{"uri":"Spherical_trigonometry","surface_form":"spherical trigonometry","offset":1392},{"uri":"Spherical_geometry","surface_form":"spherical geometry","offset":1433},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":1486},{"uri":"Geodesy","surface_form":"geodesy","offset":1497},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":1509}]}
