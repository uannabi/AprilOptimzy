{"id":12438,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism","text":"Polytheis means believing in many gods. A person that believes in polytheism is called a polytheist. A religion with polytheism can be called a polytheistic religion.\nPolytheism is well documented in historical religions of classical antiquity, especially those of ancient Greeks and Romans. Other ancient people who were polytheists include German pagans, Ancient Egyptians, the Celts and the Norse.\nThere are various polytheistic religions practiced today, for example Shinto, Chinese folk religion, Thelma, Wicca, Druidism, Taoism, Asatru and Candombl\u00E9.\nUsually, a polytheistic religion has a set of stories about the gods. This is called mythology.\nThe opposite of polytheism is monotheism, which is the belief in only one god, practiced by the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":34},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":103},{"uri":"Classical_antiquity","surface_form":"classical antiquity","offset":224},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greeks","offset":273},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":284},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":298},{"uri":"Germanic_paganism","surface_form":"German pagans","offset":342},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":357},{"uri":"Celts","surface_form":"Celts","offset":380},{"uri":"Norse","surface_form":"Norse","offset":394},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":471},{"uri":"Chinese_folk_religion","surface_form":"Chinese folk religion","offset":479},{"uri":"Thelma","surface_form":"Thelma","offset":502},{"uri":"Wicca","surface_form":"Wicca","offset":510},{"uri":"Druidism","surface_form":"Druidism","offset":517},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoism","offset":527},{"uri":"Asatru","surface_form":"Asatru","offset":535},{"uri":"Candombl%C3%A9","surface_form":"Candombl\u00E9","offset":546},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"stories","offset":603},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":642},{"uri":"Monotheism","surface_form":"monotheism","offset":683},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":775},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":784},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":798},{"uri":"Sikhism","surface_form":"Sikhism","offset":805}]}
