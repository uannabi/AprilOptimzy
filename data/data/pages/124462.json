{"id":124462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprise_Records","text":"Reprise Records is an American record label, founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra, which is owned by Warner Music Group, and operated through Warner Bros. Records. Reprise is best known for recording Green Day since 1994.\nCompany history.\nReprise was formed in 1960 by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings. He had earlier been with Capitol Records, but was upset when Capitol issued an album, \"Come Fly with Me\", whose cover had a picture of him in front of an airplane with a Trans-World Airlines (TWA) logo. He believed Capitol and TWA were profiting together from his image, and left him out.\nReprise's artists included Sinatra's longtime friend Dean Martin, who was a singer and comedian, with a popular television show. Sinatra's daughter, Nancy Sinatra, became a recording artist and singer, and signed with her father's label. (His advice to her, whoever she signed with, was to \"Own your own masters\", and she did that. Years later, her was valuable, and she earned more money from her records than if she was not their owner.) Reprise also released records by Jimi Hendrix, and later Neil Young.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":22},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":31},{"uri":"1960_in_music","surface_form":"1960","offset":56},{"uri":"Frank_Sinatra","surface_form":"Frank Sinatra","offset":64},{"uri":"Warner_Music_Group","surface_form":"Warner Music Group","offset":97},{"uri":"Warner_Bros._Records","surface_form":"Warner Bros.
