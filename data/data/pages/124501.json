{"id":124501,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)","text":"The constellation Sagittarius (meaning \"the Archer\") is a group of stars in one area of the night sky. The stars are in the shape of a centaur archer. This constellation is part of the Western zodiac.\nThe Milky Way is at its densest near Sagittarius, as this is where the galactic center lies. Consequently, Sagittarius contains many star clusters and nebulae. One of the brightest of the star clusters is Messier 55, about 7.5\u00B0 west of \u03B4 Sgr.\nThe complex radio source Sagittarius A is here. Astronomers believe that one of its components, known as Sagittarius A*, is associated with a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, with a mass of 2.6 million solar masses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Centaur","surface_form":"centaur","offset":135},{"uri":"Archery","surface_form":"archer","offset":143},{"uri":"Zodiac","surface_form":"Western zodiac","offset":185},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":205},{"uri":"Galactic_center","surface_form":"galactic center","offset":272},{"uri":"Messier_55","surface_form":"Messier 55","offset":406},{"uri":"Sagittarius_A","surface_form":"Sagittarius A","offset":469},{"uri":"Sagittarius_A%2A","surface_form":"Sagittarius A*","offset":549},{"uri":"Supermassive_black_hole","surface_form":"supermassive black hole","offset":586},{"uri":"Solar_mass","surface_form":"solar mass","offset":666}]}
