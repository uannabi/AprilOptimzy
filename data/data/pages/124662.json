{"id":124662,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menoitios","text":"e=\"preserve\">Menoitios (or Menoetius) was the Titan god (perhaps) of violent anger, rash action, and human mortality. Zeus struck him down with a thunderbolt and sent him to Erebos (the Underworld) as punishment for his hybristic behaviour.\nHe was a son of Iapetus and Clymene or Asia, and a brother of Atlas, Prometheus and Epimetheus. He was killed by Zeus with a flash of lightning, in the fight of the Titans, and thrown into Tartarus. (Hes. Theog. 507, &c., 514; Apollod. i. 2. \u00A7 3; Schol. ad Aeschyl. Prom. 347.)\nThe name Menoitios was derives from the Greek words \"menos\" meaning variously might, force, spirit, passion, batterage, and \"oitos\" meaning ill-fated or doomed. Hesiod also describes him as \"hybristes\", a violent, overbearing and insolent man. Menoitios and his brothers, the sons of Iapetos, were all depicted with extreme human foibles: Prometheus was overly crafty, Epimetheus a fool, and Atlas exceedingly daring.\nMenoitios was perhaps identical to Menoites the herdsman of Hades, whom Herakles wrestled with in the underworld. This connection with cattle, suggests that he was also the same as Bouphagos (the Cattle Eater) son of Iapetos, a hybristic man who attacked the goddess Artemis in Arkadia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iapetus","surface_form":"Iapetus","offset":257},{"uri":"Clymene","surface_form":"Clymene","offset":269},{"uri":"Atlas","surface_form":"Atlas","offset":303},{"uri":"Prometheus","surface_form":"Prometheus","offset":310},{"uri":"Epimetheus","surface_form":"Epimetheus","offset":325},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":354},{"uri":"Tartarus","surface_form":"Tartarus","offset":430},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":997}]}
