{"id":124721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse","text":"Betelgeuse (from Arabic:\u0625\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u062C\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0621 Ib\u1E6D al-Jauz\u0101\u2019, meaning \"the armpit of Orion\") is a large red supergiant star in the Orion constellation. It is usually the ninth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest in Orion.\nBetelgeuse is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.2 and 1.2. This is the widest range of any first-magnitude star.\nIt is also one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. It has a radius between 950 to 1,000 times wider than the Sun. This means it is 1.322 to 1.392 billion kilometers in diameter. Betelgeuse was the first star other than the Sun whose size was known. The star's distance from Earth is about 640 light-years. Its average absolute magnitude is about \u22126.02.\nBetelgeuse is less than 10 million years old. It evolves rapidly because of its high mass. It is moving through the interstellar medium at a speed of 30\u00A0km/s, creating a shock wave over 4 light-years wide.\nBetelgeuse is now in a later stage of stellar evolution. It will rapidly go through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova sometime in the next million years.\nAn observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 showed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.\nBetelgeuse is one of the red supergiant stars to have a bow shock: others are Mu Cephei and IRC-10414. Betelgeuse can be seen at the upper left in Orion.\nAlternate names.\nBetelgeuse is also called Alpha Orionis (\u03B1 Orionis, abbreviated Alpha Ori, \u03B1 Ori).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supergiant","surface_form":"supergiant","offset":97},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":108},{"uri":"Orion_(constellation)","surface_form":"Orion","offset":120},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":126},{"uri":"List_of_brightest_stars","surface_form":"ninth-brightest","offset":159},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":175},{"uri":"Variable_star","surface_form":"variable star","offset":261},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":281},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":506},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":671},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":690},{"uri":"Absolute_magnitude","surface_form":"absolute magnitude","offset":715},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":835},{"uri":"Interstellar_medium","surface_form":"interstellar medium","offset":866},{"uri":"Shock_wave","surface_form":"shock wave","offset":920},{"uri":"Stellar_evolution","surface_form":"stellar evolution","offset":994},{"uri":"Type_II_supernova","surface_form":"type II supernova","offset":1077},{"uri":"Herschel_Space_Observatory","surface_form":"Herschel Space Observatory","offset":1153},{"uri":"Red_supergiant_star","surface_form":"red supergiant star","offset":1308},{"uri":"Bow_shock","surface_form":"bow shock","offset":1339},{"uri":"Mu_Cephei","surface_form":"Mu Cephei","offset":1361},{"uri":"IRC-10414","surface_form":"IRC-10414","offset":1375},{"uri":"Orion_(constellation)","surface_form":"Orion","offset":1430}]}
