Cushites include people like Afars, Oromos, and Sidama. Some people said that its a good idea for Cushites to help each other with making money and politics. This aim is sometimes called \"Pan-Hornism\".\nBorders.\nThere are four countries in the Horn of Africa. They are Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The northernmost areas of the Horn are Ras Kasar in the west, settled by the Rashaida tribe, and Alula in the east, settled by Dishiishe. The easternmost area is Ras Hafun, settled by Leelkase, and the southernmost in Ras Kamboni, settled by Dhulbahante.\nHistory.\nThe Horn of Africa became famous for taking longer to be colonized than other African countries. Those countries which fought back were Ethiopia, led by Menelik II, and the Daraawiish State, led by Ismail Mire. Eritrea was part of Ethiopia, but fought the Eritrean War of Independence from 1961 to 1991.\nNumbers.\nHorn of Africa can also mean the greater region containing the countries of Eritrea, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia.
