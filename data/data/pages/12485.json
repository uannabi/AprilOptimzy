{"id":12485,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong","text":"waist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound.\nA monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the \"oo\" sound in \"book.\" In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the \"oi\" sound in the word \"oil\". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an \"o\" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard \"e\" sound. Another example is the \"ou\" sound in the word \"house\". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft \"a\" sound in \"flat\", then moves to make the a hard \"oo\" sound like the one in \"caboose\".\nJust like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents.\nThe word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, \"di\" means \"two\" or \"double\", while the part \"-phthong\" means \"sound\" or \"tone\", from the basic word \"phthalein\", which means \"speak\", \"creating sound by the voice\".\nA diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Accent","surface_form":"accent","offset":772},{"uri":"Lexeme","surface_form":"lexeme","offset":1033},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":1045},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":1080}]}
