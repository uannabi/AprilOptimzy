{"id":124889,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge%2C_Victoria","text":"Beveridge is a small town in Victoria, Australia. It is on the Hume Highway, north of Melbourne. In 2006 there were 1,192 people living in Beveridge and the local area.\nEarly history.\nBeveridge was named after Scottish sheep farmer Andrew Beveridge who built the Hunters' Tryste Inn in 1845. The Inn still serves as a hotel, as well as post office and general store.\nNed Kelly.\nThe town is known as the birthplace of bushranger Ned Kelly. He lived there as a small boy. His birth details aren't known, but he was probably born at his grandfather, James Quinn's farm. A cottage where the Kelly family lived for a short time is still standing today, located on Kelly Street. It is recorded that John Kelly built this house in about 1859 when Ned was about five years old. Dan Kelly and Kate Kelly were born in the house. The Primary School is a bluestone building once a church where the Kelly family prayed. Sitting on a hillside, this gothic style building was built between 1857 and 1862. The sacristy and chancel were added in 1877.\nMount Fraser.\nNear Beveridge is Mt Fraser, an extinct volcanic cone. It last erupted about 1 million years ago. It is about 120 metres in height above the surrounding land. From this spot the explorers Hume and Hovell first saw Port Phillip Bay on 14 December 1824. A quarry now operates at the side of the hill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":29},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":39},{"uri":"Hume_Highway","surface_form":"Hume Highway","offset":63},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":86},{"uri":"Scottish_people","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":210},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":318},{"uri":"Post_office","surface_form":"post office","offset":336},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"store","offset":360},{"uri":"Bushranger","surface_form":"bushranger","offset":417},{"uri":"Ned_Kelly","surface_form":"Ned Kelly","offset":428},{"uri":"Dan_Kelly","surface_form":"Dan Kelly","offset":770},{"uri":"Kate_Kelly","surface_form":"Kate Kelly","offset":784},{"uri":"Bluestone","surface_form":"bluestone","offset":843},{"uri":"Gothic","surface_form":"gothic","offset":935},{"uri":"Sacristy","surface_form":"sacristy","offset":994},{"uri":"Chancel","surface_form":"chancel","offset":1007},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":1081},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":1089},{"uri":"Hamilton_Hume","surface_form":"Hume","offset":1237},{"uri":"William_Hovell","surface_form":"Hovell","offset":1246},{"uri":"Port_Phillip_Bay","surface_form":"Port Phillip Bay","offset":1263}]}
