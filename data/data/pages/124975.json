This resolution asked for greater Muslim autonomy of Muslim majority states such as Punjab Bengal Sindh, NWFP within British India. However, later on most people thought of this as a call for a separate Muslim state, Pakistan. The resolution was presented at Minto Park (now renamed 'Iqbal Park'), in Lahore, by Maulvi A.K. Fazlul Huq on the instructions of the Working Committee.\nIn fact, from the declaration made in this resolution in 1940 onwards, the goals of the Muslim League became increasingly fixed upon achieving an independent nation-state.\nToday, the resolution's importance is remembered in Pakistan, by the Minar-e-Pakistan structure that stands in the Greater Iqbal Park, Lahore.\nCommittee.\nThe following is the full list of the 25 original, formally designated members of the Special Working Committee of the All India Muslim League, 1940, which met between 21 and 24 March 1940, and which largely drafted the Lahore Resolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"All-India_Muslim_League","surface_form":"All-India Muslim League","offset":275},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":407},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":532},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":632},{"uri":"A.K._Fazlul_Huq","surface_form":"A.K.
