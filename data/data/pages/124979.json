{"id":124979,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_(British_India)","text":"Meaning.\nThe word Punjab is named from the \"five rivers\" which flow through it: the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all tributaries of the Indus.\nGeography.\nThe Punjab province of British India was a triangular area of country bordered by the Indus and the Sutlej rivers.\nPartition.\nIn 1947, the province of Punjab was divided between the new republics of India and Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's Punjab Province; the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became India's Punjab state in 1966. Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so the partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence. Lahore and Amritsar were at the center of the problem, the British were not sure where to place them - make them part of India or Pakistan. The British decided to hand both cities to India, but because of a lack of control and regulation for the border, Amritsar became part of India while Lahore became part of Pakistan. Areas in west Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujrat, had a large Sikh population and many of the residents were attacked or killed by radical Muslims. On the other side in East Punjab cities such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Gurdaspur had a majority Muslim population in which many of them were wiped out by Sikh guerrillas who launched an all out war against the Muslims.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jhelum_River","surface_form":"Jhelum","offset":84},{"uri":"Chenab_River","surface_form":"Chenab","offset":92},{"uri":"Ravi_River","surface_form":"Ravi","offset":100},{"uri":"Beas_River","surface_form":"Beas","offset":106},{"uri":"Sutlej","surface_form":"Sutlej","offset":115},{"uri":"Tributaries","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":127},{"uri":"Indus","surface_form":"Indus","offset":146},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangular","offset":207},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":234},{"uri":"Indus","surface_form":"Indus","offset":250},{"uri":"Partition_of_India","surface_form":"divided","offset":326},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":363},{"uri":"Dominion_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":373},{"uri":"Punjab_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Punjab Province","offset":448},{"uri":"Punjab_(India)","surface_form":"Punjab state","offset":519},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":698},{"uri":"Amritsar","surface_form":"Amritsar","offset":709}]}
