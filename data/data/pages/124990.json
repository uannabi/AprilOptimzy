They saw it as an area of strategic importance in the war against Burma. Sylhet gradually fell under British control and administration. It was governed as a part of Bengal. After the British administrative reorganization of India, Sylhet became a part of Assam. It remained a part of Assam for the rest of the era of British rule.\nIn 1947, after a referendum, almost all of Sylhet as a district became a part of East Bengal at the time and remained so after Bangladeshi independence. The Karimganj subdivision became part of the new Indian state of Assam. The referendum was held on 3 July 1947. There were a total of 546,815 votes cast on 239 polling stations. A majority of 43.8 per cent voted in favour of East Bengal. There were protests about false votes, but the referendum was acknowledged during India's independence on 18 July 1947. In 1971, Sylhet became part of the newly formed country of Bangladesh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_Bangladesh","surface_form":"division","offset":36},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":48},{"uri":"Sylhet","surface_form":"Sylhet","offset":93},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":117},{"uri":"Meghalaya","surface_form":"Meghalaya","offset":133},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":152},{"uri":"Tripura","surface_form":"Tripura","offset":172},{"uri":"Assam","surface_form":"Assam","offset":200},{"uri":"Dhaka_Division","surface_form":"Dhaka","offset":237},{"uri":"Chittagong_Division","surface_form":"Chittagong","offset":247},{"uri":"Karimganj_Thana","surface_form":"Karimganj Thana","offset":310},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":368},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":442},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":457},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":472},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":486},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":503},{"uri":"British_East_India_Company","surface_form":"British East India Company","offset":585},{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategic","offset":667},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":707},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British","offset":742},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administration","offset":762},{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":807},{"uri":"Assam","surface_form":"Assam","offset":897},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British rule","offset":959},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":990},{"uri":"Karimganj_district","surface_form":"Karimganj subdivision","offset":1130},{"uri":"Assam","surface_form":"Assam","offset":1191},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":1375}]}
