He was a two-term United States Senator from Minnesota. Mondale was the Democratic Party nominee for president in 1984. His vice presidential nominee, Geraldine Ferraro, was the first woman to be nominated. He only got a majority of votes in Minnesota and the District of Columbia, and lost to Ronald Reagan in the other 49 states.\nMondale was the first Vice President to have an office. He made the role of Vice President more important than it once was, by having weekly meetings with President Carter.\nDuring the Bill Clinton presidency, he was the Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996.\nMondale was hospitalized with influenza at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, in March 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":62},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":71},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President of the United States","offset":107},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":161},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":171},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":203},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":230},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":257},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_1984","surface_form":"president in 1984","offset":286},{"uri":"Geraldine_Ferraro","surface_form":"Geraldine Ferraro","offset":336},{"uri":"District_of_Columbia","surface_form":"District of Columbia","offset":445},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":479},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":565},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":701},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"Ambassador","offset":737},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":751},{"uri":"Influenza","surface_form":"influenza","offset":806},{"uri":"Mayo_Clinic","surface_form":"Mayo Clinic","offset":823},{"uri":"Rochester%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Rochester, Minnesota","offset":839}]}
