She found and kept Anne's diary after Anne Frank was found and sent away by the Nazis. Although Gies did not read the diary (as she gave it to Otto Frank immediately after recovering it from the annex and thought it would be rude to read), it has become very successful worldwide.\n'I stand at the end of the long, long line of good Dutch people who did what I did or more \u2013 much more \u2013 during those dark and terrible times years ago, but always like yesterday in the hearts of those of us who bear witness. Never a day goes by that I do not think of what happened then.', Miep Gies stated on her own website.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":99},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":105},{"uri":"Anne_Frank","surface_form":"Anne Frank","offset":122},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":157},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":170},{"uri":"The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl","surface_form":"Anne's diary","offset":203},{"uri":"Otto_Frank","surface_form":"Otto Frank","offset":327},{"uri":"Annex","surface_form":"annex","offset":379},{"uri":"Success","surface_form":"successful","offset":443}]}
