{"id":125383,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Show_of_Shows","text":"\"Your Show of Shows\" was a 90-minute long comedy television series appearing weekly in the United States on NBC, from 1950 until June 5, 1954. The main people of the show were Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. Other people who appeared were Carl Reiner, Howard Morris, Nanette Fabray, Bill Hayes, Judy Johnson, The Hamilton Trio and the soprano Marguerite Piazza. Jos\u00E9 Ferrer also appeared on the show sometimes, as a guest.\nWriters for the show included Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin, and Carl Reiner who, though a cast member, always sat in with the writers. Although it is not true, some people think that Woody Allen wrote for \"Your Show of Shows\". He did, however, write for \"Caesar's Hour\", which ran from 1954 to 1957.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":42},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":49},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":91},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":108},{"uri":"Sid_Caesar","surface_form":"Sid Caesar","offset":176},{"uri":"Imogene_Coca","surface_form":"Imogene Coca","offset":191},{"uri":"Carl_Reiner","surface_form":"Carl Reiner","offset":236},{"uri":"Howard_Morris","surface_form":"Howard Morris","offset":249},{"uri":"Nanette_Fabray","surface_form":"Nanette Fabray","offset":264},{"uri":"Bill_Hayes","surface_form":"Bill Hayes","offset":280},{"uri":"Soprano","surface_form":"soprano","offset":332},{"uri":"Marguerite_Piazza","surface_form":"Marguerite Piazza","offset":340},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Ferrer","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Ferrer","offset":359},{"uri":"Guest","surface_form":"guest","offset":413},{"uri":"Mel_Brooks","surface_form":"Mel Brooks","offset":450},{"uri":"Neil_Simon","surface_form":"Neil Simon","offset":462},{"uri":"Danny_Simon","surface_form":"Danny Simon","offset":474},{"uri":"Larry_Gelbart","surface_form":"Larry Gelbart","offset":487},{"uri":"Mel_Tolkin","surface_form":"Mel Tolkin","offset":502},{"uri":"Carl_Reiner","surface_form":"Carl Reiner","offset":518},{"uri":"Woody_Allen","surface_form":"Woody Allen","offset":637},{"uri":"Caesar%27s_Hour","surface_form":"Caesar's Hour","offset":709}]}
