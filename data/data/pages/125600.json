{"id":125600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmutation","text":"=\"preserve\">Transmutation is a basic process in alchemy. The most important form of transmutation is the change of lead into gold. Alchemists tried and failed to change \"base metals\" (metals of very little value) into a metal of high value like gold.\nHowever, more recent work by James Chadwick and Ir\u00E8ne Joliot-Curie in nuclear physics has established that radioactivity does lead to elemental changes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alchemy","surface_form":"alchemy","offset":48},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":115},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":125},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":245},{"uri":"James_Chadwick","surface_form":"James Chadwick","offset":280},{"uri":"Ir%C3%A8ne_Joliot-Curie","surface_form":"Ir\u00E8ne Joliot-Curie","offset":299},{"uri":"Nuclear_physics","surface_form":"nuclear physics","offset":321},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactivity","offset":358}]}
