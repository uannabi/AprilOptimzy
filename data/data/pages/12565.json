{"id":12565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_disability","text":"e=\"preserve\">Learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are conditions that make it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn.\nLearning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading and writing). They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism). People with learning disabilities may have average intelligence. Learning disabilities are not the same as mental illnesses. They can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":315},{"uri":"Dyslexia","surface_form":"dyslexia","offset":441},{"uri":"Reading","surface_form":"reading","offset":469},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":481},{"uri":"Autism","surface_form":"autism","offset":560},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"intelligence","offset":620},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illnesses","offset":676}]}
