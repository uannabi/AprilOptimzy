{"id":12572,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity","text":"e=\"preserve\">Electrical conductivity is the measure of a material's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge. Its SI is the \"siemens per meter\", (A2s3m\u22123kg\u22121) (named after Werner von Siemens) or, more simply, Sm\u22121.\nIt is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. It is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test.\nElectrical conductance is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge (such as electrons), which can carry electricity. When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor, its electrons flow, and an electric current appears.\nA conductor such as a metal has high conductivity, and an insulator like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity. A semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions.\nElectrical conductivity is the reciprocal (or inverse) of electrical resistivity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":126},{"uri":"Siemens_(unit)","surface_form":"siemens","offset":137},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"meter","offset":149},{"uri":"Ampere","surface_form":"A","offset":158},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"s","offset":160},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":162},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":165},{"uri":"Werner_von_Siemens","surface_form":"Werner von Siemens","offset":184},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":250},{"uri":"Electric_field","surface_form":"electric field","offset":273},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"electrical phenomenon","offset":452},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"electric charge","offset":523},{"uri":"Electrons","surface_form":"electrons","offset":548},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":576},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":688},{"uri":"Electrical_conductor","surface_form":"conductor","offset":716},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":736},{"uri":"Insulator_(electricity)","surface_form":"insulator","offset":772},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":787},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":798},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":829},{"uri":"Reciprocal","surface_form":"reciprocal","offset":940},{"uri":"Inverse","surface_form":"inverse","offset":955},{"uri":"Electrical_resistivity","surface_form":"electrical resistivity","offset":967}]}
