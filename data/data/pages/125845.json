It is now extinct in India, but during British colonial times in India it was the famous hunting leopard. This name came about because some of these animals were kept captive by Indian royalty and used to hunt wild antelope.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":78},{"uri":"Cheetah","surface_form":"cheetah","offset":96},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":114},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":207},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":223},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":234},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British colonial times in India","offset":252},{"uri":"Captive","surface_form":"captive","offset":380},{"uri":"Antelope","surface_form":"antelope","offset":428}]}
