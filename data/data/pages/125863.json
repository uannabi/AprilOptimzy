{"id":125863,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharal","text":"The bharal or Himalayan blue sheep (\"Pseudois nayaur\") is a mammal of the Caprinae subfamily.\nThe bharal is found in the high Himalayas of Nepal, Tibet, China, Kashmir, Pakistan, Bhutan and the Republic of India.\nThe bharal has horns that grow upwards, curve out and then towards the back, somewhat like an upside down mustache.\nBharal are active throughout the day, feeding and resting on the grassy mountain slopes. With their excellent camouflage and the absence of cover in their environment, bharal stay motionless when approached. Once they have been noticed, however, they scamper up to the precipitous cliffs, where they once again freeze, using camouflage to blend into the rock face.\nWhere they overlap, they are the favourite prey of snow leopards and leopards. A few lambs fall prey to foxes or eagles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caprinae","surface_form":"Caprinae","offset":74},{"uri":"Himalaya","surface_form":"Himalaya","offset":126},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":139},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":146},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":153},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":160},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":169},{"uri":"Bhutan","surface_form":"Bhutan","offset":179},{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":194},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"camouflage","offset":439},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":737},{"uri":"Snow_leopard","surface_form":"snow leopard","offset":745},{"uri":"Leopard","surface_form":"leopard","offset":763},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":798},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":807}]}
