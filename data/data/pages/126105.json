In 1957, it took over Capitol Records, an American record company.\nIn 1962, The Beatles signed a contract with EMI's Parlophone Records, and they became the company's most successful musicians. The Beatles made nearly all their recordings at Abbey Road Studios, EMI's main recording studios in London.\nIn 1992, EMI bought Virgin Records, which had been owned by Richard Branson. It almost bought Universal Records in 1998, also. In 2007, EMI was taken over by a group called Terra Firma, after it said no to a bid from Warner Music Group.\nOther famous musicians that were with EMI include Prince, Pink Floyd, Spice Girls, and Coldplay.\nIn 2012, Universal Music Group bought EMI, but the European Commission told Universal to sell some of EMI's record labels. Parlophone, the oldest EMI label, was sold to Warner Music Group; while BMG bought Mute Records. EMI's music publishing business was sold to a group that included Sony/ATV Music Publishing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":10},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":16},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":33},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":44},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":75},{"uri":"Capitol_Records","surface_form":"Capitol Records","offset":284},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":304},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":338},{"uri":"Parlophone_Records","surface_form":"Parlophone Records","offset":379},{"uri":"Abbey_Road_Studios","surface_form":"Abbey Road Studios","offset":504},{"uri":"Recording_studio","surface_form":"recording studio","offset":535},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":556},{"uri":"Virgin_Records","surface_form":"Virgin Records","offset":584},{"uri":"Richard_Branson","surface_form":"Richard Branson","offset":624},{"uri":"Universal_Music_Group","surface_form":"Universal Records","offset":658},{"uri":"Bid","surface_form":"bid","offset":772},{"uri":"Warner_Bros.","surface_form":"Warner Music Group","offset":781},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"Prince","offset":851},{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":859},{"uri":"Spice_Girls","surface_form":"Spice Girls","offset":871},{"uri":"Coldplay","surface_form":"Coldplay","offset":888},{"uri":"Universal_Music_Group","surface_form":"Universal Music Group","offset":907},{"uri":"European_Commission","surface_form":"European Commission","offset":949},{"uri":"Parlophone","surface_form":"Parlophone","offset":1021},{"uri":"Warner_Music_Group","surface_form":"Warner Music Group","offset":1067},{"uri":"BMG_Rights_Management","surface_form":"BMG","offset":1093},{"uri":"Mute_Records","surface_form":"Mute Records","offset":1104}]}
