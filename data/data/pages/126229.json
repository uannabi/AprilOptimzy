{"id":126229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Baudelaire","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sunny Baudelaire is one of the main characters from Lemony Snicket's series of books, \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\". In the film she is portrayed by Kara and Shelby Hoffman.\nShe is the youngest of the Baudelaire orphans. Her two elder siblings are Violet and Klaus Baudelaire. She is described as being an infant throughout much of the series, and as a young (albeit advanced) child toward the end. Sunny cannot talk quite as well as the others because she's only a baby, but the baby noises that she makes are often very well translated into common English words by her older siblings. As the series progresses, her speech begins to grow and by the end of the series she is speaking in full sentences. Sunny's favorite book is \"From Molars to Incisors: A Pictorial History of the Tooth\", and she hates limp food. Her love of biting is not as common late in the series, though, when she develops a love of cooking.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lemony_Snicket","surface_form":"Lemony Snicket","offset":65},{"uri":"A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events","surface_form":"A Series of Unfortunate Events","offset":100},{"uri":"Kara_and_Shelby_Hoffman","surface_form":"Kara and Shelby Hoffman","offset":165},{"uri":"Orphan","surface_form":"orphan","offset":228},{"uri":"Violet_Baudelaire","surface_form":"Violet","offset":264},{"uri":"Klaus_Baudelaire","surface_form":"Klaus Baudelaire","offset":275},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":922}]}
