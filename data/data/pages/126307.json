It is along the coast of the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. The Persian phrase \"Mahi khoran\", fish-eaters (\"Mahi\" = fish + \"khor\" = eat) is believed to be the origin of the modern word \"Makran\".\nThe narrow coastal plain rises very rapidly into several mountain ranges. The coastline is 1,000\u00A0km, 750\u00A0km of this is in Pakistan. The climate is very dry with very little rainfall.\nHistory.\nAccording to the book Documents on the Persian Gulf's name \" and ENCYCLOPEDIA Iranika [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/makran] Makran also Mekran and Mokr\u0101n historically in persian and Arabic text was a vast area from Hormuz strait to the Sind River some mentioned as far as gujarat region.also the body of water in that region was called Macran Sea.The name Makr\u0101n has found a popular etymology in m\u0101hi-\u1E35\u1D5Bor\u0101n \u201Cfish eaters,\u201D but more probable is a connection with the name Magan,or Maka of the Old Persian.\nUntil the early Islamic period, eastern Makr\u0101n at least must have been within the sphere of Indian religion and culture.\nOn his way homewards from the Far East in 1290, Marco Polo (II, pp. 334-35) sailed along the Makr\u0101n coast, calling it KisMacoran (i.e. Tiz Makr\u0101n), considering it as the last province of India and attributing to it a ruler of its own. In the early 14th century, Ebn Ba\u1E6D\u1E6Du\u1E6Da (II, pp. 341-2) records that, after the death of the Il-Khanid sultan (i.e. after 736/1335), a certain Malek Din\u0101r took power in Makr\u0101n. It was during these centuries that Makr\u0101n was colonized by Baluch tribesmen moving southeastwards from Persia, so that it is today mostly Baluch-speaking. The boundary between Persian Makr\u0101n and that part coming within the British Indian province of Baluchistan (the easternmost part forming the Native State of Las Bela) and after 1947 within Pakistan, was demarcated by an Anglo-Persian Boundary Commission in 1870-72.[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/makran]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":35},{"uri":"Balochistan_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Balochistan","offset":72},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":88},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":97},{"uri":"Arabian_Sea","surface_form":"Arabian Sea","offset":136},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Oman","surface_form":"Gulf of Oman","offset":156},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":174},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":316},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":324},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":427},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":441},{"uri":"Documents_on_the_Persian_Gulf%27s_name","surface_form":"Documents on the Persian Gulf's name","offset":519},{"uri":"Gujarat","surface_form":"gujarat","offset":778},{"uri":"Ebn_Ba%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADu%E1%B9%ADa","surface_form":"Ebn Ba\u1E6D\u1E6Du\u1E6Da","offset":1394}]}
