{"id":126330,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler_(Doctor_Who)","text":"Rose Marion Tyler is a character in the British television series \"Doctor Who\". She was played by Billie Piper. Rose was a companion of the Doctor.\nThe character was created by series producer Russell T Davies. When \"Doctor Who\" was returned to television in 2005, Rose was introduced in the show as a new \"companion\" of series protagonist the Doctor, in his Ninth and later Tenth bodies. A regular companion of the Doctor for all of series one and series two, Rose also returned in the programme's fourth series having Changed in the gap between them.\nSeries 1.\nWhen first seen, Rose is 19 years old and working in a shop named Henrik's. She has a boyfriend named Mickey Smith, and lives in a apartment with her mother Jackie Tyler in the Powell Estate in London. Rose left school without taking her A-levels but won the bronze medal in an under-sevens gymnastics competition at her school. Her father, Pete Tyler died in 1987 in a car accident, the year after Rose was born. When she was twelve, she received a red bicycle for Christmas, which was given to her by the Doctor after meeting Rose in the future.\nNinth Doctor saves her from aliens named Autons then he destroy the building. She helps the Doctor to defeat the autons then decides to travel with him.\nWhile they are travelling, the Doctor and Rose realise that the words \"Bad Wolf\" follow them around. They discover that Rose herself is the Bad Wolf, and that the words are a message. They tell Rose that she must travel to the future to absorb the energies of the time vortex, to save the Doctor and the Earth from the Daleks. By absorbing the power of the TARDIS, she destroy the Daleks, brings Captain Jack back to life and leaves the words \"Bad Wolf\" through the universe as clues that are seen throughout the series.\nSoon the energies she absorbed begin to destroy her body. The Doctor, through a kiss, absorbs the power, sacrificing his ninth incarnation and regenerating before Rose's eyes into the Tenth Doctor.\nSeries 2.\nAt the beginning of season 2, Rose and the Doctor travel \"farther than we've ever gone before\" to New New Earth. There they meet the Face of Boe again and help defeat some cat-nurses. Over the course of season two, we learn that Rose has a crush on the Doctor, a point that is made strongly in 2.03 (when she competes for the Doctor's affections with former companion, Sarah Jane Smith) and 2.04 (when the Doctor falls for Madame de Pompadour). Toward the end of the season, the Doctor starts to return affection for Rose, ending in the finale where Rose is trapped in a parallel universe (that looks just like ours) with her mother, Jackie, Mickey, and her parallel-universe father, Peter Tyler.\nSeries 4.\nRose makes a number of little, non-speaking appearances throughout series four.\nIn \"Turn Left\", when a Time Beetle causes Donna to change the past and change the universe, Rose continually appears to her and helps her to set things right by sending her back in time. She also gives Donna the message \"Bad Wolf\" to deliver to the Doctor, which tells him that it is the end of the universe. Rose is reunited with the Doctor in \"The Stolen Earth\", but as the two run towards each other, the Doctor is shot down by a Dalek. A sad Rose, reunited with Jack Harkness for the first time since she resurrected him in \"The Parting of the Ways\", is forced to watch the Doctor begin to regenerate again.\nIn \"Journey's End\" the Doctor regenerates just enough to heal himself, moving the rest of his 'Time Lord' regenerative energy into his hand that was cut off in the series two episode \"The Christmas Invasion\". Donna later touches the hand, and the energy that flows into her creates a weird event called a 'biological metacrisis'. This metacrisis causes the hand to develop into a part human, part time lord version of the Doctor, complete with the Doctor's memories, personality and knowledge, but exhibiting traits of Donna's personality. This mixed version of the Doctor also has only one heart, and he can't regenerate. The original Doctor returns Rose to her alternate universe's Bad Wolf Bay. Between themselves, the original Doctor and the half-human Doctor have decided that the half-human Doctor will stay with Rose; this Doctor can give Rose a romantic relationship, as he will age and die as a human rather than greatly outliving her like his Time Lord counterpart would. The Doctor tells Rose that his half-human self needs her as he was \"born of blood and fire and revenge\" much like his previous body was after the Time War. He believes Rose can help turn him into a \"better man\". When the half-human Doctor seemingly completes the sentence the original Doctor started at the end of \"Doomsday\" they kiss each other. And although we do not hear what the half-human Doctor had whispered to Rose, executive producer Julie Gardner confirmed in Doctor Who Confidential that \"even though we don't hear it, of course he's saying 'I love you'.\"\nThe Doctor then leaves Rose and her Doctor in their parallel universe, the walls once again sealed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":40},{"uri":"Doctor_Who","surface_form":"Doctor Who","offset":67},{"uri":"Billie_Piper","surface_form":"Billie Piper","offset":98},{"uri":"Companion_(Doctor_Who)","surface_form":"companion","offset":123},{"uri":"Doctor_(Doctor_Who)","surface_form":"the Doctor","offset":136},{"uri":"Russell_T_Davies","surface_form":"Russell T Davies","offset":193},{"uri":"Companion_(Doctor_Who)","surface_form":"companion","offset":307},{"uri":"Doctor_(Doctor_Who)","surface_form":"the Doctor","offset":340},{"uri":"Mickey_Smith","surface_form":"Mickey Smith","offset":665},{"uri":"Gymnastics","surface_form":"gymnastics","offset":854},{"uri":"Pete_Tyler","surface_form":"Pete Tyler","offset":904},{"uri":"Ninth_Doctor","surface_form":"Ninth Doctor","offset":1111},{"uri":"Bad_Wolf","surface_form":"Bad Wolf","offset":1404},{"uri":"Time_vortex_(Doctor_Who)","surface_form":"time vortex","offset":1528},{"uri":"Dalek","surface_form":"Dalek","offset":1583},{"uri":"Doctor_Who","surface_form":"regenerating","offset":1928},{"uri":"Face_of_Boe","surface_form":"Face of Boe","offset":2126},{"uri":"Sarah_Jane_Smith","surface_form":"Sarah Jane Smith","offset":2362},{"uri":"Madame_de_Pompadour","surface_form":"Madame de Pompadour","offset":2416},{"uri":"Turn_Left_(Doctor_Who)","surface_form":"Turn Left","offset":2784},{"uri":"The_Parting_of_the_Ways","surface_form":"The Parting of the Ways","offset":3309}]}
