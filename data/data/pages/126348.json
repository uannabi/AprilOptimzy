{"id":126348,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_armies","text":"e=\"preserve\">The presidency armies were the armies of the three presidencies of British India. The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the East India Company until the Indian Mutiny, when the British government took over all three presidencies. Eventually all three presidency armies were merged into the Indian Army.\nBefore the rebellion.\nFrom the mid-eighteenth century, the East India Company began to keep armies at each of its three main stations, or \u2018Presidencies\u2019, in India at Calcutta (Bengal), Madras and Bombay. The Bengal Army, Madras Army, and Bombay Army were quite different, each with its own list of Regiments and European officers. All three armies had both European regiments in which both the officers and men were Europeans, and a larger number of \u2018Native\u2019 regiments in which the officers were Europeans and the ordinary soldiers were Indians.\nAlso from the mid-eighteenth century the British government began to send regiments of the regular British Army to India to reinforce the Company\u2019s armies. These troops are often referred to as \u2018H.M.\u2019s Regiments\u2019 or \u2018Royal regiments\u2019.\nAfter the rebellion.\nFollowing the Indian rebellion of 1857-58 and the end of the East India Company, its European regiments were joined in 1860 with the British Army, but its \u2018Native\u2019 regiments were not. The three separate Presidency Armies continued to exist, and their European officers continued to be listed as members of the Bengal, Madras or Bombay Army rather than the British Army. However, the Presidency Armies began to be described as the Indian Army. Also after the rebellion artillery was only to be used by the British Army and not by Indian troops.\nIn the 1890s, the separate Presidency Armies were joined together to form the Indian Army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"armies","offset":44},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":80},{"uri":"Honourable_East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":168},{"uri":"Indian_Mutiny","surface_form":"Indian Mutiny","offset":197},{"uri":"British_Indian_Army","surface_form":"Indian Army","offset":334},{"uri":"Calcutta","surface_form":"Calcutta","offset":513},{"uri":"Madras","surface_form":"Madras","offset":532},{"uri":"Bombay","surface_form":"Bombay","offset":543},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":1617}]}
