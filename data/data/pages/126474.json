{"id":126474,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Spire","text":"The Chicago Spire is a very large skyscraper that was being built in Chicago, Illinois. Because of financial problems, the project has not been finished.\nAs of May 2013, however, interest in the Chicago Spire site has risen, drawing in at least a half-dozen offers for the property. The developer is also considering a bid to take back control of the property, reigniting hope that the 2,000\u00A0ft. skyscraper may actually be built. In 2014, a Chicago court ruled in favor of not building the skyscraper thus abandoning plans of it being constructed.\nThe Gateway Tower, a proposed tall condo, is proposed to be built on the site of where the Spire would have been built.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":34},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":69},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":78},{"uri":"Gateway_Tower_(Chicago)","surface_form":"Gateway Tower","offset":552}]}
