{"id":126511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaking","text":"Printmaking is making art by printing pictures, normally on paper. The advantage of printmaking is that lots of the same picture can be printed. This is called a print. Each print is not a copy, but an original, since it came from the same source (not like painting or drawing).You can also use different types of techniques to start the print.\nMaterials.\nPictures for prints can be cut into plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Prints may also be published in books by the artist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Printing","surface_form":"printing","offset":29},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":60},{"uri":"Source","surface_form":"source","offset":240},{"uri":"Paint","surface_form":"paint","offset":257},{"uri":"Draw","surface_form":"draw","offset":269},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":417},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":427},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"engraving","offset":436},{"uri":"Etching","surface_form":"etching","offset":449},{"uri":"Lithography","surface_form":"lithography","offset":474},{"uri":"Woodcut","surface_form":"woodcut","offset":506},{"uri":"Linocut","surface_form":"linocut","offset":529},{"uri":"Screen-printing","surface_form":"screen-printing","offset":560},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":596}]}
