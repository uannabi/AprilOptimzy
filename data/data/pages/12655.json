{"id":12655,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule","text":"When something always does the same thing, one can say that there is a rule that it does what it does.\nA \"rule\" in mathematics is a formula which allows a person to work out parts of the solution if he or she has certain information. For example, Pythagoras' theorem is a rule which states that if a person knows the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle he or she can work out the length of the third.\nRules, however, can also means laws created aby people in power - for example, school rules are the \"laws\" of a specific school.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":132},{"uri":"Pythagoras%27_theorem","surface_form":"Pythagoras' theorem","offset":247}]}
