{"id":126645,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Uganda_Programme","text":"The British Uganda Programme was a plan to give a piece of East Africa, owned by the British, to Jewish people to live in. The plan was made to help the Jews in Russia to find somewhere to live after the pogroms.\nThe offer was first made by British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to Theodor Herzl's Zionist group in 1903. He said he would give them 5,000km of the Mau Plateau, Kenya.\nThe idea was brought up during Zionist Congress at its sixth meeting in 1903 in Basel. Many people disagreed with it. In the end the motion passed by 295 to 177 votes.\nProblems.\nThe plateau's high elevation gave it a low temperature, which was good for the European people. However, it was filled with lions and other dangerous animals. This problem made the Zionists politely refuse the offer for the land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":59},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":85},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":97},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":161},{"uri":"Pogroms","surface_form":"pogroms","offset":204},{"uri":"Joseph_Chamberlain","surface_form":"Joseph Chamberlain","offset":268},{"uri":"Theodor_Herzl","surface_form":"Theodor Herzl","offset":290},{"uri":"Zionism","surface_form":"Zionist","offset":306},{"uri":"1903","surface_form":"1903","offset":323},{"uri":"Kilometres","surface_form":"km","offset":361},{"uri":"Mau_Plateau","surface_form":"Mau Plateau","offset":371},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":384},{"uri":"World_Zionist_Organization","surface_form":"Zionist Congress","offset":422},{"uri":"Basel","surface_form":"Basel","offset":471},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":588},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":612},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":648},{"uri":"Lion","surface_form":"lion","offset":693},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":719}]}
