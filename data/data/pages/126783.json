Its last eruption is thought to have been over a thousand years ago.\nThe top of Mount Chimborazo is the farthest away from the centre of the Earth as is possible to get on land. Although Mount Everest is higher, Chimborazo is farther from Earth's center due to the fact that the earth bulges at the equator.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":22},{"uri":"Dormant_volcano","surface_form":"extinct volcano","offset":38},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":57},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruption","offset":75},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":207},{"uri":"Mount_Everest","surface_form":"Mount Everest","offset":253},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":365}]}
