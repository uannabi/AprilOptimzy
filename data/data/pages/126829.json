{"id":126829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process","text":"e=\"preserve\">An adiabatic process is a thermodynamic process where a fluid becomes warmer or cooler without getting heat from, or giving it to, something else. Usually the temperature instead changes because of changes in pressure.\nAdiabatic cooling is the usual cause of cloud<nowiki/>s. When warm, humid air rises due to convection or other cause, water condenses to make clouds, and in some cases precipitation. Convection also causes cold air to sink. This warms it adiabatically, often destroying a cloud and sometimes causing any precipitation to evaporate before hitting the ground.\nDescription.\nIf we take some fluids in an insulated system and expand or compress the system very fast, the system won't be able to gain or loose any heat (from outside of the system). (In reality, you can't get a perfectly insulated system. But in some cases, the heat transfer is so low that we can call them adiabatic process.)\nFrom the first law of thermodynamics, we know that,\nHere, formula_1 is the change of internal energy; formula_1 is the change of heat and formula_1 is the change of work.\nSince there occurs no heat transfer in adiabatic process, the formula_1 becomes 0. So, for adiabatic process, the equation is,\nAgain, we know that formula_1.(formula_1;formula_1; formula_1; so, formula_1)\nHere, formula_1 is volume; formula_1 is force; formula_1 is pressure; formula_1 is the area and formula_1 is the distance.\nWhich means, by doing work (changing volume), one can change the internal energy (and so the temperature) in a adiabatic process.\nAdiabatic process for ideal gas (for reversible adiabatic process).\nIn the case of Adiabatic process (see the upper section),\nAgain, in constant volume, the heat capacity of one mole gas is,\nHere, formula_1 is the change of temperature and formula_1 is the temperature\u0964\nBut, in constant volume (as no work is done),\nNow, the Ideal gas law for one mole gas is,\nHere, formula_1 is the gas constant.\nBy differentiating the last equation,\nformula_1\nNow from equation (2), we get,\nSince, formula_1 (Mayer's relation),\nHere, formula_1 is the heat capacity of gas at constant pressure.\nBy dividing both sides of the equation (4) with formula_1 we get,\nIntegrating (Integration leaves a constant) the equation (5),\nThis is the relation between pressure and volume in adiabatic process.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamic","offset":39},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":172},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":222},{"uri":"Cloud","surface_form":"cloud","offset":272},{"uri":"Convection","surface_form":"convection","offset":323},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":400},{"uri":"First_law_of_thermodynamics","surface_form":"first law of thermodynamics","offset":930},{"uri":"Internal_energy","surface_form":"internal energy","offset":1006},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":1050},{"uri":"Work","surface_form":"work","offset":1086},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":1316},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":1337},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":1357},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":1384},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":1410},{"uri":"Heat_capacity","surface_form":"heat capacity","offset":1707},{"uri":"Mole_(unit)","surface_form":"mole","offset":1728},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":1774},{"uri":"Ideal_gas","surface_form":"Ideal gas","offset":1875},{"uri":"Gas_constant","surface_form":"gas constant","offset":1933},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"differentiating","offset":1950},{"uri":"Mayer%27s_relation","surface_form":"Mayer's relation","offset":2044},{"uri":"Heat_capacity","surface_form":"heat capacity","offset":2086},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"Integrating","offset":2195}]}
