{"id":127059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind","text":"\"Nevermind\" is the second studio album by the American rock band, Nirvana. It was released on September 24, 1991 by DGC Records. It was produced by Butch Vig and was the first release by the band on the record label. It was also the first release with drummer Dave Grohl.\nEven though it wasn't thought to have been very popular before its release, \"Nevermind\" was a very big success. On January 11, 1992, it had reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200. The main single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was very successful and reached number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The three other singles were: \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", and \"In Bloom\". \"Nevermind\" was selling up to 300,000 copies a week between 1991 and 1992.\n\"Nevermind\" has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums ever. \"Nevermind\" helped to make both grunge music and alternative rock popular. It has been known as one of the greatest albums of all time.\nBackground.\nNirvana was a rock band from Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain (vocals and guitar) and Krist Novoselic (bass guitar) in 1987. They first signed to the Seattle record label Sub Pop. The band released their first album on this label called \"Bleach\" in 1989 with Chad Channing on drums. Channing left Nirvana after this album in 1990, and the band needed a drummer. After seeing punk band Scream, Cobain and Novoselic liked the drumming by Dave Grohl. When Scream broke up after this, Grohl joined Nirvana as the drummer.\nDuring the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was having a difficult time with money. Because of this, Nirvana looked for a new record label. They ended up signing with DGC Records\nTitle and cover.\nThe first name for the album before its release was \"Sheep\". This came from the kind of people Cobain thought were going to buy the album (sheep is a word meaning someone who does what other people do). The title was later changed to \"Nevermind\" as it was what Cobain thought about bad things in his life.\nThe album cover of \"Nevermind\" shows a naked baby (Spencer Elden) swimming underwater with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook. This is just out of the baby's reach. Cobain wanted to have a photo of a water birth on the cover but the record label wouldn't let him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":26},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":46},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":55},{"uri":"Nirvana_(band)","surface_form":"Nirvana","offset":66},{"uri":"DGC_Records","surface_form":"DGC Records","offset":116},{"uri":"Butch_Vig","surface_form":"Butch Vig","offset":148},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":203},{"uri":"Dave_Grohl","surface_form":"Dave Grohl","offset":260},{"uri":"US_Billboard_200","surface_form":"US \"Billboard\" 200","offset":438},{"uri":"Single","surface_form":"single","offset":467},{"uri":"Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit","surface_form":"Smells Like Teen Spirit","offset":476},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":551},{"uri":"Come_as_You_Are_(Nirvana_song)","surface_form":"Come as You Are","offset":603},{"uri":"Lithium_(Nirvana_song)","surface_form":"Lithium","offset":622},{"uri":"In_Bloom","surface_form":"In Bloom","offset":637},{"uri":"List_of_best-selling_albums","surface_form":"best-selling albums","offset":799},{"uri":"Grunge_music","surface_form":"grunge music","offset":857},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":874},{"uri":"Aberdeen%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Aberdeen, Washington","offset":1002},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":1034},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"vocals","offset":1047},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":1058},{"uri":"Krist_Novoselic","surface_form":"Krist Novoselic","offset":1070},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":1087},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":1134},{"uri":"Sub_Pop","surface_form":"Sub Pop","offset":1155},{"uri":"Bleach_(Nirvana_album)","surface_form":"\"Bleach\"","offset":1221},{"uri":"Chad_Channing","surface_form":"Chad Channing","offset":1243},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":1260},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk","offset":1359},{"uri":"Scream_(band)","surface_form":"Scream","offset":1369},{"uri":"Dave_Grohl","surface_form":"Dave Grohl","offset":1420},{"uri":"DGC_Records","surface_form":"DGC Records","offset":1664},{"uri":"Album_cover","surface_form":"album cover","offset":2003},{"uri":"Naked","surface_form":"naked","offset":2038},{"uri":"Swimming","surface_form":"swimming","offset":2065},{"uri":"U.S._dollar","surface_form":"U.S. dollar","offset":2092},{"uri":"Fishhook","surface_form":"fishhook","offset":2114},{"uri":"Birth","surface_form":"birth","offset":2203}]}
