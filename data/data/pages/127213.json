{"id":127213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillertal","text":"The Zillertal is the biggest valley branching off the Inntal in Tyrol, Austria drained by the river Ziller. It is surrounded by the strongly glaciated Zillertaler Alpen to the south and east, the lower grass peaks of the Kitzb\u00FCheler Alpen to the east and Tuxer Alpen to the west. The largest settlement is Mayrhofen.\nCulture.\nThe Zillertal is particularly renowned for its musical tradition. For instance, several families of travelling singers and organ builders from the valley have been credited with spreading the Christmas carol \"Silent Night\" across the world during the 19th and early 20th centuries. More recently, the Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger band have had tremendous success in German-speaking countries with their crossover mix of \"Volksmusik\" and pop.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Inn_(river)","surface_form":"Inntal","offset":54},{"uri":"Tyrol_(state)","surface_form":"Tyrol","offset":64},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":71},{"uri":"Ziller","surface_form":"Ziller","offset":100},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glaciated","offset":141},{"uri":"Zillertal_Alps","surface_form":"Zillertaler Alpen","offset":151},{"uri":"Kitzb%C3%BCheler_Alpen","surface_form":"Kitzb\u00FCheler Alpen","offset":221},{"uri":"Tux_Alps","surface_form":"Tuxer Alpen","offset":255},{"uri":"Mayrhofen","surface_form":"Mayrhofen","offset":306},{"uri":"Christmas_carol","surface_form":"Christmas carol","offset":518},{"uri":"Silent_Night","surface_form":"Silent Night","offset":535},{"uri":"Sch%C3%BCrzenj%C3%A4ger","surface_form":"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger","offset":627},{"uri":"Fusion_(music)","surface_form":"crossover","offset":714},{"uri":"Volksmusik","surface_form":"Volksmusik","offset":732},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":748}]}
