{"id":127258,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo","text":"Polo is a sport. It is played between two teams of 4 players on ponies (small horses). The players try to score goals (points) by putting the ball in the goal. They use long mallets (long sticks). It is the state sport of the Ancient iran.\nOrigins.\nVarious forms of Polo, and similar sports, have been long played, traditionally, throughout a wide range covering Assam and Manipur areas of India, Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet, and the Northern valleys of Pakistan such as Gilgit, Hunza Valley, Baltistan and Chitral District and parts of Central Asia as well. In ancient Persia, \"Chavgan\", another form of Polo, was also played. It was only in the mid-19th century that colonial officers in British India began to play this sport and imported it to Britain, where the formal Hurlingham Rules were then laid down. Later, in the 1890s, Polo was also introduced to the United States.\nThe main rules of polo.\nThere are two teams both with 4 players. They play on a field which is 300 yards long (about 275 meters) and 160 or 200 yards wide (about 146 and 183 meters). There are goalposts (long sticks in the ground) 8 yards (7.32 meters) apart at each end of the field. To score, the ball has to go between the other team's goalposts, which is called a goal.\nThe game is 4, 6 or 8 periods (units of time) of 7 minutes, which are called \"chukkas\". Between chukkas, players change ponies.\nIn a game there are 2 umpires on horses and a referee on the side.\nPolo ponies.\nThe ponies are 14.2 to 16 hands (1 hand equals 4 inches or 10.16 centimetres). They weigh between 900 and 1100lbs-pounds- (about 408 and 499 kilos). Ponies can be ridden to play from the age of 5 up to 18 or even 20 years old sometimes.\nEquipment.\nThe players have a helmet (hard hat), riding boots, white trousers, a shirt with the player's number on. Sometimes players also have one or two gloves, knee-pads and a whip.\nThe ball is made of plastic. Before, it was made of wood. The ball is about 3\u00BC inches (8.3 centimetres) in diameter and weighs about four ounces (113.4 grams).\nPolo saddles are English-style, similar to jumping saddles.\nOther forms of polo.\nPolo is not always played on ponies. Canoe polo, cycle polo, camel polo, elephant polo, golf cart polo, Segway polo, BMX polo, yak polo and water polo also exist. However most of these forms are not played at a professional level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":10},{"uri":"Team","surface_form":"team","offset":42},{"uri":"Player","surface_form":"player","offset":53},{"uri":"Pony","surface_form":"ponies","offset":64},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":78},{"uri":"Score","surface_form":"score","offset":106},{"uri":"Goal","surface_form":"goals","offset":112},{"uri":"Ball","surface_form":"ball","offset":142},{"uri":"The_Ancient_iran","surface_form":"the Ancient iran","offset":222},{"uri":"Assam","surface_form":"Assam","offset":363},{"uri":"Manipur","surface_form":"Manipur","offset":373},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":390},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":397},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":406},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":416},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":451},{"uri":"Gilgit","surface_form":"Gilgit","offset":468},{"uri":"Hunza_Valley","surface_form":"Hunza Valley","offset":476},{"uri":"Baltistan","surface_form":"Baltistan","offset":490},{"uri":"Chitral_District","surface_form":"Chitral District","offset":504},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":534},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":567},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":687},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":745},{"uri":"Hurlingham_Rules","surface_form":"Hurlingham Rules","offset":771},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":862},{"uri":"Field","surface_form":"field","offset":957},{"uri":"Apart","surface_form":"apart","offset":1130},{"uri":"Goal","surface_form":"goal","offset":1245},{"uri":"Minute","surface_form":"minute","offset":1302},{"uri":"Umpire","surface_form":"umpire","offset":1401},{"uri":"Referee","surface_form":"referee","offset":1425},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":1508},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"centimetre","offset":1524},{"uri":"Helmet","surface_form":"helmet","offset":1726},{"uri":"Boot","surface_form":"boot","offset":1752},{"uri":"Trousers","surface_form":"trousers","offset":1765},{"uri":"Shirt","surface_form":"shirt","offset":1777},{"uri":"Glove","surface_form":"glove","offset":1851},{"uri":"Whip","surface_form":"whip","offset":1875},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":1901},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1933},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":1988},{"uri":"Weigh","surface_form":"weighs","offset":2001},{"uri":"Ounce","surface_form":"ounce","offset":2019},{"uri":"Saddle","surface_form":"saddle","offset":2046},{"uri":"Canoe","surface_form":"Canoe","offset":2159},{"uri":"Camel","surface_form":"camel","offset":2183},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":2195},{"uri":"Golf_cart","surface_form":"golf cart","offset":2210},{"uri":"Segway","surface_form":"Segway","offset":2226},{"uri":"BMX","surface_form":"BMX","offset":2239},{"uri":"Yak","surface_form":"yak","offset":2249},{"uri":"Water_polo","surface_form":"water polo","offset":2262},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":2333}]}
