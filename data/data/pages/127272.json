It was not a successful product and was Atari's last console. It also had a CD-based accessory called the Atari Jaguar CD.\nThe Atari Jaguar was sold at about the same time as the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64, but it was not very popular as it did not have as many popular games as these other consoles. The graphics of Atari Jaguar games look a lot like the Sega Genesis, Sega Mega Drive or SNES games as it did not run 3D games as well as the Sega Saturn or PlayStation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":23},{"uri":"Atari","surface_form":"Atari","offset":54},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":63},{"uri":"Atari_Jaguar_CD","surface_form":"Atari Jaguar CD","offset":175},{"uri":"Sega_Genesis","surface_form":"Sega Genesis","offset":439},{"uri":"Sega_Mega_Drive","surface_form":"Sega Mega Drive","offset":453},{"uri":"SNES","surface_form":"SNES","offset":472},{"uri":"Sega_Saturn","surface_form":"Sega Saturn","offset":525},{"uri":"PlayStation","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":540}]}
