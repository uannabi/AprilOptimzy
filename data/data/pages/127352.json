{"id":127352,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate","text":"e=\"preserve\">A cognate is a word derived from the same root as another word. Cognates are words that have a common origin (source). They may happen in a language or in a group of languages.\n\"nuit\" (French), \"noche\" (Spanish), \"Nacht\" (German), \"nacht\" (Dutch), \"nag\" (Afrikaans), \"nicht\" (Scots), \"natt\" (Swedish, Norwegian), \"nat\" (Danish), \"n\u00E1tt\" (Faroese), \"n\u00F3tt\" (Icelandic), \"noc\" (Czech, Slovak, Polish), \u043D\u043E\u0447\u044C, \"noch\" (Russian), \u043D\u043E\u045C, \"no\u0107\" (Macedonian), \u043D\u043E\u0449, \"nosht\" (Bulgarian), \"\u043D\u0456\u0447\", \"nich\" (Ukrainian), \"\u043D\u043E\u0447\", \"noch\"/\"no\u010D\" (Belarusian), \"no\u010D\" (Slovene), \"no\u0107\" (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian), \u03BD\u03CD\u03BE, \"nyx\" (Ancient Greek, \"\u03BD\u03CD\u03C7\u03C4\u03B1\"/\"nychta\" in Modern Greek), \"nox/nocte\" (Latin), \"nakt-\" (Sanskrit), \"nat\u00EB\" (Albanian), \"nos\" (Welsh), \"nueche\" (Asturian), \"noite\" (Portuguese and Galician), \"notte\" (Italian), \"nit\" (Catalan), \"nu\u00E8ch/nu\u00E8it\" (Occitan), \"noapte\" (Romanian), \"nakts\" (Latvian), \"naktis\" (Lithuanian) and \"Naach\" (Colognian), all meaning \"night\" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European n\u00F3k\u02B7ts (\"night\").\nBasic English uses cognates, such as animal, attention, night, apparatus, experience, brother, invention, metal, etc.\nHistory.\nThe word 'cognate' is derived from the Latin word 'cognatus' meaning 'to be born with'.\nIn reading Churchill's \"History of the English Speaking Peoples\", it would be well to keep in mind (remember) what George Bernard Shaw says: \"England and America are two countries divided by a common language.\"\nSpeakers of British English and American English face the problem of meeting \"false friends\".\nFalse friends.\nAs a rule, similar-sounding words have the same meaning but when they do not, they are called \"false friends\".\nExample one: Spanish 'actual' and English 'actual' are cognates because they have the same root (origin) but they are \"false friends\" because Spanish 'actual' means \"of the present moment\" while English 'actual' means \"real\".\nExample two: German 'hell', Norwegian 'hell' and English 'hell' are not cognates, but are spelled the same. In German, 'hell' means 'light' and in Norwegian it means 'luck', while in English it means hell.\nFalse cognates.\nSometimes, two words look alike and it appears that they are cognates but they are not because they are not derived from the same root.\nExample one: In the English language, the word 'light' (something that makes things visible) is not a cognate of the word 'light' (not heavy) because they are not derived from the same root.\nExample two: The German word 'haben' and the English word 'have' mean the same thing and they appear to be cognates but they are not simply because they are not derived from the same root.\nExample three: The Japanese word 'okiru' \u8D77\u304D\u308B and the English word 'occur' have the same thing happening as example two.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":28},{"uri":"Derive","surface_form":"derived","offset":33},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":55},{"uri":"Source","surface_form":"source","offset":123},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":153},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":198},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":216},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":235},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":253},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":268},{"uri":"Scots_language","surface_form":"Scots","offset":289},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":305},{"uri":"Norwegian_language","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":314},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":333},{"uri":"Faroese_language","surface_form":"Faroese","offset":350},{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic","offset":368},{"uri":"Czech_language","surface_form":"Czech","offset":387},{"uri":"Slovak_language","surface_form":"Slovak","offset":394},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":402},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":425},{"uri":"Macedonian_language","surface_form":"Macedonian","offset":447},{"uri":"Bulgarian_language","surface_form":"Bulgarian","offset":474},{"uri":"Ukrainian_language","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":501},{"uri":"Belarusian_language","surface_form":"Belarusian","offset":534},{"uri":"Slovene_language","surface_form":"Slovene","offset":554},{"uri":"Bosnian_language","surface_form":"Bosnian","offset":571},{"uri":"Serbian_language","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":580},{"uri":"Croatian_language","surface_form":"Croatian","offset":589},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":612},{"uri":"Modern_Greek","surface_form":"Modern Greek","offset":647},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":675},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":692},{"uri":"Albanian_language","surface_form":"Albanian","offset":711},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":729},{"uri":"Asturian_language","surface_form":"Asturian","offset":747},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":767},{"uri":"Galician_language","surface_form":"Galician","offset":782},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":802},{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":819},{"uri":"Occitan_language","surface_form":"Occitan","offset":844},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":864},{"uri":"Latvian_language","surface_form":"Latvian","offset":884},{"uri":"Lithuanian_language","surface_form":"Lithuanian","offset":904},{"uri":"Colognian_language","surface_form":"Colognian","offset":929},{"uri":"Basic_English","surface_form":"Basic English","offset":1026},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":1063},{"uri":"Apparatus","surface_form":"apparatus","offset":1089},{"uri":"Experience","surface_form":"experience","offset":1100},{"uri":"Brother","surface_form":"brother","offset":1112},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invention","offset":1121},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":1132},{"uri":"Etc","surface_form":"etc","offset":1139},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1192},{"uri":"Churchill","surface_form":"Churchill","offset":1252},{"uri":"George_Bernard_Shaw","surface_form":"George Bernard Shaw","offset":1356},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1383},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":1395},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":1464},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":1484},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":2098},{"uri":"Have","surface_form":"have","offset":2506}]}
