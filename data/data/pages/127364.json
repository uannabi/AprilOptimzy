{"id":127364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyptodon","text":"\"Glyptodon\" is part of the placental group of mammals known as Xenarthra. This order of mammals includes anteaters, tree sloths, extinct ground sloths, extinct pampatheres, and armadillos.\n\"Glyptodon\" came from South America. A related genus, \"Glyptotherium\", first appeared in the south-west of the modern USA about 2.5 million years ago as a result of the Great American Interchange.\nThese herbivores (plant-eaters) would not have been vulnerable to the Sparassodont carnivores of the day. The native human population in their range is believed to have hunted them and used the shells for shelter in bad weather.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Xenarthra","surface_form":"Xenarthra","offset":63},{"uri":"Anteater","surface_form":"anteater","offset":105},{"uri":"Sloth","surface_form":"sloth","offset":121},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":129},{"uri":"Ground_sloth","surface_form":"ground sloth","offset":137},{"uri":"Pampatheriidae","surface_form":"pampatheres","offset":160},{"uri":"Armadillo","surface_form":"armadillo","offset":177},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":211},{"uri":"Glyptotherium","surface_form":"Glyptotherium","offset":244},{"uri":"Great_American_Interchange","surface_form":"Great American Interchange","offset":358},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":392},{"uri":"Vulnerable","surface_form":"vulnerable","offset":438},{"uri":"Sparassodont","surface_form":"Sparassodont","offset":456}]}
