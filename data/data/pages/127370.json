{"id":127370,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhshali_manuscript","text":"=\"preserve\">The Bakhshali Manuscript is a mathematical manuscript written on birch bark. It was found in 1881 near the village of Bakhshali in what was then the North-West Frontier Province of British India (now Pakistan). Most of the manuscript is missing, only seventy leaves of birch bark remain.\nNo-one knows how old it is and different scholars have come up with different dates. Most scholars agree that the manuscript is a copy of a more ancient text.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":42},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":55},{"uri":"Birch_bark","surface_form":"birch bark","offset":77},{"uri":"Bakhshali","surface_form":"Bakhshali","offset":130},{"uri":"Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","surface_form":"North-West Frontier Province","offset":161},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":193},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":212},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":271},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":341},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":445}]}
