He was a founding member of The Hollies, but left that band to form Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby and Stephen Stills. He moved to California to be part of the new group, which Neil Young also joined later.\nWhile Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young broke apart and came back together many times, Nash has almost always worked with David Crosby since the 1960s.\nNash became an American citizen in 1978. Besides music, he is also a talented photographer, and collector of photographs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blackpool%2C_England","surface_form":"Blackpool, England","offset":45},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":70},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":78},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":88},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":99},{"uri":"The_Hollies","surface_form":"The Hollies","offset":139},{"uri":"Crosby%2C_Stills_%26amp%3B_Nash","surface_form":"Crosby, Stills & Nash","offset":179},{"uri":"David_Crosby","surface_form":"David Crosby","offset":206},{"uri":"Stephen_Stills","surface_form":"Stephen Stills","offset":223},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":251},{"uri":"Neil_Young","surface_form":"Neil Young","offset":297},{"uri":"Crosby%2C_Stills%2C_Nash_%26amp%3B_Young","surface_form":"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young","offset":333},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":498},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":552}]}
