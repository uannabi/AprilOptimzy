It was founded in Bologna, Italy in about 1088.\nThe university received a charter from Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158. In the 19th century, a committee of historians traced the founding of the University back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuous university in the world. That is slightly earlier than the University of Oxford, where there is evidence of teaching in 1096.\nBologna was also the first to use the term \"universitas\" for the corporation of students and masters which make up a university.\nHistory.\nIn the Middle Ages, the University of Bologna was famous in all Europe for its schools of humanities and law.\nThe poets Dante and Petrarca studied at this university.
