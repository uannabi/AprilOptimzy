It was first published in 1982 by Lord Northcliffe. It sells the second biggest amount of Sunday newspapers in Britain after\"The News of the World\". The \"Daily Mail\" was launched nearly a century before(1896) and is The Mail on Sunday's \"sister paper\".\nThey are both owned by Associated Newspapers, but the editorial staff are completely separate.\nHistory.\n\"The Mail on Sunday\" was first launched on 2 May 1982, to go with the \"Daily Mail\". The first story ever printed on the front page was the \"RAF's bombing of Port Stanley airport in the Falklands\". The Daily Mail and General Trust(DMGT)came up with some tough targets for the paper to reach. Initially DMGT wanted to sell 1.25 million copies a week. But the launch of The Mail on Sunday was not a success. After six weeks, sales were only around 700,000 copies.\nToday (2008)the circulation is around 2.3 million, an increase of more than 1.5 million.\nThe newspaper's reputation developed thanks to Stewart Steven. Its circulation grew from around 1 million to almost 2 million during his time in charge. The editor who followed him was Jonathan Holborow and the current editor is Peter Wright.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":26},{"uri":"The_News_of_the_World","surface_form":"The News of the World","offset":214},{"uri":"Daily_Mail","surface_form":"Daily Mail","offset":243},{"uri":"Associated_Newspapers","surface_form":"Associated Newspapers","offset":365},{"uri":"2_May","surface_form":"2 May","offset":489},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":495},{"uri":"Port_Stanley","surface_form":"Port Stanley","offset":603},{"uri":"Falklands","surface_form":"Falklands","offset":631},{"uri":"General_Trust","surface_form":"General Trust","offset":662},{"uri":"Increase","surface_form":"increase","offset":961}]}
