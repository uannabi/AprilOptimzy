{"id":12747,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazko_Cone","text":"=\"preserve\">Nazko Cone is a small volcano in central British Columbia, Canada. It is approximately 75\u00A0km west of the town of Quesnel. It is in the eastern part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The most recent eruption of Nazko Cone was 7200 years ago.\nA series of small earthquakes occurred in the area of Nazko Cone beginning on October 10, 2007. Most of these earthquakes were magnitude 1.0 or less; some as strong as magnitude 3.2 were centered 25 kilometers below the surface. The cause of these earthquakes is believed to be the rising of molten magma because there are no faults or tectonic plate boundaries. The source of this magma is from the Anahim hotspot and continues to this day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":34},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":53},{"uri":"Anahim_Volcanic_Belt","surface_form":"Anahim Volcanic Belt","offset":167},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruption","offset":205},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":266},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":547},{"uri":"Fault","surface_form":"fault","offset":574},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":584},{"uri":"Anahim_hotspot","surface_form":"Anahim hotspot","offset":648}]}
