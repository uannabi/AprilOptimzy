{"id":12749,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilcotin_Group","text":"Chilcotin Plateau basalts cover a large area in British Columbia. Basaltic lava formed a volcanic plateau running parallel with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, about 150\u00A0km from the ocean.\nDuring the Miocene and Pliocene, a volcanic field occurred in British Columbia's Interior Plateau. The basalt is assumed to cover up to 50,000 km2 of the Pacific Northwest. It forms a medium-sized large igneous province, of volume 3300 km3.\nVolcanism still continues from time to time. Eruptions were most vigorous 610 million years ago (mya) and 23 mya, when most of the basalt was released. Smaller eruptions continued from 1.6 mya to 0.01 mya.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":48},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":98},{"uri":"Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt","surface_form":"Garibaldi Volcanic Belt","offset":132},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":197},{"uri":"Pliocene","surface_form":"Pliocene","offset":209},{"uri":"Interior_Plateau","surface_form":"Interior Plateau","offset":267},{"uri":"Pacific_Northwest","surface_form":"Pacific Northwest","offset":340},{"uri":"Large_igneous_province","surface_form":"large igneous province","offset":383}]}
