{"id":127703,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem","text":"The theorem says that there will be a solution to this question if there's no common factor between the row sizes. Using the original example, that is that no number divides both 3 and 7, both 3 and 5, nor both 5 and 7 (except, of course, 1). They're all coprime.\nThe Chinese remainder theorem is used in cryptography. For example, for the RSA algorithm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coprime","surface_form":"coprime","offset":255},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":305},{"uri":"RSA_algorithm","surface_form":"RSA algorithm","offset":340}]}
