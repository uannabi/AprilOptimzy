{"id":12773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)","text":"Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is north of Oregon, west of Idaho, east of the Pacific Ocean, and south of British Columbia. (British Columbia is part of Canada.) There are more than 6,000,000 people in Washington. Most live in the western part of Washington, which gets more rain. About a quarter of the people live in the east part, where it gets less rain, and some parts have a desert climate. The largest city on the east part is Spokane, and it is also the second biggest city in the state. The Cascade Mountains go down the middle of the state and break it into two sides. The state's nickname is the \"Evergreen State\" because it has a lot of pine trees. Washington was the 42nd state to join the United States, on November 11, 1889. It is often called \"Washington State\" so that it does not get confused with the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. The name \"Washington\" comes from President George Washington.\nThe capital of Washington is Olympia. Olympia is a small city on the west side of Washington, at the south end of Puget Sound. Washington's biggest city is Seattle, Seattle is also on Puget Sound.\nWashington has many beautiful forests, rivers, gorges (gorges are small canyons), and mountains. Because it's next to the ocean, it has a long beach. However, because Washington is north of Oregon and California (the other two states on the West Coast of the United States), the ocean is cold, and usually not good to swim in.\nThe biggest universities in Washington are the University of Washington and Washington State University. The University of Washington is in Seattle. Washington State University is in a small town called Pullman. Pullman is on the east side of the state.\nGeography and climate.\nThe state of Washington has an extremely varied geography, and therefore an extremely varied climate. The map shows western cities have shipping access. These are the low-lying parts on the next to the Pacific Ocean. The western side of the mountains is wet and forested with conifers. Some areas are temperate rain forests (in the Olympic Mountains).\nThe central area is mountainous, including five volcanos: Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams. To the east of the mountains the land is dry and mostly dry grassland (high plains). Only one feature links the west to the east: the important Snake River, a tributary of the even larger Columbia River.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state","U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":16},{"uri":"Pacific_Northwest","surface_form":"Pacific Northwest","offset":29},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":61},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":91},{"uri":"Idaho","surface_form":"Idaho","offset":107},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":126},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":154},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":201},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":323},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":429},{"uri":"Spokane%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Spokane","offset":482},{"uri":"Cascade_Range","surface_form":"Cascade Mountains","offset":548},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":639},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":886},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":946},{"uri":"Olympia%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Olympia","offset":994},{"uri":"Puget_Sound","surface_form":"Puget Sound","offset":1079},{"uri":"Seattle%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":1121},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1192},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1201},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":1209},{"uri":"Canyon","surface_form":"canyon","offset":1234},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1248},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":1284},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":1352},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1363},{"uri":"West_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"West Coast","offset":1403},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1421},{"uri":"Cold","surface_form":"cold","offset":1450},{"uri":"Swimming","surface_form":"swim","offset":1480},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":1501},{"uri":"University_of_Washington","surface_form":"University of Washington","offset":1536},{"uri":"Washington_State_University","surface_form":"Washington State University","offset":1565},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1680},{"uri":"Pullman%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Pullman","offset":1692},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":1814},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":1859},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":2067},{"uri":"Rain_forests","surface_form":"rain forests","offset":2077},{"uri":"Olympic_Mountains","surface_form":"Olympic Mountains","offset":2098},{"uri":"Mount_Baker","surface_form":"Mount Baker","offset":2176},{"uri":"Glacier_Peak","surface_form":"Glacier Peak","offset":2189},{"uri":"Mount_Rainier","surface_form":"Mount Rainier","offset":2203},{"uri":"Mount_St._Helens","surface_form":"Mount St. Helens","offset":2218},{"uri":"Mount_Adams_(Washington)","surface_form":"Mount Adams","offset":2240},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":2313},{"uri":"Snake_River","surface_form":"Snake River","offset":2397},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":2412},{"uri":"Columbia_River","surface_form":"Columbia River","offset":2441}]}
