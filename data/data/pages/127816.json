{"id":127816,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poales","text":"Poales is a taxonomic order of flowering plants in the monocotyledons. The order includes families of plants such as the grasses, bromeliads, and sedges.\nThe earliest fossils attributed to the Poales date to the late Cretaceous period about million years ago, though some suggest the origin of the group may be 115 million years ago in South America. The earliest known fossils include pollen and fruits.\nThe flowers are typically small, enclosed by bracts, and arranged in inflorescences (except in the genus \"Mayaca\", with solitary terminal flowers). The flowers of many species are wind pollinated; the seeds usually contain starch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomic","offset":12},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":22},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":31},{"uri":"Monocotyledon","surface_form":"monocotyledon","offset":55},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":90},{"uri":"Plants","surface_form":"plants","offset":102},{"uri":"Poaceae","surface_form":"grasses","offset":121},{"uri":"Bromeliaceae","surface_form":"bromeliads","offset":130},{"uri":"Sedge","surface_form":"sedge","offset":146},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":217},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":336},{"uri":"Pollen","surface_form":"pollen","offset":386},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":409},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"inflorescence","offset":474},{"uri":"Mayaca","surface_form":"Mayaca","offset":511},{"uri":"Starch","surface_form":"starch","offset":628}]}
