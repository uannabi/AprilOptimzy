{"id":127817,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae","text":"Poaceae or Gramineae are the \"true\" grasses. They are a large family of Monocot flowering plants. There are about 10,000 species and 660 genera, and they are one of most ecologically and economically important of all plant families.\nRushes, and sedges fall outside this family, but they are related.\nGrasslands are about 20% of the vegetation cover of the Earth. Poaceae also live in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests, and tundra.\nDomestication of poaceous cereal crops such as maize (corn), wheat, millets, and rice are eaten around the world. The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family in modern times, providing forage, building materials (bamboo, thatch) and fuel (ethanol), as well as food.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":62},{"uri":"Monocot","surface_form":"Monocot","offset":72},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":80},{"uri":"Juncaceae","surface_form":"Rushes","offset":233},{"uri":"Cyperaceae","surface_form":"sedges","offset":245},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"Grassland","offset":300},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":356},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"wetland","offset":415},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":425},{"uri":"Tundra","surface_form":"tundra","offset":438},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":472},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":493},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":507},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":527},{"uri":"Bamboo","surface_form":"bamboo","offset":676},{"uri":"Thatch","surface_form":"thatch","offset":684},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":702}]}
