{"id":127837,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes","text":"The Medes were an ancient Arian and Kurdish people who lived in the northwestern portions of present-day Iran. This area was known in Greek as Media or Medea They entered this region with the first wave of Iranian tribes, in the late second millennium BC (at the end of the Bronze Age).\nBy the 6th century BC, the Medes were able to make their own empire. It stretched from southern shore of the Black Sea and Aran province (in modern Azerbaijan) to north and central Asia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Medes had many tributary states, including the Persians, who eventually took over the Median empire as part of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.\nThe Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and Persians, often referred to as the Achaemenid Empire.\nControversy.\nModern scholars question whether a Median empire even existed. It is argued that even if it existed, it must have been just a \"political alliance\" among highland neighbors of the Assyrians. The alliance might include Armenia in southeastern Anatolia, Sagartians in modern northern Iraq, and the actual Medians in the area between what is today Hamadan-Kirmanshah in cental Zagros. Neither cuneiform sources, archaeological evidence, or biblical accounts, support Herodotus, who claimed there really was a Median empire.\nMedian language.\nHerodotus, mentions the word \"Spaka\" (\"Dog\", still present in current Iranian languages such as Kurdish and talysh, and different from Persian)","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Former Country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"ancient Arian and Kurdish people","offset":18},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":105},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":274},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":396},{"uri":"Arran_(Azerbaijan)","surface_form":"Aran","offset":410},{"uri":"Republic_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":435},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"central Asia","offset":460},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":474},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":491},{"uri":"Persians","surface_form":"Persians","offset":552},{"uri":"Achaemenid_Empire","surface_form":"Achaemenid Persian Empire","offset":620},{"uri":"Cyrus_the_Great","surface_form":"Cyrus the Great","offset":748},{"uri":"Persian_people","surface_form":"Persians","offset":818},{"uri":"Achaemenid_Empire","surface_form":"Achaemenid Empire","offset":853},{"uri":"Assyria","surface_form":"Assyria","offset":1064},{"uri":"Urartu","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":1102},{"uri":"Sagartians","surface_form":"Sagartians","offset":1136}]}
