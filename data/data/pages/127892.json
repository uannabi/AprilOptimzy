It is the main radio station for sport in the United Kingdom, covering nearly all big sports events in the UK or with British competitors in, including the Olympics and the football World Cup\nIt is transmitted via analogue radio on 693 and 909 kHz AM in the medium wave band. These frequencies belonged to BBC Radio 2 from November 23, 1978 to August 26, 1990. Before that they were used in some regions of the UK by the BBC Home Service and BBC Radio 4. The radio is also available on digital radio in the United Kingdom via DAB, digital satellite, IPTV, Freeview, and is also streamed online. However, because of rights restrictions, coverage of some events (especially live sporting events) is not available online. Also, some of the content available online is only for UK users.\nOther websites.\nNote that Radio 5 Live operates International and UK feeds. International feeds aren't allowed to cover certain sports events because of local radio rights to those events.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":55},{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio station","offset":61},{"uri":"BBC_News","surface_form":"BBC News","offset":91},{"uri":"BBC_Sport","surface_form":"sports","offset":116},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":162},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":175},{"uri":"Olympics","surface_form":"Olympics","offset":285},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":302},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"World Cup","offset":311},{"uri":"AM_radio","surface_form":"AM","offset":377},{"uri":"Medium_wave","surface_form":"medium wave","offset":387},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_2","surface_form":"BBC Radio 2","offset":435},{"uri":"November_23","surface_form":"November 23","offset":452},{"uri":"1978","surface_form":"1978","offset":465},{"uri":"August_26","surface_form":"August 26","offset":473},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":484},{"uri":"BBC_Home_Service","surface_form":"BBC Home Service","offset":550},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_4","surface_form":"BBC Radio 4","offset":571},{"uri":"Digital_Audio_Broadcasting","surface_form":"DAB","offset":655},{"uri":"Digital_satellite","surface_form":"digital satellite","offset":660},{"uri":"IPTV","surface_form":"IPTV","offset":679},{"uri":"Freeview","surface_form":"Freeview","offset":685}]}
