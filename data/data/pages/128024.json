{"id":128024,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_Flying_Squirrel","text":"The woolly flying squirrel (\"Eupetaurus cinereus\") is a squirrel. It is the only species of the genus \"Eupetaurus\".\nUntil recently scientific knowledge of this rare species was limited to 11 skins collected in the late nineteenth century. However, recent research has confirmed that it is still extant in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (P.A.K). It is the longest member of the family Sciuridae and the most massive gliding animal known, but observations confirm that despite its size, it does glide effectively like other flying squirrels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":56},{"uri":"Pakistan-administered_Kashmir","surface_form":"Pakistan-administered Kashmir","offset":305}]}
