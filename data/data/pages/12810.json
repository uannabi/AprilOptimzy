{"id":12810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number","text":"In mathematics, a rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction. The set of rational number is often represented by the symbol formula_1, standing for \"quotient\" in English.\nRational numbers are all real numbers, and can be positive or negative. A number that is not rational is called irrational.\nMost of the numbers that people use in everyday life are rational. These include fractions, integers and numbers with finite decimal digits. In general, a number that can be written as a fraction while it is in its own form is rational.\nFraction form.\nAll rational numbers can be written as a fraction. Take 1.5 as an example, this can be written as formula_1, formula_1, or formula_1.\nMore examples of fractions that are rational numbers include formula_1, formula_1, and formula_1.\nTerminating decimals.\nA terminating decimal is a decimal with a certain number of digits to the right of the decimal point. Examples include 3.2, 4.075, and -300.12002. All of these are rational. Another good example would be 0.9582938472938498234.\nRepeating decimals.\nA repeating decimal is a decimal where there are infinitely many digits to the right of the decimal point, but which follow a repeating pattern.\nAn example of this is formula_1. As a decimal, it is written as 0.3333333333... The dots indicate that the digit 3 repeats forever.\nSometimes, a group of digits repeats. An example is formula_1. As a decimal, it is written as 0.09090909... In this example, the group of digits 09 repeats.\nAlso, sometimes the digits repeat \"after\" another group of digits. An example is formula_1. It is written as 0.16666666... In this example, the digit 6 repeats, following the digit 1.\nIf you try this on your calculator, sometimes it may make a rounding error at the end. For instance, your calculator may say that formula_1, even though there is no 7. It rounds the 6 at the end up to 7.\nIrrational numbers.\nThe digits after the decimal point in an irrational number do not repeat in an infinite pattern. For instance, the first several digits of \u03C0 (Pi) are 3.1415926535... A few of the digits repeat, but they never start repeating in an infinite pattern, no matter how far you go to the right of the decimal point.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":71},{"uri":"Real_numbers","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":215},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive","offset":240},{"uri":"Negative","surface_form":"negative","offset":252},{"uri":"Irrational_number","surface_form":"irrational","offset":302},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integers","offset":406},{"uri":"Terminating","surface_form":"terminating","offset":822},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal","offset":834},{"uri":"Numerical_digit","surface_form":"digits","offset":880},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinitely","offset":1116},{"uri":"Ellipsis","surface_form":"dots","offset":1296},{"uri":"Pi_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"\u03C0","offset":2048}]}
