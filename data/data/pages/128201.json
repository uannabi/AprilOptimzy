{"id":128201,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherds_Flat_Wind_Farm","text":"Approval has been given for the 303 turbine Shepherds Flat Wind Farm near Arlington, Oregon. The wind farm will be able to generate 909 megawatts (MW) at its peak, which is enough electricity to power some 225,000 homes. The wind farm should employ up to 300 people during construction and about 25 when operational.\nWhen completed, this will be the world's largest wind farm. Currently, the largest operating wind farm in the U.S. is the 736 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center in Texas. Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens plans to build a 4,000 MW Pampa Wind Project by 2014, also in Texas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wind_farm","surface_form":"wind farm","offset":97},{"uri":"Horse_Hollow_Wind_Energy_Center","surface_form":"Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center","offset":446},{"uri":"T._Boone_Pickens","surface_form":"T.
