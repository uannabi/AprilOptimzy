This, along with a chain of Alliances in Europe (Triple Entente and Central Powers) helped cause World War I.\nThe Russian Memorandum of Advice to Serbia.\nThe Russia asked Austria-Hungaria to extend the ultimatum deadline which would allow the Governments of the Great Powers to become acquainted with and to investigate the documents on the Sarajevo crime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Demarche","surface_form":"Demarche","offset":38},{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":57},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":86},{"uri":"Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria","surface_form":"Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria","offset":140},{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":559},{"uri":"Alliance","surface_form":"Alliance","offset":625},{"uri":"Triple_Entente","surface_form":"Triple Entente","offset":646},{"uri":"Central_Powers","surface_form":"Central Powers","offset":665},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":694}]}
