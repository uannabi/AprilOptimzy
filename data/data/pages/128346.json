{"id":128346,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_Black","text":"Sirius Black is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series, played by Gary Oldman. Black, also known as\u00A0Padfoot\u00A0or\u00A0Snuffles\u00A0(in his\u00A0Animagus\u00A0form) was a\u00A0pure-blood\u00A0wizard. He was born on 3rd November, 1959 and is the eldest son of\u00A0Orion and\u00A0Walburga Black. He is heir of the Ancient and Noble house of Black and brother to Regulus. His cousin's are Bellatrix Lestrange (n\u00E9e Black), Andromeda Tonks (n\u00E9e Black) and Narcissa Malfoy (n\u00E9e Black). He was Harry Potter's godfather. He was best friends with James Potter, along with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. These four were known as the Marauders in their school days, and created the Marauder's Map.\nHe, along with his three friends, belonged to Gryffindor house when at Hogwarts, unlike the rest of his family, who had belonged to the house of Slytherin. He did not like his family, and ran away from home to James Potter's house when he was 16. The Potters took Sirius in as their own son. His prized possession during childhood was his flying motorbike.\nSirius was an animagus and was able to transform into a big black dog, (a Grim) which is an omen of death, at will. He, along with James Potter and Peter Pettigrew became Animagus to help Remus Lupin with his transformations. He was the first wizard to escape Azkaban prison, after being kept there twelve years for a crime that he did not commit. The betrayal of James and Lily Potter, the murder of Peter Pettigrew and 12 muggles with an unknown curse. Harry found out, after a year of believing otherwise, that Sirius was an innocent man, and helped him evade capture from the Ministry of Magic. Sirius went on the run before returning to his (empty) childhood home, 12 Grimmauld Place, and offered it up as headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix upon Voldemort's return. He was killed in a battle at the Ministry of Magic by his cousin, a Death Eater, Bellatrix Lestrange in Harry's (his Godson's)5th year at Hogwarts. He returned during Harry's 7th year along with James, Lily and Remus, after being resurrected with the help of the Resurrection stone in a hazy form.\nHe was the only remaining \u201Ctrue\u201D heir of the House of Black. 12 Grimmauld Place was gifted to Harry Potter, Sirius\u2019 godson. In which case, Harry or Draco Malfoy (related to the House of Black through his mother Narcissa) would\u2019ve likely inherited the title of Head of House. Possibly even Andromeda Tonks or her grandson, Edward \u201CTeddy\u201D Remus Lupin.\nAs he has said before, \"almost all pure-bloods are somehow related, and he\u2019s no exception\". He\u2019s related to the Weasleys by way of Cedrella Weasley (n\u00E9e Black), whom married Septimus Weasley. Together they're the paternal grandparents of the Weasley children. He\u2019s related to the Malfoys through Narcissa Malfoy (nee Black) who married into the Malfoy family, and is Sirius\u2019 cousin. He\u2019s even related to his godson, Harry Potter, through Dorea Potter (n\u00E9e Black) who is a distant relative to Harry and James Potter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":18},{"uri":"J._K._Rowling","surface_form":"J.
