{"id":128385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxbox","text":"In Unix computing, Fluxbox is an X window manager based on Blackbox 0.61.1. It tries to be lightweight and customizable, and has very little support for graphical icons. Its user interface has only a taskbar and a menu that can be used by right-clicking on the desktop. All basic settings are controlled by text files.\nFluxbox can show some eye candy such as: colors, gradients, borders, and several other basic appearance settings can be changed. Effects managers such as Xcompmgr and transset-df can add true transparency to desktop elements and windows. Enhancements can also be provided by using iDesk or [http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/fbdesk/ fbdesk], or the ROX Desktop.\nFluxbox also has several features Blackbox does not have, including tabbed windows and a configurable titlebar.\nBecause of its small memory use and quick loading time, Fluxbox is popular in many Live CDs such as Knoppix STD and GParted. It was the default window manager of Damn Small Linux, but was replaced with JWM after the release of Damn Small Linux 4.0. It is currently the default window manager of [http://antix.mepis.com/index.php/Main_Page antiX], a linux distribution based on MEPIS and designed for old computers, PCFluxboxOS, a remaster of PCLinuxOS, and LinguasOS, a Live CD distribution for professional translators. Fluxbuntu, Ubuntu with Fluxbox and lightweight applications, was released in October 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unix","surface_form":"Unix","offset":3},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computing","offset":8},{"uri":"X_window_manager","surface_form":"X window manager","offset":33},{"uri":"Fork_(software)","surface_form":"based","offset":50},{"uri":"Blackbox","surface_form":"Blackbox","offset":59},{"uri":"Lightweight","surface_form":"lightweight","offset":91},{"uri":"Icon_(computing)","surface_form":"icons","offset":163},{"uri":"User_interface","surface_form":"user interface","offset":174},{"uri":"Taskbar","surface_form":"taskbar","offset":200},{"uri":"Text_file","surface_form":"text file","offset":307},{"uri":"Eye_candy","surface_form":"eye candy","offset":341},{"uri":"Xcompmgr","surface_form":"Xcompmgr","offset":473},{"uri":"Transset-df","surface_form":"transset-df","offset":486},{"uri":"IDesk","surface_form":"iDesk","offset":600},{"uri":"ROX_Desktop","surface_form":"ROX Desktop","offset":665},{"uri":"Tabbed_document_interface","surface_form":"tabbed windows","offset":746},{"uri":"Live_CD","surface_form":"Live CD","offset":873},{"uri":"Knoppix_STD","surface_form":"Knoppix STD","offset":890},{"uri":"GParted","surface_form":"GParted","offset":906},{"uri":"Damn_Small_Linux","surface_form":"Damn Small Linux","offset":952},{"uri":"JWM","surface_form":"JWM","offset":992},{"uri":"Linux_distribution","surface_form":"linux distribution","offset":1139},{"uri":"MEPIS","surface_form":"MEPIS","offset":1167},{"uri":"PCFluxboxOS","surface_form":"PCFluxboxOS","offset":1205},{"uri":"PCLinuxOS","surface_form":"PCLinuxOS","offset":1232},{"uri":"LinguasOS","surface_form":"LinguasOS","offset":1247},{"uri":"Live_CD","surface_form":"Live CD","offset":1260},{"uri":"Translator","surface_form":"translator","offset":1298},{"uri":"Fluxbuntu","surface_form":"Fluxbuntu","offset":1311},{"uri":"Ubuntu","surface_form":"Ubuntu","offset":1322},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"applications","offset":1358},{"uri":"October_2007","surface_form":"October 2007","offset":1388}]}
