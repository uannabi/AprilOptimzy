{"id":12840,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","text":"The Kingdom of Great Britain, named in the Acts of Union 1707 as Great Britain and described as the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain\" and \"One Kingdom\", was a state in the British Isles in Western Europe, in existence from 1707 to 1800. It was created by joining the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, under the Acts of Union, to create a single kingdom that took in the whole of the island of Great Britain and many islands around it. A new single parliament and government, based in Westminster in London, controlled the new country. The two earlier kingdoms of Scotland and England had been in a personal union, sharing the same head of state since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I.\nIn 1801, by the Act of Union 1800, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland were joined together into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the putting down of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acts_of_Union_1707","surface_form":"Acts of Union 1707","offset":43},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":159},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":172},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":189},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Scotland","offset":267},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"Kingdom of England","offset":295},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":407},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":498},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":513},{"uri":"Personal_union","surface_form":"personal union","offset":612},{"uri":"James_I_of_England","surface_form":"James VI, King of Scots","offset":665},{"uri":"King_of_England","surface_form":"King of England","offset":697},{"uri":"Elizabeth_I_of_England","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth I","offset":744},{"uri":"Act_of_Union_1800","surface_form":"Act of Union 1800","offset":779},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Ireland","offset":835},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","surface_form":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland","offset":884},{"uri":"Irish_Rebellion_of_1798","surface_form":"Irish Rebellion of 1798","offset":958}]}
