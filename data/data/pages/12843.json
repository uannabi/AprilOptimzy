{"id":12843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T","text":"The Ford Model T was an American car built between 1908 and 1928 by the Ford Motor Company of Detroit, Michigan. It is one of the most important cars in history because it was one of the first cars to be sold for very little money, making it easy for people to travel from place to place.\nImportance.\nThe Model T, also known as the \"Tin Lizzie\", changed the way Americans live, work and travel. Henry Ford\u2019s revolutionary advancements in assembly-line automobile manufacturing made the Model T the first car to be affordable for a majority of Americans. For the first time car ownership became a reality for average American workers, not just the wealthy. More than fifteen million Model Ts were built in Detroit and Highland Park, Michigan, and the automobile was also assembled at a Ford plant in Manchester, England, and at plants in continental Europe.\nBefore the Model T, most cars cost lots of money. Only rich people could afford them. Even Ford's cars before the Model T cost a lot. The Model T went for around $980. A car built in 1903 called the Oldsmobile Curved Dash was very easy to buy, but was a very simple and slow car that was more like a carriage than a car.\nEven before it lost favor to larger, more powerful, and more luxurious cars, the Model T, known popularly as the \"Tin Lizzie\" or the \"flivver\", had become an American folkloric symbol, essentially realizing Ford\u2019s goal to \"democratize the automobile\".\nThe man who owned the company, Henry Ford, heard about meat being cut on a disassembly line, which moved meat from worker to worker so that the meat could be cut up. Assembly lines were not much used at the time. Ford knew that if he built his cars on an assembly line instead of one at a time like other cars, he could make a car that anyone could afford and would be built like cars that cost more money. He also knew that he could pay his workers more money.\nThe Model T was offered in several body styles, including a five-seat touring car, a two-seat runabout, and a seven-seat town car. All bodies were mounted on a uniform 100-inch (2.5m)-wheelbase chassis. A choice of colors was originally available, but from 1913 to 1925 the car was mass-produced in only one color\u2014black. The engine was simple and efficient, with all four cylinders cast in a single block and the cylinder head detachable for easy access and repair. The engine generated 20 horsepower and propelled the car to modest top speeds of 40\u201345 miles per hour (65\u201370 km/h). In most models the engine was started by a hand crank, which activated a magneto connected to the flywheel, but after 1920 some models were equipped with battery-powered starters.\nThe transmission, having two forward gears and one reverse, was of the planetary type, controlled by foot pedals rather than the more common hand lever used in sliding-gear transmissions. Spark and throttle were controlled by a hand lever on the steering column. The ten gallon fuel tank was located under the front seat. Because gasoline was fed to the engine only by gravity, and also because the reverse gear offered more power than the forward gears, the Model T frequently had to be driven up a steep hill backward. Such deficiencies, along with its homely appearance, less-than-comfortable ride at top speeds, and incessant rattling, made the Model T the butt of much affectionate humor in innumerable jokes, songs, poems, and stories.\nHistory.\nThe Ford Model T car was designed by Henry Ford, Childe Harolde Wills, and two Hungarian men named J\u00F3zsef Galamb and Eugene Farkas. The Model T had a 177-cubic-inch (2.9-litre) four-cylinder engine producing 20 horsepower (15 kW) for a top speed of 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). The engine had side valves and three main bearings. Fuel economy was 14 to 21 miles per gallon (11 to 17 l/100km).\nFord began building the Model T in his Piquette factory on October 6, 1908 as a 1909 model. Workers from all over the world wanted to work for Ford because of the good pay. Workers could even save their money for a Model T of their own. The price of the Model T dropped over the years, making it even easier to buy.\nWork began at one end of the assembly line, starting with an empty chassis. From there, the chassis moved slowly down the assembly line. Workers on the assembly line added parts to the chassis. Before long, a new Model T rolled off the other end of the line. Different body styles were available, even a truck, or Model TT. At first, the only color available was black. Black paint was used because it was cheaper and lasted longer than other paints and Ford was obsessed with increasing profit. As car paint got better over the years, Ford began offering other colors. The time it took a chassis to become a finished car was over 12 hours when the first Model Ts were built. By the time the last Model T came off of the line, Ford had so many plants, it was making one car every twenty-seven seconds!\nEven though the Model T sold for little money, Ford used the best materials he could buy to make his car. Most roads in the Model T's day were dirt, gravel, or even mud. That meant the Model T had to be very strong, and it was. The wheels and tyres were very tall and skinny so that they could sink into mud roads and not get stuck. It was also very simple.\nOperation.\nFord made the Model T easy to drive compared to today's cars since the people to whom he sold his cars did not know how to drive anything other than a horse. It is not like driving a modern car, though three pedals are on the floor like a modern manual transmission car. A Model T has a steering wheel that works the same way as in cars of today, but almost everything else is different.\nThe first Model Ts did not even have a starter like a modern car. This is the powerful electric motor in a car that turns the engine to make it run when it is turned off. The engine on the Model T was started with a hand crank on the front of the car. A wire loop near the radiator worked the choke on the carburetor to give the engine extra fuel to help start it when it was cold. This could be dangerous if the operator was not careful. If the levers that controlled the engine were not set the right way, especially the spark control, the engine could backfire, or spin the wrong way. Many people got broken arms this way. Doctors even had a name for this kind of break: the \"Ford fracture\". Many Model T owners added electric starters to their cars and it was not long before Ford started doing the same. A Model T is in high gear by default, so if the parking/clutch lever was not engaged, the car had a tendency to run over the operator when started.\nTo make a modern car go or accelerate once the engine is running, a person steps on a pedal on the floor to engage the transmission into low gear. To make a Model T accelerate, move two levers near the steering wheel. The lever on the right was the throttle (or engine speed), and the lever on the left adjusted the time that the spark plugs fired. These levers needed to be set properly before the engine could be started.\nThe three pedals on the floor of the Model T were for the brake on the right, reverse in the middle to make the Model T go backwards, and a pedal on the left to shift the gears from low to high speed. A lever on the floor worked the brakes as well as the clutch. Pulling the lever toward the driver would set the parking brake and help keep the car from moving while parked. When the lever was placed in the middle, the transmission would be in neutral.\nOnce the engine is running, the driver now has to make the Model T move on its own. Step on the pedal all the way to the left, move the throttle lever to \"give it the gas\" and gently move the floor lever forward. This is low gear, the powerful gear used to get the Model T moving. Once it is moving, move the right lever up, let the left pedal come all the way up, and give it more gas to shift into high. To make the car go faster still, move the throttle lever as well as the spark advance lever. Stepping on the left pedal only halfway puts the car in neutral, the same as the lever. This helps the Model T come to a stop without causing the engine to stop as well.\nThe brakes on a Model T work the rear wheels by the use of brake bands inside the transmission. Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels. No brakes are on the front wheels of a Model T.\nMore than fifteen million Model Ts were built. That record was not broken until 1971 by the Volkswagen Golf. Today, the record for the most cars built is held by the Toyota Corolla.\nThe Model T was nicknamed the \"Tin Lizzie\" and \"Flivver\" by the people who drove it. A new car took the place of the Model T in 1928, named the Ford Model A.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":24},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":33},{"uri":"1908","surface_form":"1908","offset":51},{"uri":"1928","surface_form":"1928","offset":60},{"uri":"Ford_Motor_Company","surface_form":"Ford Motor Company","offset":72},{"uri":"Detroit%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Detroit, Michigan","offset":94},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":225},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":261},{"uri":"Highland_Park%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Highland Park, Michigan","offset":717},{"uri":"Manchester%2C_England","surface_form":"Manchester, England","offset":799},{"uri":"Oldsmobile","surface_form":"Oldsmobile","offset":1056},{"uri":"Carriage","surface_form":"carriage","offset":1157},{"uri":"Henry_Ford","surface_form":"Henry Ford","offset":1461},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":1485},{"uri":"Assembly_line","surface_form":"assembly line","offset":1508},{"uri":"Worker","surface_form":"worker","offset":1545},{"uri":"Assembly_line","surface_form":"Assembly line","offset":1596},{"uri":"Transmission_(mechanics)","surface_form":"transmission","offset":2658},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":3484},{"uri":"Horsepower","surface_form":"horsepower","offset":3616},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":3657},{"uri":"Valve","surface_form":"valve","offset":3703},{"uri":"Bearings","surface_form":"bearings","offset":3725},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":3846},{"uri":"1908","surface_form":"1908","offset":3868},{"uri":"1909","surface_form":"1909","offset":3878},{"uri":"Chassis","surface_form":"chassis","offset":4181},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":4383},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":4418},{"uri":"Wheels","surface_form":"wheels","offset":5148},{"uri":"Tyres","surface_form":"tyres","offset":5159},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":5436},{"uri":"Steering_wheel","surface_form":"steering wheel","offset":5572},{"uri":"Starter","surface_form":"starter","offset":5712},{"uri":"Electric_motor","surface_form":"electric motor","offset":5760},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":5799},{"uri":"Crank","surface_form":"crank","offset":5894},{"uri":"Radiator","surface_form":"radiator","offset":5946},{"uri":"Choke","surface_form":"choke","offset":5966},{"uri":"Carburetor","surface_form":"carburetor","offset":5979},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Doctors","offset":6299},{"uri":"Pedal","surface_form":"pedal","offset":6716},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"lever","offset":6816},{"uri":"Throttle","surface_form":"throttle","offset":6879},{"uri":"Spark_plugs","surface_form":"spark plugs","offset":6960},{"uri":"Brake","surface_form":"brake","offset":7112},{"uri":"Clutch","surface_form":"clutch","offset":7309},{"uri":"Transmission","surface_form":"transmission","offset":8259},{"uri":"Volkswagen_Golf","surface_form":"Volkswagen Golf","offset":8457},{"uri":"Toyota_Corolla","surface_form":"Toyota Corolla","offset":8531},{"uri":"Ford_Model_A","surface_form":"Ford Model A","offset":8691}]}
