{"id":128529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Tree_Friends","text":"Happy Tree Friends is a show created by Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Warren Graff, and Aubrey Ankrum. It is a flash cartoon, a cartoon made by Universal Pictures. Since it first came out the show has become a popular internet phenomenon and has many fans (though the show is not as popular as it was a few years ago).\nDespite the child-like form of the series and having cute characters, the show is violent and not for teenagers and is only for 17+ content.\nWhile the music videos are comparable to that of \"Nirvana\" (the short cartoon featured on Smells Like Teen Spirit), the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, the band The Police and the movie studio \"Universal Pictures\", the portrayal of death in \"Happy Tree Friends\" is usually more extreme sport stunts and anatomically correct, showing rain and special effects in more vivid and often exaggerated detail.\nThe show is nearly free of speech; however, when the characters do speak, their words are severely garbled. Though it is easy to tell what each character's reaction is, their words can hardly be understood at all. According to the website, the idea for \"Happy Tree Friends\" was created by Rhode Montijo when he drew a yellow rabbit, slightly resembling the character Cuddles, on a piece of paper and wrote \"Resistance Is Futile\" underneath it.\nA \"Happy Tree Friends\" spin-off called \"Ka-Pow!\" premiered on September 2, 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flash_cartoon","surface_form":"flash cartoon","offset":110},{"uri":"Universal_Pictures","surface_form":"Universal Pictures","offset":143},{"uri":"Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit","surface_form":"Smells Like Teen Spirit","offset":549},{"uri":"Nine_Inch_Nails","surface_form":"Nine Inch Nails","offset":600},{"uri":"The_Police","surface_form":"The Police","offset":626},{"uri":"Universal_Pictures","surface_form":"Universal Pictures","offset":659}]}
