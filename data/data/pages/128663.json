{"id":128663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Clovis culture was the first widely spread Native culture in the Americas. The Clovis people lived in the Americas about 13,000 years ago. They lived there for between 200 and 800 years. Different sources list different lengths of time in that range.\nThey had a special way of making tools like spear tips and knives from stones. The flint tips are called Clovis points. Artifacts that they made in this way can be found in many places in North America. The Clovis way of making tools only lasted between 500 and 1000 years. After that, other similar ways became more popular.\nThey are called \"Clovis culture\" because archaeologists first found their artifacts at Clovis, New Mexico.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native","offset":60},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":67},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":78},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":301},{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":312},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knives","offset":327},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":339},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":351},{"uri":"Clovis_point","surface_form":"Clovis point","offset":373},{"uri":"Artifact_(archaeology)","surface_form":"Artifact","offset":388},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":456},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeologists","offset":635},{"uri":"Clovis%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Clovis","offset":681},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":689}]}
