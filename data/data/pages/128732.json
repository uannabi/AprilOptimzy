{"id":128732,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish","text":"Archerfish (or archer fish) are small fish. Some live in fresh water. Others live in salt water. They live in lots of places, like India, the Philippines, Australia, and Polynesia.\nArcherfish eat insects and other small animals. The archerfish looks for an insect hanging over the water. The archerfish shoots drops of water out of its mouth at the insect. When the drops hit the insect, it falls into the water. Then the archerfish catches (gets) the insect and eats it.\nArcherfish can hit insects up to two meters (six feet) away. Adult archerfish almost always hit the insect the first time, but young archerfish must do it many times in order to learn how.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":38},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":57},{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"salt water","offset":85},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":131},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":142},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":155},{"uri":"Polynesia","surface_form":"Polynesia","offset":170},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":196},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":220}]}
