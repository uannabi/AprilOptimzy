{"id":128858,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_photography","text":"e=\"preserve\">Nude photography is a style of photography which shows the naked human body as a form of art. This is different form erotic photography, and pornography which focus on sexual arousal.\nFor many photographers, nude photography is a study of the human body, much like some paintings did.\nPhotographing a named person is called portraiture. Nude photography focuses on showing the human body, and often the face is not visible.\nIn general, nude photography is a \"planned image\", not a snapshot. Nude photography wants to show a stylised depiction of the human body. Photographers sometimes use extremes of light and shadow, oiled skin, and shadows falling across the body to show the texture and structure of the body.\nEarly photographers often showed the nudity of women like the one we see here by F\u00E9lix-Jacques Moulin. Many, like Edward Weston, Jean-Christophe Destailleur, Augustao de Luca, Ruth Bernhard and Jerry Avenaim, preferred to show the lines of a body as a piece of art. They used the terms \"art nude\" and \"figurenude\" from painting to avoid suggestions that their works were meant to be erotica or pornography.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":35},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":44},{"uri":"Nakedness","surface_form":"naked","offset":72},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":78},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":102},{"uri":"Erotic_photography","surface_form":"erotic photography","offset":130},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":154},{"uri":"Sexual_arousal","surface_form":"sexual arousal","offset":181},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"study","offset":243},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":283},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":320},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portraiture","offset":337},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":633},{"uri":"F%C3%A9lix-Jacques_Moulin","surface_form":"F\u00E9lix-Jacques Moulin","offset":809},{"uri":"Edward_Weston","surface_form":"Edward Weston","offset":842},{"uri":"Jean-Christophe_Destailleur","surface_form":"Jean-Christophe Destailleur","offset":857},{"uri":"Augustao_de_Luca","surface_form":"Augustao de Luca","offset":886},{"uri":"Ruth_Bernhard","surface_form":"Ruth Bernhard","offset":904},{"uri":"Jerry_Avenaim","surface_form":"Jerry Avenaim","offset":922},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":1047},{"uri":"Erotic","surface_form":"erotica","offset":1111},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":1122}]}
