{"id":128866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_photography","text":"Erotic photography is a style of photography, between nude photography and pornography. Erotic photography wants to show the more or less naked human body in a sexual context. It can be difficult to make a difference between erotic photography and pornography - in general erotic photography wants to arouse or stimulate the viewer.\nThis stimulation is generally not done by explicitly showing people having sex. Instead, the models in the photographs will try to create a sexual impression. For example, female models may try to appear alluring. Male models will try to convey sexual arousal, though not through a full erection. In general, erotic photography only suggests, and has a higher artistic value than pornography.\n__INDEX__\n__NEWSECTIONLINK__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":24},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":33},{"uri":"Nude_photography","surface_form":"nude photography","offset":54},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":75},{"uri":"Nakedness","surface_form":"naked","offset":138},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":144},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual","offset":160},{"uri":"Context","surface_form":"context","offset":167},{"uri":"Erection","surface_form":"erection","offset":620}]}
