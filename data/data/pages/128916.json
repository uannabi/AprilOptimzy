{"id":128916,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was formed in 1824 to deal with Native Americans inside the United States. The BIA manages land and natural resources for Native Americans. It is responsible for the U.S. government's relationship with Native American tribes. Sometimes, it helps with infrastructure and law enforcement.\nIn the past, the BIA operated schools on Indian reservations. Now, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) provides money for schools. Some of the schools are operated by the BIE and others are operated by the tribes themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":80},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":108},{"uri":"Natural_resource","surface_form":"natural resource","offset":148},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":266},{"uri":"Infrastructure","surface_form":"infrastructure","offset":299},{"uri":"Law_enforcement","surface_form":"law enforcement","offset":318},{"uri":"Indian_reservation","surface_form":"Indian reservation","offset":376}]}
