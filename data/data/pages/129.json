{"id":129,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator","text":"=\"preserve\">A creator is a person who creates something.\nIn some religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) God (or Allah meaning the God in Arabic) is the most important and original creator of the whole universe - including Man who is made \"in his image\" (see Genesis) to observe it and control it like God. The idea that anything that a person is creating, like an idea, can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions.\nIn other traditions (Buddhism, Native American mythology) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the universe. Stewardship of home, land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this, or just good sense.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Create","surface_form":"create","offset":38},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":65},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":76},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":85},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":99},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":106},{"uri":"Allah","surface_form":"Allah","offset":114},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":139},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":203},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"Man","offset":224},{"uri":"Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":260},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"observe","offset":272},{"uri":"Control","surface_form":"control","offset":287},{"uri":"Creating","surface_form":"creating","offset":348},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":366},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"owned","offset":379},{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"property","offset":388},{"uri":"Ethical_tradition","surface_form":"ethical tradition","offset":412},{"uri":"Legal_code","surface_form":"legal code","offset":435},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":500},{"uri":"Native_American_mythology","surface_form":"Native American mythology","offset":510},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":628},{"uri":"Stewardship","surface_form":"Stewardship","offset":638},{"uri":"Ecological_footprint","surface_form":"land and all of Earth","offset":659}]}
