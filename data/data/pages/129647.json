{"id":129647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Bell","text":"Drake Bell (27 June 1986) is an American actor, singer, director and guitarist.\nLife.\nBell was born in Santa Ana, California in 1986. In June 2005, he was badly hurt in a car accident in Los Angeles. He was in the car with a friend. A truck went through a red light and hit Bell's car, a 1966 Ford Mustang. The steering wheel of Bell's car was made of wood and metal. Because the seatbelts of the car were only around the waist and there were no airbags, he hit his face against the steering wheel. This caused a broken neck, six dislodged teeth, a broken jaw and a deep cut across his chin. Bell had plastic surgery to fix his face.\nActing.\nBell started to act when he was 5 years old. At the age of 8, he wrote his first song. When he was 9, he played \"Jesse Ramo\" in the movie \"Jerry Maguire\". In 1999, he started to act in \"The Amanda Show\" with Amanda Bynes. He played Drake Parker on the television series \"Drake & Josh\". In 2008, Bell played in the movies \"Superhero Movie\" and \"Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh\".\nMusic.\nBell learned to play guitar when he was 13. In September 2005, he started to sell his first album, \"Telegraph\". In December 2006, he started to sell his second album, \"Its Only Time\". His third album was released in 2014. Some songs of his new album appeared, including \"Saturday Night\", \"All alone at the Disco\", \"Sea Song\", \"C.C.Rider\", \"To Hip gotta go\", \"Little Miss Prissy\" and \"Jingle Bells\".\nControversies.\nBell has made comments that have upset a lot of people. He made a negative comment when Caitlyn Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair. He deleted the comment soon after he posted it but it was still seen by many readers.
