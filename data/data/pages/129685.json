{"id":129685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota","text":"The University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (U of M or The U) is a public university. Most of the buildings are in Minneapolis, and some more buildings are about 3 miles (4.8\u00A0km) away near Saint Paul. These two parts are called the Twin Cities campus, and together they are the oldest and largest part of the University of Minnesota system. The Twin Cities campus is the flagship of the system.\nThe University of Minnesota is one of the Public Ivy universities in America, which is like saying they can give people an experience in college similar to the Ivy League. The University of Minnesota was started in 1851, and they are now in the Association of American Universities.\nThere are lots of students and teachers at the University of Minnesota. Some of them have won Nobel Prizes and Pulitzer Prizes. Some famous people who went to the University of Minnesota are Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, and Bob Dylan. The nickname of the University of Minnesota is the Golden Gophers.\nKinds of People.\nThe campus is made up of more than 50,000 people, so the University of Minnesota is the sixth largest in the United States. There are many kinds of people that are part of the University of Minnesota, from a lot of different places and groups.\nAs of Fall 2017, there are 31,535 people who are studying for an undergraduate degree \u2014 that is, a level of learning that someone can get after high school. Of that number, 5,858 are new to the University of Minnesota trying to get a degree for the first time. There are also 12,614 people trying to get a degree that's even higher than an undergraduate degree, like becoming a doctor.\nMinneapolis Campus.\nThe campus started near the Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River, but people moved about 1 mile (1.6\u00A0km) over to the place it is today. The old site is now a small park. They closed during the American Civil War, but they opened again in 1867 when John S. Pillsbury gave some money. They were bigger by 1869, so they stopped being called preparatory school and started being called a college instead. Today there are so many buildings, there are some on both sides of the Mississippi River. The part with buildings on the east side of the river is called the \"East Bank\", and the part with buildings on the west side of the river is called the \"West Bank\".\nEast Bank.\nThe University of Minnesota has many buildings on the east side of the Mississippi River. To help people find their way around, these buildings are divided into several areas: the Knoll area, the Mall area, the Health area, the Athletic area, and the Gateway area.\nThe Knoll area is the oldest part of the University of Minnesota, and it's in the northwestern corner. Some buildings in this area are over 100 years old.\nThe Mall area, or Northrop Mall is in the middle. It was based on a drawing by Cass Gilbert, but that drawing was too hard to follow. There are many buildings in the Mall area that are important.\nThe Health area is in the southeast corner. Some buildings are part of a hospital. There's also some buildings where students live, which called a residence hall.\nThe Athletic area is near the health area. Some buildings are for students who want to stay healthy to use like a gymnasium. There are also stadiums and arenas for people in sports to use in student athletics.\nThe Gateway area is on the east side. Most of these buildings are for offices, but there are also some buildings for people who are learning about medicine and living things.\nWest Bank.\nThe University of Minnesota has some buildings on the west side of the Mississippi River. Some are for people to learn about theatre, dance, music, and art. There's also a big library and some buildings for people to learn about social science.\nSaint Paul Campus.\nThe place people call the \"Saint Paul Campus\" is not in Saint Paul. It's in a city called Falcon Heights, about 3 miles (4.8\u00A0km) away from the Minneapolis campus. Most of the buildings are for people to about farming and natural resources. There are also fields and quiet spots. The Saint Paul Campus is next to the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, where Minnesota has a big party every year.\nClubs.\nMany students at the University of Minnesota are part of clubs. Some clubs are fraternities and sororities\u2014 that is, a group of students who have things in common and are close together. There are also clubs for people who are studying the same thing, or for people who want to help like a charity.\nPrint.\n\"The Minnesota Daily\" is a newspaper made all by students. It was first made on May 1, 1900. It gets made twice a week, except in the summer when it's made once a week.\nThere's another newspaper called \"The Wake Student Magazine\", made all by students. It was first made in November, 2001.\nAthletics.\nMinnesota's sports teams mostly play in the Big Ten Conference. The women's ice hockey team plays in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA); the men's ice hockey team also played in the WCHA until 2013, when the Big Ten began a men's ice hockey league.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["US university ranking"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minneapolis","surface_form":"Minneapolis","offset":112},{"uri":"Saint_Paul%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Saint Paul","offset":186},{"uri":"Campus","surface_form":"campus","offset":241},{"uri":"University_of_Minnesota_system","surface_form":"University of Minnesota system","offset":306},{"uri":"Flagship","surface_form":"flagship","offset":368},{"uri":"Public_Ivy","surface_form":"Public Ivy","offset":434},{"uri":"Ivy_League","surface_form":"Ivy League","offset":552},{"uri":"Association_of_American_Universities","surface_form":"Association of American Universities","offset":637},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":769},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize","offset":786},{"uri":"Hubert_Humphrey","surface_form":"Hubert Humphrey","offset":866},{"uri":"Walter_Mondale","surface_form":"Walter Mondale","offset":883},{"uri":"Bob_Dylan","surface_form":"Bob Dylan","offset":903},{"uri":"Campus","surface_form":"campus","offset":1002},{"uri":"Undergraduate_education","surface_form":"undergraduate","offset":1307},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctor","offset":1620},{"uri":"Saint_Anthony_Falls","surface_form":"Saint Anthony Falls","offset":1676},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":1703},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":1849},{"uri":"John_S._Pillsbury","surface_form":"John S.
