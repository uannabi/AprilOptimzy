It has the name of one of the Founding Fathers of the country, Juan Pablo Duarte.\nIt was created in 1896 as a district (an old country subdivision) with the name \"Distrito Pacificador\" but the Constitution of 1907 changed all districts to provinces. In 1925 its name was changed to \"Duarte\".\nLocation.\nThe Duarte province is bordered on the east by the Mar\u00EDa Trinidad S\u00E1nchez and Saman\u00E1 provinces, on the south by the Monte Plata and S\u00E1nchez Ram\u00EDrez provinces, on the west by the La Vega and Hermanas Mirabal provinces and on the north by the Espaillat and Mar\u00EDa Trinidad S\u00E1nchez provinces.\nHistory.\nThe area that currently forms the Duarte province was originally part of La Vega province until 1885 when it was made part of the Espaillat province.\nIn 1896, this part of the country was made a province, including some coastal towns that are now part of the Mar\u00EDa Trinidad S\u00E1nchez province. With the creation of this last province in 1959, the Duarte province lost all coastal areas and became a landlocked province (surrounded by other provinces by all sides). At this time, the municipalities of the Duarte province were San Francisco de Macor\u00EDs, Castillo, Pimentel and Villa Riva, with Hostos as a municipal district.\nArenoso was made a municipality in 1993, Las Gu\u00E1ranas in 1998 and Hostos (with the name of Eugenio Mar\u00EDa de Hostos) in 2004.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Duarte province, and 191,878 () living in towns and cities.

The first road comes from Moca and Salcedo and goes to the southeast and then to the north to end in Nagua, on the northern coast.\nThe second road is shorter than the first and is a branch of the \"Carretera Duarte\" (Duarte National Road) that ends in San Francisco de Macor\u00EDs.\nRivers.\nMost rivers in the province are short and have their sources in the \"Cordillera Septentrional\". Most of them flow to the south and are tributaries of the \"Cam\u00FA\" or \"Yuna\" rivers; Cam\u00FA is the main tributary of Yuna and these two rivers mark the southern limit of the province and flow from west to east.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the province is a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"Trade winds\" (winds that come from the Atlantic Ocean, filled with water), which blow from the Atlantic all year long. Rains are common in this province, mainly in the northern mountains where there are rainforests.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main products are coffee in the mountains, rice in the southern and eastern part of the province and cacao in the low mountains and those parts of the valley close to the mountains.\nOther important economic activity is cattle raising.
