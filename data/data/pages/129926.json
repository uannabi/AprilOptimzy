{"id":129926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hot_Minute","text":"\"One Hot Minute\" is the sixth studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was released on September 12, 1995 by record label Warner Bros. Records. John Frusciante had left the band after their previous album, \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\", so Dave Navarro joined as the new guitarist.\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' music was very different because of Navarro. \"One Hot Minute\" is less about sex and love than the band's previous work, but is instead about themes like drugs and depression. It also had some heavy metal guitar riffs. Anthony Kiedis had become addicted to cocaine and heroin in 1994, so some of the lyrics he wrote were about the effects of drugs.\n\"One Hot Minute\" did not sell many copies, even though it reached number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" sold twice as many copies as \"One Hot Minute\". In 1998, Navarro was asked to leave the band. Red Hot Chili Peppers told the media it was because they and Navarro liked to make different kinds of music. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that \"One Hot Minute\" is as musically ambitious as \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\", but is even more unfocused, which means it provides the fewest thrills of any of the group's albums.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":30},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":46},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":55},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":72},{"uri":"Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers","surface_form":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","offset":77},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":141},{"uri":"Warner_Bros._Records","surface_form":"Warner Bros.
