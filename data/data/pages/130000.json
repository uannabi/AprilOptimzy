The name \"dasyurus\" means \"hairy tail.\" Adults are between 25 and 75 cm long, with hairy tails about 20-35 cm long (about the size of a cat). Females have pouch to carry their babies.\nQuolls are threatened by eating toxic cane toads, but a University of Sydney project is teaching them not to eat them.\nThe family Dasyurini to which quolls belong also includes the Tasmanian devil, antechinuses, the kowari, and mulgaras.\nQuoll species.\nThere is at least one fossil species from the Pliocene, that is \"D. dunmalli\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"meat-eating","offset":30},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":42},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":63},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":77},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":231},{"uri":"Cane_toad","surface_form":"cane toads","offset":317},{"uri":"University_of_Sydney","surface_form":"University of Sydney","offset":335},{"uri":"Dasyurini","surface_form":"Dasyurini","offset":409},{"uri":"Tasmanian_devil","surface_form":"Tasmanian devil","offset":460},{"uri":"Antechinus","surface_form":"antechinus","offset":477},{"uri":"Kowari","surface_form":"kowari","offset":495},{"uri":"Mulgara","surface_form":"mulgara","offset":507},{"uri":"Pliocene","surface_form":"Pliocene","offset":578}]}
