{"id":130005,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_States","text":"Wind power in the United States is a growing industry. As of 2011, the total installed capacity of was 42,432 megawatts (MW), making it second in the world, behind China. In 2010 wind power accounted for 2.3% of the electricity generated in the United States. This amounted to 94,650 thousand megawatt-hours of electricity.\nDriven by state renewable energy mandates, fourteen states have installed over 1,000\u00A0MW of wind capacity, and a total of 37\u00A0states now have installed at least some large-scale wind power. Texas, with 10,135\u00A0MW of capacity, has the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. state, followed by Iowa with 3,675\u00A0MW. The Roscoe Wind Farm (781\u00A0MW) in Texas is the largest wind farm in the US as of 2011.\nThe U.S. wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars. Wind projects boost local tax bases, and help the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land. GE Energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Megawatts","surface_form":"megawatts","offset":110},{"uri":"Wind_power_in_China","surface_form":"China","offset":164},{"uri":"Wind_power","surface_form":"wind power","offset":179},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":245},{"uri":"Wind_power_in_Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":512},{"uri":"Wind_power_in_Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":621},{"uri":"Roscoe_Wind_Farm","surface_form":"Roscoe Wind Farm","offset":645},{"uri":"Wind_power_in_Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":674},{"uri":"Wind_farm","surface_form":"wind farm","offset":695},{"uri":"GE_Energy","surface_form":"GE Energy","offset":971},{"uri":"Wind_turbine","surface_form":"wind turbine","offset":1005}]}
