{"id":130007,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot","text":"The Tarot (often Tarot cards) are a set of seventy-eight cards, comprising twenty-two \u0422rump cards, and four suits of fourteen cards each with four Face cards. In the English speaking world, Tarot cards are mostly used for divination. Tarot cards are also used in many European countries for playing trick taking card games. Cartomancy is to use Tarot cards for divination.\nTarot decks did not come before decks having four suits of the same length. They were invented not for occult purposes but purely for gaming. In 1781, Court de G\u00E9belin published an essay associating the cards with ancient wisdom. This idea was later disproved by Dummett. Tarot cards have been used for cartomancy and divination as well as gaming. Nowadays fortune-tellers tend to use specially-developed tarot decks rather than those used for games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%D0%A2rump_cards","surface_form":"\u0422rump cards","offset":86},{"uri":"Suit_(cards)","surface_form":"suits","offset":108},{"uri":"Face_card","surface_form":"Face card","offset":147},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":166},{"uri":"Divination","surface_form":"divination","offset":222},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"European","offset":268},{"uri":"Card_games","surface_form":"card games","offset":312},{"uri":"Cartomancy","surface_form":"Cartomancy","offset":324},{"uri":"Occult","surface_form":"occult","offset":476},{"uri":"Antoine_Court_de_G%C3%A9belin","surface_form":"Court de G\u00E9belin","offset":524},{"uri":"Michael_Dummett","surface_form":"Dummett","offset":636},{"uri":"Cartomancy","surface_form":"cartomancy","offset":676},{"uri":"Divination","surface_form":"divination","offset":691}]}
