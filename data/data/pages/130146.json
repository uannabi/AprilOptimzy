This sugar was called \"cellose\".\nCellobiose is made from cellulose, which comes from the cells of plants. Things that have a lot of cellulose are good for making cellobiose, like cotton or paper. Water and cellulose make cellobiose: this process is called hydrolysis.\nPure cellobiose is a white powder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":37},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":62},{"uri":"Disaccharide","surface_form":"disaccharide","offset":105},{"uri":"Cellulose","surface_form":"cellulose","offset":192},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":314},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":324},{"uri":"Hydrolysis","surface_form":"hydrolysis","offset":391}]}
