They formed together in 1997, and have often changed their lineup, with singer Chris Conley being the only original member who is still in the band.\nAt first, Saves the Day was influenced heavily by melodic hardcore band Lifetime. At first, their songs had macabre lyrics and a lot of power chords. In 2001, they started to have more of a pop sound.\nThe band started to record a trilogy of albums in 2005. The first album, \"Sound the Alarm\" (2006), is more similar to the band's original sound than the band's previous albums. The second album, \"Under the Boards\", was released in fall 2007 and mixed together many previous records' sounds. \"Daybreak\", the concluding album in the trilogy, was released in 2011. They started recording it after a string of shows in late October 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":107},{"uri":"Lifetime","surface_form":"Lifetime","offset":304},{"uri":"Macabre","surface_form":"macabre","offset":340},{"uri":"Power_chord","surface_form":"power chord","offset":368},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":422},{"uri":"Trilogy","surface_form":"trilogy","offset":462},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":751},{"uri":"Trilogy","surface_form":"trilogy","offset":764}]}
