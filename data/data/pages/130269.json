{"id":130269,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dens_Park","text":"Dens Park is a football stadium on Dens Road in the Scottish city of Dundee.\nThe stadium is the home of Dundee F.C. and has a capacity of 11,856. Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as Tannadice, which is the home of city rivals Dundee United F.C.\nThe club moved to 'Dens' from their first stadium at Carolina Port in 1899. Over the years, the ground has been redeveloped, with the construction of the near-identical Bobby Cox and Bob Shankly stands, which sit at either end of the ground. The former is given over to home supporters, and the latter to visiting supporters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":15},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":24},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":52},{"uri":"Dundee","surface_form":"Dundee","offset":69},{"uri":"Dundee_F.C.","surface_form":"Dundee F.C.","offset":104},{"uri":"Tannadice","surface_form":"Tannadice","offset":218},{"uri":"Dundee_United_F.C.","surface_form":"Dundee United F.C.","offset":262},{"uri":"Bobby_Cox","surface_form":"Bobby Cox","offset":450},{"uri":"Bob_Shankly","surface_form":"Bob Shankly","offset":464}]}
