{"id":130316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonese_language","text":"Leonese language (\"Llion\u00E9s\" in Leonese) is the language of Le\u00F3n and Zamora, both in Spain, and Bragan\u00E7a, in Portugal. A Romance language, Leonese was the language of the Kingdom of Le\u00F3n in the Middle Ages.\nLeonese is recognised by the UN as \"seriously endangered\" and is officially recognised by Castile and Le\u00F3n.\nEducation.\nLeonese is taught in sixteen schools in the cirt of Le\u00F3n, and there are lessons for adults in several villages in the provinces of Le\u00F3n and Zamora.\nFor approximately fifteen years, some cultural associations have offered courses in Leonese, sometimes with the support or collaboration of local administrations in the provinces of Leon and Zamora. There was never collaboration by Castile and Le\u00F3n. The courses have taken place mostly with difficulty, without continuity or by unqualified teachers and very often, far from where Leonese is spoken.\nPronunciation.\nThe language has five vowels in a stressed position, represented by \"a, e, i, o\" and \"u\", and three (two archiphonemes /I/, /U/ and one phoneme /a/) in a nonstressed position, represented by \"e, u, \"and \"a\" at the end of word.\nEndangered language.\nUNESCO, in its \"Atlas of Languages in Danger in the World\", places Leonese among languages in danger.\nLiterature.\nLiterature written in Leonese started in the Middle Ages and is still written today. The first written text in Leonese is the \"Nodicia of Kesos\" (959 or 974), found in Ard\u00F3n. Other works in Leonese include the \"Fueru de Lli\u00F3n\", \"Fueru de Salamanca\", \"Fueru Xulgu\", \"C\u00F3dice d'Alfonsu XI\", \"Disputa d'Elena y Mar\u00EDa\" and \"Llibru d'Alixandre\".\nImportant writers are Torres Naharro, Juan del Encina, and Lucas Fern\u00E1ndez. Some writers like Caitano Bard\u00F3n (\"Cuentos en Dialecto Leon\u00E9s\"), Luis Maldonado or Arag\u00F3n Escacena (\"Entre brumas\") restarted the Leonese literature in the early 20th century. Today, important writers include Eva Gonz\u00E1lez in the last 20th century or Abel Pardo, Xuas\u00FAs Gonz\u00E1lez, Adrianu Mart\u00EDn or F\u00E9lix Ll\u00F3pez.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Le%C3%B3n%2C_Spain","surface_form":"Le\u00F3n","offset":59},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":84},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":108},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance language","offset":120},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Kingdom of Le\u00F3n","offset":170},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":193},{"uri":"Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Castile and Le\u00F3n","offset":296},{"uri":"Le%C3%B3n%2C_Spain","surface_form":"Le\u00F3n","offset":377},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":1023},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":1135},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"Literature","offset":1249},{"uri":"Eva_Gonz%C3%A1lez_(Leonese_language_writer)","surface_form":"Eva Gonz\u00E1lez","offset":1874},{"uri":"Abel_Pardo","surface_form":"Abel Pardo","offset":1915}]}
