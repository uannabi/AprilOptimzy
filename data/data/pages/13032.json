They did not get international attention until around 1982 when their third album came out.\nINXS was originally called \"The Farriss Brothers and it started with 3 members: Andrew, Tim, and Jon Farriss. They were all brothers. In 1978, 3 more people joined the band; Michael Hutchence (1960-1997), Garry Gary Beers, and Kirk Pengilly. After the band expanded their line-up, they changed their name to INXS, which is pronounced as \"in excess\".\nHutchence was the singer of INXS until he died. A man named Jon Stevens was his temporary replacement for about 5 years. After Jon Stevens left, the other 5 members did a television show called \"Rock Star INXS\" to choose a permanent replacement for Michael Hutchence. A Canadian man named J.D, Fortune won the show and became the new singer for INXS.\nThe most famous song by INXS is \"Need You Tonight\" which came out in 1987. Some of their other songs are \"What You Need\", \"The One Thing\", and \"New Sensation\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":13},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":24},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":70},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":92},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":100},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":130},{"uri":"Michael_Hutchence","surface_form":"Michael Hutchence","offset":402},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":848},{"uri":"Need_You_Tonight","surface_form":"Need You Tonight","offset":962},{"uri":"What_You_Need","surface_form":"What You Need","offset":1035},{"uri":"The_One_Thing","surface_form":"The One Thing","offset":1052},{"uri":"New_Sensation","surface_form":"New Sensation","offset":1073}]}
