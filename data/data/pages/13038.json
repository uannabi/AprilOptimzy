{"id":13038,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisian_language","text":"Frisian refers to three languages that comes from Friesland, a province in the Netherlands. They are spoken in the Netherlands, in Eastern Germany, and in some areas of Jutland, Denmark. It is also spoken on the Frisian Isles (Wadden Isles) and Western German (East Frisian) Isles such as Borkum.\nThey are West Germanic languages related to Dutch and are also the closest living languages to English. Since they have been spoken since Roman times, English could descend from Frisian directly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":24},{"uri":"Friesland","surface_form":"Friesland","offset":50},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":63},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":79},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":115},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":139},{"uri":"Jutland","surface_form":"Jutland","offset":169},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":178},{"uri":"Frisian_Isles","surface_form":"Frisian Isles","offset":212},{"uri":"Borkum","surface_form":"Borkum","offset":289},{"uri":"West_Germanic_language","surface_form":"West Germanic language","offset":306},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":341},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":392}]}
