{"id":130421,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartomancy","text":"=\"preserve\">Cartomancy is the study of reading cards for fortune-telling or divination. There are many different types of cards used for cartomancy, some of which include standard playing cards and the tarot.\nTarot cards are similar to a standard deck of playing cards. In fact, Tarot predates regular playing cards, and might have been the basis for them. The major difference between playing cards and tarot is that tarot decks contain 22 extra cards called the Major Arcana, which are primarily used to read fortunes.\nSome Spanish-speaking countries like Mexico use cards similar to bingo for fortune-telling. They call this practice Loter\u00EDa. Because the game was invented in Italy, Loter\u00EDa gets its name from the Italian word for lottery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fortune-telling","surface_form":"fortune-telling","offset":57},{"uri":"Divination","surface_form":"divination","offset":76},{"uri":"Tarot","surface_form":"tarot","offset":202},{"uri":"Playing_card","surface_form":"playing cards","offset":255},{"uri":"Major_Arcana","surface_form":"Major Arcana","offset":464},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":558},{"uri":"Bingo","surface_form":"bingo","offset":586},{"uri":"Loteria","surface_form":"Loter\u00EDa","offset":637},{"uri":"Italian","surface_form":"Italian","offset":717},{"uri":"Lottery","surface_form":"lottery","offset":734}]}
