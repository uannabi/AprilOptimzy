{"id":13043,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(band)","text":"\"Death\" was one of the first ever death metal bands in the United States. They started in 1983 under the name Mantas and they changed the name to \"Death\" in 1984.\nDeath is no longer a band because their guitarist Chuck Schuldiner died on December 13, 2001. He was 34 years old. He had brain cancer and the drugs he used to beat the cancer made him weak. He died of pneumonia. He had another band project called Control Denied during the 3 years before he died.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Death_metal","surface_form":"death metal","offset":34},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":46},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":59},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":90},{"uri":"1984","surface_form":"1984","offset":157},{"uri":"Chuck_Schuldiner","surface_form":"Chuck Schuldiner","offset":213},{"uri":"December_13","surface_form":"December 13","offset":238},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":251},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":285},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":291},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"drugs","offset":306},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":365},{"uri":"Control_Denied","surface_form":"Control Denied","offset":411}]}
