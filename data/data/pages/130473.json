{"id":130473,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golant","text":"Golant is a small village in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is in the parish of St Sampson on the banks of the Fowey estuary and between St. Austell and Polperro. The church in the villiage is dedicated to St. Sampson.\nGolant railway station was at one time by the river to the south of the village. It was served by trains on the Great Western Railway's Fowey branch line from 1 July 1896 until 4 January 1965. The station has since been removed. The space is now used for a car park.\nAnnie Vernon, the Olympic rower, first learned her sport at Golant's Castle Dore Rowing Club.\nHistory.\nUntil very recently, Golant has been almost unknown except to the people who live there and pilgrims and other walkers of the Saints' Way. Nearby, there is a little used ford across the Fowey estuary. In late summer 1644, during the first English Civil War, war came to Golant and the area around the village. A large group of about 10,000 Parliamentary soldiers fought against the forces of King Charles on the peninsula between Lostwithiel, St Blazey and Fowey. King Charles was in the area at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":18},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":29},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":39},{"uri":"Parish","surface_form":"parish","offset":68},{"uri":"St_Sampson","surface_form":"St Sampson","offset":78},{"uri":"Shore","surface_form":"banks","offset":96},{"uri":"Fowey_estuary","surface_form":"Fowey estuary","offset":109},{"uri":"St._Austell","surface_form":"St. Austell","offset":135},{"uri":"Polperro","surface_form":"Polperro","offset":151},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":165},{"uri":"Saint_Sampson","surface_form":"St. Sampson","offset":204},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":224},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":263},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"trains","offset":315},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":329},{"uri":"Car_park","surface_form":"car park","offset":474},{"uri":"Annie_Vernon","surface_form":"Annie Vernon","offset":484},{"uri":"Olympic_games","surface_form":"Olympic","offset":502},{"uri":"Rowing","surface_form":"rower","offset":510},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":535},{"uri":"Pilgrim","surface_form":"pilgrim","offset":679},{"uri":"Saints%27_Way","surface_form":"Saints' Way","offset":713},{"uri":"Ford","surface_form":"ford","offset":757},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"English Civil War","offset":826},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":845},{"uri":"Parliament_of_England","surface_form":"Parliamentary","offset":927},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":941},{"uri":"List_of_English_monarchs","surface_form":"King","offset":979},{"uri":"Charles_I_of_England","surface_form":"Charles","offset":984},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":999},{"uri":"Lostwithiel","surface_form":"Lostwithiel","offset":1017},{"uri":"St_Blazey","surface_form":"St Blazey","offset":1030},{"uri":"Fowey","surface_form":"Fowey","offset":1044}]}
