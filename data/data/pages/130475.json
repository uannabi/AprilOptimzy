{"id":130475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints%27_Way","text":"=\"preserve\">The Saints' Way () is a long-distance footpath in Cornwall, in the United Kingdom.\nIt follows the probable route of early Christian travellers making their way from Ireland to the Continent. Rather than risk the difficult passage around Land's End they would disembark their ships on the North Cornish coast and progress to ports such as Fowey on foot. The footpath today between Padstow in the north and Fowey in the south is 26 miles in length and is well marked. Guide books are available.\nOther websites.\n[http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5787 Saints' Way information at Cornwall County Council]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trail","surface_form":"footpath","offset":50},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":62},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":79},{"uri":"Miles","surface_form":"miles","offset":442}]}
