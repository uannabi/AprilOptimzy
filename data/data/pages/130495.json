{"id":130495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial_(song)","text":"\"Psychosocial\" is the second single and fourth track from Slipknot's fourth studio album, \"All Hope Is Gone\" which was released August 26 2008.\nMusic video.\nThe music video for \"Psychosocial\" was shot at Sound Farm studios in Jamaica, Iowa on June 30, 2008. The shoot was delayed due to an unrelated head injury sustained by turntablist Sid Wilson before the shoot, who was subsequently hospitalized. On July 18, 2008 the video premiered on MTV's \"FNMTV\" show, hosted by Pete Wentz. The video, which was directed by Paul Brown, was shot using high-end cameras which shoot 1,000 frames per second and are contrasted with traditional 35\u00A0mm hand crank camera equipment. Percussionist Shawn Crahan explains; \"we have the most extreme on both ends, with nothing in the middle. That's what the video is, and nobody does that. There's an art form behind it.\"\nDuring an interview with \"Kerrang!\", guitarist James Root revealed that the video features the burning of the purgatory masks adorned by the band members in the splash teaser photos shown on Slipknot's website, reportedly because the masks represent the band's ego.\nThe are two versions of the video. One uses the album version of the song, whilst the other uses a much shorter version of the song; excluding the \"Limit of the Dead!\" lines.\nThis song was nominated to best rock video at the VMA\u00B4s 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":29},{"uri":"Track_(music)","surface_form":"track","offset":47},{"uri":"Slipknot","surface_form":"Slipknot","offset":58},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":83},{"uri":"All_Hope_Is_Gone","surface_form":"All Hope Is Gone","offset":91},{"uri":"August_26","surface_form":"August 26","offset":128},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":138},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":161},{"uri":"Jamaica%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Jamaica, Iowa","offset":226},{"uri":"June_30","surface_form":"June 30","offset":243},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":252},{"uri":"Turntablism","surface_form":"turntablist","offset":325},{"uri":"Sid_Wilson","surface_form":"Sid Wilson","offset":337},{"uri":"July_18","surface_form":"July 18","offset":404},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":413},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":441},{"uri":"FNMTV","surface_form":"FNMTV","offset":448},{"uri":"Pete_Wentz","surface_form":"Pete Wentz","offset":471},{"uri":"P.R._Brown","surface_form":"Paul Brown","offset":516},{"uri":"Digital_cinematography_cameras","surface_form":"high-end cameras","offset":543},{"uri":"Shawn_Crahan","surface_form":"Shawn Crahan","offset":681},{"uri":"Kerrang%21","surface_form":"Kerrang!","offset":878},{"uri":"James_Root","surface_form":"James Root","offset":899}]}
