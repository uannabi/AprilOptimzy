According to Microsoft, Windows 7 is faster, more reliable and more compatible than the previous version named Windows Vista.\nThe beta version of Windows 7 was released on January 9, 2009, and the release candidate was released on May 5. The final version of Windows 7 was sent to PC manufacturers on July 22, 2009, so that they have three months to change it and include it with their computers. Windows 7 was released to the public on October 22, 2009. Microsoft stopped providing security updates for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020.\nDevelopment.\nFirst, a beta version of Windows code-named \"Black-comb\" was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Big features were planned for Black-comb, including an emphasis on looking for data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such situations. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed Longhorn was announced for 2003, delaying the making of Black-comb. By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had gotten some of the features meant for Black-comb. After three major viruses exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time in 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while they made new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn Windows Vista was also reset, or delayed in September 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn.\nBlackcomb was renamed \"Vienna\" in early 2006, and again to \"Windows 7\" in 2007.
