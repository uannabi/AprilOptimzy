{"id":130731,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirga","text":"e=\"preserve\">A jirga (sometimes spelt jirgah) (Pashto /) is a tribal meeting of elders. The meeting makes decisions by consensus. It is mainly the Pashtun people who have theses meetings - but other people who live near the Pashtun also have these meetings to settle disputes. They are most common in Afghanistan and among the Pashtun in Pakistan near its border with Afghanistan.\nSolving disputes.\nThe meeting is usually made to help solve a dispute between two people. The people involved in a dispute usually begin by finding a mediator, choosing someone who is trusted to fairly solve the problem. The mediator can be a religious leader, a local notable, or someone who is known for helping to settle disputes.\nThe mediator hears from the two sides, and then forms a jirga of community elders, taking care to include supporters of both sides. After listening to both sides the jirga then comes to a decision. When the decision has been made the mediator then announces it. The jirga's decision has to be accepted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Consensus","surface_form":"consensus","offset":119},{"uri":"Pashtun","surface_form":"Pashtun","offset":147},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":301},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":338},{"uri":"Mediator","surface_form":"mediator","offset":531}]}
