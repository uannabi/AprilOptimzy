{"id":13080,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tosh","text":"e=\"preserve\">Peter Tosh (born Winston McIntosh, October 19, 1944- September 11, 1987) was a Jamaican reggae musican. He was a member of the Wailers with Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston. He was a Rastafarian and sang very political songs. His songs were a lot more radical than his friend, Bob Marley's, whom he often criticized for selling out to the white mainstream. He also toured with the Rolling Stones and sang a duet with Mick Jagger. He was murdered in his home in Kingston during a robbery in 1987. His biggest claim to fame was a song titled \"Legalize It\" in relation to marijuana laws.\nCompilations.\nThese are the highest rated compilation albums on Allmusic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"October_19","surface_form":"October 19","offset":48},{"uri":"1944","surface_form":"1944","offset":60},{"uri":"September_11","surface_form":"September 11","offset":66},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":80},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":92},{"uri":"Reggae_music","surface_form":"reggae","offset":101},{"uri":"Bob_Marley","surface_form":"Bob Marley","offset":153},{"uri":"Bunny_Livingston","surface_form":"Bunny Livingston","offset":168},{"uri":"Rastafarian","surface_form":"Rastafarian","offset":195},{"uri":"Bob_Marley","surface_form":"Bob Marley","offset":289},{"uri":"The_Rolling_Stones","surface_form":"the Rolling Stones","offset":389},{"uri":"Mick_Jagger","surface_form":"Mick Jagger","offset":429},{"uri":"Kingston","surface_form":"Kingston","offset":473},{"uri":"Marijuana","surface_form":"marijuana","offset":581},{"uri":"Compilation_album","surface_form":"compilation album","offset":639},{"uri":"Allmusic","surface_form":"Allmusic","offset":661}]}
