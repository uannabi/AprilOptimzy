{"id":131081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling","text":"Linus Carl Pauling (February 28, 1901 \u2013 August 19, 1994) was an American scientist, peace activist, author and educator. He was one of the most important chemists in history.\nPauling was one of the first scientists to work in quantum chemistry, molecular biology and orthomolecular medicine. He is one of a small group of people to have been given more than one Nobel Prize. He is one of only two people to receive them in different fields (the other person was Marie Curie) and the only person in that group to have been awarded each of his prizes without having to share it with another winner.\nLife and education.\nPauling was born and grew-up in Oregon, USA. He went to Oregon Agricultural College and graduated in 1922 with a degree in chemical engineering. Pauling then went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he received his Ph. D in physical chemistry and mathematical physics in 1925. Two years later, he became an assistant professor at Caltech, and he completed his academic career there after many decades on the faculty. He was a Unitarian.\nWork and awards.\nIn 1932, Pauling came up with the idea of electronegativity and made a scale that would help the chemical bonding. Pauling kept doing this work while he also did work on the structure of the atomic.\nIn 1954, Pauling was given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work that he did on the structure of DNA. This work led scientists in the UK to come up with the double helix of DNA.\nDuring the Second World War, Pauling worked on military research and development. But, after the war had ended he became worried about the making and future use of atomic weapons and with the destruction forced on the world by war. Ava Helen Pauling, Linus's wife, was a and in time he came to share her beliefs. Pauling then began to talk about his worries with the effects of nuclear fallout and in 1962, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work against above ground nuclear testing.\nWork as author and teacher.\nPauling was also an author and a teacher. His first book, \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond\" (1939), is still used today. his introductory textbook, \"General Chemistry\" (1949). Later in life, he became an advocate for greatly increased consumption of vitamin C and other nutrients. He generalized his ideas to define orthomolecular medicine, which is still regarded as unorthodox by conventional medicine. He popularized his concepts, analyses, research and insights in several successful but controversial books, such as \"How to Live Longer and Feel Better\" in 1986.\nDeath.\nPauling died of prostate cancer on August 19, 1994, at 7:20 PM at home in Big Sur, California. He was 93 years old. A grave marker for him is in Oswego Pioneer Cemetery in Lake Oswego, Oregon.\nHonors and awards.\nPauling received numerous awards and honors during his career. Following are awards and honors he has received.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":64},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":73},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":84},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":90},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":100},{"uri":"Educator","surface_form":"educator","offset":111},{"uri":"Chemists","surface_form":"chemists","offset":154},{"uri":"Quantum_chemistry","surface_form":"quantum chemistry","offset":226},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":245},{"uri":"Orthomolecular_medicine","surface_form":"orthomolecular medicine","offset":267},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":362},{"uri":"Marie_Curie","surface_form":"Marie Curie","offset":462},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":649},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":657},{"uri":"Oregon_State_University","surface_form":"Oregon Agricultural College","offset":673},{"uri":"Chemical_engineering","surface_form":"chemical engineering","offset":740},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"California Institute of Technology","offset":787},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.
