{"id":131328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundgarden_discography","text":"The discography of Soundgarden, an American rock band, consists of six studio albums, one live album, four compilation albums, seven extended plays, twenty-four singles and eighteen music videos.\nThis list does not include material recorded by Soundgarden band members with Skin Yard, Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, Hater, Wellwater Conspiracy, or Audioslave.\nSoundgarden was formed in 1984 by vocalist Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. The band signed with the independent label Sub Pop and released the \"Screaming Life\" EP in 1987 and the \"Fopp\" EP in 1988. In 1988, the band signed with legendary punk record label SST Records and released its debut full-length album \"Ultramega OK\". The band subsequently signed with A&M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign with a major label. In 1989, the band released its first album for a major label, \"Louder Than Love\".\nIn 1990, the band was joined by a new bass player, Ben Shepherd. They released \"Badmotorfinger\" in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention being paid to the Seattle music scene. The band's next album was to be its breakthrough. \"Superunknown\", released in 1994, debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and launched several successful singles, including \"Spoonman\" and \"Black Hole Sun\". In 1996, the band released its fifth studio album, \"Down on the Upside\"; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by \"Superunknown\".\nIn 1997, the band broke up because they could no longer agree on how their music sounded. The members worked on other projects for more than ten years. Soundgarden got back together in 2010. Two years later, they released their sixth studio album, \"King Animal\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Discography","surface_form":"discography","offset":4},{"uri":"Soundgarden","surface_form":"Soundgarden","offset":19},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":44},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":71},{"uri":"Live_album","surface_form":"live album","offset":90},{"uri":"Compilation_album","surface_form":"compilation album","offset":107},{"uri":"Extended_play","surface_form":"extended play","offset":133},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"singles","offset":161},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":182},{"uri":"Skin_Yard","surface_form":"Skin Yard","offset":274},{"uri":"Temple_of_the_Dog","surface_form":"Temple of the Dog","offset":285},{"uri":"Pearl_Jam","surface_form":"Pearl Jam","offset":304},{"uri":"Hater_(band)","surface_form":"Hater","offset":315},{"uri":"Wellwater_Conspiracy","surface_form":"Wellwater Conspiracy","offset":322},{"uri":"Audioslave","surface_form":"Audioslave","offset":347},{"uri":"Chris_Cornell","surface_form":"Chris Cornell","offset":402},{"uri":"Kim_Thayil","surface_form":"Kim Thayil","offset":427},{"uri":"Hiro_Yamamoto","surface_form":"Hiro Yamamoto","offset":451},{"uri":"Independent_record_label","surface_form":"independent label","offset":491},{"uri":"Sub_Pop","surface_form":"Sub Pop","offset":509},{"uri":"Screaming_Life","surface_form":"Screaming Life","offset":535},{"uri":"Fopp_(EP)","surface_form":"Fopp","offset":571},{"uri":"SST_Records","surface_form":"SST Records","offset":647},{"uri":"Ultramega_OK","surface_form":"Ultramega OK","offset":701},{"uri":"A%26amp%3BM_Records","surface_form":"A&M Records","offset":750},{"uri":"Louder_Than_Love","surface_form":"Louder Than Love","offset":885},{"uri":"Ben_Shepherd","surface_form":"Ben Shepherd","offset":955},{"uri":"Badmotorfinger","surface_form":"Badmotorfinger","offset":984},{"uri":"Superunknown","surface_form":"Superunknown","offset":1236},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":1298},{"uri":"Spoonman","surface_form":"Spoonman","offset":1366},{"uri":"Black_Hole_Sun","surface_form":"Black Hole Sun","offset":1381},{"uri":"Down_on_the_Upside","surface_form":"Down on the Upside","offset":1450},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":1788}]}
