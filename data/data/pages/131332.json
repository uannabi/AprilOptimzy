{"id":131332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louder_Than_Love","text":"\"Louder Than Love\" is the second full-length album by the American grunge band Soundgarden. It was released on September 5, 1989 through A&M Records. After touring in support of its first full-length studio album, \"Ultramega OK\", released in 1988, the band signed with A&M and began work on its first album for a major label. The songs on the album featured a heavy rock sound with some songs featuring unusual or unorthodox time signatures.\nBecause of some of the song lyrics the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release, including the addition of a Parental Advisory sticker on the album packaging. \"Louder Than Love\" would become the band's first album to chart on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band supported the album with tours of North America and Europe. It was the last Soundgarden album to feature the band's original bassist, Hiro Yamamoto.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":58},{"uri":"Grunge_music","surface_form":"grunge","offset":67},{"uri":"Soundgarden","surface_form":"Soundgarden","offset":79},{"uri":"A%26amp%3BM_Records","surface_form":"A&M Records","offset":137},{"uri":"Ultramega_OK","surface_form":"Ultramega OK","offset":215},{"uri":"Hard_rock","surface_form":"heavy rock","offset":360},{"uri":"Parental_Advisory","surface_form":"Parental Advisory","offset":587},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":708},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":768},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":786},{"uri":"Hiro_Yamamoto","surface_form":"Hiro Yamamoto","offset":868}]}
