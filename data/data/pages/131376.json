{"id":131376,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Everman","text":"Jason Everman (born August 16, 1967 in Kodiak, Alaska) is an American guitarist who played with Nirvana and Soundgarden.\nNirvana.\nEverman joined Nirvana in February 1989 as a second guitarist. He is listed as being second guitarist on Nirvana's \"Bleach\", but did not actually play on any of the tracks. Nirvana founder Kurt Cobain said the credit was a token of thanks to Everman for paying a fee of US $606.17 to record the album. The cash was never repaid. Everman toured with Nirvana in summer of 1989 in support of \"Bleach\". During his time with Nirvana, he can sometimes be seen using Fender guitars, generally the Fender Telecaster.\nA two-song Nirvana session featuring Everman on guitar is available, albeit in separate releases. A Kiss cover called \"Do You Love Me?\" was released on a tribute album and \"Dive\" was released on 2004's \"With the Lights Out\". Both tracks were recorded at Evergreen State College's 24-track studio in June 1989.\nSoundgarden.\nEverman left Nirvana in July 1989 following a stressful tour and joined Soundgarden the following year as Hiro Yamamoto's temporary successor on bass. In April 1990, he played on the band's cover of The Beatles' \"Come Together\", which appeared on an EP called \"Loudest Love\". Everman appeared in Soundgarden's \"Louder Than Live\" home video. Later in 1990, Everman left the band and Soundgarden found Yamamoto's ultimate successor, bassist Ben Shepherd.\nThe \"Come Together\" cover remains the only recorded Soundgarden material to feature Everman.\nMind Funk.\nEverman's subsequent projects included a stint on guitar in Mind Funk. In September 1994, he left Mind Funk to join the Army 2nd Ranger Battalion and the Special Forces, serving tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. After his military service he appeared in the documentary \"Lemmy\", said he was a member of the Rangers and Special Forces [http://i.imgur.com/HI5hf.jp] and that \"Motorhead is good go to war music.\" He also said that \"war is a function of the human condition\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kodiak%2C_Alaska","surface_form":"Kodiak","offset":39},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":47},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":70},{"uri":"Nirvana_(band)","surface_form":"Nirvana","offset":96},{"uri":"Soundgarden","surface_form":"Soundgarden","offset":108},{"uri":"Bleach_(album)","surface_form":"Bleach","offset":246},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":319},{"uri":"Fender_Musical_Instruments_Corporation","surface_form":"Fender","offset":590},{"uri":"Telecaster","surface_form":"Telecaster","offset":627},{"uri":"Kiss_(band)","surface_form":"Kiss","offset":739},{"uri":"2004_in_music","surface_form":"2004's","offset":834},{"uri":"With_the_Lights_Out","surface_form":"With the Lights Out","offset":842},{"uri":"The_Evergreen_State_College","surface_form":"Evergreen State College's","offset":893},{"uri":"Hiro_Yamamoto","surface_form":"Hiro Yamamoto","offset":1068},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":1161},{"uri":"Come_Together","surface_form":"Come Together","offset":1175},{"uri":"Ben_Shepherd","surface_form":"Ben Shepherd","offset":1401},{"uri":"Mind_Funk","surface_form":"Mind Funk","offset":1579},{"uri":"2nd_Ranger_Battalion_(United_States)","surface_form":"2nd Ranger Battalion","offset":1644},{"uri":"United_States_Army_Special_Forces","surface_form":"Special Forces","offset":1673},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":1706},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":1722},{"uri":"Lemmy_(movie)","surface_form":"Lemmy","offset":1787}]}
