{"id":131394,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Rij-Rousseau","text":"Jeanne Rij-Rousseau (10 June 1870 \u2013 22 October 1956) was a French Cubist painter and an art theoretician.\nRij-Rousseau was born in Cand\u00E9. From 1890 on, she lived in Paris and moved in an artistic circle with painters of the \"Ile de la Grande Jatte\" in Montmartre. She was a student of Maurice Denis and Paul S\u00E9rusier. S\u00E9rusier's had ideas about the relationship of music and painting. She used these ideas to form the theory of vibrism, which is a combination of Synthetic Cubism of the pre-war period and Larionov and Goncharova's Rayonism.\nJuan Gris was a close friend of hers. From 1911 on, Rij-Rousseau showed her works in Salon d'Automne, Salon des Ind\u00E9pendants and Salon Tuileries. In 1920, she was a member of the artist circle called Section d'Or. She often traveled to South France, especially to C\u00E9ret, and also to Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. Her paintings were displayed in Zurich, Brussels, New York, and Boston.\nIn Aubusson and Beauvais' manufactories large-size tapestries designed by her were produced. In 1925, she was awarded a gold medal for one of them in the first Arts D\u00E9coratifs' exhibition.\nGuillaume Apollinaire named her a \"searcher\", and her colour choices were admired by Florent Fels and Andr\u00E9 Salmon.\nAlso in 1925, Rij-Rousseau founded the Association of Modern-Age Female Painters. She exhibited with Suzanne Duchamp and Marie Laurencin, among others. Aside from Colette, Rij-Rousseau's biography was published in the book, \"F\u00FChrende Frauen Europas\" by Elga Kern as a representative of French art.\nHer fame did not last long, and in 1956 she died lonely, impoverished and forgotten in her great-niece's house in Savigny-sur-Braye. Her final exhibition in Ch\u00E2teau de Blois in 1959 attracted little notice, and the whereabouts of the 70 exhibited paintings are still unknown. Her estate has been scattered throughout the world. Paintings are trafficked in N.Y., Chicago, London, and Paris. Some works are in Parisan museums, in Blois, and in Grenoble, but especially in private collectors' homes.\nResearch on this painter of the French Modern Age is still in its beginnings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"Cubist","offset":66},{"uri":"Cand%C3%A9","surface_form":"Cand\u00E9","offset":131},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":165},{"uri":"Montmartre","surface_form":"Montmartre","offset":252},{"uri":"Maurice_Denis","surface_form":"Maurice Denis","offset":285},{"uri":"Paul_S%C3%A9rusier","surface_form":"Paul S\u00E9rusier","offset":303},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":365},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":375},{"uri":"Synthetic_Cubism","surface_form":"Synthetic Cubism","offset":463},{"uri":"Mikhail_Larionov","surface_form":"Larionov","offset":506},{"uri":"Natalia_Goncharova","surface_form":"Goncharova's","offset":519},{"uri":"Rayonism","surface_form":"Rayonism","offset":532},{"uri":"Juan_Gris","surface_form":"Juan Gris","offset":542},{"uri":"Salon_d%27Automne","surface_form":"Salon d'Automne","offset":627},{"uri":"Salon_des_Ind%C3%A9pendants","surface_form":"Salon des Ind\u00E9pendants","offset":644},{"uri":"Section_d%27Or","surface_form":"Section d'Or","offset":742},{"uri":"C%C3%A9ret","surface_form":"C\u00E9ret","offset":806},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":825},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":834},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":846},{"uri":"Zurich","surface_form":"Zurich","offset":891},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":899},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York","offset":909},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":923},{"uri":"Aubusson%2C_Creuse","surface_form":"Aubusson","offset":934},{"uri":"Beauvais","surface_form":"Beauvais","offset":947},{"uri":"Art_Deco","surface_form":"Arts D\u00E9coratifs'","offset":1091},{"uri":"Guillaume_Apollinaire","surface_form":"Guillaume Apollinaire","offset":1120},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Salmon","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Salmon","offset":1222},{"uri":"Suzanne_Duchamp","surface_form":"Suzanne Duchamp","offset":1337},{"uri":"Marie_Laurencin","surface_form":"Marie Laurencin","offset":1357},{"uri":"Colette","surface_form":"Colette","offset":1399},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Blois","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Blois","offset":1691},{"uri":"Blois","surface_form":"Blois","offset":1962},{"uri":"Grenoble","surface_form":"Grenoble","offset":1976}]}
