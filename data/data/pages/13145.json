{"id":13145,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Constance","text":"Lake Constace or Lake of Constance (German: \"Bodensee\") is a large Lake on the river Rhine. It is on the border between Germany and Switzerland and Austria. It is the third largest lake in Central Europe after Lake Balaton and Lake Geneva. It is made of two smaller lakes (called \"Obersee\" and \"Untersee\" (Upper and lower lake) respectively). These are joined by a small part of river in Constance.\nThe lake covers about of total area.\nThere are three big islands in the lake. The islands Lindau and Mainau are in the \"Obersee\". Reichenau is in the \"Untersee\". The Obersee is about long, from Bregenz to Bodman-Ludwigshafen. It is about wide at its widest point between Romanshorn and Friedrichshafen. The deepest point is deep, between Fischbach and Uttwil (just off Constance).\nThe lake forms the border between Austria, Germany and Switzerland. On much of its length, this border has not been defined. Switzerland thinks the border runs through the middle of the lake. Austria thinks the lake is a condominium of all the countries. A condominium is a space that is governed by all countries taking part in it. Germany has no clear view.\nOther legal issues, like navigation and fishing are governed by separate treaties. About 62% of the lake's shoreline belongs to Germany, about 33% to Switzerland, and the remaining 11% to Austria.\nIn 1963, the whole lake froze. This has not happened since then.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":36},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"Lake","offset":67},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":79},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":85},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":120},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":132},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":148},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":189},{"uri":"Balaton","surface_form":"Balaton","offset":215},{"uri":"Lake_Geneva","surface_form":"Lake Geneva","offset":227},{"uri":"Constance","surface_form":"Constance","offset":388},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":456},{"uri":"Lindau","surface_form":"Lindau","offset":489},{"uri":"Mainau","surface_form":"Mainau","offset":500},{"uri":"Reichenau","surface_form":"Reichenau","offset":529},{"uri":"Bregenz","surface_form":"Bregenz","offset":593},{"uri":"Bodman-Ludwigshafen","surface_form":"Bodman-Ludwigshafen","offset":604},{"uri":"Romanshorn","surface_form":"Romanshorn","offset":670},{"uri":"Friedrichshafen","surface_form":"Friedrichshafen","offset":685},{"uri":"Fischbach","surface_form":"Fischbach","offset":737},{"uri":"Uttwil","surface_form":"Uttwil","offset":751},{"uri":"Condominium","surface_form":"condominium","offset":1001},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":1165},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":1180},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaties","offset":1213},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"shoreline","offset":1247}]}
