{"id":13148,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic","text":"\"The Republic\" is a book by Plato. It was finished in 390 BC.\nIt asks the question 'why should people do good things?' and also the question 'are people punished for doing bad things?'.\nPlato said that people should not do bad things because people who do bad things end up unhappy.\nHowever, people who do good things end up happy.\nHe also said that if people who do bad things get power in a society then that society will become an unhappy one.\nPlato believed that philosophers are best able to do good things and so they should be given power in a society.\nHe thought that non-philosophers should allow themselves to be ruled by philosophers and that if they do this then they will be happy, because the rule of peoples (democracy) often fall because of unreasonable confusion.\nHowever, in order not to be tempted to do bad things, the philosophers who have power must not be able to have things or feel love.\nPlato also talked about many other things while discussing these questions including metaphysics, psychology, religion and most branches of philosophy.\nHe introduced the philosophy called Platonism.\nPlato's argument (Less Simple).\nPlato thought that people and societies are very much alike.\nHe said that a good person will listen to all these things, but will let the mind control the other two.\nSomebody who does not listen to all three parts, or who does not let the mind control the other two will be unhappy.\nThey might go mad because they do not let the mind control them.\nOr they might do things that they later regret.\nThey will also be disliked by other people and will suffer because of that.\nHe said that they will be like a country in anarchy.\nPlato also thought society should be made up of three things (types of people)\nHe said that society needs all three things (types of people) but that only the philosophers will be good people.\nThe others will be dominated by their souls or bodies, not their minds.\nThe soldiers will not even listen to their minds, and the workers will not listen to their minds or their souls.\nThis is why the philosophers should rule and the other types of people should be soldiers and workers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":28},{"uri":"390_BC","surface_form":"390 BC","offset":54},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"power","offset":382},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":393},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":467},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":724},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":907},{"uri":"Metaphysics","surface_form":"metaphysics","offset":998},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":1011},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":1023},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":1053},{"uri":"Platonism","surface_form":"Platonism","offset":1101},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"people","offset":1163},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"societies","offset":1174},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":1649},{"uri":"Anarchy","surface_form":"anarchy","offset":1660}]}
