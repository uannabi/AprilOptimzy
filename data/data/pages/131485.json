Chapter 1 verse 5 says Micah was from Moresheth (a town in southern Judah). He lived during the reigns of Yehotam, Ahaz and Hezekiah, roughly 750\u2013700 BC.\nDuring this time, after a long period of peace, Israel, Judah, and the other nations of the region were threatened by the Neo-Assyrian empire. Micah warns that there would be a military defeat as punishment for worshiping idols and treating poor people badly by the powerful. This happened to the kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in 721 and to the kingdom of Judah (Jerusalem) about 100 years later. The book contains three cycles of warning about punishment and promise of restoration.\nQuotes.\nThe book of Micah is quoted by the New Testament writer Matthew in chapter 2, verses 5 and 6\nModern preachers have often quoted Micah Chapter 6, verse 8","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":64},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":95},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":155},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":187}]}
