{"id":131582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabellianism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sabelianism is a position in Christian theology. It is against to the idea of the trinity, but embraces Morpheus. Sabellianism is also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism. Basically, the teaching says that God has three masks, and humans see him in three different ways, but he is in fact only one.\nThose in favor.\nHistoric Sabellianism taught that God the Father was the only person of the Godhead, a belief known as Monarchianism. One author has described Sabellius' teaching: \"The true question, therefore, turns on this, viz., what is it which constitutes what we name \u2018person\u2019 in the Godhead? Is it original, substantial, essential to divinity itself? Or does it belong to and arise from the exhibitions and developments which the divine Being has made of himself to his creatures? The former Sabellius denied; the latter he fully admitted.\"\nModalists say that the only number given to God in the Holy Bible is \"One\". Christian texts do not explicitley talk about God being \"three\". The number three is never mentioned in texts talking about God. The number three is the number that is central to the word \"Trinity\". There is one text known as Comma Johanneum which may be an exception to this. The comma Johanneum is a disputed text passage in First John. The text is mainly known from the King James Version of the Bible and some versions of the Textus Receptus. It is usually not included in modern critical texts. Modalism has been mainly associated with Sabellius, who taught a form of it in Rome in the third century.\nHippolytus of Rome knew Sabellius personally and mentioned him in the \"Philosophumena\". He knew Sabellius disliked Trinitarian theology, but he said Modal Monarchism was the heresy of Noetos, not that of Sabellius.\nChristians in Cyrenaica liked Sabellianism, and converted to it. Demetrius, Patriarch of Alexandria, wrote many letters to them arguing against this belief.\nCritics.\nThe primary critic was Tertullian, who said that they crucified the Father.\nIt is important to note that our only sources available for our understanding of Sabellianism are from people who opposed it. Scholars today do not agree what exactly Sabellius or Praxeus taught. It is easy to think Tertullian and Hippolytus misrepresented the opinions of their opponents.\nTertullian seems to suggest that the majority of believers at that time favoured the Sabellian view of the oneness of God. Epiphanius (Haeres 62) about 375 AD notes that Sabellius still had many followers, both in Mesopotamia and at Rome. The second general council at Constantinople in 533 AD declared the baptism of Sabellius to be invalid, which indicates that Sabellianism was still around.\nIts position today.\nSabellianism has been rejected by the majority of Christian churches in favour of Trinitarianism. This was done through the Athanasian Creed, which says that God is three distinct persons. Each one of the three is equal to the others, and eternal in the same way than the other two.\nMichael Servetus and Emanuel Swedenborg were scientists of the 16th and 17th century. Some of the tests thy have written seem to suggest that they were in favor of Modalism. Neither of the two describes God as appearing in three modes. Both describe him as the One Divine Person, Jesus Christ, who has a Divine Soul of Love, Divine Mind of Truth, and Divine Body of Activity. Jesus merged his human form with the divine. By doing this, he became entirely One with His Divine Soul from the Father in such a way that the persons could no longer be kept apart.\nOneness Pentecostalism teaches that the Father (a spirit) is united with Jesus (a man) as the Son of God. However, Oneness Pentecostalism is very different from Sabellianism, because it rejects sequential modalism. They teach that God was fully God and fully man.\nOneness Pentecostalism and Sabellianism can be compared to each other, because they are both Notrinitarian. There may be several differences between both positions though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":42},{"uri":"Trinity","surface_form":"trinity","offset":95},{"uri":"Morpheus","surface_form":"Morpheus","offset":117},{"uri":"Mask","surface_form":"mask","offset":262},{"uri":"God_the_Father","surface_form":"God the Father","offset":391},{"uri":"Monarchianism","surface_form":"Monarchianism","offset":460},{"uri":"Comma_Johanneum","surface_form":"Comma Johanneum","offset":1191},{"uri":"First_John","surface_form":"First John","offset":1292},{"uri":"King_James_Version","surface_form":"King James Version","offset":1338},{"uri":"Textus_Receptus","surface_form":"Textus Receptus","offset":1395},{"uri":"Sabellius","surface_form":"Sabellius","offset":1506},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1544},{"uri":"Hippolytus_of_Rome","surface_form":"Hippolytus of Rome","offset":1571},{"uri":"Philosophumena","surface_form":"Philosophumena","offset":1642},{"uri":"Trinitarianism","surface_form":"Trinitarian","offset":1686},{"uri":"Christian_heresy","surface_form":"heresy","offset":1745},{"uri":"Noetos","surface_form":"Noetos","offset":1755},{"uri":"Cyrenaica","surface_form":"Cyrenaica","offset":1800},{"uri":"Demetrius_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Demetrius","offset":1851},{"uri":"Patriarch_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Patriarch of Alexandria","offset":1862},{"uri":"Tertullian","surface_form":"Tertullian","offset":1975},{"uri":"Epiphanius","surface_form":"Epiphanius","offset":2441},{"uri":"Trinitarianism","surface_form":"Trinitarianism","offset":2815},{"uri":"Athanasian_Creed","surface_form":"Athanasian Creed","offset":2857},{"uri":"Michael_Servetus","surface_form":"Michael Servetus","offset":3016},{"uri":"Emanuel_Swedenborg","surface_form":"Emanuel Swedenborg","offset":3037},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th","offset":3079},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":3088},{"uri":"Oneness_Pentecostalism","surface_form":"Oneness Pentecostalism","offset":3574},{"uri":"Nontrinitarianism","surface_form":"Notrinitarian","offset":3931}]}
