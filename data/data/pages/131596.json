It is named after the prophet Ezekiel.\nIt belongs to the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") and consists of 48 chapters.\nThe book begins with a vision of God in heaven and describes wheels and strange beings around his throne. Another well known dream that the prophet saw was a valley full of dry bones that came to life when the prophet spoke to them. This was to show that God would bring life back to the people who were being punished by being taken captive by Babylon These two stories have been made into songs.\nThe prophet did some strange things to warn the people that they were going to be punished for a time because they had not been faithful to God as he had told them to.\nIt deals among others with the revival of the Jewish people and the Land of Israel (chapters 36-37), with the war of Gog and Magog against Israel (chapters 38-39), the new Jewish temple (chapters 40-47), and the determination of the boundaries of the land and also the division of the land among the tribes of Israel (chapters 47-48).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":34},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":71},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":95},{"uri":"Ezekiel","surface_form":"Ezekiel","offset":140},{"uri":"Nevi%27im","surface_form":"Nevi'im","offset":167},{"uri":"Babylon","surface_form":"Babylon","offset":562},{"uri":"Jewish_people","surface_form":"Jewish people","offset":829},{"uri":"Land_of_Israel","surface_form":"Land of Israel","offset":851},{"uri":"Gog_and_Magog","surface_form":"Gog and Magog","offset":900},{"uri":"Temple_in_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jewish temple","offset":955},{"uri":"Tribes_of_Israel","surface_form":"tribes of Israel","offset":1083}]}
