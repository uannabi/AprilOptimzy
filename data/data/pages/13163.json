{"id":13163,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte","text":"=\"preserve\">A megabyte (MB) is a large number used when talking about hard drives or computer memory. One megabyte is 1 million bytes or 1 thousand kilobytes.\nUntil December 1998, when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) first defined a mebibyte as 220, or 1,048,576 bytes, \"megabyte\" also meant either 1,048,576 bytes, or 1,024,000 bytes. Casual computer users still often use megabyte to mean one of these numbers.\nOne thousand megabytes make one gigabyte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hard_disk","surface_form":"hard drives","offset":70},{"uri":"Computer_memory","surface_form":"computer memory","offset":85},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":128},{"uri":"Kilobyte","surface_form":"kilobyte","offset":148},{"uri":"International_Electrotechnical_Commission","surface_form":"International Electrotechnical Commission","offset":189},{"uri":"Mebibyte","surface_form":"mebibyte","offset":253},{"uri":"Gigabyte","surface_form":"gigabyte","offset":465}]}
