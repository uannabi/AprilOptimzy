He was a member of the Kaw Nation. Every other vice president has been Caucasian, except Vice Presidential-elect Kamala Harris. Curtis called himself \"one-eighth Kaw Indian and a one-hundred percent Republican.\" In 1900, Kaw Chief Washungah called Curtis \"one of our own men.\"\nCurtis grew up in Kansas and spoke the Kaw language.
