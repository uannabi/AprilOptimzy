{"id":13186,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Eat_World","text":"Jimmy Eat World is an alternative rock band. They formed in Mesa, Arizona in 1994. To date, they have released six studio albums. They may record one more album on their label for a 2009 release, but after that will consider self-releasing. They have released many singles, including \"Sweetness\", \"The Middle\", \"Bleed American\", \"Rockstar\", and \"Let It Happen\".\nThey used to be part of the emo scene and many would still call them that. However, the band has never liked that term and do not even understand that. While their albums do have considerable emo influences, the album \"Future\" brought on a change of sound and a different fanbase.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":22},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":39},{"uri":"Mesa%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Mesa, Arizona","offset":60},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":77},{"uri":"Sweetness_(song)","surface_form":"Sweetness","offset":285},{"uri":"The_Middle","surface_form":"The Middle","offset":298},{"uri":"Bleed_American","surface_form":"Bleed American","offset":312},{"uri":"Rockstar","surface_form":"Rockstar","offset":330},{"uri":"Let_It_Happen","surface_form":"Let It Happen","offset":346},{"uri":"Emo","surface_form":"emo","offset":390}]}
