{"id":13188,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phish","text":"e=\"preserve\">Phish is an American rock band. They formed in Vermont in 1983, broke up in 2004, and reformed in 2009. Their lead singer is Trey Anastasio. Phish was often compared to the Grateful Dead, and had a similar following of \"Phish Heads\" following the band on tour. They went on a 5-year-long hiatus from 2004 to 2009. Their hiatus ended when they played shows on March 6, 7 and 8 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, VA. The band surprised the audience with longer sets than usual.\nTheir music has a lot of improvisation, so when they play live, their songs are sometimes a lot longer. They use elements from many genres, including rock, jazz, funk, progressive rock, bluegrass, country, reggae, blues, Latin, and psychedelic rock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":25},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":34},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":60},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":71},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":89},{"uri":"2009","surface_form":"2009","offset":111},{"uri":"Improvisation","surface_form":"improvisation","offset":515},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":640},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":646},{"uri":"Funk","surface_form":"funk","offset":652},{"uri":"Progressive_rock","surface_form":"progressive rock","offset":658},{"uri":"Bluegrass","surface_form":"bluegrass","offset":676},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country","offset":687},{"uri":"Reggae","surface_form":"reggae","offset":696},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":704},{"uri":"Latin_music","surface_form":"Latin","offset":711},{"uri":"Psychedelic_rock","surface_form":"psychedelic rock","offset":722}]}
