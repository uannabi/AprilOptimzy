{"id":131903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Park","text":"Richmond Park is a 955 hectare (2,360 acres) park in outer London. Originally, it was outside London, in Surrey. It is now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.\nThe park was created by Charles I in the 17th century as a deer park. It is the largest of London's Royal Parks. It is of national and international importance for wildlife conservation. The park is a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. It is included, at Grade I, on the \"Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England\".\nIt is the largest of the eight Royal Parks in London, and is famous for red and fallow deer. It is about three times the size of Central Park in New York (341 hectares or 843 acres).\nNotable features in the park include Pembroke Lodge, once the home of the British Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Also in the park is White Lodge, home of the Royal Ballet School and once a royal residence. One house in the park, Thatched House Lodge, is the residence of Princess Alexandra.\nThe park is fully open to the public, with access by road, bicycles and pedestrians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hectare","surface_form":"hectare","offset":23},{"uri":"Acre","surface_form":"acre","offset":38},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":45},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":105},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Richmond_upon_Thames","surface_form":"London Borough of Richmond upon Thames","offset":130},{"uri":"Charles_I_of_England","surface_form":"Charles I","offset":194},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":229},{"uri":"Royal_Parks","surface_form":"Royal Parks","offset":270},{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":343},{"uri":"Nature_reserve","surface_form":"nature reserve","offset":380},{"uri":"Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest","surface_form":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","offset":398},{"uri":"Special_Area_of_Conservation","surface_form":"Special Area of Conservation","offset":440},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":633},{"uri":"Red_Deer","surface_form":"red","offset":659},{"uri":"Fallow_deer","surface_form":"fallow deer","offset":667},{"uri":"Central_Park","surface_form":"Central Park","offset":716},{"uri":"Hectare","surface_form":"hectare","offset":746},{"uri":"Acres","surface_form":"acres","offset":762},{"uri":"Pembroke_Lodge","surface_form":"Pembroke Lodge","offset":807},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"the British Prime Minister","offset":840},{"uri":"John_Russell%2C_1st_Earl_Russell","surface_form":"Lord John Russell","offset":867},{"uri":"White_Lodge","surface_form":"White Lodge","offset":906},{"uri":"Royal_Ballet_School","surface_form":"Royal Ballet School","offset":931},{"uri":"Thatched_House_Lodge","surface_form":"Thatched House Lodge","offset":1002},{"uri":"Princess_Alexandra%2C_the_Honourable_Lady_Ogilvy","surface_form":"Princess Alexandra","offset":1044}]}
