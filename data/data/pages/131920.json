{"id":131920,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew%2C_Duke_of_York","text":"Prince Andrew, Duke of York, (Andrew Albert Christian Edward, born 19 February 1960) is a member of the British Royal Family, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He has been titled Duke of York since 1986, and is eighth in line to the succession to the throne of the United Kingdom.\nLife.\nPrince Andrew was born at Buckingham Palace in London. He went to Heatherdown Preparatory School in Berkshire, England, and Gordonstoun in Scotland. Prince Andrew did not go to university, he went to Britannia Royal Naval College instead. In the Navy, he served in the Falklands War, and continued his career, becoming a commander in 1999 and an honorary captain in 2001.\nIn 1986, Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson, the younger daughter of Ronald Ferguson, the polo manager for the Prince of Wales. They have two daughters from the marriage: Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Andrew and Sarah separated in 1992, and divorced in May 1996.\nIn November 2019, Prince Andrew was interviewed for the BBC television programme \"Newsnight\" on 16 November 2019. The interviewer talked about the Prince's friendship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before he died. The interview was very bad for the British royal family, because many people who saw the interview thought Prince Andrew was unsympathetic to Epstein's victims. As of 20 November, he has no official royal duties.\nTitles and styles.\nPrince Andrew's current full style is \"His Royal Highness\" \"The Prince Andrew Albert Christian Edward, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh, Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Personal Aide-de-Camp to The Queen.\"\nArms.\nThe whole differenced by a Label of three points Argent the central point charged with an \"Anchor Azure\". The anchor is in reference to his naval career.\nThe arms are identical to those his grandfather George VI used when still Duke of York.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Royal_Family","surface_form":"British Royal Family","offset":104},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Elizabeth II","offset":150},{"uri":"Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","offset":167},{"uri":"Buckingham_Palace","surface_form":"Buckingham Palace","offset":354},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":375},{"uri":"Heatherdown_Preparatory_School","surface_form":"Heatherdown Preparatory School","offset":394},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":428},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":439},{"uri":"Gordonstoun","surface_form":"Gordonstoun","offset":452},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":467},{"uri":"Britannia_Royal_Naval_College","surface_form":"Britannia Royal Naval College","offset":528},{"uri":"Falklands_War","surface_form":"Falklands War","offset":597},{"uri":"Commander","surface_form":"commander","offset":649},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":683},{"uri":"Sarah%2C_Duchess_of_York","surface_form":"Sarah Ferguson","offset":731},{"uri":"Ronald_Ferguson","surface_form":"Ronald Ferguson","offset":771},{"uri":"Polo","surface_form":"polo","offset":792},{"uri":"Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales","surface_form":"Prince of Wales","offset":813},{"uri":"Princess_Beatrice_of_York","surface_form":"Princess Beatrice","offset":873},{"uri":"Princess_Eugenie_of_York","surface_form":"Princess Eugenie","offset":895},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":953},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":1031},{"uri":"Child_sexual_abuse","surface_form":"child sex","offset":1161},{"uri":"Jeffrey_Epstein","surface_form":"Jeffrey Epstein","offset":1180},{"uri":"Sympathy","surface_form":"unsympathetic","offset":1337},{"uri":"Duty","surface_form":"duties","offset":1417},{"uri":"George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George VI","offset":1948}]}
