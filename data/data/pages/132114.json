To accommodate Grand Prix racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but it was only used for motorcycle racing until 1924. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24 hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track.\nRepeat winners (drivers).\n\"Drivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\nRepeat winners (constructors).\n\"Teams in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\n\"A yellow background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (engine manufacturers).\n\"Manufacturers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\n\"A yellow background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship.\"\nYear by year.\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\n\"A yellow background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship.\"\n\"A green background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war World Manufacturers' Championship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Auto_racing","surface_form":"motor race","offset":29},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":53},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":112},{"uri":"1925","surface_form":"1925","offset":132},{"uri":"Spa%2C_Belgium","surface_form":"Spa","offset":144},{"uri":"Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps","surface_form":"Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps","offset":342},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":396},{"uri":"24_hours_of_Le_Mans","surface_form":"24 hours of Le Mans","offset":490},{"uri":"Spa_24_Hours","surface_form":"Spa 24 Hours","offset":525},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"war","offset":991},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"war","offset":1314},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"war","offset":1519},{"uri":"World_Manufacturers%27_Championship","surface_form":"World Manufacturers' Championship","offset":1616}]}
