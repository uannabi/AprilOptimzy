{"id":132126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix","text":"The Canadian Grand Prix (known in French as the \"Grand Prix du Canada\") is an auto race held in Canada since 1961. It has been part of the Formula One World Championship since 1967. It was first staged at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario as a sports car event before it alternated between Mosport and Circuit Mont-Tremblant, Quebec after Formula One took over the event. After 1971 safety concerns led to the Grand Prix moving permanently to Mosport. In 1978 the Canadian Grand Prix moved to its current home on Circuit \u00CEle Notre-Dame in Montreal. In 1982, the track was renamed to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. This was to honour Canadian Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve, following his death in 1982.\nRepeat winners (drivers).\n\"Drivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (constructors).\n\"Teams in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (engine manufacturers).\n\"Manufacturers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nYear by year.\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nUnited Kingdom.\n2006: Race started on ITV4 due to ITV showing coverage of the FIFA World Cup but simulcasted the race with ITV until the end of the race.\n2011: Race started on BBC One, but finished on BBC Two and BBC HD due to rain delays.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":34},{"uri":"Auto_racing","surface_form":"auto race","offset":78},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":96},{"uri":"1961","surface_form":"1961","offset":109},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One World Championship","offset":139},{"uri":"Mosport","surface_form":"Mosport","offset":205},{"uri":"Bowmanville%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Bowmanville, Ontario","offset":221},{"uri":"Sports_car_racing","surface_form":"sports car","offset":247},{"uri":"Circuit_Mont-Tremblant","surface_form":"Circuit Mont-Tremblant","offset":305},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":329},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":381},{"uri":"1978","surface_form":"1978","offset":458},{"uri":"Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve","surface_form":"Circuit \u00CEle Notre-Dame","offset":516},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":542},{"uri":"Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve","surface_form":"Circuit Gilles Villeneuve","offset":586},{"uri":"Gilles_Villeneuve","surface_form":"Gilles Villeneuve","offset":660},{"uri":"ITV4","surface_form":"ITV4","offset":1509},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":1549},{"uri":"BBC_One","surface_form":"BBC One","offset":1647},{"uri":"BBC_Two","surface_form":"BBC Two","offset":1672},{"uri":"BBC_HD","surface_form":"BBC HD","offset":1684}]}
