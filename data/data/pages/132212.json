The oil in the leaves of some \"Nepeta\" species gives cats euphoria, that is, it makes them feel good. They get a \"high\", roll around, and may cry out, jump and behave in an unusual way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":14},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":33},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":44},{"uri":"Lamiaceae","surface_form":"Lamiaceae","offset":75},{"uri":"Catnip","surface_form":"catnip","offset":126},{"uri":"House_cat","surface_form":"house cat","offset":171}]}
