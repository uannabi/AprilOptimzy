{"id":13228,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb","text":"The thumb is one of the five fingers on the human hand. Thumbs are different from the other four fingers because they are in a different direction, have only two bones (the others have three) and are shorter. Thumbs help us to pick things up. This is called having \"opposable thumbs\". All primate<nowiki/>s have thumbs but humans have fully opposable thumbs.\nThumbs have an artery in them. Arteries have a pulse. This is why we should not take other peoples' pulses with our thumbs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hand","surface_form":"hand","offset":50},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":137},{"uri":"Phalanges","surface_form":"bones","offset":162},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":289},{"uri":"Artery","surface_form":"artery","offset":374},{"uri":"Pulse","surface_form":"pulse","offset":406}]}
