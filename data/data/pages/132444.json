{"id":132444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hammer_(businessman)","text":"Victor Hammer (1901 in New York City - July 21, 1985), was a businessman, founder and owner of the famed Hammer Galleries in New York City, and the younger brother of Armand Hammer.\nVictor attended Princeton University, where he graduated in 1921 with a degree in Art History.\nVictor was business partner to his brother Armand Hammer on several business ventures, including Hammer Galleries in New York City, founded in 1928 as a way to funnel profits made in Soviet Russia out of that country. At one point, British Intelligence believed Hammer Galleries was a front for Soviet Intelligence. The Hammer brothers had been in contact with Soviet authorities for a number of reasons, such as famine relief as well as when the Soviets sought a buyer for the treasures of the Hermitage as a way to earn hard currency. Victor was responsible for acquisitions for Hammer Galleries, including the so-called Romanov Treasures and Faberg\u00E9 eggs. In 1937, Time Magazine described Victor and Armand as \"Two of the most startling characters in the U. S. art world are the Brothers Armand and Victor Hammer, one with a medical degree, both friends of Soviet Russia.\".\nVictor Hammer was a prolific philanthropist. He, along with his brothers Harry and Armand, purchased Campobello Island and donated it to the US and Canada as the countries' first joint park, known as Roosevelt Campobello International Park","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1901","surface_form":"1901","offset":15},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":23},{"uri":"July_21","surface_form":"July 21","offset":39},{"uri":"1985","surface_form":"1985","offset":48},{"uri":"Hammer_Galleries","surface_form":"Hammer Galleries","offset":105},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":125},{"uri":"Armand_Hammer","surface_form":"Armand Hammer","offset":167},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton University","offset":198},{"uri":"Armand_Hammer","surface_form":"Armand Hammer","offset":320},{"uri":"Hammer_Galleries","surface_form":"Hammer Galleries","offset":374},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":394},{"uri":"1928","surface_form":"1928","offset":420},{"uri":"British_Intelligence","surface_form":"British Intelligence","offset":509},{"uri":"Hammer_Galleries","surface_form":"Hammer Galleries","offset":539},{"uri":"Soviet_Intelligence","surface_form":"Soviet Intelligence","offset":572},{"uri":"Hermitage","surface_form":"Hermitage","offset":772},{"uri":"Romanov_Treasures","surface_form":"Romanov Treasures","offset":900},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":939},{"uri":"Campobello_Island","surface_form":"Campobello Island","offset":1255},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":1295},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1302},{"uri":"Roosevelt_Campobello_International_Park","surface_form":"Roosevelt Campobello International Park","offset":1354}]}
