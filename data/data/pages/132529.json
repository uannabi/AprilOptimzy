{"id":132529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editors","text":"Editors have so far made two platinum albums, selling over two million copies around the world. Their first album, \"The Back Room\", came out in 2005. It had hit songs such as \"Munich\" and \"Blood\" and the following year was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Their next album \"An End Has a Start\" went to number one in the UK Album Chart in June 2007. It was nominated for a BRIT Award for best British Band. The second album also had a Top 10 hit single, \"Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors\".\nAfter success in the charts, sold out tours and playing as the main act at many festivals, The Mail on Sunday newspaper said the Editors were the second biggest British band of the decade, after Arctic Monkeys. Their style of epic, sweeping, indie rock is often compared to the sound of bands such as Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Interpol and U2.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_recording_sales_certification","surface_form":"platinum","offset":29},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":38},{"uri":"The_Back_Room","surface_form":"The Back Room","offset":116},{"uri":"Munich_(song)","surface_form":"Munich","offset":176},{"uri":"Blood_(Editors_song)","surface_form":"Blood","offset":189},{"uri":"Nominate","surface_form":"nominated","offset":223},{"uri":"Mercury_Prize","surface_form":"Mercury Prize","offset":241},{"uri":"An_End_Has_a_Start","surface_form":"An End Has a Start","offset":274},{"uri":"UK_Album_Chart","surface_form":"UK Album Chart","offset":320},{"uri":"BRIT_Awards","surface_form":"BRIT Award","offset":372},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":445},{"uri":"Smokers_Outside_the_Hospital_Doors","surface_form":"Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors","offset":454},{"uri":"UK_Charts","surface_form":"charts","offset":512},{"uri":"Music_festival","surface_form":"festivals","offset":571},{"uri":"The_Mail_on_Sunday","surface_form":"The Mail on Sunday","offset":582},{"uri":"2000%E2%80%932009","surface_form":"decade","offset":672},{"uri":"Arctic_Monkeys","surface_form":"Arctic Monkeys","offset":686},{"uri":"Echo_and_the_Bunnymen","surface_form":"Echo and the Bunnymen","offset":792},{"uri":"Joy_Division","surface_form":"Joy Division","offset":815},{"uri":"Interpol_(band)","surface_form":"Interpol","offset":829},{"uri":"U2","surface_form":"U2","offset":842}]}
