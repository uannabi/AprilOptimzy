{"id":13256,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter","text":"A carpenter is a person who works with wood. They can make cabinets, build houses, or do other things with wood.\nCarpenters usually make very good foremen (people who watch over a job) on larger jobs as they deal with so much of the project from ground up. Carpenters are always adding to their tools and always learning how to use the new tools, materials, and ways of working with wood.\nMany carpenters will choose to focus their skills in one of two broad ranging categories. Rough carpenters will focus on building things that need to be simple and structural. This includes framing for houses, or crates for shipping. Finish carpenters will focus on things that are detailed and artistic. For example, they can be furniture builders, cabinet makers or toy makers. Wood carvers are sometimes counted as carpenters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":39},{"uri":"Cabinet_(furniture)","surface_form":"cabinets","offset":59},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":75},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":591},{"uri":"Crate","surface_form":"crate","offset":602},{"uri":"Furniture","surface_form":"furniture","offset":719},{"uri":"Cabinet_making","surface_form":"cabinet makers","offset":739},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy","offset":757},{"uri":"Wood_carver","surface_form":"Wood carver","offset":769}]}
