{"id":132624,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Moore_Sitterly","text":"e=\"preserve\">Charlotte Emma Moore Sitterly (September 24, 1898 \u2013 March 3, 1990) was an American astronomer.\nCharlotte Moore was born in Ercildoun, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Swarthmore College in 1920 and went on to Princeton to assist Henry Norris Russell. During this time, she worked at the Princeton University Observatory and the Mt. Wilson Observatory. She worked much on solar spectroscopy, studying the spectral lines of the Sun and identifying the chemical elements in the Sun. She earned a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1931 from the University of California, Berkeley on a Lick Fellowship. She then returned to Princeton.\nDuring her second stay at Princeton, she met and married Bancroft W. Sitterly, who became a physics professor. She joined the then National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in 1945. Her tables of atomic spectra and energy levels, published by NBS, have remained essential references in spectroscopy for decades.\nLater in her life, it became possible to launch instruments on rockets and she extended her work to the ultraviolet spectral lines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_24","surface_form":"September 24","offset":44},{"uri":"1898","surface_form":"1898","offset":58},{"uri":"March_3","surface_form":"March 3","offset":65},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":74},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":87},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":96},{"uri":"Ercildoun%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Ercildoun","offset":136},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":147},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":165},{"uri":"Swarthmore_College","surface_form":"Swarthmore College","offset":180},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton","offset":222},{"uri":"Henry_Norris_Russell","surface_form":"Henry Norris Russell","offset":242},{"uri":"Princeton_University_Observatory","surface_form":"Princeton University Observatory","offset":300},{"uri":"Mt._Wilson_Observatory","surface_form":"Mt.
