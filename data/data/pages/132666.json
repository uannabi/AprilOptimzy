{"id":132666,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant","text":"e=\"preserve\">An antioxidant is a molecule that can slow or stop the oxidation, or electron transfer, of other molecules.\nAntioxidants can be found in food.\nAntioxidants are molecules that relieve oxidative stress by preventing the formation and oxidation of free radicals. Antioxidants donate one of their electrons or hydrogen to free radicals, stopping their chain reaction. Found in our diet (for example, in vitamins) or formed inside our body (like enzymes), antioxidants can protect us from the damaging effects of free radicals.\nThe best way to combat free radicals is to have a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, red wine, and green tea. These functional foods are rich in phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. Health supplements enriched with antioxidants are also now widely available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":33},{"uri":"Redox","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":68}]}
