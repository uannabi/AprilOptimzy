{"id":133014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander","text":"Anaximander (; \"Anaximandros\"; c. 610 \u2013 c. 546 BC) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia. He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded him and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and Pythagoras amongst his pupils.\nLittle of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies, although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pre-Socratic","surface_form":"Pre-Socratic","offset":57},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":70},{"uri":"Miletus","surface_form":"Miletus","offset":101},{"uri":"Ionia","surface_form":"Ionia","offset":120},{"uri":"Milesian_school","surface_form":"Milesian school","offset":146},{"uri":"Thales","surface_form":"Thales","offset":202},{"uri":"Anaximenes_of_Miletus","surface_form":"Anaximenes","offset":288},{"uri":"Pythagoras","surface_form":"Pythagoras","offset":303}]}
