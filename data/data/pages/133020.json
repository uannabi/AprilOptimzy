{"id":133020,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sophism can mean two very different things. In Ancient Greece, sophism was practiced by \"sophists\", who were a group of teachers of philosophy and rhetoric. In the modern definition, a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"sophism\" originated from the Greek word \u03C3\u03CC\u03C6\u03B9\u03C3\u03BC\u03B1, \"sophisma\" (from \u03C3\u03BF\u03C6\u03AF\u03B6\u03C9, \"sophizo\" meaning \"I am wise\").\nThe similar Greek word \u03C3\u03BF\u03C6\u03B9\u03C3\u03C4\u03AE\u03C2, \"sophist\u0113s\" means \"wise-ist, one who does wisdom, one who makes a business out of wisdom\" while \u03C3\u03BF\u03C6\u03CC\u03C2, \"soph\u00F3s\" means a \"wise man\".\nHistory.\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras\n(ca. 490\u2013420\u00A0BC) is often said to be the first of the sophists. Others include: Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Lycophron, Callicles, Antiphon, and Cratylus.\nPlato opposed those sophists because they only abused wisdom for their own interest and refused the truth and justice.\nModern usage.\nIn modern usage, \"sophism\", \"sophist\", and \"sophistry\" are derogatory terms, due the influence of many philosophers in the past. Sophism and platonism were rival schools, as enemies of each other.\nA \"sophism\" is a statement to deceive someone in a debate or conversation. It might be made to seem to make sense when really being wrong, or it might use difficult words and complicated sentences to intimidate the audience into agreeing. An argument \"ad hominem\" is an example of sophistry.\nA \"sophist\" is a person who uses sophisms. \"Sophistry\" means using sophisms for subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":60},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":145},{"uri":"Rhetoric","surface_form":"rhetoric","offset":160},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":295},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":330},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":585},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":599},{"uri":"Protagoras","surface_form":"Protagoras","offset":611},{"uri":"Gorgias","surface_form":"Gorgias","offset":702},{"uri":"Prodicus","surface_form":"Prodicus","offset":711},{"uri":"Hippias","surface_form":"Hippias","offset":721},{"uri":"Thrasymachus","surface_form":"Thrasymachus","offset":730},{"uri":"Lycophron","surface_form":"Lycophron","offset":744},{"uri":"Callicles","surface_form":"Callicles","offset":755},{"uri":"Antiphon_(person)","surface_form":"Antiphon","offset":766},{"uri":"Cratylus","surface_form":"Cratylus","offset":780},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":790},{"uri":"Truth","surface_form":"truth","offset":890},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":900},{"uri":"Derogatory","surface_form":"derogatory","offset":982},{"uri":"Platonism","surface_form":"platonism","offset":1064},{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":1171},{"uri":"Ad_hominem","surface_form":"ad hominem","offset":1372}]}
