{"id":133059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmata","text":"Stigmata are marks on a person's body, that are like the wounds Jesus got from being crucified.\nThey supposedly happen to other religious people like Saint Francis of Assisi, as well as Jesus. The marks include nail holes in the hands and feet, as if the person had been crucified, but without that having happened.\nContradictions.\nThose who believe in stigmata say that actual nails were not used, but the holes just appear as a miracle. Those who do not believe say it is not a miracle. They have other ways to explain those stories.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":33},{"uri":"Wound","surface_form":"wound","offset":57},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":64},{"uri":"Crucified","surface_form":"crucified","offset":85},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":128},{"uri":"Saint_Francis_of_Assisi","surface_form":"Saint Francis of Assisi","offset":150},{"uri":"Nail","surface_form":"nail","offset":211},{"uri":"Crucified","surface_form":"crucified","offset":271},{"uri":"Miracle","surface_form":"miracle","offset":430}]}
