Old World orioles are found areas of Africa, Asia and Europe. They are most often found in tropical areas but one species lives in cooler areas. The golden oriole is the only species of Old World oriole which is not a tropical bird.\nMany species have bright coloured feathers.\nThe orioles evolved in Australasia, and later spread to Eurasia. They are not related to the New World oriole. New World orioles are members of the blackbird family \"Icteridae\" and are native to the Americas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":38},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":50},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":85},{"uri":"Old_World","surface_form":"Old World","offset":102},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":139},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":147},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":156},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropical","offset":193},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":216},{"uri":"Golden_oriole","surface_form":"golden oriole","offset":251},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":369},{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":391},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":402},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":435},{"uri":"New_World_oriole","surface_form":"New World oriole","offset":472},{"uri":"Blackbird","surface_form":"blackbird","offset":527},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":574}]}
