{"id":13317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity","text":"Common identities.\nMuch of dominant society across cultures follows the construction of the gender binary, prescribing that everyone must either be a man or a woman. However, more genders exist outside of male and female. Recent decades have brought new terminology and means of using language to make space for a range of genders. And more importantly, the rise of LGBTQ+ education and rights have brought transgender issues to the attention of the public, as well as the many genders that a person can identify as.\nIn 2014, to keep up with changing views about gender identity, Facebook changed their gender options that users can pick from, to 58 different gender identities. This change was noticed and widely reported at the time.\nGender expression.\nGender expression (also called, \"gender presentation\") means how a person dresses, looks, and acts, in ways that might affect how other people view their gender. Someone who wears men's clothes and acts in a masculine way has a \"male gender expression.\" Someone who wears women's clothes and acts in a feminine way has a \"female gender expression\". This is different from \"gender identity\" because people can choose to look or behave one way even if that is not how they feel inside. Sometimes people call this \"gender presentation\" or just \"presentation\".\nTransgender and transsexual.\n'Transgender' is a term that means that the gender assigned at birth (typically 'AMAB' or 'assigned male at birth' and 'AFAB' or 'assigned female at birth') does not match with the gender a person identifies as. The experiences that transgender people have are vast and may differ from one another, although there are sometimes shared experiences. For instance, a transgender person may feel gender dysphoria (but not everyone will be dysphoric). A transgender person may also feel it necessary to medically transition, or take hormones, or a combination of the two. 'Transsexual' is a term that some transgender people may use after receiving sex-reassignment surgeries and medical transition, but depending on who one is talking to, this term may be considered outdated and the person may instead opt to simply continue using the term 'transgender' as their identification.\nSome people use the word 'transgender' to mean somewhat different things, as the word has expanded and changed since it was first invented in 1965.\nFactors and terminology.\nAll three of these factors contribute to how a person labels their self, and make gender a confusing construct to navigate. People can have gender presentations that don't match their gender identity, or a gender identity that doesn't match the gender they were assigned at birth, etc. A person whose gender identity matches the gender they were assigned at birth is called 'cisgender'. As time has passed, the growing voice of LGBTQ+ issues and rise of educational resources on the topics of gender and sexuality has allowed for many to learn about transgender issues, and help others with their own gender navigation.\nTypes of identity mismatch.\nThere are many people whose gender identity differs from the one they are at birth, but the person hides it due to fear of rejection, laws that do not protect transgender people, being abandoned or cut off by family and friends, and even fear of getting assaulted.\nFor instance, a woman going on a date may have to grapple with the decision of when and or if she should tell her date that she is transgender. There is the chance that her date will not care that she is transgender and they can carry on, and she will be happy knowing that she can safely be herself around this person. However, there's also the chance that her date will react angrily and misgender her after finding out she is transgender, and maybe even assault her. A person who identifies as nonbinary may keep their identity a secret to their family out of fear of being kicked out and left homeless, or sent to conversion therapy.\nMany people go through this fear, so it is very normal to feel scared.\nAnother issue that has come up recently is one that feminists, who believe one can dress however they want, argue over whether someone claiming to be a woman and deciding to wear a dress\nshould be treated as a woman based on this self-identification. This is a matter of dispute within the feminist movement. You can wear whatever you want and still be a woman. A transwoman AMAB who wears a dress makes it so that the feminist movement can not move past this idea that women must wear a dress. Women who see themselves as feminists have strong views on both sides of the issue of whether or not trans women are women,to the point that they deny those who hold the opposite view are real feminists.\nWomen who see feminism as based on fighting against the oppression of biological women based on biological sex often call themselves \"gender critical\" or \"gender abolitionists\" (the latter idea based on the expectation of particular dress or behavior being itself oppression). Those who disagree often label these women \"Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists\", or \"TERFs\".\nMedical diagnosis.\nWhen a person's gender identity and body do not match, they may go to see a doctor. The doctor may help them change their body if that is what they want. A psychiatrist may diagnose this person with Gender identity disorder (gender dysphoria), but medical diagnosis itself is a controversial subject because being transgender has one been considered to be a mental illness, the stigma is still there. Principle 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles, a document about international law on human rights states that \"any classifications to the contrary, a person's gender identity is not in and of itself, medical condition\". And \"Activist's Guide\" to them says that \"gender identity\" or \"gender identity disorder\" exists still in categories of mental illness, contrary to the \"sexual orientation\" removed from such categories.\nBut despite the strides taken to remove the stigma of mental illness in being transgender, gatekeeping by doctors and therapists make most transgender people struggle to achieve their ideal self. In most cases, doctors require therapists to 'diagnose' whether their patient is 'transgender enough' to take hormones or have surgery. And even if you do that diagnosis, a surgeon can refuse to perform surgery on you.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gender_binary","surface_form":"gender binary","offset":92},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"man","offset":150},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":159},{"uri":"Gender_dysphoria","surface_form":"gender dysphoria","offset":1733},{"uri":"Transsexual","surface_form":"Transsexual'","offset":1909},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":5178},{"uri":"Medical_diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnose","offset":5275},{"uri":"Gender_identity_disorder","surface_form":"Gender identity disorder","offset":5301},{"uri":"Yogyakarta_Principles","surface_form":"Yogyakarta Principles","offset":5523},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":5563},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":5584},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":5838}]}
