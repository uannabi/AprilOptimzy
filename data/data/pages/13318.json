{"id":13318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Army","text":"\"America's Army\" is a multiplayer first-person shooter computer game series. It can be played using Windows, Macintosh, or Linux. It is the official game of the United States Army. The first version was free. It came out on July 4, 2002. It has been updated many times since then. The second important release was \"America's Army: Special Forces\" in November 2003. \"America's Army\" was made by the \"MOVES Institute\" at the Naval Postgraduate School. It is based on the Unreal engine.\nOverview.\n\"America's Army\" is a tactical shooter. It is also called a \"serious games\". According to the game's website, America's Army \"provides civilians with an inside perspective and a virtual role in today's premier land force: the U.S. Army. The game is designed for verisimilitude and to provide an accurate portrayal of Soldier experiences across a number of occupations. In the game, players will explore progressive individual and collective training events within the game. Once they successfully completed these events they will advance to multiplayer operations in small units.\"\nOn February 20, 2005 there were 4.6 million registered players, and 2.7 million of them had finished basic training. Also, there were more than 15,000 servers being used, and 1.3 million rounds being played each day. The game has been changed a lot. This keeps people interested in the game. It can be found as a free download on the Internet or on a CD-ROM at recruiting centers around the United States.\nHistory.\nIn 1999, Lieutenant Colonel E. Casey Wardynski, a professor at the U.S Military Academy at West Point decided to tell the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Military Manpower about his idea for an online computer game. His basic idea eventually became America's Army. In the same year, fewer people were joining the army.[http://www.cnn.com/US/9909/30/army.recruitment/#1]. Congress decided to use \"aggressive, innovative experiments\" including America's Army to get more people to join the Army.\nThe first release was July 4, 2002, and other changes (called patches) were added. On November 6, 2003, version 2.0 of \"America's Army: Special Forces\" was made. (Go here for more information about the different version). The Army is spending about USD$3 million a year to make more versions of the game.\nAnother AA version called \"America's Army: Rise of a Soldier\" is available on Playstation 2 and Xbox. This version was developed by UbiSoft. [http://games.teamxbox.com/xbox/873/Americas-Army/]\nSince \"America's Army\" was created, people have complained about its purpose. People have argued about the Army using its money to make a game. They are also worried about how this game will change people's lives.\nGameplay.\nIn \"America's Army\" there are teams of soldiers fighting in a war. The person who is playing controls a soldier of the \"US Army\" from the character's eyes. This is called first person.\nPlayers fight as either the US Army or Indigenous forces (\"IF\"). They fight against a team called \"OPFOR\" (Army lingo for \"Opposing Forces\"). There are different kinds of OPFORs called \"insurgents\", \"enemy forces\" or \"terrorists\".\nUS/OPFOR Transformation for Teams.\nOne of \"America's Armys different features is the way the enemies are. The players are split into two different teams. There is usually an \"assault\" group and a \"defense\" group. The \"assault\" loses the round if the time limit runs out, which is usually ten minutes.\nThe players on each team see themselves as American soldiers with American weapons, such as the \"M16A2\". Their opponents look like non-uniformed people with Eastern bloc weapons, like the \"AK-47\" (the counterpart of the \"M16A2\" in the game). In training maps the only distinguishing features are the players' uniforms. The development team did this to make the game realistic for players on both sides. They allowed everyone to play on the side of the American forces. They also avoided the problem of asking players to kill American soldiers.\nOn the Special Forces maps, players can also play as non-uniformed people with Eastern bloc weapons (known as Indigenous forces (\"IF\") in the game), but be on the same team as regular army forces.\nThis is confusing to many players because when they pick up an enemy weapon, it works differently than the US version. An AK-47 removed from a fallen opponent is fully automatic, more powerful, but less accurate than his M16. But when his opponent had it, to him it \"was\" an M16. The important thing is that each weapon behaves as the owner sees it. It transforms when it is picked up. If people pay a lot of attention might notice that the enemies weapons behave wrong, but it is hard to notice.\nEvery round starts with both teams spawning at the same time. Players can join the other team, but cannot play as the OPFOR. Equipment is not bought but selected through choosing a class.\nGoals and scoring system.\nThe goal of the game is to complete the objectives, kill the enemy team. For example, one objective could be to kill the \"V.I.P.\", who is trying to survive and escape. If a player joined the other team, he would have to protect the same V.I.P. The round is over if a team wins0, or if the time limit is reached. For a listing of missions gohere.\nThe game remembers how many people each player has killed, how many times each team has won, how many times each player has been killed, and how well the player is completing the objectives. The game then distributes score which calculates the player's \"Honor\" level.\nEvery time a player is killed, every time he fails to protect an objective which he is assigned to defend, and especially every killing of teammates or his allies caused by friendly fire is called a violation of the \"ROE\" (Rules of engagement) in the game and has an extremely negative effect on his score and \"Honor\". If too many points are lost in a round, the player is put in \"jail\" and kicked out of the server. As of February 2005 95.2% of AA players had 0-20 HONOR points, 3.3% had 20-40 points, 1% had 40-60, and.4% had 61-80 points.\nEvery healing of injured teammates and every killing of opponents increases a players score and \"Honor\". Completing the game's missions affects a player's score in a good way and his \"Honor\" points as well. The score is saved in the player's account that was being used. Some servers only allow players with certain Honor levels to join. The most common is to not let anyone with less than 10 Honor in because this is the base level that everyone starts with. Some also do not let players with too much Honor in. The developers say that \"Honor\" is based on the values of the Army: \"Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity and Personal Courage or Leadership\". Its main purpose in the game is stop \"team-killing\", which is a problem in a lot of online first-person shooters (see team killer).\nWeaponry and equipment.\nThe game depicts real guns. The guns have all the same traits as the real versions. Each gun has different accuracy, power, recoil, and rate of jamming. To aim, there are cross-hairs and iron sights.\nPlayers may select a \"class\" like \"squad leader\", \"rifleman\", \"automatic rifleman\", \"grenadier\", or \"sniper\"; these classes decide what weapon the player will have at the beginning of each round. Some players from each team may be \"medics\". Medics can help their teammates get better after they get shot. Being a medic is an extra ability which is added to the class. The Honor points are used to decide which players gets which class. Players with more Honor usually get to pick their class first.\nEach gun also can jam in action. When a gun jams it means that it stops working because a part is stuck. The player then needs to press a button to fix the gun. This can be a problem because it makes it so that the player cannot shoot for a few seconds. AA was the first game ever to have player's guns jam.\nEvery firearm in the game has either iron sights or a telescopic sight (for sniper rifles); while using the sights, a zoom effect enlarges objects in view. The iron sights enlarge to a small degree, the telescopic sights to large one. Until he stops zooming, the player's moving speed is additionally decreased.\nIn the first few versions, weapons could only hurt players and glass. For example, a grenade could not destroy a television but a gun could put a bullet hole in the screen. Compared to most games, the grenades and are more deadly. They tried to make the blast radius of grenades more like real life than it usually is in other games. Getting hurt by weapons always leads to some bleeding, which causes a player's health gauge to go down over time. Injuries make players slower, they also make it harder for the player to shoot where they are aiming. Sometimes, if the player does not get help from a medic, they will die.\nIn the newer versions of the game players can make changes to their weapons. For example, the M4 Carbine can be change in different ways and let the soldier have features that work better on a certain map. For example, on a large map a scope and a bi-pod might be picked, but in a city a player might choose only iron sights and a M203 grenade launcher.\nMissions and maps.\nThe map list is sorted by the version they were released with, with newer maps coming first. The game currently has 28 multiplayer maps and 14 single player training missions. Completing these training missions unlocks things like the ability to play online or to become a medic, a special forces unit or a sniper. Maps have different sizes, objectives, and weapons that players can have.\nHowever, no known custom maps have been made because there is no level editor for the game and the developers made it impossible for players to use the level design computer program \"UnrealEd\", which works for other Unreal engine games.\nVersions.\nVersion 2.7 came out June 2006\nVersion 2.6 is available for
