{"id":133312,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarok_(software)","text":"Amarok is a music player for the KDE desktop environment. Unlike most KDE programs, it has its own schedule for releasing versions, so a new version of Amarok might not be released when a new version of KDE comes out. Amarok's first stable version was released in 2003. They are now on version 2.4.3.\nFeatures.\nAmarok cannot play videos. However, it can play most sound and music files in a large range of formats, like MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and WMA. Amarok also includes an internet radio tuner, and supports submitting a listener's music preferences to Last.fm. It can sync music to most MP3 players, like the iPod or ZEN.\nVersions.\nAmarok was updated to version 2 along with the major upgrade of KDE3 to KDE4. The newer KDE4 version of Amarok is still missing some features when compared with the previous KDE3 version, but it does have some new features not included with the earlier one.\nMany users of KDE3 Amarok believed it was the best software music player of any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux), and it had a great and loyal following. This loyalty has faded somewhat since the KDE4 release, though Amarok developers are still working hard to make certain the newer Amarok meets and exceeds all users' expectations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"KDE","surface_form":"KDE","offset":33},{"uri":"MP3","surface_form":"MP3","offset":420},{"uri":"Ogg_Vorbis","surface_form":"Ogg Vorbis","offset":425},{"uri":"WMA","surface_form":"WMA","offset":441},{"uri":"Internet_radio","surface_form":"internet radio","offset":470},{"uri":"Last.fm","surface_form":"Last.fm","offset":550},{"uri":"MP3_players","surface_form":"MP3 players","offset":585},{"uri":"IPod","surface_form":"iPod","offset":607},{"uri":"Creative_ZEN","surface_form":"ZEN","offset":615}]}
