{"id":133317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi","text":"Ignoratio elenchi (also known as irrelevant conclusion or irrelevant thesis) is the informal fallacy of presenting an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question. \"Ignoratio elenchi\" can be roughly translated by \"ignorance of refutation\", that is, ignorance of what a refutation is; \"elenchi\" is from the Greek Socratic method, meaning an argument of disproof or refutation. (Some sources give \"by ignorance of the issues\" or even \"by ignoring the issues\" as a translation of ignoratio elenchi.)\nAristotle believed that an ignoratio elenchi is a mistake made by a questioner while attempting to falsify a respondent's argument. He called it an ignorance of what makes for a refutation. For Aristotle, ignoratio elenchi amounts to \"ignorance of logic\". In fact, Aristotle goes so far as to say that all logical fallacies can be reduced to what he calls ignoratio elenchi.\nModern use limits this term much more narrowly to the kind of mistake described in the first paragraph above.\nRed herring.\nSimilar to ignoratio elenchi, a \"red herring\" is an argument, given in reply, that does not address the original issue. Critically, a red herring is a \"deliberate\" attempt to change the subject or divert the argument. This is known formally in the English vocabulary as digression which is a neutrally connotated \"Red herring\". The actual problem is eclipsed by the process of re-focusing on something else.\nExamples.\nMaher: It's arbitrary, isn't it? If you had been born in Pakistan, you wouldn't be believing in Jesus Christ. You would have been told another fairy tale and you would have been believing that.\nScarborough: Well, Bill, that's your opinion.\n\"Whether Maher's argument is his opinion or not is irrelevant and does not address the argument made.\"\n\"The conclusion is ignoratio elenchi, since friendliness and charity are not the main qualifications for induction into the Hall of Fame.\"\n\"The existence of worse criminals is a secondary issue which has no bearing on whether the driver deserves a fine for recklessness. If the speaker were deliberately attempting to divert the issue, this would be an example of a red herring. While the argument about how the police should spend their time may have merit, the question of whom the police should prioritize pursuing and the question of what should be done with those the police have caught are separate questions.\"\n\"A red herring, the unrelated alleged affair, attempts to change the subject away from the popular policies. However, if the original discussion were of the prime minister's public integrity (encompassing both popularity and conduct), this argument could be perfectly valid. Such as if a politician's election campaign revolved around family values. Then an argument about such an affair would be valid, as it is in direct conflict with a family values platform.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Informal_fallacy","surface_form":"informal fallacy","offset":84},{"uri":"Valid","surface_form":"valid","offset":149},{"uri":"Socratic_method","surface_form":"Socratic method","offset":348},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":533},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":781},{"uri":"Digression","surface_form":"digression","offset":1301},{"uri":"Eclipse","surface_form":"eclipsed","offset":1381}]}
