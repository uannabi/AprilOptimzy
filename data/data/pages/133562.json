{"id":133562,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill","text":"Gerard Kitchen \u201CGerry\u201D O\u2019Neill (February 6, 1927\u2013April 27, 1992) was an American scientist. He taught physics at Princeton University. He invented a machine for holding subatomic particles. He also invented the mass driver, a machine used to things into outer space. He wrote about building cities in space.\nHis space station design is known as the \"O\u2019Neill cylinder\". He started the Space Studies Institute (SSI). SSI is a group focused on learning about space manufacturing and colonization.\nIn 1954 O'Neill finished school at Cornell University. Then he began his work on particle physics at Princeton.\nTwo years later he wrote about a device to hold very fast moving subatomic particles. In 1965 he used his device to shoot two beams of particles at each other for the first time. This experiment was done at Stanford University. Scientists used the experiment to discover the size of the electron.\nWhile he was teaching, O\u2019Neill became excited about humans living in outer space. He wrote about the O\u2019Neill cylinder in \u201CThe Colonization of Space\u201D. This was his first paper about people living in space. He met with other scientists at Princeton in 1975. There he talked with them about manufacturing in outer space. O\u2019Neill built his first mass driver with help from scientist Henry Kolm in 1976. Mass drivers were part of his plan to mine the Moon and asteroids. His book \"The High Frontier\" won an award and got people excited about outer space. He died in 1992 after a seven year fight against leukemia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":72},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":81},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":102},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton University","offset":113},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":149},{"uri":"Subatomic_particles","surface_form":"subatomic particles","offset":169},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":254},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":291},{"uri":"Space_station","surface_form":"space station","offset":312},{"uri":"O%27Neill_cylinder","surface_form":"O\u2019Neill cylinder","offset":350},{"uri":"Space_Studies_Institute","surface_form":"Space Studies Institute","offset":384},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":462},{"uri":"Colonization","surface_form":"colonization","offset":480},{"uri":"Cornell_University","surface_form":"Cornell University","offset":529},{"uri":"Particle_physics","surface_form":"particle physics","offset":575},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":639},{"uri":"Subatomic_particles","surface_form":"subatomic particles","offset":671},{"uri":"Shoot","surface_form":"shoot","offset":722},{"uri":"Beam","surface_form":"beam","offset":732},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":790},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":813},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":893},{"uri":"Henry_Kolm","surface_form":"Henry Kolm","offset":1282},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":1349},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":1358},{"uri":"Human_Colonies_in_Space","surface_form":"The High Frontier","offset":1379},{"uri":"Leukemia","surface_form":"leukemia","offset":1502}]}
