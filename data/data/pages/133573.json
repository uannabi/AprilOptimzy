{"id":133573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Rosary is a Catholic form of prayer using beads. It is a cycle of repeated formal prayers, such as the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary, done while thinking about important events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. This is called \"saying the Rosary\" or \"praying the Rosary.\" A rosary can also be the series of joined beads that a person holds while saying these prayers.\nThe Church has always recognized the efficacy of this devotion John Paul II said \u201CThrough the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as by the hands of the Mother of the Redeemer.\nPrayer is for every person to obtain graces and consolations for oneself or for others, for the diffusion of good actions in the world, for the solution of international conflicts, for conversion and spiritual growth.. Prayer, in the room of your home or into the church, at any time of the day, is a moment of peace and serenity that distracts from the worries of the day and it is a moment of communication with Divine Mercy through the most beautiful prayers. The graces result from the experience not only of saints and religious but also of ordinary people who have left public witness of the graces received requested to the Virgin Mary.\nA person who says a Rosary usually thinks about certain events from the Bible. Each day has a traditional list of these events, called \"Mysteries of the Rosary.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":29},{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":46},{"uri":"Bead","surface_form":"bead","offset":59},{"uri":"Lord%27s_Prayer","surface_form":"Lord's Prayer","offset":120},{"uri":"Hail_Mary","surface_form":"Hail Mary","offset":142},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":212},{"uri":"Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","surface_form":"Mary","offset":222},{"uri":"John_Paul_II","surface_form":"John Paul II","offset":447},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":1285}]}
