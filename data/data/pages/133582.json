{"id":133582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_language","text":"Kazakh is a Turkic language that is spoken in Kazakhstan, a country in central Asia. It, along with Russian, is one of Kazakhstan's official languages.\nHistory.\nThe Kazakh language had been written in the Cyrillic alphabet since the Russian Empire started to occupy that country in the 19th century. In 1917, people began to use the Arabic alphabet, but the Russians were not able to make them use Cyrillic.\nAfter World War I, the Turkic countries started to use the Latin alphabet, led by Kemal Atat\u00FCrk of Turkey. Because of this, from 1927 to 1939, Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union, changed from the Arabic to the Latin alphabet. But Stalin made a law in 1940 that all the countries that were part of the Soviet Union had to use Cyrillic, in order to bring Kazakhstan and the rest of the countries in Central Asia in line with the Russian style.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly-independent Republic of Kazakhstan allowed the old Latin alphabet to be used, but continued to use Cyrillic as the main alphabet. In 2006, president Nursultan Nazarbayev started a project to introduce a standard form of the Latin alphabet as the official script of his country. A version of the new Latin alphabet, which used apostrophes for certain sounds, was created in April 2017, but was replaced with another one in February 2018 which instead uses diacritics on certain letters. If all goes as planned, the Cyrillic alphabet will be fully replaced with Latin by 2025.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkic_language","surface_form":"Turkic language","offset":12},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":46},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":79},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":100},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":132},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":205},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":233},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic alphabet","offset":333},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":414},{"uri":"Turkic","surface_form":"Turkic","offset":431},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":467},{"uri":"Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk","surface_form":"Kemal Atat\u00FCrk","offset":490},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":507},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":580},{"uri":"Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":645},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":812},{"uri":"Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Russian","offset":842},{"uri":"Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"dissolution of the Soviet Union","offset":871},{"uri":"Nursultan_Nazarbayev","surface_form":"Nursultan Nazarbayev","offset":1071},{"uri":"Apostrophe","surface_form":"apostrophe","offset":1248},{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"diacritic","offset":1377}]}
