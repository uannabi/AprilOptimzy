{"id":133604,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_County_F.C.","text":"Ross County F.C. are a Scottish professional football team who currently play in the Scottish Football League. They play their home matches at Victoria Park in the Highland town of Dingwall, Ross and Cromarty.\nTheir manager, up until October 2005, was former Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Heart of Midlothian manager John Robertson. He left the club on the 24 October 2005, due to differences of opinion on a number of fundamental issues with the chairman. Gardner Spiers, a former Aberdeen coach, was appointed caretaker manager, but he too left in April 2006 after being told he would not be considered for appointment on a permanent basis. Director of Football George Adams took temporary charge before former Motherwell player Scott Leitch was appointed on 18 April 2006. Leitch, after winning the Challenge Cup but suffering relegation, stood down at the end of the 2006-2007 season, almost exactly one year after his appointment. Former Partick Thistle manager Dick Campbell was announced as his replacement in May 2007. However, after a good run of results to start their Division 2 campaign, Campbell and the Ross County board decided to part company on 2 October 2007. Derek Adams (son of George Adams) took over as caretaker, and was confirmed as permanent manager a month later, after the side's good form continued.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":23},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":45},{"uri":"Scottish_Football_League","surface_form":"Scottish Football League","offset":85},{"uri":"Victoria_Park%2C_Dingwall","surface_form":"Victoria Park","offset":143},{"uri":"Highland_(council_area)","surface_form":"Highland","offset":164},{"uri":"Dingwall","surface_form":"Dingwall","offset":181},{"uri":"Ross_and_Cromarty","surface_form":"Ross and Cromarty","offset":191},{"uri":"Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle_F.C.","surface_form":"Inverness Caledonian Thistle","offset":259},{"uri":"Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.","surface_form":"Heart of Midlothian","offset":292},{"uri":"John_Grant_Robertson","surface_form":"John Robertson","offset":320},{"uri":"24_October","surface_form":"24 October","offset":360},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":371},{"uri":"Gardner_Spiers","surface_form":"Gardner Spiers","offset":460},{"uri":"Aberdeen_F.C.","surface_form":"Aberdeen","offset":485},{"uri":"Caretaker_manager","surface_form":"caretaker manager","offset":515},{"uri":"George_Adams_(football_player)","surface_form":"George Adams","offset":667},{"uri":"Motherwell_F.C.","surface_form":"Motherwell","offset":716},{"uri":"Scott_Leitch","surface_form":"Scott Leitch","offset":734},{"uri":"18_April","surface_form":"18 April","offset":764},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":773},{"uri":"Partick_Thistle","surface_form":"Partick Thistle","offset":946},{"uri":"Dick_Campbell","surface_form":"Dick Campbell","offset":970},{"uri":"2_October","surface_form":"2 October","offset":1165},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":1175}]}
