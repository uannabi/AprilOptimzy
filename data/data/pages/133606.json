{"id":133606,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irn-Bru","text":"Irn-Bru is a carbonated drink made by Barrs in Scotland, United Kingdom. It was invented in Glasgow in 1901. It is a bright orange colour, and is nicknamed \"Scotland's other national drink\" \u2013 a reference to whisky.\nRecipe.\nThe recipe remains a secret today, with competing drinks trying to make their own copy of Irn-Bru, with little success.\nOne notable advertising slogan was \"Made in Scotland from Girders\". Although not made from girders, Irn-Bru does actually contain iron: it has an ammonium ferric citrate content of 0.002%.\nIn 1999, Irn Bru was included in the book \"Oxford Companion to Food\" along with caviar, quail and smoked salmon as one of the world's great foods. The drink's inclusion was because it is \"important for its symbolic value as well as its refreshing qualities\".\nSponsorship.\nIrn-Bru is a sponsor of the Scottish Football League. It currently sponsors the Scottish First Division, Scottish Second Division and the Scottish Third Division.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carbonation","surface_form":"carbonated","offset":13},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":24},{"uri":"Barrs","surface_form":"Barrs","offset":38},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":47},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":57},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":92},{"uri":"Whisky","surface_form":"whisky","offset":207},{"uri":"Girder","surface_form":"girders","offset":434},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":473},{"uri":"Ammonium_ferric_citrate","surface_form":"ammonium ferric citrate","offset":489},{"uri":"Caviar","surface_form":"caviar","offset":612},{"uri":"Quail","surface_form":"quail","offset":620},{"uri":"Salmon","surface_form":"smoked salmon","offset":630},{"uri":"Scottish_Football_League","surface_form":"Scottish Football League","offset":832},{"uri":"Scottish_First_Division","surface_form":"Scottish First Division","offset":884},{"uri":"Scottish_Second_Division","surface_form":"Scottish Second Division","offset":909},{"uri":"Scottish_Third_Division","surface_form":"Scottish Third Division","offset":942}]}
