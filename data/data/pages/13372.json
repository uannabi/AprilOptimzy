{"id":13372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate","text":"The prostate is a gland of the male body that adds part of the fluid to semen. A healthy human prostate is slightly larger than a walnut. It surrounds the urethra just below the urinary bladder.\nProstate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting elderly men in developed (also known as first world) countries and a major cause of death. Regular rectal exams are recommended for older men to detect prostate cancer early.\nThe prostate is often referred to as the male G-spot, which is a spot inside the female vagina that causes intense pleasure when it is stimulated. The prostate can be massaged by using a finger or during anal sex. Some males are able to orgasm with prostate stimulation alone.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":18},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":31},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":36},{"uri":"Semen","surface_form":"semen","offset":72},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":89},{"uri":"Urethra","surface_form":"urethra","offset":155},{"uri":"Urinary_bladder","surface_form":"urinary bladder","offset":178},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":204},{"uri":"First_world","surface_form":"first world","offset":295},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":339},{"uri":"G-spot","surface_form":"G-spot","offset":476},{"uri":"Orgasm","surface_form":"orgasm","offset":667}]}
