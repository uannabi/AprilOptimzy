It is used in exercise or stress relief to improve one of three areas: physical strength, aerobic fitness or punching technique.\nHistory.\nPunching bags have been used in martial arts for as long as there has been a written history of military training. Similar apparatus in Asian martial arts include the Okinawan \"makiwara\" and the Chinese \"mook jong\", which may have padded striking surfaces attached to them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punch_(strike)","surface_form":"punched","offset":54},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":83},{"uri":"Chronic_stress","surface_form":"stress","offset":95},{"uri":"Strength_training","surface_form":"physical strength","offset":140},{"uri":"Aerobics","surface_form":"aerobic fitness","offset":159},{"uri":"Martial_arts","surface_form":"martial arts","offset":239}]}
