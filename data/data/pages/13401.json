{"id":13401,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_chess","text":"Xiangqi is a form of chess that started in China. In English it is called Chinese chess.\nThough derived from the original Indian Chaturanga, Chinese chess is quite different from modern international chess. The board is different, there are different pieces, and they have different moves. The \"general\" and his \"mandarin\" may not leave the nine-pointed fortress; they have only limited movement. Clearly, this is more similar to the old Indo-Arabic game than to modern chess.\nXiangqi is a chess game for two people to play. Each player has 16 pieces to move on the board. One player's set is red, and one is black. The way to win is to kill the other player's Jiang (Shuai). Each kind of piece has different ways to move. Xiangqi is one of the most popular chess games in China.p78","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":21},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":43},{"uri":"Chaturanga","surface_form":"Chaturanga","offset":129},{"uri":"Two","surface_form":"two","offset":505},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":593},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":609},{"uri":"Popular","surface_form":"popular","offset":750},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":773}]}
