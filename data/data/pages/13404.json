{"id":13404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","text":"The United States Democratic Party is one of the two biggest political parties in the United States of America. The other is the Republican Party. The U.S. also has several smaller political parties known as third parties. Supporters of this party are known as Democrats.\nEvery four years the party holds a National Convention where they agree on their candidate for President. The Democratic National Committee coordinates most of the activities of the Democratic Party in all 50 United States. There have been 14 Democratic presidents, the most recent being Barack Obama, who was President from 2009 to 2017. In 2020, Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden was elected president.\nThe Democratic Party represents a broad spectrum of leftist ideologies, including classic liberalism, social democracy, progressivism, and socialism.\nPhilosophy and role in government.\nDemocrats, also sometimes called 'the left', 'liberals' or 'progressives' make up one of the two main political parties in the United States. A mostly Democratic state is sometimes called a 'blue state'. This comes from the party\u2019s main color, which is blue, referring to a state supporting \u2018blue\u2019 candidates.\nDemocrats believe in a strong government with social assistance programs to help members of society. They prefer diplomatic solutions to conflicts, and take a generally protectionist view on trade, believing that trade must be regulated to protect American workers.\nSocially, most Democrats believe in social liberalism, taking pro-immigration, pro-gay marriage, and pro-choice views.\nCurrent Democratic beliefs.\nCurrently, the Democratic Party is identified by progressivism, liberalism, and left-wing policies.\nMost support for Democrats comes from states in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and the Pacific Coast, as well as from the state of Hawaii.\nSymbols.\nThe symbol of the Democratic Party is the Donkey. Since the election of 2000, the color blue has become a symbol for Democrats.\nHistorically, Thomas Jefferson, whom the party claims as it founder, has been often seen as symbols of the Democratic Party, particularly emphasized in the annual celebrations of Jefferson Day Dinners held since the days of Andrew Jackson. As such, the Democratic Party is also often referred to as the \u201CParty of Jefferson.\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political parties","offset":61},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":86},{"uri":"United_States_Republican_Party","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":129},{"uri":"Democratic_National_Committee","surface_form":"Democratic National Committee","offset":382},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":560},{"uri":"Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Joe Biden","offset":653},{"uri":"Progressivism","surface_form":"progressivism","offset":1643},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberalism","offset":1658},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":1674},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":1824},{"uri":"Donkey","surface_form":"Donkey","offset":1883},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":1929}]}
