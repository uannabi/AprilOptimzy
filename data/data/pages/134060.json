{"id":134060,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy","text":"=\"preserve\">A country's foreign policy (also called the international relations policy) is a set of goals about how the country will work with other countries economically, politically, socially and militarily. It includes such matters as international trade, foreign aid, military alliances, and war.\nForeign policy also involves dealing with groups that are not countries but that are still important. These are called \"non-state actors\", and might include religious groups, large companies, or even terrorist groups. The study of foreign relations is known as foreign policy analysis (FPA) and the work is called diplomacy. Most counties have a foreign minister who directs these things, with help from other officials.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"State","surface_form":"country","offset":14},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":120},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economically","offset":159},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politically","offset":173},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"militarily","offset":199},{"uri":"International_trade","surface_form":"international trade","offset":239},{"uri":"Foreign_aid","surface_form":"foreign aid","offset":260},{"uri":"Alliance","surface_form":"alliance","offset":282},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":297},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":459},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":502},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomacy","offset":616},{"uri":"Foreign_minister","surface_form":"foreign minister","offset":648}]}
