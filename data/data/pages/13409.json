{"id":13409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics","text":"Classical mechanics is the part of physics that describes how everyday things move and how their motion changes because of forces. If we know how things are moving now, classical mechanics allows us to predict how they will move in the future and how they were moving in the past. We can use classical mechanics to predict how things like planets and rockets move.\nThere are two parts of mechanics. The two parts are classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Classical mechanics is used most of the time for most of the things we can see, and that are not moving too fast. When the things are too small, classical mechanics is not good. Then we need to use quantum mechanics.\nNewton's Three Laws.\nNewton's three laws of motion are important to classical mechanics. Isaac Newton discovered them. Newton's laws tell us how forces change how things move, but they do not say what causes the forces.\nThe \"first law\" says that if there is no external force (a push or pull), things that are not moving will stay not-moving, and things that are moving will keep moving in the same way. Before, people thought that things would slow down and stop moving even if there was no force making them stop. Newton said this was wrong. Often, people say, \"Objects that are not moving tend to stay not-moving, and objects that are moving tend to stay moving, unless acted upon by an outside force, such as gravity, friction, etc...\"\nThe \"second law\" says how much a force changes how a thing moves. When there is a net outside force on an object, its velocity (speed and direction of motion) will change. How fast the velocity changes is called the acceleration. Newton's second law says that bigger forces produce more acceleration. But objects with a lot of stuff in them (mass) are harder to push, so they do not accelerate as much. Another way of saying this is that the net force on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum. The momentum measures how much mass is in a thing, how fast it is going, and which direction it is going. So forces change the momentum, but how much they can change the speed and direction of motion still depends on mass.\nThe \"third law\" says that if one thing puts a force on another thing, the second thing also puts a force on the first thing. The second force is equal in size to the first force. The forces act in opposite directions. For example, if you jump forward off a boat, the boat moves backward. For you to jump forward, the boat had to push you forward. Newton's third law says that for the boat to push you forward, you had to push the boat backward. Often, people say, \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\nKinematic Equations.\nIn physics, kinematics is the part of classical mechanics that explains the movement of objects without looking at what causes the movement or what the movement affects.\n1-Dimensional Kinematics.\n1-Dimensional (1D) Kinematics are used only when an object moves in one direction: either side to side (left to right) or up and down. There are equations with can be used to solve problems that have movement in only 1 dimension or direction. These equations come from the definitions of velocity, acceleration and distance.\n2-Dimensional Kinematics.\n2-Dimensional kinematics is used when motion happens in both the x-direction (left to right) and the y-direction (up and down). There are also equations for this type of kinematics. However, there are different equations for the x-direction and different equations for the y-direction. Galileo proved that the velocity in the x-direction does not change through the whole run. However, the y-direction is affected by the force of gravity, so the y-velocity does change during the run.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":35},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"forces","offset":123},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planets","offset":339},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"rockets","offset":351},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":658},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":766},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":947},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":2696},{"uri":"Kinematics","surface_form":"kinematics","offset":2705},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":2961},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":3034},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"solve","offset":3064},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":3070},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"movement","offset":3089},{"uri":"Dimension","surface_form":"dimension","offset":3108},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":3162},{"uri":"Velocity","surface_form":"velocity","offset":3177},{"uri":"Acceleration","surface_form":"acceleration","offset":3187},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":3204},{"uri":"Galileo","surface_form":"Galileo","offset":3526},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":3670}]}
