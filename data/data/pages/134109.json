{"id":134109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature","text":"e=\"preserve\">Human nature refers to the characteristics of mankind. This means ways of thinking, feeling and acting which humans have naturally.\nWhat these characteristics are, what causes them and how fixed human nature is, are good questions. They among the oldest and most important questions in western philosophy. These questions affect ethics, politics and theology. Human nature is a source of advice on how to live well, but it also puts limits and obstacles on living a good life.\nThe complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature, while the humanities inquire into human nature, and what it means to be human.\nAristotle.\nAristotle, Plato's most famous student, made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature.\nFor Aristotle, reason is what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, and is what we achieve at our best.\nMuch of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today, but the particular teleological idea that humans are \"meant\" or intended to be something, has become much less popular in modern times.\nBiological theories.\nHumans are mammals, and have developed by a process of evolution. It follows that what is called human nature is inherited, and had been the product of natural selection. We are not blank slates; our mental life and behaviour has ancient roots. This is the question of nature vs nurture, and the subject-matter of evolutionary psychology. Ethology and sociobiology has also looked at these issues from the perspective of human evolution and heredity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_race","surface_form":"mankind","offset":59},{"uri":"Thought","surface_form":"thinking","offset":87},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"feeling","offset":97},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"acting","offset":109},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":122},{"uri":"Natural","surface_form":"natural","offset":134},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":307},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":342},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":350},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":363},{"uri":"Obstacle","surface_form":"obstacles","offset":457},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":556},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":564},{"uri":"Humanities","surface_form":"humanities","offset":586},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":666},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":677},{"uri":"Reason","surface_form":"reason","offset":797},{"uri":"Teleology","surface_form":"teleological","offset":1001},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":1150},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1194},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":1291},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":1355},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":1369},{"uri":"Nature_vs_nurture","surface_form":"nature vs nurture","offset":1408},{"uri":"Evolutionary_psychology","surface_form":"evolutionary psychology","offset":1453},{"uri":"Ethology","surface_form":"Ethology","offset":1478},{"uri":"Sociobiology","surface_form":"sociobiology","offset":1491},{"uri":"Human_evolution","surface_form":"human evolution","offset":1560},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"heredity","offset":1580}]}
