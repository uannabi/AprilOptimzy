They took their name from a character called \"Atreyu\" in a book called \"The Neverending Story\".Sound Tracks\n'Atreyu' is an American metal core band with melodic death metal and hardcore influences from Orange County, California. Contrary to popular belief, the band did not intentionally name itself after Atreyu, a character from Michael Ende's novel, The Never-ending Story. Rather, the name was suggested to them by a friend of the band.\nMembers.\nAtreyu was formed as a band sometime during 1998 and 1999. Shortly thereafter, they released their first EP, entitled Visions. The record garnered the band some success in the Southern California metal core scene and they constantly performed to support the seven-track release.\nAtreyu released its second record, a five-track EP, entitled Fractures in the Facade of Your Porcelain Beauty, in 2001. The record featured early versions of the songs \"Living Each Day Like You're Already Dead\", \"Someone's Standing on My Chest\", and \"Tulips Are Better\", which were re-worked for the band's third release. The record also caught the attention of record executives at Victory Records, who quickly signed the band and added it to its roster.\nAtreyu recorded and released its first full-length album in 2002. Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses would become an instant fan favorite and was noticed by a wide variety of music fans. The record broke down the walls separating the genres of heavy metal and hardcore, allowing the band to push itself into the forefront of the metal core scene. Critics from publications such as the L.A. Times, Guitar World, and Metal Maniacs commented that the \"Southern California five-piece brings new definition to overnight success.\" Since then, the album has sold over 100,000 copies and has produced two popular singles, \"Ain\u2019t Love Grand\" and \"Lip Gloss and Black.\" Their newest album, \"Congregation of the Damned\", was released October 2009 and delighted many of their original fans. Their songs changed by their music slowly getting heavier and darker.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":14},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":23},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":35},{"uri":"Roadrunner_Records","surface_form":"Roadrunner Records","offset":60},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":139}]}
