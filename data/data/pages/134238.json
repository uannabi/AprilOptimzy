{"id":134238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukulele","text":"The ukulele (from the Hawaiian \u02BBukulele, pronounced) is a musical instrument with four strings. It is also called the \"uke\" for short. Ukuleles are part of the guitar family of instruments. The strings are usually tuned G, C, E, A' or A, D, F#, B. Ukuleles normally have nylon strings or gut strings.\nUkuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor and baritone. Sopranino and bass ukuleles also exist. Sopraninos are tuned to standard tuning, however, baritone ukuleles are tuned to D, G, B, E (the top four strings of a guitar). Bass ukuleles are tuned E, A, D, G (bass guitar and double bass tuning).\nThe ukulele was invented in the 19th Century in Hawaii, where people got the idea from small guitar-like instruments known as cavaquinhos brought to the island by Portuguese sailors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":58},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":160},{"uri":"Nylon","surface_form":"nylon","offset":271},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":536},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":581},{"uri":"Double_bass","surface_form":"double bass","offset":597},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":666},{"uri":"Cavaquinho","surface_form":"cavaquinho","offset":744},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":781}]}
