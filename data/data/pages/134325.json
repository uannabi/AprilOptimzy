{"id":134325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murten","text":"Murten (French: \"Morat\") is a city in the canton of Fribourg in Switzerland. It is a historic city on the south side of Lake Morat. The name of the city first appears in 515 as \"Muratum\". The name is probably related to Celtic \"Moridunum\". This is made from \"Mori\" (lake), and \"dunum\" (castle, fortification). The city used to be part of the duchy of Burgundy. It got city rights in 1337.\nToday, about 6,000 people live there. Almost all of the old parts of the city still exist. In 2000, about 77% of the people spoke German, 13% spoke French, and about 2% spoke Italian. About 19% of the people living there are foreigners.\nOn 1 January 1975 the former municipality of Burg bei Murten merged into the municipality of Murten. It was created on 1 January 1991 by the former municipality of Altavilla and on 1 January 2013 by the former municipality of B\u00FCchslen. On 1 January 2016 the former municipalities of Courlevon, Jeuss, Lurtigen and Salvenach merged into Murten.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":8},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":30},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":42},{"uri":"Fribourg_(canton)","surface_form":"Fribourg","offset":52},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":64},{"uri":"Lake_Morat","surface_form":"Lake Morat","offset":120},{"uri":"Celtic_languages","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":220},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":286},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":294},{"uri":"Duchy","surface_form":"duchy","offset":342},{"uri":"Burgundy","surface_form":"Burgundy","offset":351},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":519},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":537},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":564},{"uri":"Foreigner","surface_form":"foreigner","offset":614},{"uri":"Burg_bei_Murten","surface_form":"Burg bei Murten","offset":671},{"uri":"Altavilla","surface_form":"Altavilla","offset":790},{"uri":"B%C3%BCchslen","surface_form":"B\u00FCchslen","offset":852},{"uri":"Courlevon","surface_form":"Courlevon","offset":909},{"uri":"Jeuss","surface_form":"Jeuss","offset":920},{"uri":"Lurtigen","surface_form":"Lurtigen","offset":927},{"uri":"Salvenach","surface_form":"Salvenach","offset":940}]}
