{"id":13434,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease","text":"e=\"preserve\">Heart disease is a general term that means that the heart is not working normally. Babies can be born with heart disease. This is called \"congenital heart disease\". If people get heart disease later, it is called \"acquired heart disease\". Most heart disease is acquired.\nDeaths.\nHeart disease is the biggest killer of both men and women in the United States, England, Wales, and Canada. For example, heart disease causes 4 out of every 10 deaths in the United States. This is more than all kinds of cancer put together. Also, one person dies of heart disease about every minute in the United States alone.\nCongenital heart disease.\nCongenital heart disease refers to a form of heart problem that starts before birth (congenital). Congenital heart disease includes a large number of conditions. The formation of the heart before birth is very complex and is sometimes abnormal. For example, if a part of the main artery that comes from the heart is narrowed, that is called coarctation of the aorta. There may be holes inside the heart which keep the blood from flowing normally inside the heart. Other congenital heart problems are caused by abnormal heart valves. In some cases, congenital heart problems are discovered at birth. Other times the problems may not be detected until the person is an adult","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":65},{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"Babies","offset":96},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":126},{"uri":"Congenital_defect","surface_form":"congenital","offset":151},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":357},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":372},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":381},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":392},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":512},{"uri":"Aorta","surface_form":"aorta","offset":1005}]}
