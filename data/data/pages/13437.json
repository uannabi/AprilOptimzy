{"id":13437,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota","text":"North Dakota is a state in the United States. 672,591 people lived in North Dakota in the year 2010. The capital and seat of government is Bismarck.\nGeography.\nNorth Dakota is south of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, east of Montana, north of South Dakota, and west of Minnesota. Manitoba and Saskatchewan are provinces - part of Canada. Montana, South Dakota, and Minnesota are other states in the United States.\nWeather.\nNorth Dakota is not close to any big bodies of water (oceans or seas). Because of this, temperatures in North Dakota are \"very\" hot in the summer and \"very\" cold in the winter. In the summer, there are sometimes \"strong\" thunderstorms. These storms can have tornadoes and hail.\nHistory.\nBefore European people came, Native American people lived in the area now called North Dakota. One important tribe was the Mandan.\nNorth Dakota was one of the last US states to be \"settled\". (To have people go there to make homes and live.) On November 2, 1889, North Dakota (and South Dakota) became part of the United States.\nEconomy.\nMost of the economy is based on agriculture. The most important agricultural crops are durum, a type of wheat, which is grown all across the state. In the Red River Valley, there is more rain, and maize (corn) and sugar beets are grown as well. In the Badlands, there is less rain, and more cattle are raised than crops.\nNorth Dakota has the only bank in the United States that is \"owned\" by the state. The Bank of North Dakota is where all of the money from all government agencies is held. Most banks in the United States are guaranteed by the FDIC (acronym for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.) The FDIC guarantees that people will not lose money if a bank fails. But the Bank of North Dakota is insured by the \"state\" of North Dakota.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. state symbols"],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":18},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":31},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":105},{"uri":"Bismarck%2C_North_Dakota","surface_form":"Bismarck","offset":139},{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":185},{"uri":"Saskatchewan","surface_form":"Saskatchewan","offset":198},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":220},{"uri":"South_Dakota","surface_form":"South Dakota","offset":238},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":264},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":325},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":472},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":482},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":506},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":639},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":660},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":676},{"uri":"Hail","surface_form":"hail","offset":690},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":734},{"uri":"November_2","surface_form":"November 2","offset":949},{"uri":"1889","surface_form":"1889","offset":961},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":1054},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1074},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":1119},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":1146},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":1594},{"uri":"Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation","surface_form":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation","offset":1606}]}
