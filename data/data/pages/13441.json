{"id":13441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism","text":"Dualism is the idea or theory that something (an object, an idea or the whole world) is split into two parts. These parts are separate from each other, and the thing cannot be divided up in any other way. The idea or theory that something cannot be split into any parts is called monism. The idea that something can be split into many parts is called pluralism.\nIn philosophy there are many kinds of dualism.\nDualism is also a common sense idea. For example, it is a form of dualism to say that a thing is either hot or cold, good or bad, mine or somebody else's, with no allowance for possible states in between.\nDitheism.\nIn theology, dualism may also refer to \"duotheism\", \"bitheism\" or \"ditheism\". This the doctrine or belief that there are two independent divine beings or eternal principles, one good and the other evil. Examples of ditheism include Zoroastrianism, Wicca and Marcionism. Although the Bible mentions Satan, this is not ditheism as he is not equal to God, but merely an angel. (See Epistle of Jude, verse 6). Ditheism is not the same as dualism, but they are similar. Ditheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not imply any \"-theism\" (belief in a god) whatsoever.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":15},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":23},{"uri":"Monism","surface_form":"monism","offset":280},{"uri":"Pluralism","surface_form":"pluralism","offset":351},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":365},{"uri":"Common_sense","surface_form":"common sense","offset":427},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":627},{"uri":"Zoroastrianism","surface_form":"Zoroastrianism","offset":856},{"uri":"Wicca","surface_form":"Wicca","offset":872},{"uri":"Marcionism","surface_form":"Marcionism","offset":882},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":907},{"uri":"Satan","surface_form":"Satan","offset":922},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":972},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":991},{"uri":"Epistle_of_Jude","surface_form":"Epistle of Jude","offset":1003},{"uri":"Theism","surface_form":"theism","offset":1168},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":1189}]}
