{"id":134485,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Stoicism was a school of Hellenistic philosophy. It was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early third century BC. It concerns the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom. This philosophy claims that it is virtuous to maintain a will (a determination, \"prohairesis\") which is in accord with nature.\nStoic doctrine was popular in Greece and the Roman Empire from its founding until all the schools of philosophy were ordered closed in 529 AD by the Emperor Justinian I, who thought their pagan character was at odds with his Christian faith.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hellenistic","surface_form":"Hellenistic","offset":38},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":50},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":80},{"uri":"Zeno_of_Citium","surface_form":"Zeno of Citium","offset":90},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":132},{"uri":"Determinism","surface_form":"determinism","offset":187},{"uri":"Freedom_(philosophy)","surface_form":"freedom","offset":209},{"uri":"Virtue","surface_form":"virtuous","offset":252},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":337},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":375},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":390},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":484},{"uri":"Justinian_I","surface_form":"Justinian I","offset":502},{"uri":"Pagan","surface_form":"pagan","offset":533}]}
