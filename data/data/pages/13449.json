{"id":13449,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel","text":"A blood vessel is a tube that carries blood in the circulatory system. Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood back to the heart are veins. Capillaries are between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood.\nThe heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system. Blood is moved by the pumping of the heart and carries oxygen to the tissues.\nThe expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation, it helps the body to get rid of heat energy (\"vas-\" in Latin means \"container\" or \"vessel\").\nThe constriction of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction, it prevents the body from losing warmth.\nThere are 100,000 km (60,000 miles) of blood vessels in an adult human body.\nGrowing new blood vessels is called angiogenesis.\nStructure.\nThe structure of the vessel wall depends on hemodynamic conditions: blood flow velocity, volume and blood pressure. Arteries located close to the heart are characterized by a predominance of elastic elements that are able to counteract high hemodynamic parameters. As you move away from the heart, hemodynamic values decrease, the caliber of blood vessels decreases and the number of muscle elements in their walls increases, which are able to create additional force to push blood into the network of the smallest vessels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":38},{"uri":"Circulatory_system","surface_form":"circulatory system","offset":51},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":115},{"uri":"Artery","surface_form":"arteries","offset":125},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":177},{"uri":"Vein","surface_form":"vein","offset":187},{"uri":"Capillary","surface_form":"Capillaries","offset":194},{"uri":"Circulatory_system","surface_form":"circulatory system","offset":348},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":423},{"uri":"Vasodilation","surface_form":"vasodilation","offset":487},{"uri":"Vasoconstriction","surface_form":"vasoconstriction","offset":638}]}
