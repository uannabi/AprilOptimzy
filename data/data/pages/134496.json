{"id":134496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Anarcho-communism, also known as anarchist communism, is the belief that hierarchies, money, and social classes should not exist, and that the means of production should be held in common by society. Anarcho-communists support direct democracy and a network of voluntary associations, workers' councils, decentralized economic planning and a gift economy in which everyone will be free to satisfy their needs.\nSome well-known anarcho-communist writers are Peter Kropotkin, Ricardo Flores Mag\u00F3n and Nestor Makhno. Anarcho-communism is opposed to more authoritarian forms advocated by Leninists and Maoists. These groups have violently clashed in Russia, Korea and Spain over their beliefs. Some examples of anarcho-communism in practice include the Free Territory of Ukraine, Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, Shinmin Autonomous Region, and the Revolutionary Spain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchies","offset":86},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":99},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"social classes","offset":110},{"uri":"Direct_democracy","surface_form":"direct democracy","offset":240},{"uri":"Voluntary_association","surface_form":"voluntary association","offset":274},{"uri":"Workers%27_council","surface_form":"workers' councils","offset":298},{"uri":"Decentralized_planning_(economics)","surface_form":"decentralized economic planning","offset":317},{"uri":"Text%3DA%2520gift%2520economy%2520or%2520gift%2Cfor%2520immediate%2520or%2520future%2520rewards.","surface_form":"gift economy","offset":355},{"uri":"Peter_Kropotkin","surface_form":"Peter Kropotkin","offset":469},{"uri":"Ricardo_Flores_Mag%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Ricardo Flores Mag\u00F3n","offset":486},{"uri":"Nestor_Makhno","surface_form":"Nestor Makhno","offset":511},{"uri":"Leninism","surface_form":"Leninists","offset":596},{"uri":"Maoism","surface_form":"Maoists","offset":610},{"uri":"Free_Territory_of_Ukraine","surface_form":"Free Territory of Ukraine","offset":761},{"uri":"Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone","surface_form":"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone","offset":788},{"uri":"Korean_People%27s_Association_in_Manchuria","surface_form":"Shinmin Autonomous Region","offset":818},{"uri":"Spanish_Revolution_of_1936","surface_form":"Revolutionary Spain","offset":853}]}
