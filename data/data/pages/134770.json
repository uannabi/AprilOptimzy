The idea was to wait until genetic analysis had decided how best to classify them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":60},{"uri":"River_dolphin","surface_form":"river dolphin","offset":74},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":97},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":104},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":116},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":126},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"genetic analysis","offset":461}]}
