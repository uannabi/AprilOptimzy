These stars form the Big Dipper and the North Star.\nCreation.\nThe flag was created in 1927 by Benny Benson, a 13-year-old Alaska native. Up to that time, Alaskans had flown only the U.S. flag. Benson's design was chosen over 700 other submissions from school-children in grades 7\u201312. Most other entries showed the seal, the midnight sun, the northern lights, polar bears, and gold pans. To celebrate his achievement, Benson was awarded $1,000 and an engraved watch. The Alaska Legislature adopted the flag on May 2, 1927. It was kept as the state flag upon statehood in 1959.\nAlaska's Flag Song Lyrics.\nThis song was made for the flag.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"Flag","offset":4},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":12},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":34},{"uri":"Ursa_Major_(constellation)","surface_form":"Big Dipper","offset":75},{"uri":"Polaris","surface_form":"North Star","offset":94},{"uri":"Benny_Benson","surface_form":"Benny Benson","offset":148},{"uri":"U.S._flag","surface_form":"U.S. flag","offset":236},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":306},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":313},{"uri":"Midnight_sun","surface_form":"midnight sun","offset":378},{"uri":"Northern_lights","surface_form":"northern lights","offset":396},{"uri":"Polar_bear","surface_form":"polar bear","offset":413},{"uri":"Watch","surface_form":"watch","offset":513},{"uri":"Legislature_of_Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska Legislature","offset":524}]}
