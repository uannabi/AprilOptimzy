Many cars and public buildings, for example schools were burnt. The riots started on October 25, 2005 in Clichy-sous-Bois, a suburb of Paris. Afterwards they spread to other parts of France. Together they lasted for about 3 weeks. The riots were a reaction to the accidental deaths of two teenage boys and the serious injuries of another. The three boys hid in a power substation and got an electric shock, after being chased by police. However the boys did not commit a crime.\nThe event starting the riots.\n\"The New York Times\" said the event started at 17:20 on 27 October 2005 in Clichy-sous-Bois. They said they know this from a police report. The police were called to a construction site, because of a burglary. Three teenagers thought they were being chased by the police, so they climed a fence of a power substation. This was because the feared long questioning by the police. Another 6 teenagers were caught by the police for questioning by 17:50. At 18:12 at the local police station in Livry-Gargan the lights went out because of a blackout. This black-out was caused by the death of Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor\u00E9 in the power station and the injury of the third boy.\nThere is a controversy, if the boys were chased by police. The local prosecutor and Nicholas Sarkozy, who was minister of interior at that time said no. But the newspaper \"The Australian\", who asked some of his friends, said yes.\nBefore this event there had been in issues with unemployment and police brutality in this town. But after this event mobs of protesters gathered. The \"Associated Press\" quoted a protester with \"People are joining together to say we've had enough. We live in ghettos. Everyone lives in fear.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"civil unrest","offset":9},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":25},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":38},{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"riot","offset":48},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":84},{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"public","offset":93},{"uri":"Buildings","surface_form":"buildings","offset":100},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":123},{"uri":"Clichy-sous-Bois","surface_form":"Clichy-sous-Bois","offset":184},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":204},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":214},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":343},{"uri":"Teenage","surface_form":"teenage","offset":368},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injuries","offset":397},{"uri":"Power_substation","surface_form":"power substation","offset":442},{"uri":"Electric_shock","surface_form":"electric shock","offset":470},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":550},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":588},{"uri":"Clichy-sous-Bois","surface_form":"Clichy-sous-Bois","offset":662},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":719},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":731},{"uri":"Construction_site","surface_form":"construction site","offset":755},{"uri":"Burglary","surface_form":"burglary","offset":787},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":803},{"uri":"Fence","surface_form":"fence","offset":876},{"uri":"Power_substation","surface_form":"power substation","offset":887},{"uri":"Questioning","surface_form":"questioning","offset":938},{"uri":"Livry-Gargan","surface_form":"Livry-Gargan","offset":1077},{"uri":"Blackout","surface_form":"blackout","offset":1123},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injury","offset":1232},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversy","offset":1268},{"uri":"Prosecutor","surface_form":"prosecutor","offset":1326},{"uri":"Nicholas_Sarkozy","surface_form":"Nicholas Sarkozy","offset":1341},{"uri":"Minister","surface_form":"minister","offset":1367},{"uri":"Interior","surface_form":"interior","offset":1379},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":1418},{"uri":"The_Australian","surface_form":"The Australian","offset":1429},{"uri":"Unemployment","surface_form":"unemployment","offset":1535},{"uri":"Police_brutality","surface_form":"police brutality","offset":1552},{"uri":"Mob","surface_form":"mobs","offset":1604},{"uri":"Protester","surface_form":"protester","offset":1612},{"uri":"Associated_Press","surface_form":"Associated Press","offset":1638},{"uri":"Quote","surface_form":"quote","offset":1656},{"uri":"Ghetto","surface_form":"ghetto","offset":1745},{"uri":"Fear","surface_form":"fear","offset":1772}]}
