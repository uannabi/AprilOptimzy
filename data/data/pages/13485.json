He is known mainly for his parodies of popular songs. He has also starred in a movie called \"UHF\" (1989). Yankovic had a children's program for a short time. It was named \"The Weird Al Show\". He has made parodies of songs such as \"American Pie\" (his ever popular \"The Saga Begins\"), \"Ridin'\" (\"White and Nerdy\"), \"Bad\" (\"Fat\"), \"Like a Virgin\" (\"Like a Surgeon\") and \"Gangster's Paradise\" (\"Amish Paradise\").\nHe also has a band to help him perform his songs. His band members are: Jim West (guitar), Steve Jay (bass), Rub\u00E9n Valtierra (piano), and Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz (drums).\nYankovic has also written a children's book titled \"When I Grow Up\".\nEarly life.\nAlfred was born in Downey, California. He was raised in the town of Lynwood, California. He is the only child of Nick Louis Yankovic (June 4, 1917 \u2013 April 9, 2004) and Mary Elizabeth Yankovic (n\u00E9e Vivalda; February 7, 1923 \u2013 April 9, 2004). His father was born in Kansas City, Kansas, of Yugoslavian ancestry, and began living in California after serving during World War II; he believed \"the key to success\" was \"doing for a living whatever makes you happy\" and often reminded his son of this philosophy. Nick Yankovic married Mary Elizabeth Vivalda in 1949. Mary, who was of Italian and English descent, and had come to California from Kentucky, gave birth to Alfred ten years later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":65},{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":74},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":93},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parodist","offset":103},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"record producer","offset":113},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satirist","offset":130},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"movie producer","offset":162},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":178},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":189},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parodies","offset":224},{"uri":"Songs","surface_form":"songs","offset":244},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":276},{"uri":"UHF_(movie)","surface_form":"UHF","offset":290},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"program","offset":329},{"uri":"The_Weird_Al_Show","surface_form":"The Weird Al Show","offset":369},{"uri":"American_Pie","surface_form":"American Pie","offset":428},{"uri":"Ridin","surface_form":"Ridin","offset":481},{"uri":"Bad_(song)","surface_form":"Bad","offset":511},{"uri":"Like_a_Virgin","surface_form":"Like a Virgin","offset":526},{"uri":"Gangster%27s_Paradise","surface_form":"Gangster's Paradise","offset":565},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":620},{"uri":"Performance","surface_form":"perform","offset":637},{"uri":"Jim_West","surface_form":"Jim West","offset":678},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":688},{"uri":"Steve_Jay","surface_form":"Steve Jay","offset":697},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":708},{"uri":"Rub%C3%A9n_Valtierra","surface_form":"Rub\u00E9n Valtierra","offset":715},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":732},{"uri":"Jon_Schwartz","surface_form":"Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz","offset":744},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":768},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":815},{"uri":"Downey%2C_California","surface_form":"Downey, California","offset":876},{"uri":"Lynwood%2C_California","surface_form":"Lynwood, California","offset":925},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas City, Kansas","offset":1121},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1219},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":1495}]}
