He was best known for his time working for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he wrestled under the ring names Garrison Cade and Lance Cade. Cade was trained by Shawn Michaels and made his professional wrestling debut along with Bryan Danielson in 1999 for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) in Japan.\nCade signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001 and began working for their developmental territory Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW). In the summer, he was sent to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). When the WWF dropped HWA as their developmental territory, Cade moved the then-renamed WWE's main developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In 2003, he debuted on an episode of Sunday Night Heat in a match against Lance Storm who forced him to submit to the sharpshooter. During his WWE career, he was known to team with Mark Jindrak and then later Trevor Murdoch. Cade was released from the company on October 14, 2008. Jim Ross stated on his blog that Cade \"made a major league mistake while utilizing bad judgment\" and that it was a factor in his departure. Ross also mentioned Cade having a seizure on a plane and him needing emergency medical care as a part of this.\nHe was a three-time World Tag Team Champion with Trevor Murdoch.\nOn August 13, 2010, Cade died at the age of 29 of apparent heart failure in San Antonio, Texas. On October 13, the medical examiner in San Antonio ruled that his death was \"accidental,\" and stated that intoxication from mixed drugs complicated a cardiomyopathy and caused his death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestler","offset":72},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Entertainment","offset":138},{"uri":"Ring_name","surface_form":"ring name","offset":203},{"uri":"Shawn_Michaels","surface_form":"Shawn Michaels","offset":264},{"uri":"Daniel_Bryan","surface_form":"Bryan Danielson","offset":332},{"uri":"Frontier_Martial-Arts_Wrestling","surface_form":"Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling","offset":360},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":450},{"uri":"Farm_team","surface_form":"developmental territory","offset":519},{"uri":"Memphis_Championship_Wrestling","surface_form":"Memphis Championship Wrestling","offset":543},{"uri":"Heartland_Wrestling_Association","surface_form":"Heartland Wrestling Association","offset":611},{"uri":"Ohio_Valley_Wrestling","surface_form":"Ohio Valley Wrestling","offset":772},{"uri":"WWE_Heat","surface_form":"Sunday Night Heat","offset":838},{"uri":"Lance_Storm","surface_form":"Lance Storm","offset":875},{"uri":"Mark_Jindrak","surface_form":"Mark Jindrak","offset":982},{"uri":"Trevor_Murdoch","surface_form":"Trevor Murdoch","offset":1010},{"uri":"Jim_Ross","surface_form":"Jim Ross","offset":1082},{"uri":"Epileptic_seizure","surface_form":"seizure","offset":1256},{"uri":"World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)","surface_form":"World Tag Team Champion","offset":1353},{"uri":"San_Antonio","surface_form":"San Antonio","offset":1474},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":1487},{"uri":"Cardiomyopathy","surface_form":"cardiomyopathy","offset":1644}]}
