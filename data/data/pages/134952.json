{"id":134952,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom","text":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland uses as its national flag the royal banner known as the \"Union Flag\" or, popularly, \"Union Jack\". The design today of the Union Flag comes from the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. It has the red cross of Saint George (patron saint of England), edged in white, on top of the Cross of Saint Patrick (patron saint of Ireland), which are on the Saltire of Saint Andrew (patron saint of Scotland). The flag does not contain anything that represents Wales, leading some people to call for a redesign.\nIts correct measurements are 1:2 (i.e. the bottom is twice as long as the sides). However, the British Armed Forces sometimes use a 3:5 version, where two of the red diagonals are cropped.\nLegacy.\nThe Union Jack has a legacy for flags, and some of the former colonies of Britain have this design on their own flags (i.e. Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, some provinces of Canada, etc.).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","offset":4},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":78},{"uri":"Saint_George","surface_form":"Saint George","offset":273},{"uri":"Patron_saint","surface_form":"patron saint","offset":287},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":303},{"uri":"Saint_Patrick","surface_form":"Saint Patrick","offset":352},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":383},{"uri":"Saint_Andrew","surface_form":"Saint Andrew","offset":421},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":451},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":513},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":576},{"uri":"British_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"British Armed Forces","offset":659},{"uri":"Legacy","surface_form":"legacy","offset":782},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":885},{"uri":"Fiji","surface_form":"Fiji","offset":896},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":902},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":915},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":928}]}
