{"id":13519,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom","text":"e=\"preserve\">Symptoms are used in diagnosis. The term is used in medicine, and in other fields such as fault-finding in engineering.\nIn medicine, it refers to things the patient feels or notices. It contrasts with signs, which are changes which a doctor sees in a patient. What a patient feels is subjective, whereas what a doctor sees is objective.\nIn diagnosis, all symptoms and signs are brought together to make a hypothesis as to what is going wrong. This might suggest further investigation or treatment. A complete investigation ends with a diagnosis that summarizes all this.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosis","offset":34},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":65},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":120},{"uri":"Patient","surface_form":"patient","offset":170},{"uri":"Signs","surface_form":"signs","offset":214},{"uri":"Subjective","surface_form":"subjective","offset":297},{"uri":"Objective","surface_form":"objective","offset":339},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":418}]}
