{"id":13520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis","text":"A medical diagnosis is when a doctor finds out what is making someone sick. Sometimes doctors can diagnose a sickness by asking the person questions and looking at the person's body. Sometimes doctors do \"tests\". Tests can mean taking a small bit of blood, urine, or tissue which is sent to a hospital laboratory where it is tested. X-rays are another form of test. Tests are ways to see how the body is working.\nWhen a diagnosis has been made, the doctor may recommend treatment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"doctor","offset":30},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"sickness","offset":109},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":250},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":257},{"uri":"Tissue_(biology)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":267},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":333},{"uri":"Treatment","surface_form":"treatment","offset":470}]}
