{"id":13525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)","text":"Pok\u00E9mon is a Japanese video game franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri for Nintendo in the 1990s. It is known as \"Pocket Monsters\" in Japan. It is now made up of animated television programs (anime), Japanese comic books (manga), trading cards, and toys but, most importantly, the video games. There are currently 721 monsters, with \"Pok\u00E9mon X and Y\". Pikachu is the most well-known. When the idea was invented, there were only 150, which was upgraded to 151 (including Mew) when the Blue version in Japan was released. In the United States and Europe, the number of Pok\u00E9mon was 151 from the beginning. There are now over 700 altogether.\nThe Pok\u00E9mon games involve making decisions about what to do and when to do it. They allow the player to catch the monsters, train them to make them better and attack other monsters so that they get better abilities and possibly evolve into different Pok\u00E9mon. It is also possible to trade Pok\u00E9mon with a friend. The Pok\u00E9mon in the battles never bleed or die; they only faint. All Pok\u00E9mon love human beings, except for Shadow Pok\u00E9mon - the doors to their hearts have been artificially closed. The game's slogan in the U.S. was \"Gotta catch 'em all!\", although now it is not used officially any more. The Japanese slogan is \"Let's get Pok\u00E9mon\" Over one hundred million (100,000,000) of the games have been sold so far, not counting the ones released for the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo GameCube. This makes it the second best-selling video game series of all time (after Nintendo's Mario series).\nFifteen versions of the animated television series exist, from 1998 until now on Kids WB and Cartoon Network. Additionally, sixteen full-length movies have been made since 1999.\nHistory.\nThe first games, released in 1998, were \"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue\", which became big hits and are still among the best-selling video games of all time. They followed the adventures of the player, a Pok\u00E9mon trainer who catches, raises, and battles with Pok\u00E9mon, collects badges from the 8 Gym Leaders, explores all over Kanto (the region), and trades Pok\u00E9mon with other people who have the game by using the Game Boy's Game Link Cable. Later, a sequel to \"Red\" and \"Blue\" was released: \"Pok\u00E9mon Yellow\". In this game, the player's character design is similar to Ash Ketchum (from the anime.) Also, instead of the Pok\u00E9mon given to the player at the start of \"Red\" and \"Blue\" (the player can choose Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle) in \"Yellow\" the only possible choice is Pikachu, which represents the Pok\u00E9mon Ash started with in the anime.\nWhen Nintendo realized how popular \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\" had become, they decided to support the production and release of more games. After \"Yellow\" came \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\", released in 2000, which had a total of 251 catchable Pok\u00E9mon, as opposed to only 151 previously. A sequel to the two games was released, \"Pok\u00E9mon Crystal\", which had several new features that were not on \"Gold\" and \"Silver\": Pok\u00E9mon had animated sprites when they came into battle, there was a subplot within the games relating to the different letter shapes of the Pok\u00E9mon Unown, and there was a new building called the Battle Tower, where players could battle very strong Pok\u00E9mon to win items and set records. Once the player has beaten the Elite Four, they can go to Kanto, the region in \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\".\nIn 2003, \"Pok\u00E9mon Ruby and Sapphire\" were released. They were the first \"Pok\u00E9mon\" games on the Game Boy Advance, and this upset many players because they could not trade Pok\u00E9mon with \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Gold\", \"Silver\", or \"Crystal\". However, there were 135 new Pok\u00E9mon, bringing the total to 386. There were many new features, like a Pok\u00E9Nav (a new item used for many ingame tasks), many more kinds of Pok\u00E9 Balls, a far bigger region (Hoenn) than in previous games (Kanto and Johto), and a Battle Tower different from the one in \"Crystal\". Players could also create Secret Bases, small hideouts hidden in trees and rock walls.\nLater in 2004, \"Pok\u00E9mon Fire Red & Leaf Green\" were released. They did not take place in a new region, and they did not have any new Pok\u00E9mon. They were simply remakes of \"Pok\u00E9mon Red & Blue\", adding a new \"extra region\" called the Sevii Islands, and a few new features. However, they made it possible for players of \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" to get earlier Pok\u00E9mon in their games. If a person had \"Ruby\", \"Sapphire\", \"Colosseum\", \"FireRed\", and \"LeafGreen\" (which many fans of the games did), they could have all 386 Pok\u00E9mon, which made many players happy.\nIn 2005, \"Pok\u00E9mon Emerald\" was released. It is a sequel to \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". It was the first \"main\" \"Pok\u00E9mon\" game since \"Crystal\" where Pok\u00E9mon had battle animations instead of static images. There was also a new place called the Battle Frontier where players could go after they beat the Elite Four. It was similar to the Battle Tower in \"Crystal\", \"Ruby\", and \"Sapphire\", except it was eight different facilities, all with different rules. Players earned Battle Points which could be used to buy items for Secret Bases, items for Pok\u00E9mon, and other things.\nIn 2007, \"Pok\u00E9mon Diamond and Pearl\" were released. They take place in a new region called Sinnoh. They had 107 new Pok\u00E9mon, which brought the total to 493. Another noticeable difference from the previous games was that \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" did not capitalize all the letters in names of Pok\u00E9mon, people, towns, items, and other things that were important to the games. For example, Lugia would appear as \"LUGIA\" in previous games, but in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" it would just say \"Lugia.\" This cleared up a lot of players' confusion, because many thought that a sentence like \"LUGIA is found in the WHIRL ISLANDS\" looked unusual. A sequel to \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", \"Pok\u00E9mon Platinum\" was released in the United States in March 2009. In May 2009 it was released in the UK.\nIn 2010, \"Pok\u00E9mon HeartGold & SoulSilver\" were released. They did not take place in a new region, or have any new Pok\u00E9mon. They were simply remakes of \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\". Like \"Pok\u00E9mon Yellow\", the player's Pok\u00E9mon can follow them. The games come with a pedometer like device, called the Pok\u00E9 Walker, that can let players walk with their Pok\u00E9mon, and gain Watts, which can be used to fight Pok\u00E9mon, or dowse for items.\nLater in 2010, \"Pok\u00E9mon Black and White\" were released. They take place in a new region called Unova. They had 156 new Pok\u00E9mon, bringing the total to 649. They introduced seasons, where areas appear differently depending on the season, and some areas can only be reached during certain seasons.\nIn 2012, \"Pok\u00E9mon Black 2 & White 2\" were released. They are sequels to \"Pok\u00E9mon Black and White\". They had a number of new areas and characters, as well as characters from \"Black and White\".\nIn 2013, \"Pok\u00E9mon X & Y\" were released. They are the first ever 3D games in the main \"Pok\u00E9mon\" series. They take place in a new region called Kalos. There are many new features, including the Mega Evolution, where some Pok\u00E9mon like Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Lucario are be able to evolve into stronger forms during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. There is also a new type called Fairy, which is strong against Dragon-type Pok\u00E9mon.\nin 2014, Pok\u00E9mon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire were released, which were remakes of ruby and sapphire. it added more mega evolutions, including the other hoenn starters, beedrill, Sableye, etc. tons of features were also added.\nIn 2016, Pok\u00E9mon Sun & Moon were released, which introduced people to a new region, Alola. there were a total of 803 (including mythical's). however, only 403 are in the alolan pokedex, with the others being able to be transferred from past games. rotom is now your pokedex, called the rotomdex, and z moves were introduced. z moves does a lot of damage,but can only be done once per battle. gyms, and gym leaders were taken out, and were replaced with totem pokemons, and island kahunas. a lot of features were added including SOS battles, where a wild Pok\u00E9mon send out help to exactly the same Pok\u00E9mon (or evolutions) to help when weakened.\nIn 2017, Pok\u00E9mon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon were released, which was like sun & moon, but more features were added. it increased the Pok\u00E9mon number to 807, and added ultra wormholes, where different Pok\u00E9mon are seen and caught, which made shiny hunting very easy and accessible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":13},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video
