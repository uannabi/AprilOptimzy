{"id":135264,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-in-glass_thermometer","text":"The mercury-in-glass thermometer was invented by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in Amsterdam (1714). It is a bulb containing\u00A0Mercury\u00A0attached to a\u00A0glass\u00A0tube of narrow diameter. The volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb. The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature. The small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column up the tube. The space above the mercury may be filled with\u00A0nitrogen\u00A0or it may be at less than\u00A0atmospheric pressure, a partial\u00A0vacuum.\nMercury cannot be used to measure temperatures lower than -39\u02DAC (as mercury freezes at that point) or temperature higher than 356.7\u02DAC (the boiling point of mercury). Mercury has been replaced largely by alcohol for use in thermometers. Ethanol is cheaper and safer than mercury and can be used as low as -80\u02DAC. However, ethanol boils at 78\u00B0C (172.4\u00B0F), which means its upper limit is much lower than mercury thermometers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Daniel_Gabriel_Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit","offset":49},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":78},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":120},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":704},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"Ethanol","offset":737}]}
