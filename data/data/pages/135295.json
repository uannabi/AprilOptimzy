{"id":135295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_Europe","text":"e=\"preserve\">The early modern period is a term used by historians for the period in Western Europe and its first colonies which spans the three centuries between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution.\nThe early modern period is characterized by the rise to importance of science and technological progress, civic politics and the nation state. Capitalism began its rise, beginning in northern Italian republics such as Genoa. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church.\nThe period includes the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, the European colonization of the Americas and the peak of the European hunt of witches.\nThe end date of the early modern period is associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750, or the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, which drastically transformed the state of European politics.\nAmong the most important political changes of this time are the abolition of serfdom and the change of kingdoms into nation-states. Then the Reformation, that meant that Christendom was no unified entity any more. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as English Reformation) converted to Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the power of the Pope.\nThe intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of mercantilism and the publication of works of political and social philosophy, such as Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" (1513) and Thomas More's \"Utopia\" (1515).\nDifference between 'early modern' and the Renaissance.\nThe expression \"early modern\" is sometimes, and incorrectly, used as a substitute for the term Renaissance. However, \"Renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments; which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe\u2014especially central and northern Italy\u2014and span the transition from late Medieval civilization and the opening of the early modern period.\nThe term early modern is most often applied to Europe, and its overseas empire. However, in Japan, the Edo period from 1590 to 1868 is also sometimes referred to as the early modern period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":84},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":113},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":166},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"Industrial Revolution","offset":186},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":279},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technological progress","offset":291},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":321},{"uri":"Nation_state","surface_form":"nation state","offset":338},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"Capitalism","offset":352},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":401},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":409},{"uri":"Genoa","surface_form":"Genoa","offset":427},{"uri":"Mercantilism","surface_form":"mercantilism","offset":516},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudalism","offset":649},{"uri":"Serfdom","surface_form":"serfdom","offset":660},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":689},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Protestant Reformation","offset":730},{"uri":"Thirty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Thirty Years' War","offset":758},{"uri":"European_colonization_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"European colonization of the Americas","offset":781},{"uri":"Witch","surface_form":"witch","offset":856},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"Industrial Revolution","offset":928},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":1013},{"uri":"Abolition","surface_form":"abolition","offset":1166},{"uri":"Serfdom","surface_form":"serfdom","offset":1179},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Reformation","offset":1243},{"uri":"Christendom","surface_form":"Christendom","offset":1272},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English Reformation","offset":1515},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestantism","offset":1549},{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":1609},{"uri":"Mercantilism","surface_form":"mercantilism","offset":1707},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":1773},{"uri":"Machiavelli","surface_form":"Machiavelli","offset":1793},{"uri":"The_Prince","surface_form":"The Prince","offset":1808},{"uri":"Thomas_More","surface_form":"Thomas More","offset":1831},{"uri":"Utopia_(book)","surface_form":"Utopia","offset":1846},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":2012},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2192},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":2231},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":2271},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2429},{"uri":"Edo_period","surface_form":"Edo period","offset":2440}]}
