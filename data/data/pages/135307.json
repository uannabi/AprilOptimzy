{"id":135307,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny","text":"The spinning jenny is a multi-spool spinning wheel. It was invented around 1764 by James Hargreaves (c. 1720 \u2013 22 April 1778) in Stanhill, near Blackburn, Lancashire in the northwest of England. The device dramatically reduced the amount of work needed to produce yarn. A single worker could work eight or more spools at once.\nThe spinning jenny was a huge success due to the fact that it could hold more than one ball of yarn, therefore making more clothing materials in a shorter amount of time while reducing the overall cost.\nThomas Highs (1718\u20131803) also claimed patents on the spinning jenny, and on other machines for cloth production.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"James_Hargreaves","surface_form":"James Hargreaves","offset":83},{"uri":"Blackburn","surface_form":"Blackburn","offset":144},{"uri":"Lancashire","surface_form":"Lancashire","offset":155},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":186},{"uri":"Yarn","surface_form":"yarn","offset":264},{"uri":"Thomas_Highs","surface_form":"Thomas Highs","offset":530},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":568}]}
