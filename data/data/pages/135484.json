Three games were played here for the tournament. During Euro2008, the real grass inside the stadium was replaced with fake grass, which is called artificial turf. The stadium's operators removed the artificial turf after the championship.\nThe hot seat.\nAll the seats are either black or yellow, but there is one red seat in sector A. It is called the \"hot seat\". The ticket for that seat is often given to former players of Young Boys or famous visitors. The first person who sat in the \"hot seat\" was the most successful goalkeeper of the BSC Young Boys, Walter Eirich.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":34},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":43},{"uri":"BSC_Young_Boys","surface_form":"Berner Sport Club Young Boys","offset":103},{"uri":"European_Football_Championship","surface_form":"European Football Championship","offset":435},{"uri":"Wankdorf_Stadium","surface_form":"Wankdorf Stadium","offset":552},{"uri":"Franc","surface_form":"franc","offset":629},{"uri":"Solar_panel","surface_form":"solar panel","offset":668},{"uri":"Olympique_Marseille","surface_form":"Olympique Marseille","offset":959},{"uri":"Hockey","surface_form":"Hockey","offset":1195},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":1220},{"uri":"Artificial_turf","surface_form":"artificial turf","offset":1520},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":1896}]}
