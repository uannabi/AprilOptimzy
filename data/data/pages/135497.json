{"id":135497,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnaj%C3%B6kull","text":"Vatnaj\u00F6kull (English: Glacier of Lakes) () is the largest glacier in Iceland. It lies in the south-east of the island, covering more than 8% of the country.\nThe average thickness of the ice is 400 m, with a maximum thickness of 1,000 m. Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshn\u00FAkur (2,110 m), is located at the southern tip of Vatnaj\u00F6kull, near Skaftafell National Park. It is classified as an ice cap glacier.\nVatnaj\u00F6kull has been shrinking for some years now, possibly because of climatic changes and recent volcanic activity. Until 1930 it was growing.\nAccording to Guinness World Records Vatnaj\u00F6kull is the object of the world's longest sight line, 550\u00A0km from Sl\u00E6ttaratindur, the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands. GWR state that \"owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction, Vatnaj\u00F6kull (2119m), Iceland, can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands, 340 miles (550\u00A0km) away\". This may be based on a claimed sighting by a British sailor in 1939.
