{"id":135545,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire","text":"The Durrani Empire (actually Afghan Empire) was established in 1747 by Ahmad Shah Durrani at Kandahar, Afghanistan. It included the land that is now called Afghanistan, Pakistan, eastern Iran and western India. The Durrani Empire is considered the foundation of the modern state of Afghanistan, with Ahmad Shah Durrani (Ahmad Shah Baba) being the \"Father of the nation\".\nThe Durrani dynasty diminished in the early 19th century when Afghanistan was fighting defensive wars with Persia on one side and British India on the other side. The Barakzai dynasty took over control of the kingdom but lost many of Afghanistan's territories by the end of the 19th century. It became to what is now Afghanistan after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 when the state became officially recognized by all the major countries in the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ahmad_Shah_Durrani","surface_form":"Ahmad Shah Durrani","offset":71},{"uri":"Kandahar","surface_form":"Kandahar","offset":93},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":103},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":169},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":187},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":204},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":501}]}
