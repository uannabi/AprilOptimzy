{"id":135555,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology","text":"Social psychology is the study in psychology of how people and groups interact. Researchers in this field are often either psychologists or sociologists. All social psychologists use both the individual and the group as their unit of analysis.\nDespite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate academic journals and professional groups. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following World War II. Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":34},{"uri":"Researcher","surface_form":"Researcher","offset":80},{"uri":"Psychologist","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":123},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociologists","offset":140},{"uri":"Individual","surface_form":"individual","offset":192},{"uri":"Group","surface_form":"group","offset":211},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":234},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":407},{"uri":"Journal","surface_form":"journal","offset":416},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":429}]}
