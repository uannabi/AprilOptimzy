{"id":135567,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_English","text":"Indian English or South Asian English is several dialects or varieties of English. It is spoken mainly in India, and by first-generation members of the Indian diaspora.\nThe dialect evolved during and after the British colonial rule of India. English is the co-official language of India, with about 90 million speakers, but with fewer than quarter of a million calling it a first language.\nIn 19th century India, Britain first faced the need to teach English to a body of people who were important to Britain.\nThere were a number of schools which taught and used English in India. They were mostly run by missionaries. Many taught European and Eurasian children and orphans. The products of these schools provided the first generation of teachers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":74},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":106},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diaspora","offset":159},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British colonial rule of India","offset":210},{"uri":"Missionaries","surface_form":"missionaries","offset":605},{"uri":"Orphan","surface_form":"orphan","offset":666}]}
