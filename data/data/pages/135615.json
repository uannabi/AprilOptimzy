{"id":135615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy","text":"Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908\u00A0\u2013 May 2, 1957) was an American politician. He was a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period of intense anti-communist suspicion inspired by the tensions of the Cold War.\nHe made claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside the federal government and elsewhere. The term \"McCarthyism,\" coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist pursuits.\nDuring World War II he was a captain in the United States Marine Corps.\nMcCarthy died of hepatitis at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":65},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":95},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"U.S. Senator","offset":106},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":137},{"uri":"Anti-communism","surface_form":"anti-communist","offset":269},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":326},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"Communists","offset":384},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":399},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"United States Marine Corps","offset":648},{"uri":"Hepatitis","surface_form":"hepatitis","offset":693},{"uri":"Walter_Reed_National_Military_Medical_Center","surface_form":"Walter Reed National Military Medical Center","offset":710}]}
