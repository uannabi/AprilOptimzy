She has released five studio albums and two EPs. In 2001, she released a Christian album named after herself, \"Katy Hudson\". In November 2007, Perry released the music video for her first single, \"Ur So Gay\". She has a contralto vocal range. Perry became the most-followed person on Twitter in November 2013. She has earned nine number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, five of which are from one album (she became the first female artist to achieve this record). Perry has also been nominated for 11 Grammy Awards.\n1984\u20132000: Early life.\nPerry was born on October 25, 1984 at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, to Maurice Hudson and Mary Hudson (\"n\u00E9e\" Perry), both pastors. She has an older sister, Angela, and a younger brother, David, who is also a musician. Perry has said that her upbringing was \"sheltered\" and that an example of this was that her family did not eat Lucky Charms cereal because her parents thought that luck was something that came from the devil. She also called deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\" growing up.\n2001: \"Katy Hudson\".\nThen known as Katy Hudson, she released a Christian album named after herself. It had the single \"Search Me\". She was discovered by Glen Ballard, who is known for his work with musician Alanis Morissette. This album did not perform well, and she was dropped from her record label, Red Hill, when the label was shut down. She struggled for six years before eventually signing with her current label, Capitol Records.\n2007\u201309: \"One of the Boys\".\nAfter changing her last name to Perry (her mother's maiden name) so that she allegedly would not be confused with actress Kate Hudson, Katy released an EP album called \"Ur So Gay\".
