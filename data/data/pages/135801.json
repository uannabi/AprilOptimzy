{"id":135801,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin","text":"Murray Bookchin (January 14, 1921 \u2013 July 30, 2006) was an American libertarian socialist, political and social philosopher, speaker and writer. For much of his life he called himself an anarchist, although as early as 1995 he privately renounced his identification with the anarchist movement. A pioneer in the ecology movement, Bookchin was the founder of the social ecology movement within libertarian socialist and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books on politics, philosophy, history, and urban affairs as well as ecology.\nBookchin was a radical anti-capitalist and always favored the decentralisation of society. His writings on libertarian municipalism, a theory of face-to-face, grassroots democracy, had an influence on the Green Movement and anti-capitalist direct action groups such as Reclaim the Streets. His criticisms of \"new age\" Greens such as Charlene Spretnak contributed to the divisions in the American Green movement in the 1990s.\nAlthough an anti-capitalist, Murray Bookchin often met with libertarian thinker Murray Rothbard and occasionally attended Libertarian Party (United States) conventions, endorsing their Presidential candidate Roger MacBride in 1976.\nBookchin has influenced the thinking of captured Kurdish militant Abdullah \u00D6calan, who has renounced violence and now wants a peaceful solution to the question of Kurdish autonomy.\nLibertarian municipalism.\nBookchin was the first to use the term \"Libertarian municipalism\", to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the State with a confederation of free municipalities. Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers \u2014 the municipal confederations and the nation-state \u2014 cannot coexist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Philosopher"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":58},{"uri":"Libertarian_socialism","surface_form":"libertarian socialist","offset":67},{"uri":"Social_philosopher","surface_form":"social philosopher","offset":104},{"uri":"Anarchist","surface_form":"anarchist","offset":274},{"uri":"Pioneer","surface_form":"pioneer","offset":296},{"uri":"Dozen","surface_form":"dozen","offset":463},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":488},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":500},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":538},{"uri":"Radical","surface_form":"radical","offset":562},{"uri":"Anti-capitalism","surface_form":"anti-capitalist","offset":570},{"uri":"Decentralisation","surface_form":"decentralisation","offset":609},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":629},{"uri":"Libertarian_municipalism","surface_form":"libertarian municipalism","offset":654},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":735},{"uri":"Green_movement","surface_form":"Green Movement","offset":752},{"uri":"Anti-capitalist","surface_form":"anti-capitalist","offset":771},{"uri":"Direct_action","surface_form":"direct action","offset":787},{"uri":"Reclaim_the_Streets","surface_form":"Reclaim the Streets","offset":816},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticism","offset":841},{"uri":"New_age","surface_form":"new age","offset":856},{"uri":"Charlene_Spretnak","surface_form":"Charlene Spretnak","offset":880},{"uri":"Green_movement","surface_form":"Green movement","offset":943},{"uri":"Murray_Rothbard","surface_form":"Murray Rothbard","offset":1052},{"uri":"Libertarian_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Libertarian Party (United States)","offset":1094},{"uri":"Abdullah_%C3%96calan","surface_form":"Abdullah \u00D6calan","offset":1270},{"uri":"Libertarian_municipalism","surface_form":"Libertarian municipalism","offset":1451},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":1492},{"uri":"Libertarian_socialism","surface_form":"libertarian","offset":1508},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democratic","offset":1545},{"uri":"Assemblies","surface_form":"assemblies","offset":1556},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"State","offset":1596},{"uri":"Confederation","surface_form":"confederation","offset":1609},{"uri":"Coexist","surface_form":"coexist","offset":1787}]}
