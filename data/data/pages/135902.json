If approved, they are sworn in and begin their duties. Aside from the Attorney General, and previously, the Postmaster General, they all receive the title \"Secretary\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Executive_branch","surface_form":"executive branch","offset":121},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"federal government of the United States","offset":145},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"American","offset":228},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":237},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":248},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":308},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":328},{"uri":"Secretary_of_the_Treasury","surface_form":"Secretary of the Treasury","offset":346},{"uri":"Alexander_Hamilton","surface_form":"Alexander Hamilton","offset":373},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_War","surface_form":"Secretary of War","offset":393},{"uri":"Henry_Knox","surface_form":"Henry Knox","offset":411},{"uri":"United_States_Attorney_General","surface_form":"Attorney General","offset":427},{"uri":"Edmund_Randolph","surface_form":"Edmund Randolph","offset":445},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senate","offset":576},{"uri":"Advice_and_consent","surface_form":"confirmation or rejection","offset":601},{"uri":"Simple_majority","surface_form":"simple majority","offset":632},{"uri":"Oath_of_office","surface_form":"sworn in","offset":671},{"uri":"United_States_Postmaster_General","surface_form":"Postmaster General","offset":757}]}
