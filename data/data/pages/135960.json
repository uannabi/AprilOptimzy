{"id":135960,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_image_processor","text":"A Raster image processor is a component that can be found in some printers. The raster image processor receives the data in a description language, like Postscript, PCL, or PDF and converts it to a bitmap or raster image.\nRaster image processing can be done in two ways: as Software running as part of the operating system, or as a special microprocessor inside the printer. Cheaper printers use a solution called host-based printing, where this is done in the operating system, more expensive printers, and those that support PCL, Postscript or a similar language have a Raster image processor inside the printer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"printers","offset":66},{"uri":"Postscript","surface_form":"Postscript","offset":153},{"uri":"PCL","surface_form":"PCL","offset":165},{"uri":"Portable_Document_Format","surface_form":"PDF","offset":173},{"uri":"Bitmap","surface_form":"bitmap","offset":198},{"uri":"Raster_image","surface_form":"raster image","offset":208},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"Software","offset":274},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":306},{"uri":"Microprocessor","surface_form":"microprocessor","offset":340},{"uri":"Host-based_printing","surface_form":"host-based printing","offset":414}]}
