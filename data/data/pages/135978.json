{"id":135978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane","text":"Taxanes are poisonous alkaloids produced by Yew plants.\nAlkaloids are natural basic chemical compounds which contain nitrogen atoms. The name comes from the word alkaline and was used to describe any alkaline containing nitrogen.\nAlkaloids are made by a large variety of organisms, but taxanes are produced only by plants of the genus \"Taxus\".\nTaxanes work mainly by disrupting the function of cell microtubules. Microtubules are essential to cell division, so taxanes are essentially mitotic inhibitors. This explains why taxanes have been used to produce chemotherapy drugs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":12},{"uri":"Alkaloid","surface_form":"alkaloid","offset":22},{"uri":"Yew","surface_form":"Yew","offset":44},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":78},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":84},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":117},{"uri":"Alkaline","surface_form":"alkaline","offset":162},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":329},{"uri":"Taxus","surface_form":"Taxus","offset":336},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":394},{"uri":"Microtubule","surface_form":"microtubule","offset":399},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":443},{"uri":"Mitosis","surface_form":"mitotic","offset":485},{"uri":"Inhibition","surface_form":"inhibitor","offset":493},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":557}]}
