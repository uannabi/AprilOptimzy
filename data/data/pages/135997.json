{"id":135997,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library","text":"=\"preserve\">Dynamic-link library (also written as Dynamic Link Library or DLL), is the Microsoft's implementation of shared libraries used by the Microsoft Windows operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension <kbd>DLL</kbd>, <kbd>OCX</kbd> (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or <kbd>DRV</kbd> (for Windows legacy system drivers).\nAny of the Microsoft Windows data files having the same file format as that of the \"Dynamic-link library\" can be called a \"resource DLL\". Examples of such DLLs include \"icon libraries\", sometimes having the extension <kbd>ICL</kbd>, and the font files, having the extensions <kbd>FON</kbd> and <kbd>FOT</kbd>.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":87},{"uri":"Shared_library","surface_form":"shared libraries","offset":117},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":146},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":164},{"uri":"File_extension","surface_form":"file extension","offset":216},{"uri":"ActiveX","surface_form":"ActiveX","offset":288},{"uri":"Device_driver","surface_form":"system driver","offset":345},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":373},{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"files","offset":396},{"uri":"File_format","surface_form":"file format","offset":418},{"uri":"Icon_(computing)","surface_form":"icon","offset":531},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":603}]}
