He killed 225 soldiers and officers of the Wehrmacht and other Axis armies, including 11 enemy snipers. Before the 10th November, he had already killed 32 Axis soldiers with the standard Mosin-Nagant rifle. Between October 1942 and January 1943, Zaytsev had made 242 verified kills, but the real number may be much higher; some argue it might have been as many as 400. His military rank at the time was Junior Lieutenant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"Captain","offset":0},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":77},{"uri":"Sniper","surface_form":"sniper","offset":84},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":98},{"uri":"Battle_of_Stalingrad","surface_form":"Battle of Stalingrad","offset":211},{"uri":"Soldiers","surface_form":"soldiers","offset":247},{"uri":"Wehrmacht","surface_form":"Wehrmacht","offset":276},{"uri":"Axis_Powers","surface_form":"Axis","offset":296},{"uri":"Sniper","surface_form":"sniper","offset":328},{"uri":"Mosin-Nagant","surface_form":"Mosin-Nagant","offset":420},{"uri":"Military_rank","surface_form":"military rank","offset":606}]}
