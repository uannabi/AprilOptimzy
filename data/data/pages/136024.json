{"id":136024,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding","text":"e=\"preserve\">Port forwarding, also referred to as port mapping, is a method of forwarding a network port from one network node to another. This technique can allow an external user to reach a port on a private IP address (inside a LAN) from the outside using a NAT-enabled router.\nPort forwarding allows remote computers (e.g. public machines on the Internet) to connect to a specific computer within a private LAN.\nPort forwarding is not necessary with IPv6, because every IPv6-enabled device has a public IPv6 address.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Packet_forwarding","surface_form":"forwarding","offset":79},{"uri":"TCP_and_UDP_port","surface_form":"network port","offset":92},{"uri":"Node_(networking)","surface_form":"network node","offset":114},{"uri":"Private_network","surface_form":"private IP address","offset":202},{"uri":"Local_area_network","surface_form":"LAN","offset":231},{"uri":"Network_address_translation","surface_form":"NAT","offset":261},{"uri":"Router","surface_form":"router","offset":273},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":350}]}
