{"id":136049,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States_Virgin_Islands","text":"The flag of the United States Virgin Islands was adopted in 1921. The eagle holds a branch in one talon, and three arrows in the other, meaning the three major islands: Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Saint Croix. Additionally, the colors of the flag are: yellow, showing various characteristics of the territory and the flowers; green, symbolizing the hills; white, meaning the clouds; and blue, depicting the waters.\nHistory of the flag.\nThe idea of a Virgin Islands Flag began with Rear Admiral Summer Ely Whitmore Kitelle, who was governor of the Islands on April 26, 1921. He approached Mr. White, and Percival Wilson Sparks, and asked them for suggestions for a flag design. Sparks, a cartoonist, drew a flag on paper. Afterwards Sparks transferred it on heavy cotton material, then asked his wife Grace and her sister Blanche Joseph to make the design.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":4},{"uri":"United_States_Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"United States Virgin Islands","offset":16},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":533},{"uri":"April_26","surface_form":"April 26","offset":560},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":570},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":716},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":765},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":850}]}
