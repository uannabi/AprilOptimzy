So, to \"reverse-resolve\" a known IP address to determine the hostname is simply the process of searching what host and domain name belongs to that IP address.\nA reverse lookup is often referred to as reverse resolving, or more specifically reverse DNS lookup, and is accomplished using a \"reverse IN-ADDR entry\" in the form of a PTR record.\nRFC 1033 in the \"INSTRUCTIONS\" section, and later, RFC 1912 Section 2.1 states \"Every Internet-reachable host should have a name\" and \"Make sure your PTR and A records match\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hostname","surface_form":"hostname","offset":73},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"host computer","offset":89},{"uri":"IP_address","surface_form":"IP address","offset":127},{"uri":"Network_address","surface_form":"network address","offset":159},{"uri":"Domain_Name_System","surface_form":"Domain Name System","offset":191},{"uri":"IP_address","surface_form":"IP address","offset":236},{"uri":"Domain_name","surface_form":"domain name","offset":274},{"uri":"Hostname","surface_form":"hostname","offset":348},{"uri":"PTR_record","surface_form":"PTR record","offset":616}]}
