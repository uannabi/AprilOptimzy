{"id":136324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Polis means a city, a city-state and also citizenship and body of citizens. In context with Ancient Greece \"polis\" means nearly always \"city-state.\"\nThe word originates from the ancient Greek city-states, which developed during the period and existed well into Roman times, when the equivalent Latin word was \"civitas\", that means 'citizenhood' as well.\nAn ancient \"polis\" often centered around a citadel, called the \"acropolis\". Nearly always it had an \"agora\" (market) and typically one or more temples and a \"gymnasium\". Many citizens of a \"polis\" did not live in the central city but in the suburbs or countryside. The Greeks regarded the \"polis\" as a religious and political association: while the \"polis\" would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the \"polis\" would not simply consist of a geographical area.\nWords coming from \"polis\".\nModern European languages have many words that come from \"polis\". In English there are policy, polity, police and politics. In Greek, words coming from \"polis\" include \"polit\u0113s\" and \"politismos\".\nOther cities.\nThermopolis, Wyoming is a town in the United States of America but isn't classified as a city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":27},{"uri":"City-state","surface_form":"city-state","offset":35},{"uri":"Citizenship","surface_form":"citizenship","offset":55},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":105},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":191},{"uri":"City-state","surface_form":"city-state","offset":205},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":274},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":307},{"uri":"Citadel","surface_form":"citadel","offset":410},{"uri":"Acropolis","surface_form":"acropolis","offset":431},{"uri":"Agora","surface_form":"agora","offset":468},{"uri":"Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)","surface_form":"gymnasium","offset":525},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":880},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policy","offset":960},{"uri":"Polity","surface_form":"polity","offset":968},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":976},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":987},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":1000}]}
