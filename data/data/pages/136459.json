{"id":136459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Skepticism or scepticism (Greek \"skeptomai\": to consider, to examine) refers to any view involving \"doubt\".\nPeople who have skepticism as an attitude, opinion, or method are called skeptics or sceptics.\nThe roots of skepticism.\nSkepticism has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy. The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC, such as Protagoras of Abdera (480\u2013411 BC), were mostly skeptics. Gorgias (485\u2013380 BC) said, \"Nothing exists; if anything does exist, it cannot be known; if anything exists and can be known, it cannot be communicated\". In the 4th century BC Pyrrho of Elis (c360\u2013275 BC), who travelled and studied as far as India, adopted practical skepticism. Carneades (c213\u2013129 BC) disagreed that things were completely true or false. He criticized the Dogmatists, especially Stoics. He said that completely certain knowledge is impossible. Sextus Empiricus (c200 AD), the main authority for Greek skepticism, brought together empiricism into the basis for stating knowledge.\nSkepticism comes from Asian philosophy, too. The Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi (c369\u2013c286 BC) said that what seems real could be just a dream. In Indian philosophy, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka school thought that we should neither try to infer knowledge nor trust what other people tell us. In Buddhism, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna said that nothing exists by itself, and that this idea is an important part of enlightenment.\nThe most important part of the argument is that unless we know \"something\" for certain, then we cannot know \"anything\". The interest lies in the way great philosophers have tried to solve this problem. Some, like Descartes, retreat into the mind: \"I think, therefore I am.\" Others, such as the British empiricists John Locke and David Hume, would rely on our sense perception. Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism. For example, an agnostic believes people cannot get knowledge about supernatural things.\nSkepticism is widely used as a method for research in science, and (with changes) in modern legal procedure. Here doubt, suspending judgement, careful investigation, testing and discussion come before any statement of facts. Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached. This systematic approach is called \"methodological skepticism\". It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":39},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":269},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":283},{"uri":"Sophism","surface_form":"Sophists","offset":305},{"uri":"Protagoras","surface_form":"Protagoras","offset":345},{"uri":"Gorgias","surface_form":"Gorgias","offset":402},{"uri":"Pyrrho","surface_form":"Pyrrho","offset":577},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":643},{"uri":"Carneades","surface_form":"Carneades","offset":680},{"uri":"Dogmatists","surface_form":"Dogmatists","offset":775},{"uri":"Stoicism","surface_form":"Stoics","offset":798},{"uri":"Sextus_Empiricus","surface_form":"Sextus Empiricus","offset":863},{"uri":"Empiricism","surface_form":"empiricism","offset":949},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asian","offset":1020},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":1047},{"uri":"Chuang_Tzu","surface_form":"Zhuangzi","offset":1067},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"Indian","offset":1143},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":1275},{"uri":"N%C4%81g%C4%81rjuna","surface_form":"N\u0101g\u0101rjuna","offset":1285},{"uri":"Enlightenment_(Buddhism)","surface_form":"enlightenment","offset":1374},{"uri":"Descartes","surface_form":"Descartes","offset":1602},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":1683},{"uri":"Empiricism","surface_form":"empiricist","offset":1691},{"uri":"John_Locke","surface_form":"John Locke","offset":1703},{"uri":"David_Hume","surface_form":"David Hume","offset":1718},{"uri":"Perception","surface_form":"perception","offset":1754},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"knowledge","offset":1783},{"uri":"Agnostic","surface_form":"agnostic","offset":1853},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"supernatural","offset":1905},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":1968},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":1980},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":2018},{"uri":"Doubt","surface_form":"doubt","offset":2040},{"uri":"Judgement","surface_form":"judgement","offset":2058},{"uri":"Investigate","surface_form":"investigation","offset":2077},{"uri":"Test","surface_form":"test","offset":2092},{"uri":"Discussion","surface_form":"discussion","offset":2104},{"uri":"Fact","surface_form":"fact","offset":2144},{"uri":"Consensus","surface_form":"consensus","offset":2192}]}
