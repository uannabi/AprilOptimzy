{"id":136498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General","text":"e=\"preserve\">The United States Postmaster General is the executive head of the United States Postal Service. The office, in one form or another, is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General, serving slightly longer than 15 months.\nIn 1971, the United States Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service, a special agency independent of the executive branch. Thus, the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in line to be President.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Postal_Service","surface_form":"United States Postal Service","offset":79},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":168},{"uri":"United_States_Declaration_of_Independence","surface_form":"United States Declaration of Independence","offset":203},{"uri":"Benjamin_Franklin","surface_form":"Benjamin Franklin","offset":246},{"uri":"Continental_Congress","surface_form":"Continental Congress","offset":285},{"uri":"United_States_Post_Office_Department","surface_form":"United States Post Office Department","offset":392},{"uri":"United_States_Postal_Service","surface_form":"United States Postal Service","offset":455}]}
