{"id":13670,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt","text":"Yogurt, or yoghurt is a milk product made by bacterial fermentation of milk. The lactose in the milk becomes lactic acid when it is fermented. Lactic acid acts on the protein in the milk to make yoghurt thick and sour. The milk is heated to about 80 \u00B0C to kill any bacteria present, and to change the milk proteins so that they set together instead of becoming curd. After it is cooled to about 45 \u00B0C, the bacteria culture is added, and the milk is kept at that temperature for 4 to 7 hours to ferment. Soy yoghurt is made from soy milk.\nYogurt is one of the oldest produced foods in human history. No one knows for sure how long yogurt has been around. Today, it is eaten all over the world. It is rich in protein, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.\nSpelling.\nIn English, the word can be spelled either 'yogurt' or 'yoghurt'. In Canada 'yogourt' is also common. It can be spoken with either a short or a long 'o'.\nHistory.\nThe earliest yogurts were probably made by wild bacteria (yeast infections) and happened by chance.\nThe oldest writings mentioning yogurt were by Pliny the Elder, who said that some people knew how to thicken the milk into something which was sour but tasty.\nStamen Grigorov (1878\u20131945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the bacteria in Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905 he said that it contained a round and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907 the rod-like bacteria was called \"Lactobacillus bulgaricus\" (now \"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus\"). The Russian Nobel laureate biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov's work and made a hypothesis that eating yoghurt regularly was the reason why Bulgarian peasants lived for so long. Mechnikov believed that \"Lactobacillus\" was needed for good health, and worked to make yoghurt popular through Europe.\nHow it is good for health.\nYoghurt has a lot of protein, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 in it. It is healthier than milk is. Many people who are lactose-intolerant can enjoy yoghurt, because much of the lactose in the milk has become lactic acid.\nYoghurt also has medical uses, and in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dairy_product","surface_form":"milk product","offset":24},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":45},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":55},{"uri":"Lactose","surface_form":"lactose","offset":81},{"uri":"Lactic_acid","surface_form":"lactic acid","offset":109},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":167},{"uri":"Curd","surface_form":"curd","offset":361},{"uri":"Soy_yogurt","surface_form":"Soy yoghurt","offset":503},{"uri":"Soy_milk","surface_form":"soy milk","offset":528},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":707},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":716},{"uri":"Riboflavin","surface_form":"riboflavin","offset":725},{"uri":"Vitamin_B6","surface_form":"vitamin B6","offset":737},{"uri":"Vitamin_B12","surface_form":"vitamin B12","offset":752},{"uri":"Pliny_the_Elder","surface_form":"Pliny the Elder","offset":1084},{"uri":"Stamen_Grigorov","surface_form":"Stamen Grigorov","offset":1197},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":1228},{"uri":"Geneva","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":1261},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":1300},{"uri":"Lactobacillus","surface_form":"Lactobacillus","offset":1481},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1532},{"uri":"Nobel_laureate","surface_form":"Nobel laureate","offset":1540},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":1555},{"uri":"Ilya_Ilyich_Mechnikov","surface_form":"Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov","offset":1565},{"uri":"Pasteur_Institute","surface_form":"Pasteur Institute","offset":1597},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1618},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":1670},{"uri":"Bulgarians","surface_form":"Bulgarian","offset":1730},{"uri":"Lactobacillus","surface_form":"Lactobacillus","offset":1793},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":1935},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":1944},{"uri":"Riboflavin","surface_form":"riboflavin","offset":1953},{"uri":"Vitamin_B6","surface_form":"vitamin B6","offset":1965},{"uri":"Vitamin_B12","surface_form":"vitamin B12","offset":1980},{"uri":"Lactose_intolerance","surface_form":"lactose-intolerant","offset":2049},{"uri":"Diarrhea","surface_form":"diarrhea","offset":2222}]}
