{"id":136841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher","text":"=\"preserve\">In cryptography, a block cipher is a symmetric key cipher which operates on a groups of bits of fixed length, called \"blocks\", using an exact transformation. During encryption, a block cipher algorithm might take (for example) a 128-bit block of plaintext as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input \u2014 the secret key. Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key, and output the original 128-bit block of plaintext.\nOne of the early block cipher designs was the Data Encryption Standard (DES), developed at IBM and published as a standard in 1977. A successor to DES, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); also using block cipher, was adopted in 2001.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":15},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric key","offset":49},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":63},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":100},{"uri":"Transformation","surface_form":"transformation","offset":154},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plaintext","offset":258},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"key","offset":407},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plaintext","offset":585},{"uri":"Data_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"Data Encryption Standard","offset":642},{"uri":"IBM","surface_form":"IBM","offset":687},{"uri":"Advanced_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"Advanced Encryption Standard","offset":752}]}
