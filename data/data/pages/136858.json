{"id":136858,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname","text":"=\"preserve\">A hostname (also known as a sitename) is the unique name by which a network device (which may be a computer, file server, network storage device, copier, cable modem, etc.) is defined and known on a network. The hostname is used to identify a particular host in various electronic communication networks such as the World Wide Web, e-mail or Usenet.\nOn the Internet, the terms \"hostname\" and \"domain name\" are often misused interchangeably, but there are small technical differences between them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"A","offset":12},{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"network","offset":211},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web","surface_form":"World Wide Web","offset":328},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"e-mail","offset":344},{"uri":"Usenet","surface_form":"Usenet","offset":354},{"uri":"Domain_name","surface_form":"domain name","offset":405}]}
