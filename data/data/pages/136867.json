{"id":136867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography","text":"Public-key cryptography, also called asymmetric cryptography, is a communication where people exchange messages that can only be read by one another.\nThe private key is kept secret, while the public key may be widely distributed and used by other users.\nIncoming messages are encrypted with the \"recipient's public key\" and can only be decrypted with their corresponding private key. The keys are related mathematically, but the user's private key cannot be easily got from the widely used public key. The most usual problem with this method arises when private key is accidentally leaked.\nThey are often used together on the same message.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":11},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":67},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encrypted","offset":276}]}
