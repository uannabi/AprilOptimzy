{"id":136870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests","text":"The first Arab Muslim conquests (632\u2013732), (, Fatah, literally \"opening\",) also referred to as the Islamic conquests or Arab conquests, began after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He established a new unified political polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the following Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from northwest India, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees.\nThe Arab conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire. Though spectacular, the Arab successes are not hard to understand in hindsight. The Sassanid Persian and Byzantine empires were militarily exhausted from decades of fighting one another. This prevented them from dealing effectively with the mobile Arab raiders operating from the desert. Moreover, many of the peoples living under the rule of these empires, for example Jews and Christians in Persia and Monophysites in Syria, were disloyal and sometimes even welcomed the Arab invaders, largely because of religious conflict in both empires.\nByzantine-Arab Wars: 634-750.\nThe Byzantine-Arab Wars were between the Byzantine Empire and at first the Rashidun and then the Umayyad caliphates.\nUnder the Rashidun there were the conquests of Syria (637), Armenia (639), Egypt (639) and North Africa (652). Under the Umayyads the continuing conquest of North Africa (665), the second Arab siege of Constantinople (717-718) and the conquest of Tbilisi (736). In 827 there followed the conquest of southern Italy (827).\nConquests in Asia: 633 - 712.\nThe last ruler of the Sassanid Empire in Persia was defeated by the Rashidun in 633 and 636, but the final military victory didn't come until 642 when the Persian army was destroyed.\nDuring the seventh century the Umayyad fought successfully against the early Rajput in north India and in Central Asia.\nIn 711, a Muslim expedition defeated Raja Dahir at what is now Hyderabad in Sindh and established Umayyad rule by 712. The Umayyad brought under control the whole of what is modern Pakistan, from Karachi to Kashmir and reached the borders of Kashmir within three years. But rather soon afterwards semi-independent Arab ruled states developed.\nConquest of Hispania: 711-718.\nThe conquest of the Iberian Peninsula began when the Moors (mostly Berbers with some Arabs) invaded Visigothic Christian Iberia (modern Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Andorra) in the year 711. They landed at Gibraltar on April 30 and worked their way northward. This territory, under the Arab name \"Al-Andalus\", became first an Emirate and then an independent Umayyad Caliphate after the overthrowing of the dynasty in Damascus by the Abbasids. In 1031 the Christian kingdoms started the Reconquest up to 1492, when Granada, the last kingdom of Al-\u00C1ndalus fell under the Spanish Kings.\nFurther conquests: 1200-1800.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, the Sahelian kingdom expanded Muslim territories far from the coast. Muslim traders spread Islam.\nThe modern era saw the rise of three powerful Muslim empires: the Ottoman Empire of the Middle East and Europe, the Safavid Empire of Persia and Central Asia, and the Mughal Empire of India; along with their contest and fall to the rise of the colonial powers of Europe.\nDecline and collapse: 1800-1924.\nThe Mughal Empire declined in 1707 after the death of Aurangzeb and was officially abolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":165},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":173},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":181},{"uri":"Arabia","surface_form":"Arabia","offset":244},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":252},{"uri":"Rashidun_Empire","surface_form":"Rashidun","offset":288},{"uri":"Umayyad_Empire","surface_form":"Umayyad","offset":301},{"uri":"Caliphate","surface_form":"Caliphate","offset":309},{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":356},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":423},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":498},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":512},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":530},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":543},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":566},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":581},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":607},{"uri":"Sassanid_Empire","surface_form":"Sassanid Empire","offset":670},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":723},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1021},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":1111},{"uri":"Christians","surface_form":"Christians","offset":1120},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":1134},{"uri":"Monophysitism","surface_form":"Monophysites","offset":1145},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":1161},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":1355},{"uri":"Rashidun_Empire","surface_form":"Rashidun","offset":1389},{"uri":"Umayyad_Empire","surface_form":"Umayyad","offset":1411},{"uri":"Caliphate","surface_form":"caliphate","offset":1419},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":1478},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":1491},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":1506},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":1522},{"uri":"Siege","surface_form":"siege","offset":1624},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":1633},{"uri":"Tbilisi","surface_form":"Tbilisi","offset":1678},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1740},{"uri":"Sassanid_Empire","surface_form":"Sassanid Empire","offset":1805},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":1824},{"uri":"Rajput","surface_form":"Rajput","offset":2043},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":2059},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":2072},{"uri":"Raja_Dahir","surface_form":"Raja Dahir","offset":2123},{"uri":"Hyderabad%2C_Pakistan","surface_form":"Hyderabad","offset":2149},{"uri":"Sindh","surface_form":"Sindh","offset":2162},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":2293},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":2480},{"uri":"Moors","surface_form":"Moors","offset":2513},{"uri":"Berber_people","surface_form":"Berber","offset":2527},{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":2545},{"uri":"Visigoths","surface_form":"Visigothic","offset":2560},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":2571},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberia","offset":2581},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":2596},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":2603},{"uri":"Gibraltar","surface_form":"Gibraltar","offset":2613},{"uri":"Andorra","surface_form":"Andorra","offset":2624},{"uri":"Emirate","surface_form":"Emirate","offset":2785},{"uri":"Caliphate","surface_form":"Caliphate","offset":2825},{"uri":"Damascus","surface_form":"Damascus","offset":2876},{"uri":"Abbasid_Empire","surface_form":"Abbasids","offset":2892},{"uri":"Reconquista","surface_form":"Reconquest","offset":2945},{"uri":"Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":2973},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":3260},{"uri":"Safavid_dynasty","surface_form":"Safavid Empire","offset":3310},{"uri":"Mughal_Empire","surface_form":"Mughal Empire","offset":3361},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonial","offset":3438},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":3457},{"uri":"Mughal_Empire","surface_form":"Mughal Empire","offset":3502}]}
