{"id":136972,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_services_in_the_United_Kingdom","text":"e=\"preserve\">The fire service in the United Kingdom operates under separate legislative and administrative arrangements in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\nFire services.\nIn England, there is a fire service for each county and large city, although some cover two counties. Wales is divided between three fire services. Scotland has had only one fire service since 2013. Northern Ireland has had only one fire service since 1973.\nFire services are known as \"fire and rescue services\", or \"fire services\" for short, or by the older phrase \"fire brigades\". Most of them now have the name \"[Place] Fire and Rescue Service\", e.g. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. There are a few that do not: London Fire Brigade, Cleveland Fire Brigade and West Midlands Fire Service.\nHow fire services work.\nSome fire stations are day-crewed, meaning they are covered by wholetime firefighters during the day and by retained firefighters at night. A few places have volunteer firefighters, who are like retained firefighters but are not paid at all.\nWholetime firefighters work as part of a 'watch'. This is a group of 5-15 firefighters who work the same hours at the same fire station. A fire station's watches are usually named with a colour (e.g. red watch, white watch, blue watch, green watch).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislative","offset":76},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":92},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":123},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":132},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":150},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":163}]}
