{"id":13702,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun","text":"Abdul Rahman Ibn Khaldun was an influential Arab thinker of the 14th century. His family were from Andalusia. Born in Tunisia in 1332, Khaldun served the governments of the day in many ways. He was sometimes in prison. He lived in Marrakesh in Morocco for a time, and in Granada. Then he moved to Cairo, where was a judge and died in 1406.\nThe most famous book Khaldun wrote is the \"Kit\u0101b al-\u02BBIbar\" (Book of Lessons), a history of the world. The first part, \"Muqaddimah\" (Introduction) is often used alone. This book is often credited as inventing sociology. He also wrote his autobiography.\nTo understand and appreciate his work, one must understand his life. He lived a life in search of stability and influence. He came from a family of scholars and politicians and he intended to live up to both expectations. He would succeed in the field of scholarship much more so than in any other field.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":44},{"uri":"Andalusia","surface_form":"Andalusia","offset":99},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":118},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":154},{"uri":"Marrakesh","surface_form":"Marrakesh","offset":231},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":244},{"uri":"Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":271},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":297},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":316},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":548},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiography","offset":577}]}
