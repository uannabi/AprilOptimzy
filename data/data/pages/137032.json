{"id":137032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department","text":"The Post Office Department is the former name of the United States Postal Service when it was a Cabinet department. It was headed by the United States Postmaster General.\nThe Postal Service Act signed by President George Washington on February 20, 1792 established the Department. Postmaster General John McLean was the first to call it the Post Office \"Department\" rather than just the \"Post Office.\" The organization became more important in the government when President Andrew Jackson asked his Postmaster General, William T. Barry, to sit as a member of the Cabinet.\nDuring the Civil War, postal services in the Confederacy were provided by the Confederate States of America Post Office Department, headed by Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan.\nThe Postal Reorganization Act signed by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970, replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with the independent United States Postal Service. The Act took effect on July 1, 1971.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Postal_Service","surface_form":"United States Postal Service","offset":53},{"uri":"United_States_Cabinet","surface_form":"Cabinet","offset":96},{"uri":"United_States_Postmaster_General","surface_form":"United States Postmaster General","offset":137},{"uri":"Postal_Service_Act","surface_form":"Postal Service Act","offset":175},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":204},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":214},{"uri":"John_McLean","surface_form":"John McLean","offset":300},{"uri":"Andrew_Jackson","surface_form":"Andrew Jackson","offset":474},{"uri":"William_T._Barry","surface_form":"William T.
