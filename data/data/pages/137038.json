{"id":137038,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development","text":"The United States Department of Housing, often abbreviated HUD, is a Cabinet department of the United States federal government. Although its beginnings were in the House and Home Financing Agency, it was founded in 1965 to develop and execute policy on housing and cities. It has largely scaled back its urban development function and now focuses primarily on housing.\nThe department was established on September 9, 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act into law. It stipulated that the department was to be created no later than November 8, 60 days following the date of enactment. The actual implementation was postponed until January 13, 1966, following the completion of a special study group report on the federal role in solving urban problems.\nHUD is administered by the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The former administrator of the US Small Business Association, Steve Preston, was nominated to the Position of Secretary of HUD by President Bush on April 18, 2008. He was confirmed by the Senate and his public swearing in ceremony was on June 6, 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Cabinet","surface_form":"Cabinet","offset":69},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":95},{"uri":"Government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"government","offset":117},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States_of_America","surface_form":"President","offset":427},{"uri":"Lyndon_Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon Johnson","offset":437},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development","surface_form":"United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development","offset":835},{"uri":"Steve_Preston","surface_form":"Steve Preston","offset":956}]}
