{"id":13704,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve","text":"e=\"preserve\">A nerve is a group of special nerve cells grouped together in parallel. Another word for nerve cell is neuron. The special neurons grouped together in nerves take information (messages) to and from the human body to the central nervous system. The central nervous system (acronym) CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The spinal cord is the big cord that goes from the brain into the back. It carries all the information that goes from the brain to the nerves in the body.\nAll the nerves in the body make the peripheral nervous system (acronym PNS). The brain and spinal cord are the CNS. All the nerves that come from the spinal cord are the PNS. Together the CNS and PNS are the nervous system.\nNerve Structure.\nNervous system contains neurons and cells called glia. Glia cells keep the neurons safe and healthy. Neurons take messages to and from the CNS to the rest. The dendrite and axon are fibers that go out from the cell body. Axons take information \"away from\" the cell body. Dendrites take information to the cell body.\nTypes of nerves.\n\"Afferent\" nerves take messages to the CNS (brain) from the body. They take messages about sensation from the skin. They take messages about the position of the body from the muscles. They take messages about the function of organs like the heart and stomach.\n\"Efferent\" nerves take messages from the CNS to the body. They take messages that tell muscles to move. They take messages to glands. They tell glands like \"sweat glands\" to make sweat (the water that comes out of your skin when you are hot.)\nDiseases of nerves.\nThere are many diseases of nerves. A disease of nerves is also called a \"neuropathy\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":49},{"uri":"Neuron","surface_form":"neuron","offset":116},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":176},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":233},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":285},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":305},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":315},{"uri":"Peripheral_nervous_system","surface_form":"peripheral nervous system","offset":519},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":691},{"uri":"Glia","surface_form":"glia","offset":773},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":1167},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":1232},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":1298},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":1308},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":1443}]}
