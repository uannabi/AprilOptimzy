{"id":137065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Reconquista (a Spanish and Portuguese word for \"Reconquest\"; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062A\u0631\u062F\u0627\u062F, \"Recapturing\") was a period of 800 years in the Middle Ages during which the several Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula expanded themselves (grew) by fighting the Muslim states of \"al-Andalus\" (Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062F\u0644\u0633), the Muslim states on the Iberian Peninsula, and pushing them out of the peninsula.\nThe Reconquista began shortly after the Islamic conquest. Much of the ideology of the Reconquista was common to most Crusading: soldiers from all Christendom travelled to Iberia to fight the Muslims as an act of Christian repentance.\nThe Reconquista came to an end on the 2 January 1492 with the capture of Granada. The last Muslim ruler of Granada surrendered (gave up'\") his kingdom to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, the Catholic kings (\"los Reyes Cat\u00F3licos\"). This event marked the end of Muslim rule in Iberia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":32},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":44},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":78},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":145},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":182},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":208},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":269},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":300},{"uri":"Muslim_conquests","surface_form":"Islamic conquest","offset":440},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideology","offset":470},{"uri":"Crusades","surface_form":"Crusading","offset":517},{"uri":"Christendom","surface_form":"Christendom","offset":546},{"uri":"Repentance","surface_form":"repentance","offset":622},{"uri":"2_January","surface_form":"2 January","offset":672},{"uri":"Battle_of_Granada","surface_form":"capture of Granada","offset":696},{"uri":"Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Ferdinand II of Aragon","offset":788},{"uri":"Isabella_I_of_Castile","surface_form":"Isabella I of Castile","offset":815}]}
