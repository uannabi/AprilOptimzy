The Kashmir region is divided by the 1949 UN ceasefire line into two parts and the de facto border dividing Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir has been called the Line of Control since 1972. On the south side of the border of the Jammu Division is Pakistan's Punjab border, and is called the \"working boundary\" by Pakistan (which is a recent term) but the \"international border\" by India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":121},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":143},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":279},{"uri":"Line_of_Control","surface_form":"Line of Control","offset":305},{"uri":"Wagah","surface_form":"Wagah","offset":380},{"uri":"Amritsar","surface_form":"Amritsar","offset":497},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":532},{"uri":"Pakistan-administered_Kashmir","surface_form":"Pakistan-administered Kashmir","offset":777},{"uri":"Indian-administered_Kashmir","surface_form":"Indian-administered Kashmir","offset":812},{"uri":"Line_of_Control","surface_form":"Line of Control","offset":860}]}
