{"id":137123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_generation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography. The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted.\nModern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a digital certificate). A sender will encrypt data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.\nThe simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attack\u2013simply attempting every number, up to the maximum length of the key. Therefore, it is important to use a sufficiently long key length; longer keys take exponentially longer time to attack, making a brute force attack invisible and impractical.\nKey generation algorithms.\nIn computer cryptography keys are integers. In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator (RNG) or pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), the latter being a computer algorithm that produces data which appears random under analysis. Some types the PRNGs algorithms utilize system entropy to generate a seed data, such seeds produce better results, since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess.\nIn other situations, the key is created using a passphrase and a \"key generation algorithm\", using a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"keys","offset":57},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":66},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encrypt","offset":99},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric-key algorithm","offset":212},{"uri":"Data_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"DES","offset":246},{"uri":"Advanced_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"AES","offset":254},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public-key algorithms","offset":263},{"uri":"RSA","surface_form":"RSA","offset":294},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"single shared key","offset":331},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public key","offset":432},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"private key","offset":449},{"uri":"Public_key_certificate","surface_form":"digital certificate","offset":526},{"uri":"Brute_force_attack","surface_form":"brute force attack","offset":702},{"uri":"Key_size","surface_form":"key length","offset":844},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponentially","offset":873},{"uri":"Brute_force_attack","surface_form":"brute force attack","offset":919},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":1004},{"uri":"Random_number_generator","surface_form":"random number generator","offset":1086},{"uri":"Pseudorandom_number_generator","surface_form":"pseudorandom number generator","offset":1119},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":1176},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":1185},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":1272},{"uri":"Information_entropy","surface_form":"entropy","offset":1298},{"uri":"Random_seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":1320},{"uri":"Passphrase","surface_form":"passphrase","offset":1512},{"uri":"Cryptographic_hash_function","surface_form":"cryptographic hash function","offset":1565},{"uri":"SHA_hash_functions","surface_form":"SHA-1","offset":1601}]}
