{"id":137133,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall","text":"John Marshall (September 24, 1755 \u2013 July 6, 1835) was an American statesman and jurist who shaped American constitutional law and made the Supreme Court more powerful. Marshall was Chief Justice of the United States, working from February 4, 1801, until his death in 1835. He worked in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1799, to June 7, 1800, and, under President John Adams, was Secretary of State from June 6, 1800, to March 4, 1801. Marshall was from the Commonwealth of Virginia and a leader of the Federalist Party.\nThe longest working Chief Justice in Supreme Court history, Marshall ruled the Court for thirty years and was an important part of making the American legal system. His most important addition was judicial review; the power to stop laws that violate the Constitution. Marshall has been called the one that made the judicial branch special and powerful. Marshall also balanced the power between the federal and state government. He made sure the federal law was more powerful than state law and agreed with an expansive reading of the enumerated powers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statesman","surface_form":"statesman","offset":66},{"uri":"Jurist","surface_form":"jurist","offset":80},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":98},{"uri":"Constitutional_law","surface_form":"constitutional law","offset":107},{"uri":"United_States_Supreme_Court","surface_form":"Supreme Court","offset":139},{"uri":"Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Chief Justice of the United States","offset":181},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":290},{"uri":"John_Adams","surface_form":"John Adams","offset":387},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":403},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":497},{"uri":"United_States_Federalist_Party","surface_form":"Federalist Party","offset":526},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Supreme Court","offset":581},{"uri":"Judicial_review","surface_form":"judicial review","offset":741},{"uri":"Enumerated_powers","surface_form":"enumerated powers","offset":1078}]}
