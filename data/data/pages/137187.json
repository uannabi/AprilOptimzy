{"id":137187,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad_State","text":"Hyder\u0101b\u0101d and Berar (,) under the Nizams, was the largest Princely state in the erstwhile Indian Empire. The Berar region of present-day Vidarbha in Maharashtra was merged with the Central Provinces in 1903, to form Central Provinces and Berar.\nHyderabad state was in south-central India from 1724 until 1948. It was ruled by the hereditary Nizam. During the Partition of British India in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad declared his intentions of not joining either newly formed India or Pakistan. Sensing trouble, India launched Operation Polo which resulted in the absorption of Hyderabad into the Indian Union, in 1948.\nHistory.\nThe forebears of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty came to India from Samarkand, in Central Asia, but the family actually originated from Baghdad. In 1724, the Mughal Governor of the Deccan, Asaf Jah, Nizam ul-Mulk, Qamar ud-din Khan, established himself as an independent ruler of Deccan. Aurangabad was its first capital city, later Hyderabad became the capital and later lent its name to the state he had created. The first Nizam's successors became closely allied to the British colonialists, assisting them in subduing their enemies, the Maratha dynasty, Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the French. In later years, the Nizam's troops invariably took part in all the main campaigns of the British Indian Army. Large numbers of his troops took part in the First and Second World Wars. These contributions earned for the Nizam unequalled titles and honours from a grateful Emperor.\nThe state was the largest and premier of all princely states within the British Indian Empire. After the Pakistani and Indian Independences, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII decided that the Princely state of Hyderabad will not join the New Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan. His decision found favour with Pakistan but not with India. The Nizam\u2019s state was a prosperous one and had its own army, railway and airline network, postal system and radio network. On 15th August, 1947, India declared itself an independent nation. And so did Hyderabad.\nIndependence.\nAt the time of the Independence movement of India, the State of Hyderabad was the largest of the princely state<nowiki/>s in India. The Nizams of Hyderabad ruled over lands extending to cover 82,698 mi\u00B2 (214,190 km\u00B2) of fairly homogenous territory, bigger than Belarus but smaller than Guyana. The Nizam ruled over a cosmopolitan population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census). These advantages persuaded the Nizam to attempt an Independent existence when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. He refused to join either a Hindu India or a Muslim Pakistan, preferring to form a separate Kingdom within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Hyderabad State had its own Army, Airline, Telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and Radio broadcasting service.\nIn Hyderabad, where no official Referendum was held and where the ruler did not accede, the forced accession to India brought about by Military action, was presumed to have the tacit approval of the predominantly Hindu population. It was one of several annexation<nowiki/>s by India, with various rationales.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAfter the states were captured they reorganised in 1956, Aurangabad became part of Maharashtra, and Gulbarga became part of Karnataka, the remainder became Andhra Pradesh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nizam_of_Hyderabad","surface_form":"Nizam","offset":34},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"Princely state","offset":58},{"uri":"Indian_Empire","surface_form":"Indian Empire","offset":90},{"uri":"Vidarbha","surface_form":"Vidarbha","offset":137},{"uri":"Central_Provinces_and_Berar","surface_form":"Central Provinces and Berar","offset":216},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":282},{"uri":"Nizam_of_Hyderabad","surface_form":"Nizam","offset":341},{"uri":"Partition_of_British_India","surface_form":"Partition of British India","offset":359},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":477},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":486},{"uri":"Operation_Polo","surface_form":"Operation Polo","offset":528},{"uri":"Qamar-ud-din_Khan%2C_Asif_Jah_I","surface_form":"Asaf Jahi","offset":651},{"uri":"Samarkand","surface_form":"Samarkand","offset":688},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":702},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":756},{"uri":"Qamar-ud-din_Khan%2C_Asif_Jah_I","surface_form":"Qamar ud-din Khan","offset":834},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British colonialists","offset":1093},{"uri":"Maratha_dynasty","surface_form":"Maratha dynasty","offset":1161},{"uri":"Tipu_Sultan","surface_form":"Tipu Sultan","offset":1178},{"uri":"French_colonial_empire","surface_form":"French","offset":1209},{"uri":"British_Indian_Army","surface_form":"British Indian Army","offset":1306},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":1488},{"uri":"Nizam_of_Hyderabad","surface_form":"Nizam of Hyderabad","offset":1646},{"uri":"Osman_Ali_Khan%2C_Asaf_Jah_VII","surface_form":"Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII","offset":1666},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"Princely state","offset":1712},{"uri":"Dominion_of_India","surface_form":"Dominion of India","offset":1762},{"uri":"Dominion_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Dominion of Pakistan","offset":1783},{"uri":"Nizam_of_Hyderabad","surface_form":"Nizam\u2019s","offset":1869},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"princely state","offset":2188},{"uri":"Nizam","surface_form":"Nizams of Hyderabad","offset":2227},{"uri":"Mi%C2%B2","surface_form":"mi\u00B2","offset":2290},{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":2303},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":2352},{"uri":"Guyana","surface_form":"Guyana","offset":2377},{"uri":"Nizam_of_Hyderabad","surface_form":"Nizam","offset":2521},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"Kingdom","offset":2713},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth of Nations","offset":2740},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"Army","offset":2793},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"Airline","offset":2799},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":2866},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"Referendum","offset":2939},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexation","offset":3160},{"uri":"Aurangabad_Division","surface_form":"Aurangabad","offset":3299},{"uri":"Maharashtra","surface_form":"Maharashtra","offset":3325},{"uri":"Gulbarga_Division","surface_form":"Gulbarga","offset":3342},{"uri":"Karnataka","surface_form":"Karnataka","offset":3366},{"uri":"Andhra_Pradesh","surface_form":"Andhra Pradesh","offset":3398}]}
