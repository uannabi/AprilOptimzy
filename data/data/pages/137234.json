{"id":137234,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron","text":"A hadron, in particle physics, is any subatomic (smaller than the atom) particle or antiparticle which is made of quarks.\nHadrons are also characterized by being affected by the strong nuclear force, which holds them tightly together over a short distance. At the center of an atom is a nucleus (a cluster of protons and neutrons).\nMesons.\nThese are the most commonly discussed hadrons. There are many more: complete list of baryons, complete list of mesons.\nNot yet known to exist.\nThese are predictions for different ways quarks may be put together. There is not any solid evidence for them existing yet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":66},{"uri":"Antiparticle","surface_form":"antiparticle","offset":84},{"uri":"Quarks","surface_form":"quarks","offset":114},{"uri":"Strong_interaction","surface_form":"strong nuclear force","offset":178},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":287},{"uri":"List_of_baryons","surface_form":"complete list of baryons","offset":408},{"uri":"List_of_mesons","surface_form":"complete list of mesons","offset":434}]}
