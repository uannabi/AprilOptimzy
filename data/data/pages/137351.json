{"id":137351,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack","text":"e=\"preserve\">A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is a model for cryptanalysis which assumes that the attacker can choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key.\nModern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many applications, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose.\nAny cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks; this is a conservative approach to security.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptanalysis","surface_form":"cryptanalysis","offset":60},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plaintext","offset":124},{"uri":"Ciphertext","surface_form":"ciphertext","offset":180},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"secret key","offset":404},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public key cryptography","offset":667},{"uri":"Known-plaintext_attack","surface_form":"known-plaintext","offset":878}]}
