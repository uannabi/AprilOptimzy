{"id":137375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis","text":"=\"preserve\">In cryptography, linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.\nA variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested, including using multiple linear approximations or including non-linear expressions.\nEvidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":15},{"uri":"Cryptanalysis","surface_form":"cryptanalysis","offset":71},{"uri":"Affine_transformation","surface_form":"affine","offset":102},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":143},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"block cipher","offset":183},{"uri":"Stream_cipher","surface_form":"stream cipher","offset":201},{"uri":"Differential_cryptanalysis","surface_form":"differential cryptanalysis","offset":315},{"uri":"Linear_approximation","surface_form":"linear approximations","offset":428},{"uri":"Nonlinear_system","surface_form":"non-linear","offset":463}]}
