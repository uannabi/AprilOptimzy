{"id":137404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz","text":"Gorillaz are an animated British rock band. The band was invented by Damon Albarn, a member of the band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, who has worked on the comic book series \"Tank Girl\". Even though the band members are fictional, they have released a large amount of albums and music videos. The band's animated members are 2D, Noodle, Russell Hobbs, and Murdoc Niccals.\nThe band's genre is mostly a combination of alternative rock, alternative hip hop, and electronica. It also has elements of experimental, trip hop, dub, and psychedelic rock.\nLive performances.\nSince they are an animated group, they cannot perform live, like other bands can. At Gorillaz concerts, the real members of the band stand behind screens which show computer-generated images of the animated group performing.\nDespite the animated performances, the actual band members did go on tour as the Gorillaz (which the animated band referred to as \"that Gorillaz tribute band\"), playing at various venues across the states, headlining at Coachella. The live Gorillaz band played at the 2010 Glastonbury Festival, performing in place of u2 due to Bono's emergency back surgery. Nevertheless, they were a hit with the crowd.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":16},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":25},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":33},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":38},{"uri":"Damon_Albarn","surface_form":"Damon Albarn","offset":69},{"uri":"Blur","surface_form":"Blur","offset":104},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":151},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional","offset":215},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":263},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":274},{"uri":"Murdoc_Niccals","surface_form":"Murdoc Niccals","offset":351},{"uri":"Music_genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":378},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":411},{"uri":"Alternative_hip_hop","surface_form":"alternative hip hop","offset":429},{"uri":"Electronica","surface_form":"electronica","offset":454},{"uri":"Experimental_music","surface_form":"experimental","offset":491},{"uri":"Trip_hop","surface_form":"trip hop","offset":505},{"uri":"Dub_music","surface_form":"dub","offset":515},{"uri":"Psychedelic_rock","surface_form":"psychedelic rock","offset":524},{"uri":"Computer-generated","surface_form":"computer-generated","offset":726}]}
