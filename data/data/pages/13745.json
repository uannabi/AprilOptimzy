{"id":13745,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy","text":"The, is an 8-bit handheld video game console, first released in Japan in April 1989. It was later released in North America in July 1989 and then in Europe in September 1990. It is Nintendo's first handheld. The Game Boy is also the first portable console to use game cartridges, meaning the games are interchangeable. The Game Boy family eventually extended to include the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Micro.\nThe Game Boy has a green screen that displays four shades of dark green (gray for the Game Boy Pocket). Like the NES, the Game Boy has four buttons and a cross-shaped direction pad. The console has a single speaker, and it can be used with stereo headphones. As many as four Game Boys can be connected together with the Game Boy Link Cable.\nThe Game Boy was invented by Gunpei Yokoi, who also was responsible for creating the unsuccessful Virtual Boy and the successful Game & Watch games.\nRecently, the Game Boy was compared to all Nintendo handhelds and systems released between 1989 and 2016 to see how long each one's battery life lasted, and the Game Boy beat all the other systems with 30 hours of battery life. The Game Boy provided the most game play at its time, and currently still does.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Handheld_game_console","surface_form":"handheld video game console","offset":17},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":181},{"uri":"Handheld_game_console","surface_form":"handheld","offset":198},{"uri":"Portable","surface_form":"portable","offset":239},{"uri":"Cartridge_(electronics)","surface_form":"cartridges","offset":268},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Color","surface_form":"Game Boy Color","offset":374},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance","offset":390},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance_SP","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance SP","offset":408},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Micro","surface_form":"Game Boy Micro","offset":432},{"uri":"Shade","surface_form":"shade","offset":499},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Pocket","surface_form":"Game Boy Pocket","offset":534},{"uri":"Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"NES","offset":561},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":615},{"uri":"Speaker","surface_form":"speaker","offset":655},{"uri":"Stereo","surface_form":"stereo","offset":688},{"uri":"Headphones","surface_form":"headphones","offset":695},{"uri":"Gunpei_Yokoi","surface_form":"Gunpei Yokoi","offset":818},{"uri":"Virtual_Boy","surface_form":"Virtual Boy","offset":887},{"uri":"Game_%26amp%3B_Watch","surface_form":"Game & Watch","offset":918}]}
