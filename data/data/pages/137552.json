{"id":137552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalwil","text":"Thalwil is a municipality in the district of Horgen in the canton of Z\u00FCrich in Switzerland.\nHistory.\nEarly Middle Ages Thalwil was Alemannic farmland.\nIn the Middle Ages, most income was made in farming, vineyards and a small amount of fishing on the lake.\nThalwil also has the oldest wood corporation in the Canton of Zurich, the \"Bannegg-Waldung\". It was first mentioned in 1483.\nModern day Thalwil.\nToday, the economy of Thalwil is mostly some small and medium-sized businesses, and a wide range of shops. Most of the shops are located around Gotthardstrasse- the town centre.\nThe main source of Thalwil's wealth lies with its 7,000 commuters. These people live in Thalwil, but work in Zurich city. Today, Thalwil has left most of its farming past behind in exchange for a town of commuters, with its public transportation links, low tax and good quality of life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipalities","surface_form":"municipality","offset":13},{"uri":"Horgen_(district)","surface_form":"Horgen","offset":45},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":59},{"uri":"Zurich_(canton)","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":69},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":79},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":107},{"uri":"Alamanni","surface_form":"Alemannic","offset":131},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":141},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":176},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"vineyards","offset":204},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":236},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":251},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":285},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"corporation","offset":290},{"uri":"Canton_of_Zurich","surface_form":"Canton of Zurich","offset":309},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":413},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"businesses","offset":470},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":502},{"uri":"Commuting_residents","surface_form":"commuters","offset":636},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich_City","surface_form":"Zurich city","offset":689},{"uri":"Transportation","surface_form":"transportation","offset":811},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":837}]}
