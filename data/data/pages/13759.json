They are not very popular, but they have a loyal group of fans. Their music has influenced a lot of bands and styles of music. King Crimson are most well known for their first album, In the Court of the Crimson King, which helped create progressive rock. Only one person has been in the band since they started, guitarist Robert Fripp. Right now, the people in the band are Robert Fripp, Mel Collins, Gavin Harrison, Jakko Jakszyk, Bill Rieflin, Jeremy Stacey, Tony Levin, and Pat Mastelotto.\n1960's.\nIn 1967, drummer Michael Giles and his brother, Peter, a bass guitar player, started a band with Robert Fripp. They recorded one album called The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp. This album did not do very well, and a lot of critics wrote bad reviews of it. After this, Ian Mcdonald joined playing keyboards, reeds, and woodwind instruments. Ian McDonald's friend, Peter Sinfield, joined to write lyrics, and Greg Lake replaced Peter Giles on bass guitar. Then they bought a mellotron, which helped them sound more like classical music. They changed their name to King Crimson, and did their first show in Hyde Park, London in 1969. Their first CD, In the Court of the Crimson King, was a huge success. Their original style impressed fans and critics.\n1970's.\nMicheal Giles and Ian Mcdonald left the band to do solo work. The three of them still in the band, Robert Fripp, Peter Sinfield, and Greg Lake, released the single \"Catfood/Groon\". On the next album, woodwind player Mel Collins, singer Gordon Haskell, and Peter Giles all helped record a few songs with the band. King Crimson released their second album, In the Wake of Poseidon, in 1970. It was not very popular because it sounded too much like the first album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Progressive_rock","surface_form":"progressive rock","offset":32},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":49},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":70},{"uri":"1969","surface_form":"1969","offset":81},{"uri":"Progressive_rock","surface_form":"progressive rock","offset":117},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":154},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":169},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":186},{"uri":"20th_century_classical_music","surface_form":"experimental music","offset":202},{"uri":"In_the_Court_of_the_Crimson_King","surface_form":"In the Court of the Crimson King","offset":420},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":549},{"uri":"Robert_Fripp","surface_form":"Robert Fripp","offset":559},{"uri":"Tony_Levin","surface_form":"Tony Levin","offset":698},{"uri":"Pat_Mastelotto","surface_form":"Pat Mastelotto","offset":714},{"uri":"1967","surface_form":"1967","offset":741},{"uri":"Michael_Giles","surface_form":"Michael Giles","offset":755},{"uri":"Peter_Giles","surface_form":"Peter","offset":786},{"uri":"Robert_Fripp","surface_form":"Robert Fripp","offset":835},{"uri":"The_Cheerful_Insanity_of_Giles%2C_Giles_and_Fripp","surface_form":"The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp","offset":880},{"uri":"Ian_Mcdonald","surface_form":"Ian Mcdonald","offset":1020},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboards","offset":1048},{"uri":"Reeds","surface_form":"reeds","offset":1059},{"uri":"Woodwind","surface_form":"woodwind","offset":1070},{"uri":"Peter_Sinfield","surface_form":"Peter Sinfield","offset":1115},{"uri":"Greg_Lake","surface_form":"Greg Lake","offset":1159},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"mellotron","offset":1225},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1367},{"uri":"In_the_Court_of_the_Crimson_King","surface_form":"In the Court of the Crimson King","offset":1399},{"uri":"Mel_Collins","surface_form":"Mel Collins","offset":1726},{"uri":"Gordon_Haskell","surface_form":"Gordon Haskell","offset":1746},{"uri":"In_the_Wake_of_Poseidon","surface_form":"In the Wake of Poseidon","offset":1865},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":1893}]}
