Barricelli, who was independently rich, held an unpaid residency at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in 1953, 1954. and 1956. He later worked at the University of California, Los Angeles, at Vanderbilt University (until 1964), in the Department of Genetics of the University of Washington, Seattle (until 1968) and then at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Oslo. Barricelli published in a variety of fields including virus genetics, DNA, theoretical biology, space flight, theoretical physics and mathematical language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbiogenesis","surface_form":"symbiogenesis","offset":135},{"uri":"Artificial_life","surface_form":"artificial life","offset":192},{"uri":"Institute_for_Advanced_Study","surface_form":"Institute for Advanced Study","offset":290},{"uri":"Princeton%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Princeton, New Jersey","offset":322},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Los_Angeles","surface_form":"University of California, Los Angeles","offset":392},{"uri":"Vanderbilt_University","surface_form":"Vanderbilt University","offset":434},{"uri":"University_of_Washington","surface_form":"University of Washington","offset":507},{"uri":"University_of_Oslo","surface_form":"University of Oslo","offset":599},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":673},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":689},{"uri":"Theoretical_biology","surface_form":"theoretical biology","offset":694},{"uri":"Space_flight","surface_form":"space flight","offset":715},{"uri":"Theoretical_physics","surface_form":"theoretical physics","offset":729},{"uri":"Mathematical_language","surface_form":"mathematical language","offset":753}]}
