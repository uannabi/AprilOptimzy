{"id":137616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Rechenberg","text":"\"Ingo Rechenberg (born January 20 1934 in Berlin) is a German computer scientist and professor. Rechenberg is a pioneer of the fields of evolutionary computation and artificial evolution. In the 1960s and 1970s he invented a highly influential set of optimization methods known as evolution strategies (from German \"Evolutionsstrategie\"). His group successfully applied the new algorithms to challenging problems such as aerodynamic wing design. These were the first serious technical applications of artificial evolution, an important subset of the still growing field of bionics.\nRechenberg was educated at the Technical University of Berlin and at the University of Cambridge. Since 1972 he has been a full professor at the Technical University of Berlin, where he is heading the Department of Bionics and Evolution Techniques.\nHis awards include the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Evolutionary Programming Society (US, 1995) and the Evolutionary Computation Pioneer Award of the IEEE Neural Networks Society (US, 2002). In 1954, Rechenberg also became world champion in the field of model airplanes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"January_20","surface_form":"January 20","offset":23},{"uri":"1934","surface_form":"1934","offset":34},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":42},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":55},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer scientist","offset":62},{"uri":"Evolutionary_computation","surface_form":"evolutionary computation","offset":137},{"uri":"Artificial_evolution","surface_form":"artificial evolution","offset":166},{"uri":"Evolution_strategies","surface_form":"evolution strategies","offset":281},{"uri":"Aerodynamic","surface_form":"aerodynamic","offset":421},{"uri":"Artificial_evolution","surface_form":"artificial evolution","offset":501},{"uri":"Bionics","surface_form":"bionics","offset":573},{"uri":"Technical_University_of_Berlin","surface_form":"Technical University of Berlin","offset":613},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":655},{"uri":"Model_airplanes","surface_form":"model airplanes","offset":1090}]}
