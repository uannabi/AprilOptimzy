{"id":137621,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrometer","text":"=\"preserve\">A penetrometer is a device to test the strength of a material.\nIt is often used on soil. The penetrometer is dropped on soil or it is pressed against soil to measure how deep a hole it makes. This is a way to decide if soil is strong enough to build a road on. Scientists can use a penetrometer to measure how much moisture is in soil. Penetrometers are used on space probes such as the Cassini-Huygens probe, to measure the amount of moisture in soil on other planets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":65},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":95},{"uri":"Moisture","surface_form":"moisture","offset":327},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"space probe","offset":374},{"uri":"Cassini-Huygens","surface_form":"Cassini-Huygens","offset":399}]}
