{"id":137635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystream","text":"e=\"preserve\">In cryptography, a keystream is a stream of random or pseudorandom characters that are combined with a plaintext message to produce an encrypted message (the ciphertext).\nThe \"characters\" in the keystream can be bits, bytes, numbers or actual characters like A-Z depending on the usage case.\nUsually each character in the keystream is either added, subtracted or XORed with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, using modular arithmetic.\nKeystreams are used in the one-time pad cipher and in most stream ciphers. Block ciphers can also be used to produce keystreams. For example, the CTR mode (also known as Integer Counter Mode (ICM)) is a block mode that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher.\nExample.\nIn this simple example we will use only the English alphabet of 26 characters from a-z, therefore we will not encrypt numbers, commas, spaces and other symbols. As we have only 26 characters the random numbers in the keystream have to be at least between 0 and 25.\nTo encrypt we add the keystream numbers to the plaintext. And to decrypt we subtract the same keystream numbers from the ciphertext to get the plaintext.\nIf a ciphertext number becomes larger than 25 we wrap it to a value between 0-25. I.e. 26 becomes 0 and 27 becomes 1 and so on. (Such wrapping is called modular arithmetic.)\nHere the plaintext message \"attack at dawn\" is combined by addition with the keystream \"kjcngmlhylyu\" and produces the ciphertext \"kcvniwlabluh\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":16},{"uri":"Stream_(computing)","surface_form":"stream","offset":47},{"uri":"Randomness","surface_form":"random","offset":57},{"uri":"Pseudorandomness","surface_form":"pseudorandom","offset":67},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plaintext","offset":116},{"uri":"Ciphertext","surface_form":"ciphertext","offset":171},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":225},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":231},{"uri":"Numbers","surface_form":"numbers","offset":238},{"uri":"Character_(computing)","surface_form":"characters","offset":256},{"uri":"Exclusive_or","surface_form":"XORed","offset":376},{"uri":"Modular_arithmetic","surface_form":"modular arithmetic","offset":449},{"uri":"One-time_pad","surface_form":"one-time pad","offset":496},{"uri":"Stream_cipher","surface_form":"stream cipher","offset":528},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"Block cipher","offset":544},{"uri":"Block_cipher_modes_of_operation","surface_form":"block mode","offset":672},{"uri":"Modular_arithmetic","surface_form":"modular arithmetic","offset":1360}]}
