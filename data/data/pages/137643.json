Above the water lilly are four stars and a three-leaf clover of jute leaves. The water lily is the country's national flower, and is representative of the many rivers that run through Bangladesh. Rice represents its presence as the staple food of Bangladesh, and for the agriculture of that nation. The four stars represent the four founding principles that were originally enshrined in the first constitution of Bangladesh in 1972: Nationalism, Secularism, Socialism, and Democracy.\n\"The national emblem of the Republic is the national flower Shapla (Nymphaea pubescens) resting on water, having on each side an ear of paddy and being surmounted by three connected leaves of jute with two stars on each side of the leaves.\" - Constitution of Bangladesh Article 4(3)\nThe Government of Bangladesh has adopted Education, Nationalism and Democracy as its \"National Motto\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":23},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":76},{"uri":"Nymphaeaceae","surface_form":"White water lily","offset":109},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":160},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":205},{"uri":"Jute","surface_form":"jute","offset":238},{"uri":"Nymphaea_pubescens","surface_form":"water lily","offset":255},{"uri":"Rivers","surface_form":"rivers","offset":334},{"uri":"Secularism","surface_form":"Secularism","offset":620},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"Socialism","offset":632},{"uri":"Nymphaea_pubescens","surface_form":"Nymphaea pubescens","offset":726},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"Education","offset":982},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"Nationalism","offset":993},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"Democracy","offset":1009}]}
