{"id":137652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_schedule","text":"In cryptography, the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers, where the decryption of data is done in \"rounds\". The general setup of each \"round\" is the same, except for some hard-coded parameters and a part of the cipher key, called a subkey. A key schedule is an algorithm that, given the key, calculates the subkeys for these \"rounds\".\nNotes.\nKnudsen and Mathiassen (2004) give some experimental evidence that indicate that the key schedule plays a part in providing strength against linear and differential cryptanalysis. For toy Feistel ciphers, it was observed that those with complex and well-designed key schedules can reach a uniform distribution for the probabilities of differentials and linear hulls faster than those with poorly-designed key schedules.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":3},{"uri":"Product_cipher","surface_form":"product cipher","offset":31},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":69},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"decryption","offset":88},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"cipher key","offset":231},{"uri":"Lars_Knudsen","surface_form":"Knudsen","offset":362},{"uri":"Linear_cryptanalysis","surface_form":"linear","offset":503},{"uri":"Differential_cryptanalysis","surface_form":"differential cryptanalysis","offset":514},{"uri":"Feistel_cipher","surface_form":"Feistel cipher","offset":550},{"uri":"Differential_cryptanalysis","surface_form":"differentials","offset":697},{"uri":"Linear_cryptanalysis","surface_form":"linear hulls","offset":715}]}
