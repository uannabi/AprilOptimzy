{"id":137706,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_size_(cryptography)","text":"In modern cryptography, symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The length of this bit string is the block size. Both the input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are the same length; the output cannot be shorter than the input \u2013 this is logically required by the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible \u2013 and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input.\nThe DES is using a block size of 64 bits (8 bytes) while the AES is using a block size of 128 bits (16 bytes). Rijndael, supports block sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, although the extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard.\nA few block ciphers, such as RC5, support a variable block size. The Luby-Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher.\nFew ciphers have unusual block sizes, for example the 3-Way block cipher have an unusual block size of 96 bits (12 bytes).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":10},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric key","offset":24},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":38},{"uri":"Stream_cipher","surface_form":"stream cipher","offset":73},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"block cipher","offset":92},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"Block cipher","offset":107},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":157},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plaintext","offset":228},{"uri":"Ciphertext","surface_form":"ciphertext","offset":251},{"uri":"Pigeonhole_principle","surface_form":"Pigeonhole principle","offset":364},{"uri":"Data_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"DES","offset":512},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":552},{"uri":"Advanced_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"AES","offset":569},{"uri":"Rijndael_key_schedule","surface_form":"Rijndael","offset":619},{"uri":"Advanced_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"AES","offset":732},{"uri":"RC5","surface_form":"RC5","offset":775},{"uri":"Luby-Rackoff","surface_form":"Luby-Rackoff","offset":815},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":828},{"uri":"Richard_Outerbridge","surface_form":"Outerbridge","offset":849},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":861},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":922},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":934},{"uri":"3-Way","surface_form":"3-Way block cipher","offset":984},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":1045}]}
