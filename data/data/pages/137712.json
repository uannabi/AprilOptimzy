{"id":137712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance","text":"=\"preserve\">A security clearance is a status granted (approved) to individuals allowing them access to classified information, e.g. state secrets. It is something like permission or a license. The term \"security clearance\" is also sometimes used in private organizations that have a formal process of selecting employees to access \"sensitive information\".\nA clearance by itself is normally not sufficient to gain access; the organization must determine that the cleared person \"needs to know\" the information. No one is supposed to be granted access to classified information only because of rank, position, or a security clearance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classified_information","surface_form":"classified information","offset":103},{"uri":"Secret","surface_form":"secret","offset":138}]}
