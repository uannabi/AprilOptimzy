{"id":13772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hearing is one of the five senses. Ears detect vibrations in the air. These vibrations are sounds. Most animal<nowiki/>s can hear. Most land vertebrate<nowiki/>s hear through ear<nowiki/>s. Fish hear in several different ways. Many use their swim bladder to hear, and many use their lateral line.\nIn mammals, sound travels through three main parts of the ear to be heard. These are the outer, middle and inner ear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"senses","offset":40},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"Ear","offset":48},{"uri":"Vibration","surface_form":"vibration","offset":60},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":78},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":104},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":117},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":154},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":188},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"Fish","offset":203},{"uri":"Swim_bladder","surface_form":"swim bladder","offset":255},{"uri":"Lateral_line","surface_form":"lateral line","offset":296},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":313}]}
