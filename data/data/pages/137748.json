{"id":137748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS","text":"An SMS, or short messaging service is a type of communication used in mobile phones. They are more commonly called 'text messages'. With SMS, someone can send text to another person.\nSMS can be slow, as a network gives priority to phone calls, and only carries text messages after calls are handled. There is also a limit of 160 characters that a text message can send. Longer messages than this will be sent as multiple messages, where the sender has to pay for each individual message.\nText messages are often sent between phone users when an actual phone call is not wanted or needed. For example, they may be used in a situation where silence is needed, or to send something private that one person does not want people near them to hear. Message price depends on the phone network of the user. Some mobile phone plans allow for unlimited texting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":48},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":70},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":159}]}
