{"id":137777,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_R._Schrock","text":"Richard Royce Schrock (born on January 4, 1945) is an American Professor of Chemistry. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2005 for his work on the metathesis reaction used in organic chemistry.\nProfessor Schrock was born in Berne, Indiana, and went to Mission Bay High School in San Diego, California. He was given a B.A. degree in 1967 from the University of California, Riverside and a Ph.D., in 1971, from Harvard University. At Harvard he was a student of J. A. Osborn. Between 1971 and 1972, he studied at the University of Cambridge with Lord Jack Lewis. In 1972, he began working for George Parshall in the Experimental Station of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company in Wilmington, Delaware. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975 and became a professor in 1980.\nSchrock now works as the Frederick G. Keyes Professor of Chemistry, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has worked there since 1989. Schrock is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, National Academy of Sciences and was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University in 2007.\nHe married Nancy Carlson in 1971 and has two children, Andrew and Eric. Nancy Schrock is the Thomas F. Peterson, Jr. Conservator of Special Collections for the MIT Libraries. The family live in Winchester, Massachusetts.\nNobel prize.\nIn 2005 Professor Schrock received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Robert H. Grubbs and Yves Chauvin, for his work on olefin metathesis, which is a method of organic synthesis. Schrock was the first scientist to make sense of 'black box' olefin metathesis. Olefin Metathesis is used when making petroleum and reduces the amount of dirty waste.\nProfessor Schrock's work is continuing with metathesis as well as projects such as dinitrogen fixation and single molecule catalysts which make ammonia from dinitrogen, similar to nitrogenase enzymes in biology.\nSchrock carbenes are named after Schrock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"January_4","surface_form":"January 4","offset":31},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":42},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":54},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"Professor","offset":63},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"Chemistry","offset":76},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":106},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":122},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":135},{"uri":"Metathesis_reaction","surface_form":"metathesis reaction","offset":160},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":188},{"uri":"Berne%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Berne, Indiana","offset":237},{"uri":"San_Diego%2C_California","surface_form":"San Diego, California","offset":292},{"uri":"B.A.","surface_form":"B.A.","offset":330},{"uri":"Degree_(school)","surface_form":"degree","offset":335},{"uri":"1967","surface_form":"1967","offset":345},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Riverside","surface_form":"University of California, Riverside","offset":359},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":401},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":411},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":422},{"uri":"J._A._Osborn","surface_form":"J.
