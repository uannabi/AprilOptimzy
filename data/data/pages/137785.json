{"id":137785,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"All your base are belong to us\" (often shortened to \"All Your Base\", \"AYBABTU\", or simply \"AYB\") is a broken English phrase that began an internet phenomenon in 2001 and 2002, with the use of a Flash animation. The phrase is taken from the first part of a European Sega Mega Drive version of the video game \"Zero Wing\", made in Japan by Toaplan. The words in the game were translated into English so quickly that they did not make very much sense. The words \"All your base are belong to us'\" were at first popular on the Something Awful message forums.\nNotable media references.\nThe phrase and similar phrases from the game has been shown in articles, books, comics, clothing, movies, radio shows, songs, television shows, video games, webcomics, and websites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Broken_English","surface_form":"broken English","offset":116},{"uri":"Internet_phenomenon","surface_form":"internet phenomenon","offset":152},{"uri":"Flash_animation","surface_form":"Flash animation","offset":208},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":270},{"uri":"Sega_Mega_Drive","surface_form":"Sega Mega Drive","offset":279},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":310},{"uri":"Zero_Wing","surface_form":"Zero Wing","offset":322},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":342},{"uri":"Toaplan","surface_form":"Toaplan","offset":351},{"uri":"Something_Awful","surface_form":"Something Awful","offset":535}]}
