{"id":13784,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race","text":"Caucasoid was a word for a person from Europe, West Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, North Africa, or the Horn of Africa. The group of these persons was called \"Caucasoid race\" or Caucasian race. In former times, many people divided human beings into three races. These races were called \"Caucasoid\", \"Mongoloid\", and \"Negroid\". Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong.\nGerman anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752 \u2013 1840) invented the name \"Caucasian race\" because he saw a connection to the Caucasus Mountains.\nIn the United States, white people are often called \"Caucasian\". But the \"Caucasian race\" included people with a skin from white to dark brown.\nPictures.\nSome persons in the pictures have white skin, others have brown skin. But in former times, scientists saw all persons in the pictures as members of the \"Caucasian race\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":16},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":27},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":39},{"uri":"West_Asia","surface_form":"West Asia","offset":47},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":58},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":70},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":84},{"uri":"Horn_of_Africa","surface_form":"Horn of Africa","offset":105},{"uri":"Human_beings","surface_form":"human beings","offset":232},{"uri":"Historical_definitions_of_race","surface_form":"races","offset":256},{"uri":"Mongoloid","surface_form":"Mongoloid","offset":301},{"uri":"Negroid","surface_form":"Negroid","offset":318},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":394},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":468},{"uri":"Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach","surface_form":"Johann Friedrich Blumenbach","offset":483},{"uri":"Caucasus_Mountains","surface_form":"Caucasus Mountains","offset":595},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":622},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white people","offset":637}]}
