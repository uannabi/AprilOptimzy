{"id":137849,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep","text":"Jeep is a brand of American automobiles that is a division of FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group, LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The former Chrysler Corporation acquired the Jeep brand, along with the remaining assets of its owner American Motors, in 1987. Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off-road vehicles, but has also included pickup trucks in the past.\nThe first civilian models were produced in 1945. It inspired a number of other light utility vehicles, such as the Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations. In 2007 Jeep began manufacturing crossover SUVs with its Compass and Patriot models. This led to the 2013 Jeep Cherokee midsize crossover.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":19},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":28},{"uri":"Division_(business)","surface_form":"division","offset":50},{"uri":"Chrysler","surface_form":"FCA US LLC","offset":62},{"uri":"Fiat_Chrysler_Automobiles","surface_form":"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles","offset":134},{"uri":"American_Motors","surface_form":"American Motors","offset":263},{"uri":"Sport_utility_vehicle","surface_form":"sport utility vehicle","offset":337},{"uri":"Off-road_vehicle","surface_form":"off-road vehicle","offset":364},{"uri":"Pickup_truck","surface_form":"pickup truck","offset":405},{"uri":"Light_utility_vehicle","surface_form":"light utility vehicle","offset":511},{"uri":"Land_Rover","surface_form":"Land Rover","offset":547},{"uri":"Crossover","surface_form":"crossover SUVs","offset":698},{"uri":"Jeep_Cherokee","surface_form":"Jeep Cherokee","offset":771}]}
