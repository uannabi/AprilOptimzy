{"id":13794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Holland","text":"South Holland is a province in the west of the Netherlands. It is called \"Zuid-Holland\" in Dutch. It is surrounded by the North Sea and the provinces North Holland, Utrecht, Guelders, North Brabant, and Zeeland.\n3.45 million people live there. The biggest cities are Rotterdam and The Hague. The Hague is the capital of the province. The Hague is also the administrative capital of the Netherlands. That means that the parliament is there.\nRotterdam has the largest port of Europe. Leiden, Gouda, and Delft have town centers with many old buildings. Zoetermeer is a quite new city. Most of it was built in the 1970s. Another important city is Dordrecht.\nIn South Holland there are some typical Dutch landscapes. Near Leiden there is a region that is known as the \"Bollenstreek\" (\"bulb district\"). In springtime many large fields with flowers can be found here. These fields are called \"bulb fields\". Near Rotterdam there is a small village called Kinderdijk with 19 windmills near each other.\nThe area south of The Hague is called Westland. Here are many greenhouses.\nThe south of the province has many islands. The largest of them are Voorne-Putten, Goeree-Overflakkee, IJsselmonde, the Hoeksche Waard and the island of Dordrecht. These big islands are connected by bridges and/or tunnels.\nThe most important rivers and other bodies of waters are Nieuwe Maas, Nieuwe Waterweg, Oude Maas, Haringvliet, and Hollands Diep.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":47},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":122},{"uri":"North_Holland","surface_form":"North Holland","offset":150},{"uri":"Utrecht_(province)","surface_form":"Utrecht","offset":165},{"uri":"Guelders","surface_form":"Guelders","offset":174},{"uri":"North_Brabant","surface_form":"North Brabant","offset":184},{"uri":"Zeeland_(province)","surface_form":"Zeeland","offset":203},{"uri":"Rotterdam","surface_form":"Rotterdam","offset":267},{"uri":"The_Hague","surface_form":"The Hague","offset":281},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":419},{"uri":"Leiden","surface_form":"Leiden","offset":482},{"uri":"Gouda%2C_South_Holland","surface_form":"Gouda","offset":490},{"uri":"Delft","surface_form":"Delft","offset":501},{"uri":"Zoetermeer","surface_form":"Zoetermeer","offset":550},{"uri":"Dordrecht","surface_form":"Dordrecht","offset":643},{"uri":"Kinderdijk","surface_form":"Kinderdijk","offset":947},{"uri":"Westland","surface_form":"Westland","offset":1031},{"uri":"Greenhouse","surface_form":"greenhouse","offset":1055},{"uri":"Voorne-Putten","surface_form":"Voorne-Putten","offset":1136},{"uri":"Goeree-Overflakkee","surface_form":"Goeree-Overflakkee","offset":1151},{"uri":"IJsselmonde","surface_form":"IJsselmonde","offset":1171},{"uri":"Hoeksche_Waard","surface_form":"Hoeksche Waard","offset":1188},{"uri":"Dordrecht","surface_form":"Dordrecht","offset":1221},{"uri":"Nieuwe_Maas","surface_form":"Nieuwe Maas","offset":1348},{"uri":"Nieuwe_Waterweg","surface_form":"Nieuwe Waterweg","offset":1361},{"uri":"Oude_Maas","surface_form":"Oude Maas","offset":1378},{"uri":"Haringvliet","surface_form":"Haringvliet","offset":1389},{"uri":"Hollands_Diep","surface_form":"Hollands Diep","offset":1406}]}
