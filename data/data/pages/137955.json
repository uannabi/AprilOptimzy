{"id":137955,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\" is a paper published by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory. It is one of the \"foundational treatments\" (\"primitives\") of modern cryptography. It is also a proof that all theoretically \"unbreakable\" (\"un-crack-able\") ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad encryption algorithm.\nShannon published an earlier version of this research in the classified report \"A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography\", Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories.\nIn 1948, Shannon published his great paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" which is considered one of the founding works of the field of information theory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Claude_Shannon","surface_form":"Claude Shannon","offset":79},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":105},{"uri":"Information_theory","surface_form":"information theory","offset":140},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theoretically","offset":270},{"uri":"One-time_pad","surface_form":"one-time pad","offset":363},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":376},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":387},{"uri":"Classified_information","surface_form":"classified","offset":459},{"uri":"A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","surface_form":"A Mathematical Theory of Communication","offset":621},{"uri":"Information_theory","surface_form":"information theory","offset":723}]}
