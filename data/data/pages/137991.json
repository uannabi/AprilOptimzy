{"id":137991,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dean","text":"Hurricane Dean was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005. Also, it made the third strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall. Dean moved west-northwest from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean Sea. It became into a very strong hurricane, reaching Category\u00A05 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before moving south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm moved onto land on the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula on August\u00A021 as a Category\u00A05 storm. It moved across the peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, as a weakened storm, but still a hurricane. It strengthened for a short time before making a second landfall in Veracruz near Tecolutla, Mexico, on August 22. Dean slowly moved to the northwest, weakening into a low pressure area which dissipated over the southwestern United States.\nThe hurricane's strong winds, waves, rains and storm surge caused over 45\u00A0deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.5\u00A0billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean severely damaged agricultural crops, especially those of Martinique and Jamaica. When it reached Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category\u00A05 storm, but it missed large cities and its exceptional Category\u00A05 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category\u00A02 storm. Because of the damage, the name \"Dean\" was retired, and will not be used again for a tropical cyclone.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":33},{"uri":"2007_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2007 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":57},{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic hurricane","offset":115},{"uri":"Hurricane_Wilma","surface_form":"Hurricane Wilma","offset":140},{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2005","offset":159},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":271},{"uri":"Saint_Lucia_Channel","surface_form":"Saint Lucia Channel","offset":298},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":331},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","offset":420},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":474},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula","offset":529},{"uri":"Bay_of_Campeche","surface_form":"Bay of Campeche","offset":629},{"uri":"Veracruz","surface_form":"Veracruz","offset":758},{"uri":"Tecolutla","surface_form":"Tecolutla","offset":772},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":783},{"uri":"Low_pressure_area","surface_form":"low pressure area","offset":858},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"US","offset":1064},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":1115},{"uri":"Martinique","surface_form":"Martinique","offset":1223},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":1238}]}
