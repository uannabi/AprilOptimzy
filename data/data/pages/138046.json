{"id":138046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair","text":"In mathematics, an \"ordered pair\" is a collection of two objects, where one of the objects is first (the \"first coordinate\" or \"left projection\"), and the other is second (the \"second coordinate\" or \"right projection\"). An ordered pair where the first coordinate is formula_1 and the second coordinate is formula_1 is usually written formula_1 (sometimes it is written formula_1). If formula_1 is different from formula_1, then the ordered pair formula_1 is different from the ordered pair formula_1 - this is why it is called \"ordered\".\nProperties.\nThis means that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if: the first coordinates of the pairs are equal, and also the second coordinates of the pairs are equal.\nDefinition.\nKazimierz Kuratowski was the first person to make this definition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"Properties","offset":538},{"uri":"Kuratowski","surface_form":"Kazimierz Kuratowski","offset":724}]}
