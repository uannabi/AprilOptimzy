{"id":138085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(cipher)","text":"In cryptography, Square (sometimes written SQUARE) is a block cipher invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. The design was published in 1997.\nSQUARE is a predecessor to the Rijndael algorithm, which has been adopted in 2001 as the Advanced Encryption Standard by the U.S. government.\nSquare was introduced together with a new form of cryptanalysis discovered by Lars Knudsen, called the \"Square attack\".\nThe structure of Square is a substitution-permutation network with eight rounds, operating on 128-bit block size and using a 128-bit key size.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":3},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"block cipher","offset":56},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invented","offset":69},{"uri":"Joan_Daemen","surface_form":"Joan Daemen","offset":81},{"uri":"Vincent_Rijmen","surface_form":"Vincent Rijmen","offset":97},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":117},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"published","offset":128},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":141},{"uri":"Rijndael_key_schedule","surface_form":"Rijndael","offset":178},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":224},{"uri":"Advanced_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"Advanced Encryption Standard","offset":236},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. government","offset":272},{"uri":"Cryptanalysis","surface_form":"cryptanalysis","offset":339},{"uri":"Lars_Knudsen","surface_form":"Lars Knudsen","offset":367},{"uri":"Square_attack","surface_form":"Square attack","offset":393},{"uri":"Substitution-permutation_network","surface_form":"substitution-permutation network","offset":438},{"uri":"Block_size_(cryptography)","surface_form":"block size","offset":511},{"uri":"Key_size","surface_form":"key size","offset":542}]}
