Some of these used a large circle containing two dots for eyes and a curve for the mouth. The most well-known smiley face was created in 1963 by Harvey Ball for an insurance company in Massachusetts.

The two used the \"smiley face\" on buttons as well to decorate coffee mugs, t-shirts, bumper stickers and many other things. They also used the phrase \"Have a happy day\" (which was the idea of Gyula Bogar). \"Smiley\" buttons were very popular from the 1970s onwards.\nSmileyworld Ltd.\nSmiley is a brand developed by Franklin Loufrani since 1971.

So that they could show happiness or fun in an easy way, people started making little smiling faces using some of the symbols on the keyboard. A keyboard smiley has a colon \":\" for the eyes, a hyphen \"-\" for the nose, and a parenthesis \")\" for the mouth. Some people make the smiley without the hyphen for a nose. The \"smileys\" that are made in this way are sideways.\nWhen you tilt your head to the left, it looks like a smiling face.\nSmileys are usually used as part of a written message, but sometimes a smiley is just sent on its own to say \"I am happy with your last message.\" Smileys are a useful way to show feelings to someone who cannot see the face of person sending the message.\nSome people use different symbols, or do not use a nose, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Smile","surface_form":"smiling","offset":75},{"uri":"Email","surface_form":"email","offset":292},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":1045},{"uri":"Mug","surface_form":"mug","offset":1052},{"uri":"T-shirt","surface_form":"t-shirt","offset":1058},{"uri":"Bumper","surface_form":"bumper","offset":1068},{"uri":"Sticker","surface_form":"sticker","offset":1075},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":3088}]}
