{"id":13814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)","text":"Cream was a British rock band in the late 1960s. They played and recorded together from 1966 to 1968. The members of the group were Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker. They were called a power trio, as there were three musicians, who all played essential roles in the band. Their sound of heavy blues-rock was a great influence on many other bands. They were one of the most skilled rock bands of all time; the guitarist and bassist were capable of soloing at the same time. Clapton helped pioneer the use of the wah-wah pedal and played a famous guitar called The Fool. Clapton developed what he called the \"woman tone\" on his guitar, while Bruce played a fretless bass guitar, and Baker played unusual rhythms on drums to create the band's distinctive sound.\nCream's hit records included the songs \"Strange Brew\", \"Sunshine Of Your Love\" and \"White Room\". Their last album, titled \"Goodbye\", included a song called \"Badge\", co-written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison of The Beatles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":12},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock","offset":20},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":25},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":42},{"uri":"Eric_Clapton","surface_form":"Eric Clapton","offset":132},{"uri":"Jack_Bruce","surface_form":"Jack Bruce","offset":146},{"uri":"Ginger_Baker","surface_form":"Ginger Baker","offset":162},{"uri":"Power_trio","surface_form":"power trio","offset":195},{"uri":"Essential","surface_form":"essential","offset":253},{"uri":"Hit_record","surface_form":"hit record","offset":777},{"uri":"Album_(music)","surface_form":"album","offset":877},{"uri":"George_Harrison","surface_form":"George Harrison","offset":965},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":984}]}
