{"id":138288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9chamel_sauce","text":"B\u00E9chamel sauce (in English, in French, in Italian), also known as white sauce, is a basic mother sauce. It can be used to make other sauces, such as Mornay sauce, which is B\u00E9chamel and cheese. This basic sauce is usually made today by whisking scalded milk gradually into a white flour-butter \"roux\" (equal part clarified butter and flour), though it can also be made by whisking a kneaded flour-butter beurre mani\u00E9 into scalded milk. The thickness of the final sauce depends on the proportions of milk and flour. Escoffier adds salt and an onion stuck with a clove.\nIt is named after Louis de B\u00E9chamel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mother_sauce","surface_form":"mother sauce","offset":90},{"uri":"Mornay_sauce","surface_form":"Mornay sauce","offset":149},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":185},{"uri":"Whisk","surface_form":"whisk","offset":235},{"uri":"Scalded_milk","surface_form":"scalded milk","offset":244},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":280},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":286},{"uri":"Roux","surface_form":"roux","offset":294},{"uri":"Knead","surface_form":"knead","offset":382},{"uri":"Beurre_mani%C3%A9","surface_form":"beurre mani\u00E9","offset":403},{"uri":"Auguste_Escoffier","surface_form":"Escoffier","offset":514},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":541},{"uri":"Clove","surface_form":"clove","offset":560},{"uri":"Louis_de_B%C3%A9chamel","surface_form":"Louis de B\u00E9chamel","offset":585}]}
