{"id":13832,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_digestive_system","text":"e=\"preserve\">The digestive system is the parts of the body that digest food; it is also called the gastrointestinal system. It breaks down food into simple chemicals which can be absorbed into the blood stream. From the blood stream, nutrients go first to the liver, which is a kind of chemical factory for the body. The liver adjusts the nutrients so that the mix is what the body needs. The digestive system consists of Gastric acid (hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride), which is very reactive and has a pH level of 1.5 to 3.5. To protect it the stomach has a protective layering called as the mucus.\nThe digestive system also gets rid of waste material. The gastrointestinal system starts at the lips and ends at the anus. Animals like worms, insects, mammals, birds, fish, and people all have digestive systems.\nThe gastrointestinal tract is not only the gut, but also other organs that help us digest food. For example, digestive enzymes are needed to help us absorb carbohydrates and meat.\nFood does not go through these organs. But they help the gut digest the food. They also have other work. For example, the pancreas, thyroid, liver, and parathyroids are also endocrine glands that make hormones like insulin.\nThere are many diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system. Doctors who study the gastrointestinal tract are called gastroenterologists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":54},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digest","offset":64},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":156},{"uri":"Absorb","surface_form":"absorbed","offset":179},{"uri":"Blood_stream","surface_form":"blood stream","offset":197},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":260},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":436},{"uri":"Potassium_chloride","surface_form":"potassium chloride","offset":455},{"uri":"Table_salt","surface_form":"sodium chloride","offset":479},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH level","offset":530},{"uri":"Mucus","surface_form":"mucus","offset":620},{"uri":"Lip","surface_form":"lip","offset":723},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":744},{"uri":"Worm","surface_form":"worm","offset":763},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":770},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":779},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":788},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":795},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"people","offset":805},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":903},{"uri":"Enzymes","surface_form":"enzymes","offset":959},{"uri":"Carbohydrates","surface_form":"carbohydrates","offset":996},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":1014},{"uri":"Work","surface_form":"work","offset":1119},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":1204},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":1221},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":1235},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Doctors","offset":1309},{"uri":"Gastroenterology","surface_form":"gastroenterologists","offset":1365}]}
