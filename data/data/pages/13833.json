It is the place where food is chewed. The mouth has teeth to help eat/chew the food.\nIn addition to its main role as the start of the digestive system, in humans the mouth also plays a great part in communication. The tongue, lips, and jaw, which are parts of the mouth, are needed to produce the number of sounds in human language. People also kiss and show their feelings with the mouth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Face","surface_form":"face","offset":31},{"uri":"Alimentary_canal","surface_form":"alimentary canal","offset":65},{"uri":"Human_digestive_system","surface_form":"digestive system","offset":83},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":124},{"uri":"Chewing","surface_form":"chewed","offset":132},{"uri":"Tooth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":154},{"uri":"Eating","surface_form":"eat","offset":168},{"uri":"Chewing","surface_form":"chew","offset":172},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":181},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":301},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":320},{"uri":"Lips","surface_form":"lips","offset":328},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":338},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":425},{"uri":"Kiss","surface_form":"kiss","offset":447}]}
