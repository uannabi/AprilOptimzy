{"id":138337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem.\nGeneral meaning.\nIn this meaning, the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand, or as an abbreviation for \"cryptographic system\". A cryptographic system is any computer system that involves cryptography. Such systems include for instance, a system for secure electronic mail which might include methods for digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key management techniques, and so on.\nMeaning in the cryptographic community.\nIn this meaning, a cryptosystem refers to a set of algorithms needed to implement a method of encryption and decryption.\nThe term \"cipher\" (sometimes \"cypher\") is often used to refer to a pair of (encryption/decryption) algorithms. Therefore, the term \"cryptosystem\" is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important. For this reason, the term \"cryptosystem\" is commonly used to refer to public key techniques; however both \"cipher\" and \"cryptosystem\" are used for symmetric key techniques.\n\"Cryptographic system\" vs. \"cryptosystem\".\nThe \"Internet Security Glossary\" RFC 2828 advises against using the term \"cryptosystem\", giving the following definitions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shorthand","surface_form":"shorthand","offset":139},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":159},{"uri":"Computer_system","surface_form":"computer system","offset":230},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":260},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"electronic mail","offset":329},{"uri":"Digital_signature","surface_form":"digital signature","offset":377},{"uri":"Cryptographic_hash_function","surface_form":"cryptographic hash function","offset":397},{"uri":"Key_management","surface_form":"key management","offset":427},{"uri":"Technique","surface_form":"technique","offset":442},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":556},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":599},{"uri":"Decryption","surface_form":"decryption","offset":614},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public key","offset":909},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric key","offset":986}]}
