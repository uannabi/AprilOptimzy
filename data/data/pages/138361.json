{"id":138361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_key","text":"=\"preserve\">In cryptography, a weak key is a key which when used with a specific cipher, makes the cipher behave in some undesirable way, and simplifies breaking (cracking) the ciphertext.\nWeak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall key space, which means that if someone generates a random key to encrypt a message, it is a rare condition that weak keys will cause a security problem. However, it is considered a good design for a cipher to have no weak keys (\"quality chiper\"). A cipher with no weak keys is said to have a \"flat\", or \"linear\", key space.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":15},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"key","offset":45},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":81},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"cipher","offset":99},{"uri":"Ciphertext","surface_form":"ciphertext","offset":177},{"uri":"Key_space","surface_form":"key space","offset":254},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":440},{"uri":"Key_space","surface_form":"key space","offset":567}]}
