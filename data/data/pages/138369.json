{"id":138369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_the_Alarm","text":"\"Sound the Alarm\" is the fifth studio album by the emo band Saves the Day. It was released by Vagrant Records on April 11, 2006. It was produced by Steve Evetts who also produced Saves the Day's first two albums, \"Can't Slow Down\" and \"Through Being Cool\". All of the album's lyrics were written by Chris Conley. It is their darkest album, and Chris wrote it about the black clouds in his life, and things that were eating him alive. This album was welcomed by many as something of a return to the band's classic sound, after the sonic departure of \"In Reverie\" in 2003.\n\"Sound the Alarm\" reached number 67 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart.\n\"Sound the Alarm\" is part one of a three part concept that Conley described in an interview with Punknews.org. It is their trilogy about self discovery.\nThe \"Head for the Hills\" track is used on the soundtrack of the football video game \"Madden NFL 07\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album| &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emo","surface_form":"emo","offset":51},{"uri":"Saves_the_Day","surface_form":"Saves the Day","offset":60},{"uri":"Vagrant_Records","surface_form":"Vagrant Records","offset":94},{"uri":"Can%27t_Slow_Down_(Saves_the_Day_album)","surface_form":"Can't Slow Down","offset":214},{"uri":"Through_Being_Cool","surface_form":"Through Being Cool","offset":236},{"uri":"Chris_Conley","surface_form":"Chris Conley","offset":299},{"uri":"In_Reverie","surface_form":"In Reverie","offset":550},{"uri":"Punknews.org","surface_form":"Punknews.org","offset":738},{"uri":"Trilogy","surface_form":"trilogy","offset":764},{"uri":"Madden_NFL_07","surface_form":"Madden NFL 07","offset":879}]}
