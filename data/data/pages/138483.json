{"id":138483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show","text":"\"The Daily Show\" (known currently as \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\") is an Emmy Award winning news parody television program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central in the United States. The half-hour long program was first shown on Monday, July 22, 1996. It was first hosted by Craig Kilborn. Kilborn acted as its anchorman until December 1998. Jon Stewart took over as host in January 1999. Many changes were made to the program at that time. Stewart retired in 2015. The show will be hosted by South African comedian Trevor Noah in September 2015.\nUnder Stewart, \"The Daily Show\" has become more strongly focused around politics and the national media. It is much different to the more character-driven comedy which was shown more during Kilborn's time on the program. Stewart's final broadcast aired on August 6, 2015.\nThere have been many other on-air contributors to \"The Daily Show\" with some called \"correspondents\", including Dave Attell, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, Ed Helms, Rob Corddry, Susie Essman, Olivia Munn, Buck Henry, Lewis Black, Kristen Schaal, Larry Wilmore, and John Oliver.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emmy_Award","surface_form":"Emmy Award","offset":78},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news","offset":97},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parody","offset":102},{"uri":"Television_program","surface_form":"television program","offset":109},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"airs","offset":132},{"uri":"Comedy_Central","surface_form":"Comedy Central","offset":169},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":191},{"uri":"Television_host","surface_form":"hosted","offset":288},{"uri":"News_presenter","surface_form":"anchorman","offset":334},{"uri":"Jon_Stewart","surface_form":"Jon Stewart","offset":365},{"uri":"South_African","surface_form":"South African","offset":516},{"uri":"Trevor_Noah","surface_form":"Trevor Noah","offset":539},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":642},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"national","offset":659},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":668},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":708},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":725},{"uri":"Dave_Attell","surface_form":"Dave Attell","offset":954},{"uri":"Stephen_Colbert","surface_form":"Stephen Colbert","offset":967},{"uri":"Steve_Carell","surface_form":"Steve Carell","offset":984},{"uri":"Ed_Helms","surface_form":"Ed Helms","offset":998},{"uri":"Rob_Corddry","surface_form":"Rob Corddry","offset":1008},{"uri":"Susie_Essman","surface_form":"Susie Essman","offset":1021},{"uri":"Olivia_Munn","surface_form":"Olivia Munn","offset":1035},{"uri":"Buck_Henry","surface_form":"Buck Henry","offset":1048},{"uri":"Lewis_Black","surface_form":"Lewis Black","offset":1060},{"uri":"Kristen_Schaal","surface_form":"Kristen Schaal","offset":1073},{"uri":"Larry_Wilmore","surface_form":"Larry Wilmore","offset":1089},{"uri":"John_Oliver","surface_form":"John Oliver","offset":1108}]}
