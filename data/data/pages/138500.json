The album was released on June 12, 1985. It was released through Combat Records.\nEarly in 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat Records to record and produce the band's first album. The money proved not to be enough and the band was given $4,000 more. Most of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, which forced the group to fire their original producer and produce the record by themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thrash_metal","surface_form":"thrash metal","offset":88},{"uri":"Megadeth","surface_form":"Megadeth","offset":106},{"uri":"Combat_Records","surface_form":"Combat Records","offset":181}]}
