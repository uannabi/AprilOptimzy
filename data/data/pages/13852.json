{"id":13852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon","text":"=\"preserve\">A deacon is a role in the Christian church. The job of a deacon is different depending on the church he or she is a part of. A deacon usually helps to run the church and teaches people about Christianity. A deacon can also witness marriages.\nMen who intend to become priests are usually named deacons for some time before advancing onto the rank of priest.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches men are not allowed to marry after they have become deacons. Deacons in Protestant churches are allowed to marry.\nA protodeacon is an honorary rank given to certain married deacons in Eastern Christian churches. In the Russian Orthodox Church it is an honorary title given to married deacons, as a mark of which, the clergyman is entitled to wear a burgundy-colored skufia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":38},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodoxy","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox","offset":376},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":397},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":493},{"uri":"Honorary","surface_form":"honorary","offset":555},{"uri":"Russian_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Russian Orthodox Church","offset":640},{"uri":"Burgundy_(color)","surface_form":"burgundy","offset":770},{"uri":"Skufia","surface_form":"skufia","offset":787}]}
