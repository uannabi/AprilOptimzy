His father was a very rich factory owner, and he sent Friedrich to England to run one of the factories. The way the workers were living at his father's factories made Engels upset with the class system. At about this time, he began to write about politics and workers' struggles.\nIn 1844 he met Karl Marx in France and the two became friends and began to write together. The two men worked together until Marx's death in 1883.\nAfter Marx died, Engels spent the rest of his life editing and translating Marx' writings. He also wrote about women and marriage. He died of throat cancer in London in 1895.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":61},{"uri":"Political_science","surface_form":"political","offset":68},{"uri":"Karl_Marx","surface_form":"Karl Marx","offset":108},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"Communism","offset":138},{"uri":"The_Communist_Manifesto","surface_form":"The Communist Manifesto","offset":177},{"uri":"Barmen","surface_form":"Barmen","offset":250},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":258},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":342},{"uri":"Karl_Marx","surface_form":"Karl Marx","offset":570},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":583},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translating","offset":765},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":813},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":823},{"uri":"Throat_cancer","surface_form":"throat cancer","offset":844},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":861}]}
