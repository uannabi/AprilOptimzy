{"id":138603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucking%2C_Austria","text":"Fucking () is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf, in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria.\nThe village is 33 kilometres north of Salzburg, four kilometres east of the German border and can be travelled to in half an hour by car from the town of Petting, in Bavaria.\nHistory.\nFucking has existed since at least 1070 and is named after a man from the 6th century called \"Fuko\". In old Germanic, \"-ing\" is used to describe people as belonging to their leader; so \"Fucking\" means \"(place of) Fuko\u2019s people.\"\nAlthough the village has a population of 104, it has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its name, which is spelled the same as the continuous form of the profane English-language verb \"fuck\".\nFucking's most famous feature is a traffic sign with its name on it, which tourists often photograph. This street sign is often stolen. Significant public funds have been spent on replacing the stolen signs.\nIn 2004, because many signs had been stolen, a vote was held to change the village name, but the villagers voted not to change. In August 2005, the road signs were welded to a very strong pole. This made it more difficult to steal them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":17},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":26},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":41},{"uri":"Tarsdorf","surface_form":"Tarsdorf","offset":57},{"uri":"Innviertel","surface_form":"Innviertel","offset":74},{"uri":"Upper_Austria","surface_form":"Upper Austria","offset":103},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":136},{"uri":"Salzburg","surface_form":"Salzburg","offset":156},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":194},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":251},{"uri":"Petting%2C_Germany","surface_form":"Petting","offset":272},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":284},{"uri":"1070","surface_form":"1070","offset":337},{"uri":"6th_century","surface_form":"6th century","offset":376},{"uri":"Germanic_languages","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":410},{"uri":"English-speaking_world","surface_form":"English-speaking world","offset":607},{"uri":"Continuous_tense","surface_form":"continuous","offset":677},{"uri":"Profanity","surface_form":"profane","offset":700},{"uri":"Sign","surface_form":"sign","offset":781},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":813},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":1077},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":1084},{"uri":"Welding","surface_form":"welded","offset":1110}]}
