{"id":138701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism","text":"Shamanism is a practice where a practitioner reaches altered states of consciousness. Supposedly, the shaman perceives and interacts with a spirit world, and channels these energies into this world.\nA shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of good and bad spirits. They usually enter into a trance state during a ritual, and do divination and healing. To become a shaman, a person has to have had a near death experience (a \"shamanic illness\").\nThe name \"shaman\" comes from the Evenki people in Siberia.\nShamans play a central role in these movements, as they can be in both worlds, this one, and the world of spirits.\nBeliefs.\nShamanism is different from animism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Altered_state_of_consciousness","surface_form":"altered states of consciousness","offset":53},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"shaman","offset":102},{"uri":"Trance","surface_form":"trance state","offset":329},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":351},{"uri":"Divination","surface_form":"divination","offset":366},{"uri":"Healing","surface_form":"healing","offset":381},{"uri":"Near_death_experience","surface_form":"near death experience","offset":437},{"uri":"Shamanic_illness","surface_form":"shamanic illness","offset":463},{"uri":"Evenki","surface_form":"Evenki","offset":516},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":533},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":648},{"uri":"Animism","surface_form":"animism","offset":694}]}
