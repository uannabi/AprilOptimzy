{"id":138707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system","text":"e=\"preserve\">A real-time operating system (RTOS; commonly pronounced as \"are-toss\") is a multitasking operating system designed for real-time applications. Such applications include embedded systems, industrial robots, scientific research equipment and others.\nAn RTOS simplifies the creation of a real-time applications, but does not guarantee the final result will be real-time; this requires good development of the software.\nReal-time operating systems use specialized scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real-time applications. An RTOS can respond more quickly and/or predictably to an event than other operating systems.\nThe main features of an RTOS are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency.\nExamples.\nThese are the best known, most widely used real-time operating systems. See List of real-time operating systems for a full list. Also, see List of operating systems for all types of operating systems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_multitasking","surface_form":"multitasking","offset":89},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":102},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":119},{"uri":"Real-time_computing","surface_form":"real-time","offset":132},{"uri":"Embedded_system","surface_form":"embedded system","offset":182},{"uri":"Robot","surface_form":"robot","offset":211},{"uri":"Real-time_computing","surface_form":"real-time","offset":298},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"development","offset":400},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":419},{"uri":"Scheduling_(computing)","surface_form":"scheduling","offset":473},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":484},{"uri":"Real-time_computing","surface_form":"real-time","offset":519},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"applications","offset":529},{"uri":"Predictability","surface_form":"predictably","offset":583},{"uri":"Event-driven_programming","surface_form":"event","offset":601},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":618},{"uri":"Feature","surface_form":"feature","offset":646},{"uri":"Interrupt_latency","surface_form":"interrupt latency","offset":678},{"uri":"Thread_switching_latency","surface_form":"thread switching latency","offset":710},{"uri":"List_of_real-time_operating_systems","surface_form":"List of real-time operating systems","offset":822},{"uri":"List_of_operating_systems","surface_form":"List of operating systems","offset":885}]}
