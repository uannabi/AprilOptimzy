{"id":138743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant","text":"e=\"preserve\">In algebra, the discriminant, sometimes represented by the symbol formula_1, is an algebraic expression used to determine the number of roots a polynomial have.\nFor example, the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial\nIf the discriminant is larger than zero, then the polynomial has two (distinct) real numbers as roots.\nIf the discriminant is equal to zero, then the polynomial has two repeating real numbers as roots (i.e., exactly one real root).\nIf the discriminant is smaller than zero, then the polynomial has two (purely) complex numbers as roots (i.e., zero real root).\nApart for quadratic polynomials, discriminants can be defined for cubic polynomials, general conic equations, and other mathematical entities such as differential equations and quadratic forms as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":16},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":157},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":312},{"uri":"Real_numbers","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":411},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":543}]}
