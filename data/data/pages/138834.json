{"id":138834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination","text":"e=\"preserve\">Predestination is a religious concept, which is about the relationship between God and His creation. The religious character of predestination distinguishes it from other ideas about determinism and free will. Those who believe in predestination, such as John Calvin, believe that before the creation God determined the destiny of the universe throughout all of time and space. They believe that God orders some people to Heaven, and all other people will go to Hell because of their sins. This is determined before they even are born.\nDefinition: predestination is the divine foreordaining or foreknowledge of all that will happen. It applies to the salvation of some and not others. It has been particularly associated with the teachings of St. Augustine of Hippo and of John Calvin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":33},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":92},{"uri":"Creation","surface_form":"creation","offset":104},{"uri":"Determinism","surface_form":"determinism","offset":196},{"uri":"Free_will","surface_form":"free will","offset":212},{"uri":"John_Calvin","surface_form":"John Calvin","offset":268},{"uri":"Creation_myth","surface_form":"creation","offset":305},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":497},{"uri":"Salvation","surface_form":"salvation","offset":664},{"uri":"St._Augustine_of_Hippo","surface_form":"St. Augustine of Hippo","offset":756},{"uri":"John_Calvin","surface_form":"John Calvin","offset":786}]}
