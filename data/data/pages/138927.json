{"id":138927,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarck_Archipelago","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and part of Papua New Guinea.\nHistory.\nThe first inhabitants of the Archipelago arrived around 33,000 years ago after sailing from what is now Papua New Guinea. Later arrivals included the Lapita people.\nThe first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616.\nThe islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they became part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck.\nOn 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost 100% of the volcano fell in to the ocean leaving a small lake in the volcanic crater.\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands. They remained under Australian control \u2013 interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II \u2013 until Papua New Guinea became independent in 1975.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":90},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":116},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":142},{"uri":"Lapita","surface_form":"Lapita","offset":319},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":380},{"uri":"Willem_Schouten","surface_form":"Willem Schouten","offset":395},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":502},{"uri":"Protectorate","surface_form":"protectorate","offset":509},{"uri":"German_New_Guinea","surface_form":"German New Guinea","offset":525},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":587},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_Germany","surface_form":"chancellor","offset":594},{"uri":"Otto_von_Bismarck","surface_form":"Otto von Bismarck","offset":605},{"uri":"13_March","surface_form":"13 March","offset":627},{"uri":"1888","surface_form":"1888","offset":636},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":644},{"uri":"Ritter_Island","surface_form":"Ritter Island","offset":663},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"megatsunami","offset":687},{"uri":"Volcanic_crater","surface_form":"volcanic crater","offset":776},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":819},{"uri":"Australian_Naval_and_Military_Expeditionary_Force","surface_form":"Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force","offset":836},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":917},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":944},{"uri":"Mandate","surface_form":"mandate","offset":962},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1048},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1075}]}
