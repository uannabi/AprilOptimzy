{"id":138934,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fiesta","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car made by Ford Motor Company from 1976 to the present day. Until 1986 it was the smallest Ford vehicle until the arrival of the Festiva (a car made by Ford in a joint-venture with Mazda and Kia in markets where the Fiesta wasn't sold). The first generation was made from 1976 to 1983, the second generation was made from 1983 to 1989 although this version is a heavily updated first generation car, it was unusual in offering 2 different dashboard designs for basic and higher-end models of it. The third generation arrived in 1989 and was the first Fiesta to be sold with 5-doors alongside 3, it received updates in 1992, 1994 and 1995 when it became the Fiesta Classic, selling with the newer fourth generation car until production ended in 1997. The fourth generation arrived in late 1995 and gained a rebadged version called the Mazda 121 although it wasn't as popular as the Fiesta itself, it was facelifted in late 1999 and was made until 2002. The fifth generation arrived in Spring 2002 and was facelifted in late 2005 and was produced until 2008. The sixth generation Fiesta arrived in late 2008 and is sold more globally than previous generations including the US where it arrived in Spring 2010 as a 2011 model. It was facelifted in early 2013 and as a 2014 model for the US. The seventh generation Fiesta arrived in July 2017. The Fiesta is very popular in the UK and first became the best selling car there in 1990, by that time it was on the third generation.\nGenerations.\nThis shows how the Ford Fiesta has changed each generation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subcompact_car","surface_form":"subcompact car","offset":30},{"uri":"Ford_Motor_Company","surface_form":"Ford Motor Company","offset":53},{"uri":"1976","surface_form":"1976","offset":77}]}
