A Gaeltacht is an area where the Irish language is most often spoken. The area aims to bring interest to the Irish language and tourist attractions related to it, as well as Irish culture.\nPlans for a gaeltacht quarter in Belfast began in 2002, as a recommendation of the Joint West Belfast/Greater Shankill Task Force. The plan was then adopted by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and Belfast City Council.\nImportant areas and events in the quarter include the An C\u00FAlturlann arts centre, Conway Mill and the F\u00E9ile an Phobail.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belfast","surface_form":"Belfast","offset":38},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":47},{"uri":"Falls_Road_(Belfast)","surface_form":"Falls Road","offset":87},{"uri":"Gaeltacht","surface_form":"Gaeltacht","offset":125},{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish language","offset":156},{"uri":"Irish_culture","surface_form":"Irish culture","offset":297},{"uri":"Department_of_Culture%2C_Arts_and_Leisure","surface_form":"Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure","offset":476},{"uri":"Belfast_City_Council","surface_form":"Belfast City Council","offset":520},{"uri":"F%C3%A9ile_an_Phobail","surface_form":"F\u00E9ile an Phobail","offset":643}]}
