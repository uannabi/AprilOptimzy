{"id":139006,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Under_School","text":"e=\"preserve\">Westminster Under School is a private preparatory school for boys aged 7 to 13 and is part of Westminster School in London.\nThe school was founded in 1943 in the buildings of Westminster School in Little Dean\u2019s Yard, just behind Westminster Abbey. In 1951 the Under School relocated to its own site in Eccleston Square. Due to rising numbers of students in the 1960s and 1970s, the school moved again in 1981 to its present site (which was a former hospital) next the Westminster School playing fields in Vincent Square. There are 267 pupils attending the school. The school has a strong musical tradition and provides choristers for St Margaret's Church, London.\nMost boys attending the school move on to Westminster School after the completion of either Common Entrance or Scholarship examinations (The Challenge), although a number of boys each year go onto other schools, most often either Eton or Harrow.\nThe Master is Mrs Elizabeth Hill; the Deputy Master is Mr D. Bratt. There are currently 39 members of staff.\nThe school fees for 2008-9 are \u00A34412 pre term.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Preparatory_school_(UK)","surface_form":"preparatory school","offset":51},{"uri":"Westminster_School","surface_form":"Westminster School","offset":107},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":129},{"uri":"Westminster_School","surface_form":"Westminster School","offset":188},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":242},{"uri":"Vincent_Square","surface_form":"Vincent Square","offset":518},{"uri":"Westminster_School","surface_form":"Westminster School","offset":719},{"uri":"Common_Entrance","surface_form":"Common Entrance","offset":769},{"uri":"Eton_College","surface_form":"Eton","offset":907},{"uri":"Harrow_School","surface_form":"Harrow","offset":915}]}
