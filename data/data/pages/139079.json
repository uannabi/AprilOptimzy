The New South Wales company had taken over the Victorian chain in the 1980s but had not changed the shop names (and in fact rebranded existing Woolworths stores as Safeway). In August 2008 there were 189 supermarkets in Victoria that were to be changed from being called \"Safeway\" to \"Woolworths\".\nWoolworths was the first Australian supermarket to offer petrol discounts when a certain amount of money was spent in the shop.\nIn 2009 Apple launched a legal challenge against Woolworths, claiming their logo, resembling a curl of fruit peel in the shape of a 'w', was superficially similar to the Apple logo.\nOn 11 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic to legacy shooting of enhanced community quarantine, The supermarket is temporarily disallowed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":38},{"uri":"Supermarket","surface_form":"supermarket","offset":49},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":278},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"petrol","offset":947},{"uri":"Discounts","surface_form":"discounts","offset":954},{"uri":"Quantity","surface_form":"amount","offset":979},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":989},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple","offset":1188}]}
