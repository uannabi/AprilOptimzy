{"id":13915,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix","text":"A prefix is a part of a word or a word, within a word. It is put at the start of another word to make a different meaning. It can also mean a number that is put in at the start to show which number something is in a group. It is a type of affix.\ncompound nouns (in other cases also compound adjectives).\nThe following examples illustrate real prefixes.\nOften people want to use a prefix to mean \"not\". There are many prefixes that mean \"not\".\nWe also learnt the prefixes \"anti which means against\" and auto is used to mean \"self\" \"or own\"\nanti glare which means it will prevent sun and light glare on a screen\nautograph which means a person's signature\nautopilot which means working by itself\nScientists and doctors use prefixes in many words.\nSometimes people make up words by adding a prefix. These words are not in a dictionary. But if people use these words enough, sometimes they go into dictionaries.\nFor example, we can make the word \"unsimple\", which splits up into \"not simple\". This is not a word in a dictionary.\nCompare to suffix. Suffixes are letters put at the end of a word to change its meaning.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Affix","surface_form":"affix","offset":239},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"Scientist","offset":693},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctors","offset":708},{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionary","offset":820},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":1035}]}
