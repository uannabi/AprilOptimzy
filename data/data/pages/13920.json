{"id":13920,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO","text":"UNESCO is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (). It is an agency of the United Nations (UN).\nUNESCO says its purpose, as defined just after the end of World War II, is \"to build the defenses of peace in the minds of men and women\". It does this by helping nations work together, through education for all, science, and culture. This is supposed to help other nations follow the rule of law and human rights. It also helps promote some freedoms in the UN Charter.\nUNESCO tries to achieve what it wants to do through six programs: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, communication and information. Some projects sponsored by UNESCO are literacy, technical, and teacher-training programmes. UNESCO also decides what will become World Heritage Sites. A World Heritage Site is an important, special, interesting or beautiful place. If a place is a World Heritage Site, the place can not be destroyed, as it can give useful information for the future. The Uluru, for example, gives a lot of information on the culture of Aborigines. UNESCO is also a member of the United Nations Development Group. and works for Millennium Development Goals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Agency","surface_form":"agency","offset":92},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":106},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":185},{"uri":"Right_to_education","surface_form":"education","offset":321},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":340},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":353},{"uri":"Rule_of_law","surface_form":"rule of law","offset":412},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":428},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":469},{"uri":"United_Nations_Charter","surface_form":"UN Charter","offset":485},{"uri":"Natural_science","surface_form":"natural science","offset":574},{"uri":"Human_science","surface_form":"human science","offset":603},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":646},{"uri":"Sponsor","surface_form":"sponsor","offset":673},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":697},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":788},{"uri":"Uluru","surface_form":"Uluru","offset":1013},{"uri":"Aborigines","surface_form":"Aborigines","offset":1078},{"uri":"United_Nations_Development_Group","surface_form":"United Nations Development Group","offset":1121},{"uri":"Millennium_Development_Goals","surface_form":"Millennium Development Goals","offset":1169}]}
