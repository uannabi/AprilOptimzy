Another example uses multiple X terminals so that multiple remote users can use X Window on a single machine.\nThe complementary term, single-user commonly refers to an operating system being usable only by one person at a time, or in reference to a single-user software license agreement.\nSingle-user mode is a mode for Multi-user operating system where the computer boots or switches into a single superuser mode. It is mainly used for maintenance of multi-user environments such as network or Unix servers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":50},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":68},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":91},{"uri":"User_(computing)","surface_form":"user","offset":129},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":147},{"uri":"Unix","surface_form":"Unix","offset":190},{"uri":"Secure_Shell","surface_form":"Secure Shell","offset":255},{"uri":"Unix_shell","surface_form":"Unix shell","offset":276},{"uri":"X_terminal","surface_form":"X terminal","offset":342},{"uri":"X_Window_System","surface_form":"X Window","offset":392},{"uri":"Software_license","surface_form":"software license","offset":573},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":643},{"uri":"Booting","surface_form":"boots","offset":679},{"uri":"Administrator","surface_form":"superuser","offset":711},{"uri":"Unix","surface_form":"Unix","offset":807},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":812}]}
