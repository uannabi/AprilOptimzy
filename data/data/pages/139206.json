{"id":139206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_squirrel","text":"Flying squirrels are a tribe of 44 species in the squirrel family Sciuridae. Despite the name, none use powered flight: all are gliders.\nThey are sociable, noisy rodents that glide from tree to tree, using a flap of loose skin that connects their front and hind legs. They can glide up to 150 feet (46 m), steering with their tail, and landing on tree trunks, gripping it with all four feet.\nThese squirrels are nocturnal (most active at night). They have a life span of about five years in the wild, and about 13 years in captivity. Flying squirrels live in forests in North America, Europe and Asia.\nFlying squirrels eat mostly plants, like seeds, nuts, leaves, maple sap, bulbs, bark, flowers, and roots. Less often, they eat insects, eggs, worms, small birds, and other small animals.\nFlying squirrels are hunted by weasels, foxes, hawks, and coyotes.\nEvolution.\nBefore the 21st century, the evolutionary history of the flying squirrel was often debated. This debate was clarified by two recent molecular studies. These studies found that the living flying squirrels originated 18\u201320 million years ago, are monophyletic, and have a sister relationship with tree squirrels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":35},{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":50},{"uri":"Sciuridae","surface_form":"Sciuridae","offset":66},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":162},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":186},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":222},{"uri":"Leg","surface_form":"leg","offset":262},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":412},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":559},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":570},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":585},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":596},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":630},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":643},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nut","offset":650},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":656},{"uri":"Bulb","surface_form":"bulb","offset":675},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":688},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":701},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":729},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":738},{"uri":"Worm","surface_form":"worm","offset":744},{"uri":"Weasel","surface_form":"weasel","offset":820},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":829},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawk","offset":836},{"uri":"Coyote","surface_form":"coyote","offset":847},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":896},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"molecular studies","offset":999},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":1111}]}
