{"id":139227,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_mangabey","text":"The sooty mangabey (\"Cercocebus atys\"), is an Old World monkey of Guinea Bissau, Gabon, Senegal and Ghana. It has social groups of four to twelve individuals.\nDisease.\nSooty mangabeys are naturally infected with a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). Due to extensive human-mangabey contact in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus has jumped from this species into humans on many occasions. This resulted in the HIV-2 virus. The HIV-1 strain by contrast came from the common chimpanzee strain of SIV.\nThe sooty mangabey can also get leprosy, as can humans, the Nine-banded Armadillo, the common chimpanzee, and the crab-eating macaque.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monkey","surface_form":"monkey","offset":56},{"uri":"Guinea_Bissau","surface_form":"Guinea Bissau","offset":66},{"uri":"Gabon","surface_form":"Gabon","offset":81},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":88},{"uri":"Ghana","surface_form":"Ghana","offset":100},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"sub-Saharan Africa","offset":304},{"uri":"Zoonosis","surface_form":"jumped from this species","offset":338},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":368},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":421},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV-1","offset":432},{"uri":"Common_chimpanzee","surface_form":"common chimpanzee","offset":471},{"uri":"Leprosy","surface_form":"leprosy","offset":536},{"uri":"Nine-banded_Armadillo","surface_form":"Nine-banded Armadillo","offset":564},{"uri":"Common_chimpanzee","surface_form":"common chimpanzee","offset":591},{"uri":"Crab-eating_macaque","surface_form":"crab-eating macaque","offset":618}]}
