{"id":13925,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights","text":"Human rights are rights and freedoms that all people should have.\nToday, the ideas of human rights are protected as legal rights in national and international law.\nThey are seen as \"universal,\" which means they are meant for everyone, no matter what their race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, age, sex, political beliefs (or any other kind of beliefs), intelligence, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity are.\nHistory.\nThe idea of human rights originated from ideas found in religion and philosophy in Western Europe. The modern Western idea of human rights started in the European Enlightenment. In the 16th century, some people started suggesting that everyone had the religious and political right to choose their religion and their leaders. This sort of thinking was important in the English Civil War. After the war, the philosopher John Locke argued that people should have a certain set of human rights. These ideas were also important in the American revolution and the French revolution in the 18th century.\nLaws.\nBecause people believe that human rights are important, countries make laws to protect them. These laws say that governments cannot take away people's basic rights. They make sure people who take away other people's rights are punished. However, many countries in the world do not protect the human rights of their people.\nSome major political groups and countries have made statements that promote human rights. Many governments and international groups punish human rights violators by refusing to trade with them, or even helping groups that want to overthrow their governments.\nSome of the important places that human rights laws are written is in constitutions. The United States Constitution and Constitution of France are two of the oldest set of laws based on human rights.\nThese are United Nations human rights \"Covenants\": agreements between people or countries. The countries who sign these two covenants agree to follow them.\nIn addition to those Declaration and Covenants, there are many treaties and documents made by United Nations and other international organizations. Those treaties and documents are called \"International human rights law\".\nAbuses.\nHuman rights abuses are when a person is hurt in a way that violates (goes against) his/her human rights. Human rights abuses are also often called \"human rights violations\".\nMany people, groups, and countries think protecting human rights is very important. But not everyone in the world believes in human rights. If people who do not believe in human rights have political power they can hurt many people. Even if these people have no political power, they can be violent to other people. There are many people who work to protect everyone's human rights; some of these are government groups, and some are not with any government. They are sometimes called \"human rights organizations\". Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are examples of human rights organizations.\nIn the UK, every Act of Parliament must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Nonetheless, a person can challenge an Act if it violates the Convention. However, the Government are not bound to change the law due to incompatibility, and they have the power to pass a law that contravenes with the Human Rights, if they wish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legal_rights","surface_form":"legal rights","offset":116},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":145},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":256},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":262},{"uri":"Ethnicity","surface_form":"ethnicity","offset":272},{"uri":"Nationality","surface_form":"nationality","offset":283},{"uri":"Ageing","surface_form":"age","offset":296},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":301},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":306},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"intelligence","offset":356},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disability","offset":370},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":382},{"uri":"Gender_identity","surface_form":"gender identity","offset":405},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":491},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":504},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":589},{"uri":"Age_of_Enlightenment","surface_form":"Enlightenment","offset":598},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":620},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":733},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":752},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"English Civil War","offset":804},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":842},{"uri":"John_Locke","surface_form":"John Locke","offset":854},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American revolution","offset":966},{"uri":"French_revolution","surface_form":"French revolution","offset":994},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":1019},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1110},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1152},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"overthrow","offset":1592},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":1691},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":1710},{"uri":"Constitution_of_France","surface_form":"Constitution of France","offset":1741},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaties","offset":2040},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":2071},{"uri":"International_human_rights_law","surface_form":"International human rights law","offset":2166},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":2572},{"uri":"Amnesty_International","surface_form":"Amnesty International","offset":2896},{"uri":"Human_Rights_Watch","surface_form":"Human Rights Watch","offset":2922},{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Act of Parliament","offset":3002},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"Government","offset":3165}]}
