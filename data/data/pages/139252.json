{"id":139252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball","text":"e=\"preserve\">College basketball is basketball played between teams from colleges or universities, usually in the United States. The most popular American college basketball league is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Basketball in the NCAA is put into three divisions: Division I, Division II and Division III. However, there are other college basketball leagues, such as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). College basketball teams are split into conferences, which are groups of about 10 teams.\nDivision I of the NCAA has two tournaments to determine who the national champion. One tournament is for men and one is for women. The men's tournament has 68 teams, and the women's tournament has 64 teams. These tournaments are often called \"March Madness\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":35},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":113},{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"National Collegiate Athletic Association","offset":187},{"uri":"Division_I","surface_form":"Division I","offset":288},{"uri":"Division_II","surface_form":"Division II","offset":300},{"uri":"Division_III","surface_form":"Division III","offset":316}]}
