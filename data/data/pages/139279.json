{"id":139279,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail","text":"Retail is selling goods or items to the people who will use them. This is different from wholesale, which is selling to a retailer.\nAccording to Oxford Dictionary, Retail is the sale of goods to the public in relatively small quantities for use or consumption rather than for resale.\nRetailers buy finished goods or items directly from a manufacturer or a wholesale<nowiki/>r and then distribute in smaller quantities to the final consumer who has a need for such items.\nFor instance, when we buy shoes to wear or food to eat, we buy from a retailer.\nRetailing can be done at shops and stores. This includes department stores, malls and markets where stalls or stands are set up at a cleared area.\nAnother way of purchasing retail items is by ordering them by mail, telephone, Internet or other methods, to be delivered by post or package delivery service such as United Parcel Service. Some items are sold door-to-door, in which a sales person goes to a possible customers home and tries to sell an item.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wholesale","surface_form":"wholesale","offset":89},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retailer","offset":122},{"uri":"Finished_goods","surface_form":"finished goods","offset":298},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturer","offset":338},{"uri":"Wholesale","surface_form":"wholesale","offset":356},{"uri":"Department_store","surface_form":"department store","offset":608},{"uri":"Mall","surface_form":"mall","offset":627},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":637},{"uri":"United_Parcel_Service","surface_form":"United Parcel Service","offset":864}]}
