In 2006 there were 7,542 people living in the town.\nGunnedah is on the Oxley and Kamilaroi Highways. It is 475 kms from Sydney. There is also a railway to Sydney. There is a daily train service, the Countrylink Xplorer, between Sydney and Moree.\nThe major business is agriculture. Gunnedah produces cotton, coal, beef, lamb, pork, and cereal and oilseed grains.\nGunnedah is also the home of AgQuip, Australia's largest annual exhibition of agricultural equipment.\nHistory.\nThe Gunnedah area was the home of the Australian Aborigines who spoke the Kamilaroi (Gamilaraay) language. The area of the town was settled by Europeans in 1833 or 1834.\nDorothea Mackellar wrote her famous poem \"My Country\" (popularly known as \"I Love a Sunburnt Country\") about her family's farm near Gunnedah. Every year the Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards for school students are held in Gunnedah.\nCoal was found on Black Jack Hill in 1877. By 1891, 6,000 tons of coal had been dug from shafts. The Gunnedah Colliery Company was registered in May, 1899. One month later a private railway some 5.7\u00A0km in length had been completed from the railway station to their mine. In September, 1957, the Government Railway took over the working of the line.\n\"The Red Chief,\" by great Australian author Ion L. Idriess, tells the true story of \"Red Kangaroo\" and his tribe, from this area.\nGeography.\nGunnedah Shire is 264 metres above sea level on the Liverpool Plains in the Namoi River valley. It is very flat. The tallest hills are only 200 metres above the flat plains. The climate is hot in summer, mild in winter and dry. Rainstorms occasionally cause flooding of the Namoi River. Floods can cut transport links to the town and cut it off from the outside world.\nThe Gunnedah area has a lot of Australian wildlife, including kangaroos, echidnas and koalas. Koalas can often be seen in trees within the town.\nMedia.\nThere is a newspaper, the Namoi Valley Independent.
