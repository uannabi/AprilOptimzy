{"id":139314,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Territory","text":"e=\"preserve\">Michigan Territory was a territory of the United States in the early 19th century, between June 30, 1805 and January 26, 1837, when it became Michigan, the 26th state of the Union. Detroit was the territory's capital.\nHistory.\nThe Treaty of Detroit was signed on November 17, 1807 between William Hurt and American Indians from the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Wyandot people. Those Indian tribes agreed to give the United States the area of Southeast Michigan and a part of Ohio near the Maumee River. The Indians were allowed to own small amounts of land in the area. This helped expand the territory.\nPopulation.\nThese numbers do not count most Native Americans. In 1800, the whole of the Northwest Territory had 43,365 people living in it. Under the Northwest Ordinance, a territory could apply to become a state once it had 60,000 people living in it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":55},{"uri":"June_30","surface_form":"June 30","offset":104},{"uri":"1805","surface_form":"1805","offset":113},{"uri":"January_26","surface_form":"January 26","offset":122},{"uri":"1837","surface_form":"1837","offset":134},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":155},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":174},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":194},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Detroit","surface_form":"Treaty of Detroit","offset":244},{"uri":"November_17","surface_form":"November 17","offset":276},{"uri":"1807","surface_form":"1807","offset":289},{"uri":"William_Hurt","surface_form":"William Hurt","offset":302},{"uri":"Native_Americans_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"American Indians","offset":319},{"uri":"Odawa_people","surface_form":"Odawa","offset":345},{"uri":"Ojibwe_people","surface_form":"Ojibwe","offset":352},{"uri":"Potawatomi","surface_form":"Potawatomi","offset":360},{"uri":"Wyandot_people","surface_form":"Wyandot people","offset":376},{"uri":"Southeast_Michigan","surface_form":"Southeast Michigan","offset":457},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":490},{"uri":"Maumee_River","surface_form":"Maumee River","offset":504},{"uri":"Northwest_Territory","surface_form":"Northwest Territory","offset":707}]}
