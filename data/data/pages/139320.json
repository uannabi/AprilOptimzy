{"id":139320,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast","text":"The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of coast in south-west England. It is between Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon and Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset. This is 96 miles long (154\u00A0km).\nIt is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIts entire length can be walked on the South West Coast Path.\nMajor fossil finds.\nSome of the greatest fossil discoveries were made in this area.\nThese finds were by Mary Anning in the first part of the 19th century. This area was home to Mary, a collector who searched for fossils of the coastline around Lyme Regis and discovered several complete Ichthyosaur fossils.\nGeology.\nThe Jurassic Coast is made of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs, spanning 185 million years of geological history.\nThe site contains a number of special features and shows different landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and an island, the Isle of Portland.\nChesil Beach (or Chesil Bank) is one of England's three shingle (gravel) beaches. It is a barrier beach which runs parallel to the coastline and connects to Portland Bill (see photo). Between the barrier and the regular coastline is a lagoon.\nGolden Cap is the highest place on the south coast of England. It is high.\nSequence of rocks.\nThis section notes the main rocks found on the coast, starting with the lowest (earliest).\nBlue Lias.\nThe Blue Lias is a geologic formation in the Jurassic Coast and parts of south Wales. It is part of the Lias Group.\nThe Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers. It was laid down in late Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils, especially ammonites. Also found were remains of a number of dinosaurs, and the pterosaur \"Dimorphodon\".\nThe Blue Lias alternates between limestone, (with some clay), and mudstone.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":35},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":55},{"uri":"Exmouth","surface_form":"Exmouth","offset":97},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":113},{"uri":"Swanage","surface_form":"Swanage","offset":144},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":160},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":208},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":215},{"uri":"Mary_Anning","surface_form":"Mary Anning","offset":402},{"uri":"Lyme_Regis","surface_form":"Lyme Regis","offset":542},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"Ichthyosaur","offset":585},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":597},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":645},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":655},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":668},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":717},{"uri":"Arch","surface_form":"arch","offset":837},{"uri":"Durdle_Door","surface_form":"Durdle Door","offset":845},{"uri":"Cove","surface_form":"cove","offset":862},{"uri":"Fold_(geology)","surface_form":"limestone folding","offset":871},{"uri":"Lulworth_Cove","surface_form":"Lulworth Cove","offset":892},{"uri":"Isle_of_Portland","surface_form":"Isle of Portland","offset":925},{"uri":"Chesil_Beach","surface_form":"Chesil Beach","offset":943},{"uri":"Shingle","surface_form":"shingle","offset":999},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":1008},{"uri":"Coastline","surface_form":"coastline","offset":1074},{"uri":"Portland_Bill","surface_form":"Portland Bill","offset":1100},{"uri":"Lagoon","surface_form":"lagoon","offset":1178},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":1461},{"uri":"Lias_Group","surface_form":"Lias Group","offset":1486},{"uri":"Blue_Lias","surface_form":"Blue Lias","offset":1502},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":1538},{"uri":"Shale","surface_form":"shale","offset":1552},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":1591},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":1610},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":1697},{"uri":"Ammonite","surface_form":"ammonite","offset":1717},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1767},{"uri":"Dimorphodon","surface_form":"Dimorphodon","offset":1797},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":1844},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":1866},{"uri":"Mudstone","surface_form":"mudstone","offset":1877}]}
