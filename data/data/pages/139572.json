{"id":139572,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a set of computer software programs and data structures which use a virtual machine model for the execution of other computer programs and scripts. The model used by a JVM accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as Java bytecode.\nJava virtual machines operate on Java bytecode, which is normally (but not necessarily) generated from Java source code; a JVM can also be used to implement programming languages other than Java.\nThe JVM is an important component of the Java Platform. Because JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms, Java can be both middleware and a platform in its own right \u2013 hence the expression \"write once, run anywhere.\" The use of the same bytecode for all platforms allows Java to be described as \"compile once, run anywhere\", as opposed to \"write once, compile anywhere\", which describes cross-platform compiled languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":63},{"uri":"Virtual_machine","surface_form":"virtual machine","offset":113},{"uri":"Execution_(computing)","surface_form":"execution","offset":143},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":162},{"uri":"Scripting_language","surface_form":"scripts","offset":184},{"uri":"Intermediate_language","surface_form":"intermediate language","offset":244},{"uri":"Java_bytecode","surface_form":"Java bytecode","offset":290},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":408},{"uri":"Platform_(computing)","surface_form":"platforms","offset":615},{"uri":"Middleware","surface_form":"middleware","offset":643},{"uri":"Platform_(computing)","surface_form":"platform","offset":660},{"uri":"Write_once%2C_run_anywhere","surface_form":"write once, run anywhere","offset":710},{"uri":"Compiled_language","surface_form":"compiled language","offset":922}]}
