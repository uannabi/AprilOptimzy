{"id":139583,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret","text":"e=\"preserve\">In cryptography, a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication. The shared secret can be a password, a passphrase, a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes.\nThe shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate; in this case it can also be called a pre-shared key. Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key-agreement protocol, for-instance using public-key cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman or using symmetric-key cryptography such as Kerberos.\nThe shared secret can be used for authentication (for instance when logging in to a remote system) using methods such as challenge-response or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption and/or MACing of messages.\nTo make unique session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector (IV). An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":16},{"uri":"Password","surface_form":"password","offset":154},{"uri":"Passphrase","surface_form":"passphrase","offset":166},{"uri":"Pre-shared_key","surface_form":"pre-shared key","offset":338},{"uri":"Key-agreement_protocol","surface_form":"key-agreement protocol","offset":424},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public-key cryptography","offset":467},{"uri":"Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange","surface_form":"Diffie-Hellman","offset":499},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric-key cryptography","offset":523},{"uri":"Kerberos_(protocol)","surface_form":"Kerberos","offset":558},{"uri":"Challenge-response_authentication","surface_form":"challenge-response","offset":689},{"uri":"Key_derivation_function","surface_form":"key derivation function","offset":730},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"keys","offset":777},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":793},{"uri":"Message_authentication_code","surface_form":"MACing","offset":811},{"uri":"Session_key","surface_form":"session and message keys","offset":846},{"uri":"Initialization_vector","surface_form":"initialization vector","offset":917},{"uri":"Derived_unique_key_per_transaction","surface_form":"derived unique key per transaction","offset":971}]}
