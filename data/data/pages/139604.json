It is one of the 83 first French departments made during the French revolution and one of the eight departments of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9 region.\nIts prefecture (capital) is the city of Dijon. The inhabitants of the department are called \"Costaloriens\" (women:\"Costaloriennes\") or \"C\u00F4te-d'Oriens\" (women:\"C\u00F4te d'Oriennes\").\nHistory.\nC\u00F4te-d'Or is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790.

It is the south-east facing slope of this escarpment which is the site of the celebrated Burgundy vineyards. To the south-east of the plateau and escarpment, the department lies in the broad valley of the middle section of the river Sa\u00F4ne.\nClimate.\nThe K\u00F6ppen climate classification type for the climate at Dijon is an \"Oceanic climate\" (also known as Maritime Temperate climate) and of the subtype \"Cfb\".\nThe average temperature for the year in Dijon is.
