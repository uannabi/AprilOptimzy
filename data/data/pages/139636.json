While info for every storm that happened is not available, some parts of the coastline were had enough people to give info of hurricane happenings. Each season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation is between June 1 and November 30.\n1820 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. A minimal hurricane moved from Florida on September 8 northward to hit near the border of North Carolina and South Carolina on September 10. It caused only minor damage.\nII.

It caused 200 deaths, and is estimated to have been a Category\u00A04 hurricane.\nIII. Later in September, from the 15th-17th, a strong hurricane hit Mississippi.
