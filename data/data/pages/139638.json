While info for every storm that happened is not available, some parts of the coastline were had enough people to give info of hurricane happenings. Each season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation is between June 1 and November 30.\n1830 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. A hurricane moved from Trinidad to western Cuba between August 3 and August 9.\nAtlantic Coast Hurricane.\nII. First noted in the Leeward Islands on August 11, a hurricane moved into the Caribbean in the middle of August. It moved west-northwestward, and approached the coast of Florida. It came close to present-day Daytona Beach on August 15, but recurved northeastward before landfall, although land was not spared from effects. It made landfall near Cape Fear on the 16th and went out to sea that night, eventually well to the north of Bermuda just offshore the Canadian Maritimes. The hurricane broke a three-month drought, but caused heavy crop damage in the process.\nIII. A hurricane tracked north of the Leeward Islands on August 19 through the southwest and western Atlantic by August 26.\nIV. A hurricane moved from north of Puerto Rico on September 29 to well northeast of Bermuda on October 1.\nV. A tropical storm struck South Carolina on October 6.\n1831 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI.

The Great Barbados Hurricane was an intense Category 4 hurricane that left cataclysmic damage across the Caribbean and Louisiana in 1831. It left 2,500 people dead and $7\u00A0million (1831\u00A0dollars) in damage.\nIV. A strong tropical storm/hurricane struck western Louisiana between August 27 and August 30.\nV. A hurricane hit near the mouth of the Rio Grande, causing heavy rain over Texas and Mexico.\n1832 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. Early in the season, a hurricane moved through the Bahamas around June 5, causing 52 deaths. The gale began June 6 at 8 p.m. at Bermuda from the northeast, with the center passing quite close to the island as the wind shifted to southwest at 10:30\u00A0p.m. The storm lasted until 3 a.m. on June 7. Two schooners were damaged during the system. (from Beware the Hurricane)\nII. On August 12, this hurricane was noted near Key West. The cyclone moved across the eastern Gulf of Mexico striking northwest Florida, then recurving through the Southeast to move through South Carolina by August 18.\nIII. On August 21 a tropical storm was witnessed to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern tropical Atlantic.\nIV. Between August 23 and August 27, a hurricane moved from the central Leeward Islands to the east of Jamaica.\nV. On October 14, a tropical storm moved into South Carolina.\n1833 Atlantic hurricane season.\nA hurricane passed offshore of Norfolk in late August, keeping ships at harbor but causing no damage.\n1834 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI.

A hurricane struck the island of Dominica on September 20, bringing heavy winds and a 12\u00A0ft storm surge that devastated the capital of Roseau; 230 people are believed to have been killed by the hurricane's onslaught. Then the hurricane made its second landfall at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on the 23rd. About 170 sailors died when their ships sank in the Ozama River. On land the hurricane disrupted the funeral service of Padre Ruiz, a Roman Catholic priest. A total of 400 people were killed from the hurricane.\nIII.

It moved across the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico, hitting near the mouth of the Rio Grande on August 18. There, it destroyed small villages, caused strong storm surge, and killed 18 people.\nJay Barnes in \"Florida's Hurricane History\" pg 56, noted a hurricane, possibly the same, that smashed Cape Florida and Key Biscayne, creating the Norris Cut and knocking over the Ponce de Leon lighthouse. From there, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and took a hard northeast tack, damaging Fort Brooke in Tampa, terrorizing the city, and then ambling northward into Georgia and the Carolinas, making the trip \"all the way into New England.\"\n1836 Atlantic hurricane season.\nA hurricane hit the Cayman Islands during this season.\n1837 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI.

This cyclone later swept western Ireland as an extratropical storm, which they called The Great Wind of 1839.
