{"id":139639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigglypuff","text":"Jigglypuff, known in Japan as Purin (\u30D7\u30EA\u30F3), is one of the fictional species of Pok\u00E9mon from the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" media franchise owned by Nintendo and Game Freak. Since it was introduced early in the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" anime, it has become one of the most famous Pok\u00E9mon.\nJigglypuff is perhaps most famous for the song it sings which puts everyone who hears it into a deep sleep. Jigglypuff then becomes upset because it assumes everyone is very bored by the song, and it draws all over their faces with a marker.\nJigglypuff is a small Pok\u00E9mon, slightly shorter than Pikachu. It is shaped like a balloon and has a pink body with blue eyes, catlike ears, and a strange tuft of fur on its forehead.\nIn video games.\nIn the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" video games, Jigglypuff is famous among players because it learns the move Sing, which puts enemy Pok\u00E9mon to sleep. This often causes them to lose the battle, and many players find it very annoying.\nJigglypuff was introduced in \"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue\", the first \"Pok\u00E9mon\" games. It has appeared in most of the games since then. It evolves into Wigglytuff, an \"upgraded\" form of Jigglypuff. Starting with \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\", Jigglypuff has a pre-evolved evolutionary form, Igglybuff. Igglybuff was one of the 100 new Pok\u00E9mon introduced in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". Previously there were only 151.\nJigglypuff has also appeared in \"Super Smash Bros.,\" \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\". It is a light and fast character who is great in the air. Its attacks include Rollout, Pound, Sing, Rest, and its Final Smash, Puff Up.\nIn anime.\nJigglypuff is one of the most famous Pok\u00E9mon, alongside Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Mewtwo, mostly because it has appeared many times in the still-running \"Pok\u00E9mon\" anime. It usually appears unexpectedly and puts Pok\u00E9mon and humans near it to sleep for a few minutes by singing its trademark song. It has a black permanent marker, similar to a Sharpie, with which it often draws on people and Pok\u00E9mon's faces while they are asleep. This is an act of revenge because everyone falls asleep when they hear Jigglypuff's song and Jigglypuff assumes it's because they are very bored by it. Since people are upset when Jigglypuff puts them to sleep, and Jigglypuff is upset when they fall asleep, it is a vicious circle.\nIn episode \"Beach Blank-Out Blastoise\", Jigglypuff somehow got stuck in Blastoise's hydro cannon. When it was finally freed, it put everyone to sleep and then drew on their faces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":21},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":57},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":67},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":78},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":96},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":130},{"uri":"Game_Freak","surface_form":"Game Freak","offset":143},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)","surface_form":"\"Pok\u00E9mon\" anime","offset":192},{"uri":"Pikachu","surface_form":"Pikachu","offset":550},{"uri":"Balloon","surface_form":"balloon","offset":579},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)","surface_form":"\"Pok\u00E9mon\" video games","offset":703},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue","offset":942},{"uri":"Wigglytuff","surface_form":"Wigglytuff","offset":1057},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver","offset":1118},{"uri":"Igglybuff","surface_form":"Igglybuff","offset":1192},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros.","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.","offset":1344},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Melee","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.
