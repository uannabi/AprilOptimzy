He is the 12th Imam according to Isma'ili Faatemi faith.\nAl-Qaim (sometimes also spelled Ka'im) was born in Salamya in Syria in 895 with the name Abd ar-Rahman. After his father Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah (910-934) seized power in Ifriqiya he was named heir to the throne in 912, and helped put down several revolts. But campaigns into Egypt failed because of the resistance of the Abbasids (914-915 and 919-921).\nIn 934 Al-Qaim succeeded his father as Caliph. The Fatimid realm became an important power in the Mediterranean. After the re-conquest of Sicily the Byzantine province of Calabria and the coast of Italy and France were.\nBut from 944 to 947 there was a crisis by the revolt of Abu Yazid, who had united the Kharijite Berber tribes of eastern Algeria and overrun Ifriqiya. Imam Al-Qaim was able to hold out in Mahdia with the help of the navy for over a year, but died (17 May 946) before the revolt could be put down.\nHe was succeeded by his son Ismail al-Mansur (946-953).\nHe died on 13 th Shawwal 334 AH (Mahdiyya)/ 17th May 946 AD","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"893","surface_form":"893","offset":43},{"uri":"17_May","surface_form":"17 May","offset":49},{"uri":"946","surface_form":"946","offset":57},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"Caliph","offset":80},{"uri":"Fatimid_Caliphate","surface_form":"Fatimids","offset":94},{"uri":"Ifriqiya","surface_form":"Ifriqiya","offset":106},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":261},{"uri":"Ubayd_Allah_al-Mahdi_Billah","surface_form":"Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah","offset":320},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":479},{"uri":"Abbasid_Empire","surface_form":"Abbasids","offset":525},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":655},{"uri":"Sicily","surface_form":"Sicily","offset":695},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine","offset":706},{"uri":"Calabria","surface_form":"Calabria","offset":728},{"uri":"Abu_Yazid","surface_form":"Abu Yazid","offset":833},{"uri":"Kharijite","surface_form":"Kharijite","offset":863},{"uri":"Berber_people","surface_form":"Berber","offset":873},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":898},{"uri":"17_May","surface_form":"17 May","offset":1025},{"uri":"946","surface_form":"946","offset":1032},{"uri":"Ismail_al-Mansur","surface_form":"Ismail al-Mansur","offset":1102}]}
