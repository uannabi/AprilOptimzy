It is 108.3 m high and 1,703 m wide.\nThe falls were discovered by David Livingstone in November 1855, where he viewed it on what is now known as Livingstone Island. He named it after Queen Victoria. The Chitonga name for the Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya. That word means \"the smoke that thunders.\" They call it that because the Falls are very misty.\nIt is listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":20},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":47},{"uri":"Zambezi_River","surface_form":"Zambezi River","offset":61},{"uri":"Zambia","surface_form":"Zambia","offset":93},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":114},{"uri":"David_Livingstone","surface_form":"David Livingstone","offset":190},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":307},{"uri":"Tonga_language_(Zambia)","surface_form":"Chitonga","offset":327},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoke","offset":394},{"uri":"Thunder","surface_form":"thunder","offset":405},{"uri":"Mist","surface_form":"mist","offset":461},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"UNESCO World Heritage Sites","offset":495}]}
