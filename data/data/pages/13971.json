{"id":13971,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven","text":"Heaven is a concept of the afterlife (what happens after somebody dies) in many religions. Some people who believe in heaven say that it is a place that is perfect. They believe heaven is where people will go after they die if they have been good. Some people also believe in Hell, which is a place where people will go when they die, if they have been bad. They believe hell is a punishment for being bad. Ideas of Heaven and Hell are not the same in all religions.\nIn Christianity.\nCatholics believe Mary is the Queen of Heaven, officially defined by Pope Pius XII in 1954. However many Protestants see this as not in the Bible.\nIn Islam.\nAccording to the Quran and Hadith, Heaven is a place of reward for those believers who accept the true faith and practices the teaching of Prophet Muhammad. The eternal life will be perfect, with thousands of types of food and clothing more beautiful than humans could ever imagine. There will also be no sad feelings, stress or pain and related problems of life.\nIn Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith.\nBaha'is believe that Heaven or (hell) being specific places as symbolic. The Aqdas, the holy book of Baha'is, along with other Baha'i books, describe heaven as a \"spiritual condition\" where being close to God is called heaven. Hell is seen as being separated from God. Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h, the founder of the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith, said that the afterlife is beyond human understanding.\nIn Paganism.\nSummerland is the name given by Wiccans and other Pagan (old European religions) to their belief of afterlife (life after death).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":12},{"uri":"Afterlife","surface_form":"afterlife","offset":27},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"dies","offset":66},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":80},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":96},{"uri":"Perfect","surface_form":"perfect","offset":156},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":276},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":381},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":484},{"uri":"Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","surface_form":"Mary","offset":502},{"uri":"Queen_of_Heaven","surface_form":"Queen of Heaven","offset":514},{"uri":"Pope_Pius_XII","surface_form":"Pope Pius XII","offset":553},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":589},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":624},{"uri":"Quran","surface_form":"Quran","offset":658},{"uri":"Hadith","surface_form":"Hadith","offset":668},{"uri":"Symbolic","surface_form":"symbolic","offset":1085},{"uri":"Aqdas","surface_form":"Aqdas","offset":1099},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":1249},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h","offset":1291},{"uri":"Afterlife","surface_form":"afterlife","offset":1351},{"uri":"The_Summerland","surface_form":"Summerland","offset":1405}]}
