Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales was formed by the province of Roussillon and Fenouill\u00E8des (), a small piece of territory which had formerly been on the southern edge of Languedoc.\nGeography.\nPyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales has an area of. It has the department of Aude to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, Spain to the south, and Andorra and the department of Ari\u00E8ge to the west.\nThe department is dominated by the Pyrenees mountain range. The highest mountain is Pic Carlit () that is high. The best known mountain in the department is Le Canigou () that is high.\nThere are three main rivers in the department: from north to south, Agly, T\u00EAt (the largest river of the department) and Tech; the Agly has its source in the Corbi\u00E8res hills, in the southern part of the Aude department. The other two river has their sources in the Pyrenees. The three rivers flow into the eastern Plain of Roussillon before they flow into the Mediterranean Sea.\nMost of the population and agricultural production are concentrated in the Plain of Roussillon, with only 30% of the area.\nLl\u00EDvia is a town of Cerdanya, province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain, that forms a Spanish exclave surrounded by French territory.\nAdministration.\nThe d\u00E9partement is managed by the \"Departamental Council of the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales\" in Perpignan. The Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales is part of the region of Occitanie.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe area is traditionally divided into comarques, of which five (French Cerdagne, Capcir, Conflent, Roussillon and Vallespir) are historically Catalan-speaking and one (Fenouill\u00E8des) is historically Occitan-speaking.\nThere are 3 \"arrondissements\" (districts), 17 \"cantons\" and 226 \"communes\" (municipalities) in the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales.\nDemographics.\nPyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales has a population, in 2014, of 466,327, for a population density of inhabitants/km2. The \"arrondissement\" of Perpignan, with 349,959 inhabitants, is by far the largest. The other two, Ceret and Prades, have respectively 73,192 and 43,176 inhabitants.\nThe only important city is Perpignan with 120,605 people living there in 2012. The subprefectures C\u00E9ret and Prades have 7,663 and 5,927, respectively.\nEvolution of the population in Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales\nThe inhabitants of Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales are known, in French, as \"Pyr\u00E9naliens\" (women: \"Pyr\u00E9naliennes\") or \"Catalans\" (women: \"Catalanes\").\nFrench is spoken by almost all the population. Minority languages in the region are Catalan and Occitan, which between them are estimated to be spoken by rather more than a quarter of the population and understood by more than 40%.\nOn 10 December 2007, the \"Departamental Council of the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales\" recognized Catalan as a regional language of the department, though French is still the only official language in France, according to the Constitution.\nEconomy.\nPyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales is a wine-growing area and a tourist destination.\nThe area is famous for its wine with the predominately red grape varieties
