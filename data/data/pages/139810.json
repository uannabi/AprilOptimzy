{"id":139810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwentendorf_power_plant","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Zwentendorf power plant is a nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf an der Donau in Austria. It has never been used. This is because the people of Austria voted against using it in 1978.\nToday, the plant is used to get replacement parts to other plants of the same type (mainly in Germany), and for staff training. It is not possible to visit the power plant. Because the nuclear power plant was never in use, a coal power plant was built in 1987 to replace it.\nThe plant is now owned by Austrian energy company and used as a Solar Power Plant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nuclear_power_plant","surface_form":"nuclear power plant","offset":46},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":97},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":168},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":294},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":425},{"uri":"Solar_Power_Plant","surface_form":"Solar Power Plant","offset":539}]}
