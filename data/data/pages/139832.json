He helped establish the fields of comparative anatomy and paleontology by comparing living animals with fossils. He proved extinction was a fact. He was the most influential person believing in catastrophism in geology in the early 19th century. His most famous work is the \"R\u00E8gne animal distribu\u00E9 d'apr\u00E8s son organisation\" 1817; translated into English as \"The Animal Kingdom\".\nCuvier was a member of the elite Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise and the French Academy of Sciences. He is remembered for strongly opposing the evolutionary theories of Lamarck and Geoffroy. Cuvier believed there was no evidence for the evolution of organic forms, but there was evidence for successive creations after catastrophic extinction events.\nSome of Cuvier's most influential followers were Louis Agassiz, and Richard Owen. His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\nHe was the elder brother of Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Cuvier (1773\u20131838), also a naturalist. Cuvier died in Paris, of cholera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":115},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":122},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":137},{"uri":"Comparative_anatomy","surface_form":"comparative anatomy","offset":279},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"paleontology","offset":303},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":349},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":368},{"uri":"Catastrophism","surface_form":"catastrophism","offset":439},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":456},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise","offset":657},{"uri":"French_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"French Academy of Sciences","offset":684},{"uri":"Evolutionary","surface_form":"evolutionary","offset":755},{"uri":"Lamarck","surface_form":"Lamarck","offset":780},{"uri":"Geoffroy","surface_form":"Geoffroy","offset":792},{"uri":"Extinction_event","surface_form":"extinction event","offset":943},{"uri":"Louis_Agassiz","surface_form":"Louis Agassiz","offset":1011},{"uri":"Richard_Owen","surface_form":"Richard Owen","offset":1030},{"uri":"Eiffel_Tower","surface_form":"Eiffel Tower","offset":1088},{"uri":"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Cuvier","surface_form":"Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Cuvier","offset":1130},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1193},{"uri":"Cholera","surface_form":"cholera","offset":1203}]}
