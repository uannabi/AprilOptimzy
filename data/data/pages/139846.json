{"id":139846,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform","text":"Chloroform (also called trichloromethane) is a chemical substance. It is an organic compound. Chloroform is one of the intermediate substances that occur in the production of Polytetrafluoroethylene, better known as \"Teflon\". Chloroform is used as a solvent. In the 19th century, it was a widely used anaesthetic.\nHistory.\nThe first who reported to have produced Chloroform was the French chemist Eug\u00E8ne Soubeiran, in 1831. Soubeiran took acetone and ethanol, and used bleach powder for the reaction. The American physician Samuel Guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its \"deliciousness of flavor.\" Independently, Justus von Liebig also described it. Chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas. Starting in the 1850s factories made large amounts. Its use as an anesthetic declined in the early 20th century as safer chemicals were more used.\nProduction.\nChloroform is produced by mixing methane and chlorine at a temperature of 400 to 500\u00B0C. In this reaction, the result is a mix of chloromethane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane.\nThe four compounds get then separated with a distillation.\nIn laboratories, chloroform can be produced by mixing sodium hypochlorite and acetone together. This is an exothermic reaction, meaning it makes a lot of heat.\nProblems.\nChloroform was used as an anaesthetic during childbirth and surgery, from about 1847. It replaced ether which was used before. Chloroform is very poisonous, and can cause breathing problems, and problems with the heart. Death from chloroform can come from cardiac arrest. When Chloroform is stored for a longer time period, it can decay into Phosgene. Phosgene was a chemical weapon (poison gas) used during the First World War. Chloroform can cause birth defects and lead to miscarriages. It may cause cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_substance","surface_form":"chemical substance","offset":47},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":76},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compound","offset":84},{"uri":"Intermediate","surface_form":"intermediate","offset":119},{"uri":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","surface_form":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","offset":175},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":250},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":266},{"uri":"Anaesthetic","surface_form":"anaesthetic","offset":301},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":389},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A8ne_Soubeiran","surface_form":"Eug\u00E8ne Soubeiran","offset":397},{"uri":"Acetone","surface_form":"acetone","offset":439},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":451},{"uri":"Bleach","surface_form":"bleach","offset":469},{"uri":"Samuel_Guthrie_(U.S._physician)","surface_form":"Samuel Guthrie","offset":524},{"uri":"Gallon","surface_form":"gallon","offset":548},{"uri":"Justus_von_Liebig","surface_form":"Justus von Liebig","offset":632},{"uri":"Jean-Baptiste_Dumas","surface_form":"Jean-Baptiste Dumas","offset":730},{"uri":"1850s","surface_form":"1850s","offset":767},{"uri":"Anesthetic","surface_form":"anesthetic","offset":817},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":943},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":955},{"uri":"Degree_Celsius","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":994},{"uri":"Chemical_compounds","surface_form":"compounds","offset":1121},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distillation","offset":1157},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratories","offset":1174},{"uri":"Sodium_hypochlorite","surface_form":"sodium hypochlorite","offset":1225},{"uri":"Acetone","surface_form":"acetone","offset":1249},{"uri":"Exothermic_reaction","surface_form":"exothermic reaction","offset":1278},{"uri":"Diethyl_ether","surface_form":"ether","offset":1439},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1487},{"uri":"Cardiac_arrest","surface_form":"cardiac arrest","offset":1597},{"uri":"Phosgene","surface_form":"Phosgene","offset":1683},{"uri":"Chemical_weapon","surface_form":"chemical weapon","offset":1708},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":1753},{"uri":"Birth_defect","surface_form":"birth defect","offset":1791},{"uri":"Miscarriage","surface_form":"miscarriage","offset":1817},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1844}]}
