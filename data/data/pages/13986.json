{"id":13986,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_cancer","text":"e=\"preserve\">Testicular cancer is cancer in one or both testicles, a part of the male reproductive system. In the United States, about 8,000 to 9,000 people are diagnosed with the cancer every year. Every male has a 1 in 250 (four tenths of one percent, or 0.4%) chance of being diagnosed with it. It is most common among males aged 15-40 years. Testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers; more than 90%. This is most often achieved by removing one or both testicles. Even in the small number of cases where the cancer has spread widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 50%.\nSymptoms and early detection.\nBecause testicular cancer is curable (stage I can have a success rate of >95%) when detected early, experts recommend regular monthly testicular self-examination after a hot shower or bath, when the scrotum is looser. Men are advised to feel each testicle, feeling for pea-shaped lumps.\nHow bad the cancer is and whether it is present at all is often discovered through ultrasound of the testicles, x-rays, and/or CT scans. Blood tests are also used to identify and measure tumour markers that are only in a person's blood if they have testicular cancer. Biopsies should not be performed because it increases the risk of migrating cancer cells into the scrotum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":34},{"uri":"Testicle","surface_form":"testicle","offset":56},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":81},{"uri":"Testicular_self-examination","surface_form":"testicular self-examination","offset":775},{"uri":"Shower","surface_form":"shower","offset":815},{"uri":"Bath","surface_form":"bath","offset":825},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":840},{"uri":"Ultrasound","surface_form":"ultrasound","offset":1011},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"x-ray","offset":1040},{"uri":"CT_scan","surface_form":"CT scan","offset":1055},{"uri":"Tumour_marker","surface_form":"tumour marker","offset":1115},{"uri":"Biopsy","surface_form":"Biopsies","offset":1196}]}
