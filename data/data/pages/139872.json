{"id":139872,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Paresthesia (pron.; paraesthesia in British English, pron.) is a feeling of tingling, prickling, or numbness with no permanent effects. It is commonly called \"pins and needles\". This feeling may last a short while, or may be more long-lasting. A long-term effect means there is something wrong with neurons in the body.\nAn example of this can be felt when sitting cross-legged for a long time and your foot \"falls asleep\". The tingling feeling you get when you move is paresthesia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":49},{"uri":"Neuron","surface_form":"neuron","offset":312},{"uri":"Lotus_position","surface_form":"cross-legged","offset":377}]}
