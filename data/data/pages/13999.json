{"id":13999,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit","text":"=\"preserve\">Shit is a slang term for feces. Shit is a swear word (an offensive, rude, or impolite word) to the majority English speakers. As such, it can mean bad things other than feces, depending on the context. It can be used as an angry exclaimation/insult, and can sometimes be an adjective (referring to something being of low quality) and a verb (as in the action of producing feces) The variant form bullshit is a slang term with meanings that include nonsense and lies.\nThe general etymology of this is from the three words (of different languages): Old English \"scitte\", Dutch \"schijiten\", German \"schiessen\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":22},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":37},{"uri":"Profanity","surface_form":"swear word","offset":54},{"uri":"Rude","surface_form":"rude","offset":80},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":98},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":120},{"uri":"Context_(language)","surface_form":"context","offset":205},{"uri":"Anger","surface_form":"angry","offset":235},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":286},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":348},{"uri":"Bullshit","surface_form":"bullshit","offset":408},{"uri":"Etymology","surface_form":"etymology","offset":491}]}
