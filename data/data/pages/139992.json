{"id":139992,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)","text":"=\"preserve\">Objectivity is a philosophical opinion or method that believes that reality exists outside of the human mind. People can separate their own ideas and opinions from the observations they make. Objective observations are true no matter who makes the observation. Being objective helps people focus on things that everyone can agree on.\nThe Scientific method claims objectivity but see epistemology, the philosophy of science and the work of Karl Popper. The opposite of objectivity is subjectivity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophical","offset":29},{"uri":"Reality","surface_form":"reality","offset":80},{"uri":"Scientific_method","surface_form":"Scientific method","offset":350},{"uri":"Epistemology","surface_form":"epistemology","offset":395},{"uri":"Philosophy_of_science","surface_form":"philosophy of science","offset":413},{"uri":"Karl_Popper","surface_form":"Karl Popper","offset":451},{"uri":"Subjectivity","surface_form":"subjectivity","offset":495}]}
