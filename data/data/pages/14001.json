{"id":14001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt","text":"=\"preserve\">Cunt is an abusive word that is used against people as an insult. It can also be slang for the vagina or vulva.\nUnlike many words of profanity that came from Anglo-Saxon, this word came from a Latin one (\"cuneus\", meaning a wedge shape). After the Norman invasion of England, it replaced the native word for vagina, 'm\u00E6g\u00FEbl\u00E6d'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abuse","surface_form":"abusive","offset":23},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":93},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":107},{"uri":"Vulva","surface_form":"vulva","offset":117},{"uri":"Profanity","surface_form":"profanity","offset":145},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":170},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":205},{"uri":"Wedge","surface_form":"wedge","offset":236},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Norman","offset":260},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":279}]}
