{"id":140054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election","text":"The United States presidential election of 2000 was a contest between Democratic candidate Al Gore, then-Vice President, and Republican candidate George W. Bush, then-governor of Texas and son of former president George H. W. Bush.\nIncumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was not eligible to serve a third term, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination. Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination, and despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Many third party candidates also ran, most prominently Ralph Nader. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, and Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, though foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore did not often campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky scandal two years prior.\nBush narrowly won the November 7 election, with 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. There was a disagreement over who won Florida's 25 electoral votes, the recount that happened there, and the uncommon event that the winner got fewer popular votes than the loser. The Court's contentious decision in Bush v. Gore announced on December 12, 2000, ended the recounts, effectively awarding Florida's votes to Bush and granting him the victory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":70},{"uri":"Al_Gore","surface_form":"Al Gore","offset":91},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President","offset":105},{"uri":"United_States_Republican_Party","surface_form":"Republican","offset":125},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
