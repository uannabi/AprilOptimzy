{"id":140059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election","text":"The United States presidential election of 2004 is a political event which took place on November 2, 2004. During that day the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States were selected. President George W. Bush won against Democratic Party candidate John Kerry, the junior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. Foreign policy was the biggest issue during the election campaign, mainly, the War on Terrorism and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSince the last presidential election, there were concerns about voting. The winner was not determined until the following day, when Kerry decided not to dispute Bush's win in the state of Ohio. The state held enough electoral votes to determine the winner of the presidency. Both Kerry and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean have stated their opinion that voting in Ohio did not proceed fairly and that, had it done so, the Democratic ticket might have won that state and therefore the election.\nOnly three states changed political parties. New Mexico and Iowa voted Democratic in 2000, but those states Republican in 2004. New Hampshire voted Republican in 2000 but the state voted Democratic in 2004. In the Electoral College, Bush received 286 votes, and Kerry received 252 votes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":53},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":144},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
