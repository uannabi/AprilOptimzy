{"id":14012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumoconiosis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pneumoconiosis is a form of occupational lung disease that is not infective. It is a progressive (gets worse with time) degenerative disorder. It is caused by air pollution in the form of tiny particles. It was common among coal miners, who inhaled coal dust regularly.\nAnother type of pneumoconiosis is 'asbestosis', caused by inhaling asbestos fibres. A third type is caused by inhaling very small silica particles, called 'silicosis'. All forms of pneuomoconiosis shorten life, and have no cure.\nLong name.\nPneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by the breathing-in of very small particles of sand or quartz dust found in volcanoes. It was first seen in the Oxford English Dictionary, in 1936. It is \"an artificial long word\", invented by in 1935 by Everett Smith, president of the National Puzzlers' League (N.P.L.), at its annual meeting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":54},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":59},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infective","offset":79},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":172},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":237},{"uri":"Miner","surface_form":"miner","offset":242},{"uri":"Asbestosis","surface_form":"asbestosis","offset":318},{"uri":"Asbestos","surface_form":"asbestos","offset":350},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":413},{"uri":"Silicosis","surface_form":"silicosis","offset":439},{"uri":"Breathe","surface_form":"breathing","offset":601},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":641},{"uri":"Quartz","surface_form":"quartz","offset":649},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":670},{"uri":"Oxford_English_Dictionary","surface_form":"Oxford English Dictionary","offset":706}]}
