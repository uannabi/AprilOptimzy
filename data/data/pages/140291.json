It then came to be used for a range of light tints of yellow chosen for their neutral or pale warm colored appearance.\nIn the 1920s, the meaning of the term \"beige\" expanded to the point where it is now also used for not only for pale yellows but also for a wide range of pale brown shades.\nThe first recorded use of \"beige\" as a color name in English was in 1887.\nThe color beige means neutral, calm, and relaxing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":27},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"fabric","offset":78},{"uri":"Tint","surface_form":"tint","offset":157},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":389}]}
