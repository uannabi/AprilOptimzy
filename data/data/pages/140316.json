{"id":140316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Only_You_Were_Lonely","text":"\"If Only You Were Lonely\" is the second album released by Hawthorne Heights. Many listeners consider the album more on the dark side, than the first Hawthorne Heights album.\nThe album includes a few songs where death growls are absent, and others where it is only used in a small part of the song, to make it fit better. Previously, they would use these harsh vocals a lot more.\nIt had three singles: \"Saying Sorry\", \"This is Who We Are\" and \"Pens and Needles\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":40},{"uri":"Hawthorne_Heights","surface_form":"Hawthorne Heights","offset":58},{"uri":"Death_growl","surface_form":"death growl","offset":211},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"singles","offset":392},{"uri":"Saying_Sorry","surface_form":"Saying Sorry","offset":402}]}
