Often, the required output signal is another real-world analog signal, which requires a digital-to-analog converter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Digital_signal","surface_form":"digital signal","offset":68},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"analog signal","offset":87},{"uri":"Analog-to-digital_converter","surface_form":"analog to digital","offset":124},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":179},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":213},{"uri":"Sensor","surface_form":"sensor","offset":238},{"uri":"Digital_image_processing","surface_form":"digital image processing","offset":263},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"real-world analog","offset":319},{"uri":"Analog-to-digital_converter","surface_form":"analog-to-digital converter","offset":459},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"real-world analog","offset":533},{"uri":"Digital-to-analog_converter","surface_form":"digital-to-analog converter","offset":576}]}
