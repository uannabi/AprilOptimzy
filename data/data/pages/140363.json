{"id":140363,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_dart_frog","text":"The golden dart frog (\"Phyllobates terribilis\") is a poison dart frog. It lives in the Pacific coast of Colombia.\nIn captivity, poison dart frogs are not poisonous. It is in the wild where they are poisonous because of what they eat. This amphibian of the Dendrobatidae family is considered the most poisonous vertebrate in the world. The optimal habitat of \"P. terribilis\" is the rainforest with high rain rates (5 m. or more), altitude between 100-200 m, temperature of 26\u00A0\u00B0C, and relative humidity of 80-90%.\nThe high toxicity of \"P. terribilis\" may be due to eating small insects or other arthropods, and one of these may truly be the most poisonous creature on Earth. Scientists have suggested the crucial insect may be a small beetle from the family Melyridae. At least one species of these beetles produces the same toxin found in \"P. terribilis\". Their relatives in Colombian rainforests could be the source of the batrachotoxins found in the highly toxic \"Phyllobates\" frogs of that region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poison_dart_frog","surface_form":"poison dart frog","offset":53},{"uri":"Pacific","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":87},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":95},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":104},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":239},{"uri":"Dendrobatidae","surface_form":"Dendrobatidae","offset":256},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":310},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":381},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":576},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":593},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":733},{"uri":"Melyridae","surface_form":"Melyridae","offset":756}]}
