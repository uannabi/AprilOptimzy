{"id":140467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter","text":"An analog-to-digital converter (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic integrated circuit that converts a continuous quantity to a discrete time digital number. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement. The reverse operation is performed by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).\nTypically, an ADC is an electronic device that converts an input analog voltage or current to a digital number. The size of the number grows with an increase in the input voltage or current. However, some non-electronic or only partially electronic devices, such as rotary encoders, can also be considered ADCs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":70},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":81},{"uri":"Continuous_signal","surface_form":"continuous quantity","offset":116},{"uri":"Discrete_signal","surface_form":"discrete time","offset":141},{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":155},{"uri":"Digital-to-analog_converter","surface_form":"digital-to-analog converter","offset":260},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":319},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":367},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":378},{"uri":"Rotary_encoder","surface_form":"rotary encoder","offset":561}]}
