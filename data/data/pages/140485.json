Two main goals of the Great Society were to end poverty and to end racial discrimination. New major spending programs that dealt with education, medical care, urban problems, and transportation were started during this period. The Great Society was like the New Deal domestic plan of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but had very different programs.\nUnlike the New Deal, The Great Society focused more on people rather than the economy. Medicaid and Medicare were implemented to help poor Americans. President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society was the largest expansion of spending programs since the Great Depression. Many of the programs that exist can be attributed to the passage of the Great Society.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":79},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":96},{"uri":"Lyndon_B._Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon B.
