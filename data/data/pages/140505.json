{"id":140505,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(movie)","text":"\"A Clockwork Orange\" is a 1971 British-American crime drama thriller movie. It was written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. It is based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 short novel \"A Clockwork Orange\". It includes disturbing, violent images. Its social commentary touches on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian vision of a not-too-future Britain.\nKubrick stopped the film being shown in Britain, concerned about its possible effects. For 27 years it was difficult to see the film in the United Kingdom. It reappeared in cinemas, and the VHS and DVD releases followed, soon after Kubrick's death in 1999.\nAwards and honors.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":31},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":39},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":48},{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama","offset":54},{"uri":"Thriller_(genre)","surface_form":"thriller","offset":60},{"uri":"Stanley_Kubrick","surface_form":"Stanley Kubrick","offset":117},{"uri":"Anthony_Burgess","surface_form":"Anthony Burgess","offset":149},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":177},{"uri":"A_Clockwork_Orange","surface_form":"A Clockwork Orange","offset":184},{"uri":"Psychiatry","surface_form":"psychiatry","offset":278},{"uri":"Gang","surface_form":"gang","offset":296},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":313},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":321},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":336},{"uri":"Dystopia","surface_form":"dystopia","offset":359},{"uri":"VHS","surface_form":"VHS","offset":595},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":603},{"uri":"American_Film_Institute","surface_form":"American Film Institute","offset":681}]}
