He is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story.\nHe was an apprentice of Flaubert. Maupassant's stories have a common economy of style and their efficient, effortless d\u00E9nouement (ending). Many of the stories are set during the Franco-Prussian War. Many more describe the war. He also wrote six short novels.\n\"Boule de Suif\" (Ball of Fat)\nThe Dead Girl (a.k.a. \"Was it a Dream?\")\nThe Man with the Pale Eyes\nNo Quarter (French Le p\u00E8re Milon)\nThe Story of a Farm Girl","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"5_August","surface_form":"5 August","offset":19},{"uri":"1850","surface_form":"1850","offset":28},{"uri":"6_July","surface_form":"6 July","offset":35},{"uri":"1893","surface_form":"1893","offset":42},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":62},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":75},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":82},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short story","offset":140},{"uri":"Apprentice","surface_form":"apprentice","offset":163},{"uri":"Gustave_Flaubert","surface_form":"Flaubert","offset":177},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":222},{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":233},{"uri":"Efficiency","surface_form":"efficient","offset":249},{"uri":"Effortless","surface_form":"effortless","offset":260},{"uri":"D%C3%A9nouement","surface_form":"d\u00E9nouement","offset":271},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":331},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":375},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":404}]}
