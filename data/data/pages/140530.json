{"id":140530,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soggy_biscuit","text":"e=\"preserve\">Soggy biscuit (also called limp biscuit, crispy cookie, ookie cookie, or jizzcuit) is a masturbation game played mostly by teenage groups in which the participants stand around a biscuit masturbating until ejaculating onto it; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit. The term is thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the 1960s.\nAlthough the way its spelled may differ slightly, the notability of the game is shown by the variations on the being referred to in popular culture, examples including Stephen Fry's \"The Liar\", the German movie \"Crazy\", the 2006 film Sleeping Dogs Lie, the \"Chains\" episode of Blackadder II, the \"Freaks & Greeks\" episode of Drawn Together (2004-2006), the \"Sleepover\" episode of Big Mouth, Limp Bizkit, and Skinless's song \"Scum Cookie\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Masturbation","surface_form":"masturbation","offset":101},{"uri":"Teenage","surface_form":"teenage","offset":136},{"uri":"Biscuit","surface_form":"biscuit","offset":192},{"uri":"Ejaculation","surface_form":"ejaculating","offset":219},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":329},{"uri":"Stephen_Fry","surface_form":"Stephen Fry","offset":530},{"uri":"The_Liar","surface_form":"The Liar","offset":545},{"uri":"Crazy_(film)","surface_form":"Crazy","offset":574},{"uri":"Sleeping_Dogs_Lie","surface_form":"Sleeping Dogs Lie","offset":596},{"uri":"Blackadder_II","surface_form":"Blackadder II","offset":639},{"uri":"Drawn_Together","surface_form":"Drawn Together","offset":687},{"uri":"Big_Mouth","surface_form":"Big Mouth","offset":742},{"uri":"Limp_Bizkit","surface_form":"Limp Bizkit","offset":753},{"uri":"Skinless","surface_form":"Skinless","offset":770}]}
