{"id":140548,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix","text":"Ferdinand Victor Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix (26 April 1798 \u2013 13 August 1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nIn contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Th\u00E9odore G\u00E9ricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \"forces of the sublime\", of nature in often violent action.\nHowever, Delacroix was given neither to sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\"\nDelacroix was a member of the Club des Hashischins, or Hashish Club. This group of French writers experimented with hashish to get ideas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":73},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":80},{"uri":"Impressionist","surface_form":"Impressionist","offset":304},{"uri":"Symbolism_(arts)","surface_form":"Symbolist","offset":381},{"uri":"Lithograph","surface_form":"lithograph","offset":408},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":461},{"uri":"Sir_Walter_Scott","surface_form":"Sir Walter Scott","offset":502},{"uri":"Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","surface_form":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","offset":542},{"uri":"Neoclassicism","surface_form":"Neoclassical","offset":589},{"uri":"Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres","surface_form":"Ingres","offset":635},{"uri":"Peter_Paul_Rubens","surface_form":"Rubens","offset":689},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":725},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault","surface_form":"Th\u00E9odore G\u00E9ricault","offset":1075},{"uri":"Byron","surface_form":"Byron","offset":1126},{"uri":"Baudelaire","surface_form":"Baudelaire","offset":1380},{"uri":"Club_des_Hashischins","surface_form":"Club des Hashischins","offset":1538},{"uri":"Hashish","surface_form":"hashish","offset":1624}]}
