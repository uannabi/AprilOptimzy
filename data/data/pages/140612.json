{"id":140612,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set","text":"e=\"preserve\">An instruction set, or instruction set architecture (ISA), \u00A0is a list of all the commands (instructions), with all their variations, that a processor can execute.\nInstruction set architecture is distinguished from microarchitecture. Microarchitecture is the detailed description of the system that is enough for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computing system, as well as how they are inter-connected and inter-operate to implement the ISA. An instruction set is the part of the computer architecture related to programming. An ISA includes a specification set of opcodes (machine language), which are the native commands implemented in a particular central processing unit design.\nComputers with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set. For example, the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but they are very different in internal designs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Instruction_(computer_science)","surface_form":"instructions","offset":104},{"uri":"Microarchitecture","surface_form":"microarchitecture","offset":227},{"uri":"Computer_architecture","surface_form":"computer architecture","offset":517},{"uri":"Programming","surface_form":"programming","offset":550},{"uri":"Opcode","surface_form":"opcodes","offset":602},{"uri":"Machine_language","surface_form":"machine language","offset":611},{"uri":"Central_processing_unit","surface_form":"central processing unit","offset":688},{"uri":"Microarchitecture","surface_form":"microarchitectures","offset":745},{"uri":"Intel","surface_form":"Intel","offset":817},{"uri":"Pentium","surface_form":"Pentium","offset":823},{"uri":"AMD","surface_form":"AMD","offset":839},{"uri":"X86","surface_form":"x86","offset":893}]}
