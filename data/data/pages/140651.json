{"id":140651,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer","text":"e=\"preserve\">A One Instruction Set Computer (OISC) is an abstract computer that uses only one instruction (with no need for a machine language opcode). Such computers are the extreme case or the logical conclusion of Reduced instruction set computers, although the concept has been used only in academic circles, as a teaching aid like the URISC.\nThe Ultimate RISC (URISC) is the name given by researchers at the University of Waterloo in the city of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, to their implementation of a single-instruction computer. URISC allows complete description of a fully functional computer, in only a few pages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abstract","surface_form":"abstract","offset":57},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":66},{"uri":"Instruction_(computer_science)","surface_form":"instruction","offset":94},{"uri":"Machine_language","surface_form":"machine language","offset":126},{"uri":"Opcode","surface_form":"opcode","offset":143},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":157},{"uri":"Reduced_instruction_set_computer","surface_form":"Reduced instruction set computer","offset":217},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":295},{"uri":"Study_circle","surface_form":"circles","offset":304},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":394},{"uri":"University_of_Waterloo","surface_form":"University of Waterloo","offset":413},{"uri":"Waterloo%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Waterloo","offset":451},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":461},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":470},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":592}]}
