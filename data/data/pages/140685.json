{"id":140685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog","text":"The Bulldog, known as the British Bulldog or English Bulldog, is a medium-size breed of dog that originated in England.\nDescription.\nThese dogs are medium in size, but wide and compact with thick, massive heads. Their muzzle is short and pug. Their coat comes in many colors, including fawn, white, black and brindle. Black is not a desired color in the show ring but not a disqualification. The dog is recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC). The dog's nose is made for it to bite a bull's nose and not let go. Because their stocky legs are set squarely at each corner of the compact, muscular body, the Bulldog's gait has become a waddle.\nThey are good family pets, known for their courage and their ability to be a good guard dog. Much human attention is needed for a Bulldog to be happy. These dogs do not need much exercise or grooming except for the face, which should be wiped daily in the face folds with a damp cloth. They weigh. They stand at the shoulders.\nThe bulldog was originally bred to fight bulls during the 1600s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":79},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":88},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":111},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coat","offset":249},{"uri":"Brindle","surface_form":"brindle","offset":309},{"uri":"American_Kennel_Club","surface_form":"American Kennel Club","offset":421},{"uri":"Bull","surface_form":"bull","offset":489},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":667},{"uri":"Guard_dog","surface_form":"guard dog","offset":728},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"bred","offset":1000},{"uri":"Bull","surface_form":"bull","offset":1014},{"uri":"1600s","surface_form":"1600s","offset":1031}]}
