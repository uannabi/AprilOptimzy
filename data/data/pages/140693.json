{"id":140693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Turkey","text":"The flag of Turkey () has a white crescent moon and a star on a red background. The flag is called \"Ay Y\u0131ld\u0131z\" (literally, moon star) or \"Alsancak\" (red banner) in Turkish.\nThe flag has a complex origin since it is an ancient design, and uses the same symbols of the late flag of the Ottoman Empire which was adopted in 1844 with the Tanzimat reforms; though the shape, placement and shade of the color varies. The geometric proportions of the flag were legally standardized with the Turkish Flag Law in 1936. The shade of red used in the flag is approximated by Pantone 186, or RGB (227, 10, 23).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":12},{"uri":"Lunar_phase","surface_form":"crescent moon","offset":34},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":54},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":64},{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":164},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":177},{"uri":"Ottoman_flag","surface_form":"the late flag of the Ottoman Empire","offset":263},{"uri":"Tanzimat","surface_form":"Tanzimat","offset":334},{"uri":"Pantone","surface_form":"Pantone","offset":563},{"uri":"RGB_color_model","surface_form":"RGB","offset":579}]}
