{"id":140694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia","text":"The flag of Saudi Arabia is the flag used by the government of Saudi Arabia since March 15, 1973. It is a green flag featuring in white an Arabic inscription and a sword.\nThe sword, symbolizes the importance of the inscription by underlining it.\nGreen flags with this or other Arabic scripts are commonly seen in Islam. They should not be confused with the Saudi national flag. These other flags normally do not have the sword symbol.\nThe flag is made so that the \"shahada\" reads correctly, from right to left, from either side. The sword points from hoist to fly on both sides. The flag is sinister hoisted. This means that the obverse side (front) has the hoist side (flagpole side) to the right.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":32},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":49},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":63},{"uri":"March_15","surface_form":"March 15","offset":82},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":92},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":139},{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":164},{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":175},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":182},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":277},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":313},{"uri":"Sinister_hoisted","surface_form":"sinister hoisted","offset":591}]}
