{"id":140775,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Kerberos (pronounced \"kur-ber-uhs\") is a computer network authentication protocol, which allows people communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. It is also a suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that implements this protocol. Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model, and it provides mutual authentication \u2014 both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks.\nKerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read, modified, and inserted. Kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a key distribution center. Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication.\nHistory and development.\nMIT developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena. The protocol was named after the Greek mythological character \"Kerberos\" (or \"Cerberus\"), known in Greek mythology as being the monstrous three-headed guard dog of Hades. Several versions of the protocol exist; versions 1\u20133 used only internally at MIT.\nSteve Miller and [http://clifford.neuman.name/ Clifford Neuman], the primary designers of Kerberos version 4 (which used the DES encryption algorithm with 56-bit keys),\npublished that version in 1989, although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena.\nVersion 5, designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman, appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993 (made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005), with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of Version 4. The MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos Version 5 freely available, under a software license similar to that used by BSD license.\nIn 2007, MIT formed the [http://www.kerberos.org Kerberos Consortium] for continuation of development.\nProtocol.\nKerberos uses as its basis the Needham-Schroeder protocol. It makes use of a trusted third party authentication known as \"key distribution center (KDC)\", which consists of two logically separate parts: an Authentication Server (AS) and a Ticket Granting Server (TGS). Kerberos works on the basis of \"tickets\" (called Kerberos tickets) which serve to prove the identity of users.\nKerberos database: The key distribution center (KDC) maintains a database of secret keys; each entity on the network \u2014 whether a client or a server \u2014 shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC. Knowledge of this key serves to prove the identity of each entity. For communication between two entities, the KDC generates a session key which they can use to secure their communications.\nThe term \"Kerberos server\" generally refers to the KDC. For reliability purposes, it is possible to have backup KDCs. These are referred to as \"Kerberos slave servers\". All slaves synchronize their databases from the master Kerberos server.\nThe term \"Kerberized application server\" generally refers to Kerberized programs that clients communicate with using Kerberos tickets for authentication. For example, the Kerberos telnet server is an example of a Kerberized application server. While the term \"Kerberized applications\" is used to referrer to the client side of Kerberized application server, For example, the Kerberos telnet client is an example of a Kerberized applications\nSimplified description of the protocol.\nBriefly, the client authenticates to AS using a long-term \"shared secret\" and receives a ticket from the AS. Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS using the same shared secret. These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"computer network","offset":55},{"uri":"Authentication","surface_form":"authentication","offset":72},{"uri":"Cryptographic_protocol","surface_form":"protocol","offset":87},{"uri":"Secure_channel","surface_form":"non-secure","offset":138},{"uri":"Security","surface_form":"secure","offset":201},{"uri":"Software_suite","surface_form":"suite","offset":229},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software","offset":238},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","offset":265},{"uri":"Client-server","surface_form":"client-server","offset":375},{"uri":"Mutual_authentication","surface_form":"mutual authentication","offset":412},{"uri":"User_(computing)","surface_form":"user","offset":445},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":458},{"uri":"Replay_attack","surface_form":"replay attack","offset":555},{"uri":"Authentication","surface_form":"authentication","offset":589},{"uri":"Trusted_third_party","surface_form":"trusted third party","offset":609},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptographic","offset":661},{"uri":"Shared_secret","surface_form":"shared secret","offset":675},{"uri":"Security","surface_form":"insecure","offset":743},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric-key cryptography","offset":816},{"uri":"Key_distribution_center","surface_form":"key distribution center","offset":858},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public-key cryptography","offset":933},{"uri":"Authentication","surface_form":"authentication","offset":982},{"uri":"Project_Athena","surface_form":"Project Athena","offset":1086},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythological","offset":1135},{"uri":"Cerberus","surface_form":"Kerberos","offset":1165},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":1201},{"uri":"Monster","surface_form":"monstrous","offset":1230},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":1266},{"uri":"Software_versioning","surface_form":"versions","offset":1281},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":1432},{"uri":"Data_Encryption_Standard","surface_form":"DES","offset":1480},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":1484},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":1495},{"uri":"Project_Athena","surface_form":"Project Athena","offset":1600},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"MIT","offset":1825},{"uri":"Software_versioning","surface_form":"Version","offset":1865},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"freely","offset":1875},{"uri":"Software_license","surface_form":"software license","offset":1901},{"uri":"BSD_licence","surface_form":"BSD license","offset":1942},{"uri":"Needham-Schroeder_protocol","surface_form":"Needham-Schroeder protocol","offset":2099},{"uri":"Trusted_third_party","surface_form":"trusted third party","offset":2145},{"uri":"Key_distribution_center","surface_form":"key distribution center","offset":2190},{"uri":"Key_distribution_center","surface_form":"key distribution center","offset":2470},{"uri":"Client","surface_form":"client","offset":2576},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":2588},{"uri":"Shared_secret","surface_form":"shares a secret key","offset":2597},{"uri":"Session_key","surface_form":"session key","offset":2781},{"uri":"Security","surface_form":"secure","offset":2815},{"uri":"Technical_terminology","surface_form":"term","offset":2848},{"uri":"Reliability_(computer_networking)","surface_form":"reliability","offset":2904},{"uri":"Synchronization_(computer_science)","surface_form":"synchronize","offset":3024},{"uri":"Technical_terminology","surface_form":"term","offset":3089},{"uri":"Telnet","surface_form":"telnet","offset":3265},{"uri":"Technical_terminology","surface_form":"term","offset":3339},{"uri":"Client","surface_form":"client","offset":3397},{"uri":"Telnet","surface_form":"telnet","offset":3469},{"uri":"Client","surface_form":"client","offset":3579},{"uri":"Shared_secret","surface_form":"shared secret","offset":3625}]}
