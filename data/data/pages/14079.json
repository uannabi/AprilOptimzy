The summits are Makalu [left (8,462\u00A0metres; 27,765\u00A0feet)], Everest [middle (8,848\u00A0metres; 29,035\u00A0feet)], Lhotse [middle (8,516\u00A0metres; 27,939\u00A0feet)] and Cho Oyu right (8,201\u00A0metres; 26,906\u00A0feet)\nThe Himalayas are a mountain range in South Asia.\nThe west end is in Pakistan. They run through Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh states in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The east end is in the south of Tibet. They are divided into 3 parts Himadri, Himachal and Shiwaliks.\nThe 15 highest mountains in the world are in the Himalayas. The main ones are Mount Everest, K2, Annapurna, and Nanga Parbat. Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, at 8,849\u00A0meters. Of the fifteen highest mountain peaks in the World, nine are in the Nepali Himalayas.\nThe word \"Himalaya\" means \"House of Snow\" in Sanskrit, an old Indian language. The Himalayas are so high that they kept the Indian and Chinese people separate from each other most of the time. India is a peninsula that is cut off from the rest of Asia by the mountains. It is often called the Indian subcontinent because it is larger and more isolated than other peninsulas.\nNorth of the Himalayas is the Tibetan Plateau. It is called \u201Cthe roof of the world\u201D. However, the Tibetan Plateau is very dry because the plateau and the mountains act as a gigantic rain shadow. The rain falls instead on the south side of the mountains. This has greatly influenced the climate of the Indian subcontinent. Not only does it block the extremely cold winter winds blowing from Central Asia from entering Subcontinent, it also forces the Bay of Bengal Monsoon branch to shed its moisture along NE and Northern Indian States, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh.\nFormation of the Himalayas.\nGeologically, the origin of the Himalayas is the impact of the Indian tectonic plate. This travels northward at 15\u00A0cm per year, and joined the Eurasian continent about 40-50 million years ago. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in the lighter rock of the seabeds of that time being lifted up into mountains. An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone.\nThe Indian plate is still moving north at 67\u00A0mm per year. Over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500\u00A0km into Asia. About 20\u00A0mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5\u00A0mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also leads to earthquakes from time to time.\nWildlife.\nThe Himalayas are very popular for tourists because it has a lot of wildlife. The types of plants and trees, which are common in the place, are Oak, Pine, Fir, Rhododendron, Birch, Juniper, and Deodar. Common animals, which are seen mostly in the different parts of the Himalayas, are snow leopard<nowiki/>s, blue sheep, musk deer, tigers, elephants, wild boar, and crocodiles. Even endangered species of animals and plants are also found there. In the north part of the Himalayas where the temperature falls below freezing point, animals cannot survive well. However, those who adapted can survive. During the cold winters most of the animals migrate to the lower regions of the Himalayas while others like the brown bear hibernate instead. The Yak is mostly seen in the cold desert. They are like wild ox and they are the largest animals in this region. In regions of Ladakh animals like Nyan, the wild and the most largest sheep are found.\nFive main rivers.\nThe five main rivers of the Himalayas are the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Satluj. The rivers are the main source of human and animal life in those areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tibetan_Plateau","surface_form":"Tibetan Plateau","offset":120},{"uri":"Right_(8%2C201%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmetres%3B_26%2C906%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bfeet)","surface_form":"right (8,201\u00A0metres; 26,906\u00A0feet)","offset":298},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":352},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":376},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":401},{"uri":"Jammu_and_Kashmir","surface_form":"Jammu and Kashmir","offset":428},{"uri":"Himachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"Himachal Pradesh","offset":447},{"uri":"Uttarakhand","surface_form":"Uttarakhand","offset":465},{"uri":"Sikkim","surface_form":"Sikkim","offset":478},{"uri":"Arunachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"Arunachal Pradesh","offset":489},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":517},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":524},{"uri":"Bhutan","surface_form":"Bhutan","offset":535},{"uri":"Mount_Everest","surface_form":"Mount Everest","offset":723},{"uri":"K2","surface_form":"K2","offset":738},{"uri":"Annapurna","surface_form":"Annapurna","offset":742},{"uri":"Nanga_Parbat","surface_form":"Nanga Parbat","offset":757},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":967},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":984},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":1057},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":1126},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":1215},{"uri":"Tibetan_Plateau","surface_form":"Tibetan Plateau","offset":1327},{"uri":"Rain_shadow","surface_form":"rain shadow","offset":1479},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":1687},{"uri":"Monsoon","surface_form":"Monsoon","offset":1761},{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":1962},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":2311},{"uri":"Fault_(geology)","surface_form":"thrusting","offset":2518},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":2723},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":2799},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"wildlife","offset":2832},{"uri":"Oak","surface_form":"Oak","offset":2908},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"Pine","offset":2913},{"uri":"Fir","surface_form":"Fir","offset":2919},{"uri":"Rhododendron","surface_form":"Rhododendron","offset":2924},{"uri":"Birch_bark","surface_form":"Birch","offset":2938},{"uri":"Juniper","surface_form":"Juniper","offset":2945},{"uri":"Snow_leopard","surface_form":"snow leopard","offset":3049},{"uri":"Musk_deer","surface_form":"musk deer","offset":3085},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":3096},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":3104},{"uri":"Boar","surface_form":"wild boar","offset":3115},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":3130},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered species","offset":3147},{"uri":"Adapt","surface_form":"adapted","offset":3343},{"uri":"Migrate","surface_form":"migrate","offset":3408},{"uri":"Brown_bear","surface_form":"brown bear","offset":3476},{"uri":"Hibernation","surface_form":"hibernate","offset":3487},{"uri":"Yak","surface_form":"Yak","offset":3510},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":3541},{"uri":"Ox","surface_form":"ox","offset":3568},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":3690}]}
