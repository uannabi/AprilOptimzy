{"id":140813,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience","text":"e=\"preserve\">Civil disobedience is the active refusal to obey certain laws, demands and commands of a government, or of an occupying power, without resorting to physical violence. It is one of the primary tactics of nonviolent resistance.\nThe American author Henry David Thoreau pioneered the modern theory behind this practice in his 1849 essay \"Civil Disobedience\", originally titled \"Resistance to Civil Government\".\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi (also known as Mahatma Gandhi) used non-violent civil disobedience in South Africa in a campaign for civil rights for the people who came from India and lived in South Africa. This campaign was from 1893-1914. When Gandhi returned to India, he used civil disobedience in the campaign for the independence of India in 1930 from the British rule, when India was a British colony.\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and young activists in the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s also adopted civil disobedience techniques, during and after the Vietnam War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":70},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":102},{"uri":"Nonviolence","surface_form":"nonviolent","offset":216},{"uri":"Resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":227},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":243},{"uri":"Henry_David_Thoreau","surface_form":"Henry David Thoreau","offset":259},{"uri":"Civil_Disobedience_(Thoreau)","surface_form":"\"Civil Disobedience\"","offset":346},{"uri":"Mohandas_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi","offset":420},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":590},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":739},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":755},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British rule","offset":778},{"uri":"Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr","offset":825},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":880},{"uri":"Civil_Rights_Movement","surface_form":"Civil Rights Movement","offset":889},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":989}]}
