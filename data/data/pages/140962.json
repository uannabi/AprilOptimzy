{"id":140962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heatseekers_Albums","text":"e=\"preserve\">Heatseekers Albums (formerly Top Heatseekers) is a weekly music chart for albums introduced by \"Billboard\" in 1993. It was created to publish sales by new and developing musical recording artists. Albums that appear on Top Heatseekers may also appear on the \"Billboard\" 200 at the same time.\nTop Heatseekers contains fifty chart positions. Although the chart's rules have changed a little bit over the years, its current rules for an album to be allowed to enter \"Top Heatseekers\" say it needs to be one of the best-selling albums by a new or developing act (a band or musical artist), meaning an act that has never appeared in the top 100 of the \"Billboard\" 200. If an album on Heatseekers does enter the top 100 of the \"Billboard\" 200, it and any albums the act later releases are not eligible to appear on the Heatseekers chart. Many artists have bypassed Top Heatseekers because their first chart entry debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at position 100 or above.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_chart","surface_form":"music chart","offset":71},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":87},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":109},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":123},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publish","offset":147},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":271},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":574},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":590},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":660},{"uri":"Debut","surface_form":"debuted","offset":920}]}
