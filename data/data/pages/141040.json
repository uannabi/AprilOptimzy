Sasha Fierce\" - is the third solo studio album by American R&B singer Beyonc\u00E9.\nBackground.\nKnowles worked on the album for almost one year. This is longer than she had spent on her previous solo albums and records with her old group Destiny's Child. She said that she has co-written and co-produced over 70 songs.\nI am in a different place right now and I wanted people to see the many sides of me. The music is upbeat for the dance, fun side and it is reflective, passionate and serious for the personal side. I have taken risks here. I am not afraid and my music will explain it all. There is no label or tag on my sound. It's me and I am so excited to share it with the world on November 18.\nPlatinum edition.\nIn September 2009, an enhanced two-disc version of the album was released, its first disc featuring 16 tracks from the original version with four bonus audio tracks, and its second disc, the video collection from \"Above and Beyonc\u00E9\", including seven music videos.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":50},{"uri":"Rhythm_and_Blues","surface_form":"R&B","offset":68},{"uri":"Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles","surface_form":"Beyonc\u00E9","offset":79},{"uri":"Destiny%27s_Child","surface_form":"Destiny's Child","offset":242},{"uri":"Video_Collection_%26amp%3B_Dance_Mixes","surface_form":"Above and Beyonc\u00E9","offset":936},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":972}]}
