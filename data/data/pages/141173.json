{"id":141173,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC5","text":"In cryptography, RC5 is a simple symmetric-key block cipher. Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994, RC5 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. \"RC\" stands for \"Rivest Cipher\", or alternatively, \"Ron's Code\".\nIn order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels; RC5 has a variable block size (32, 64 or 128 bits), variable key size (0 to 2040 bits) and variable number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key and 12 rounds.\nA key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR (Xor)s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of \"nothing up my sleeve numbers\". The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts.\nCryptanalysis.\n12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts. 18\u201320 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.\nRSA Security, which has a patent on the algorithm, offered a series of US$10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5, but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007. A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing, organised by Distributed.net. Distributed.net has brute-forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56- and 64-bit keys, and now is working on cracking a 72-bit key. At the current rate (as of November 12, 2008), it will take approximately 1,000 years to test every possible key to complete the [http://stats.distributed.net/projects.php?project_id=8 project].","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":3},{"uri":"Symmetric-key_algorithm","surface_form":"symmetric-key","offset":33},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"block cipher","offset":47},{"uri":"Ron_Rivest","surface_form":"Ronald Rivest","offset":73},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":90},{"uri":"Parameter","surface_form":"parameter","offset":105},{"uri":"Block_size_(cryptography)","surface_form":"block size","offset":145},{"uri":"Key_size","surface_form":"key size","offset":168},{"uri":"Security","surface_form":"security","offset":309},{"uri":"Efficiency","surface_form":"efficiency","offset":322},{"uri":"Block_size_(cryptography)","surface_form":"block size","offset":360},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":386},{"uri":"Key_size","surface_form":"key size","offset":402},{"uri":"Permutation_box","surface_form":"rotations","offset":623},{"uri":"Block_cipher","surface_form":"block cipher","offset":698},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptographic","offset":717},{"uri":"Modular_arithmetic","surface_form":"modular","offset":775},{"uri":"Xor","surface_form":"eXclusive OR (Xor)","offset":797},{"uri":"Feistel_cipher","surface_form":"Feistel","offset":862},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":888},{"uri":"Decryption","surface_form":"decryption","offset":903},{"uri":"Key_schedule","surface_form":"key schedule","offset":968},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"key","offset":1022},{"uri":"One-way_function","surface_form":"one-way function","offset":1047},{"uri":"E_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"e","offset":1099},{"uri":"Golden_ratio","surface_form":"golden ratio","offset":1109},{"uri":"Nothing_up_my_sleeve_number","surface_form":"nothing up my sleeve number","offset":1137},{"uri":"Cryptanalysis","surface_form":"cryptanalysts","offset":1305},{"uri":"Differential_cryptanalysis","surface_form":"differential attack","offset":1389},{"uri":"RSA_Security","surface_form":"RSA Security","offset":1491},{"uri":"Ciphertext","surface_form":"ciphertext","offset":1592},{"uri":"Contest","surface_form":"contest","offset":1634},{"uri":"Distributed_computing","surface_form":"distributed computing","offset":1743},{"uri":"Distributed.net","surface_form":"Distributed.net","offset":1779},{"uri":"Brute_force_attack","surface_form":"brute-forced","offset":1816}]}
