{"id":141216,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal","text":"A scandal is a very public incident which involves a claim of wrong-doing, shame, or moral offence. A scandal may be about a real event, an untrue event (often called a) or a mixture of both. Something which is a scandal can be described as scandalous.\nScandals may be told by, who have access to secrets and allow them to go public. A well-known scandal was the Watergate scandal, in which US President Richard Nixon was found to be supporting and hiding illegal burglaries.\nUntrue claims often lead to a loss of respect for that person, and can destroy their careers. Sometimes an attempt to cover up a scandal creates a bigger scandal when the cover-up does not succeed.\nSometimes there are scandals surrounding people who work for the president such as during the Grant administration. The Iran-Contra affair was also a known scandal that surrounded Ronald Reagan and his administration. All were not-guilty of the crime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"public","offset":20},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"moral","offset":85},{"uri":"Watergate","surface_form":"Watergate","offset":363},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"US President","offset":391},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":404},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"careers","offset":561},{"uri":"Cover-up","surface_form":"cover up","offset":594},{"uri":"Ulysses_S._Grant","surface_form":"Grant administration","offset":768},{"uri":"Iran-Contra_affair","surface_form":"Iran-Contra affair","offset":794},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":854}]}
