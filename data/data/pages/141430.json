The melody is used as a musical motif throughout the movie, and the song is featured three times in the movie, twice performed by other artists in Spanish, and finally performed by Adams himself during the closing credits. The Adams version of the song, which features flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia, is featured on the soundtrack album and also on the album \"18 Til I Die\". It was at number one for five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making it the third number one song for the songwriting team, and went on to earn them their second Oscar nomination.\nVarious women's groups contacted Adams when the song became popular, which led to his publishing a series of books of photos, with all proceeds going to breast cancer research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bryan_Adams","surface_form":"Bryan Adams","offset":64},{"uri":"Michael_Kamen","surface_form":"Michael Kamen","offset":77},{"uri":"Robert_John_%26quot%3BMutt%26quot%3B_Lange","surface_form":"Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange","offset":95},{"uri":"Don_Juan_DeMarco","surface_form":"Don Juan DeMarco","offset":135},{"uri":"Paco_de_Lucia","surface_form":"Paco de Lucia","offset":442},{"uri":"Soundtrack","surface_form":"soundtrack","offset":476},{"uri":"18_Til_I_Die","surface_form":"18 Til I Die","offset":516},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"Billboard Hot 100","offset":574},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":599},{"uri":"Breast_cancer","surface_form":"breast cancer","offset":885}]}
