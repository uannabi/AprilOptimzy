{"id":14151,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a product is a number or a quantity obtained by multiplying two or more numbers together. For example: 4 \u00D7 7 = 28 Here, the number 28 is called the product of 4 and 7. As another example, the product of 6 and 4 is 24, because 6 times 4 is 24. The product of two positive numbers is positive, just as the product of two negative numbers is positive as well (e.g., -6 \u00D7 -4 = 24).\nPi product notation.\nA short way to write the product of many numbers is to use the capital Greek letter pi: formula_1. This notation (or way of writing) is in some ways similar to the Sigma notation of summation.\nInformally, given a sequence of numbers (or elements of a multiplicative structure with unit) say formula_1 we define formula_1. A rigorous definition is usually given recursively as follows\nAn alternative notation for formula_1 is formula_1.\nProperties.\nFrom the above equation, we can see that \"any\" number with an exponent can be represented by a product, though it normally is not desirable.\nUnlike summation, the sums of two terms cannot be separated into different sums.
