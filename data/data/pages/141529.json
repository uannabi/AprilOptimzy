{"id":141529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piper_at_the_Gates_of_Dawn","text":"\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" is Pink Floyd's first album. Many people think it is one of the most influential albums in history. It had a very big influence on the psychedelic rock scene of the time, and also on the music that people made afterward. It is the only Pink Floyd album with Syd Barrett as the leader, although Barrett was on some of the next album, \"A Saucerful of Secrets\".\nThe lyrics for \"Piper\" were mostly written by Syd Barrett, and are often whimsical, playful, or childlike. The album has songs about space, scarecrows, gnomes, bicycles and fairytales. Some parts of the album, like \"Interstellar Overdrive\", are instrumental and have no singing on them.\nSpecial limited editions of \"Piper\" were released to mark its 30th anniversary in 1997, and its 40th anniversary in 2007.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by Syd Barrett, except where noted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":36},{"uri":"Psychedelic_rock","surface_form":"psychedelic rock","offset":168},{"uri":"Syd_Barrett","surface_form":"Syd Barrett","offset":291},{"uri":"A_Saucerful_of_Secrets","surface_form":"A Saucerful of Secrets","offset":367},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"space","offset":525},{"uri":"Scarecrow","surface_form":"scarecrow","offset":532},{"uri":"Gnome","surface_form":"gnome","offset":544},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":552},{"uri":"Fairytale","surface_form":"fairytale","offset":565},{"uri":"Instrumental","surface_form":"instrumental","offset":637},{"uri":"Syd_Barrett","surface_form":"Syd Barrett","offset":837}]}
