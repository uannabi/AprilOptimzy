Mainly Islamic countries have pointed out that its understanding is mainly that of Christians or Jews. Muslims could not implement certain parts of the declaration, without trespassing Islamic law. On 30 June 2000, Muslim nations that are members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, an alternative document that says people have \"freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari\u2019ah\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":105},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":159},{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":175},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":225},{"uri":"December_10","surface_form":"December 10","offset":303},{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":316},{"uri":"Initialism","surface_form":"initialism","offset":332},{"uri":"Translate","surface_form":"translate","offset":389},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":414},{"uri":"Guinness_Book_of_World_Records","surface_form":"Guinness Book of World Records","offset":490},{"uri":"Affordable_housing","surface_form":"affordable housing","offset":3344},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":4582},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":4658},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":4672},{"uri":"Sharia","surface_form":"Islamic law","offset":4760},{"uri":"Organisation_of_the_Islamic_Conference","surface_form":"Organisation of the Islamic Conference","offset":4829},{"uri":"Cairo_Declaration_on_Human_Rights_in_Islam","surface_form":"Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam","offset":4903}]}
