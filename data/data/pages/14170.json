{"id":14170,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"Screw can also be a slang word for sexual intercourse.\"\nA screw is a sharp piece of threaded metal similar to a nail. Unlike a nail, a screw has spiral grooves down its spike. A screw is pressed down against wood and turned with a screwdriver. Turning the screw to the right makes it go into the wood. The grooves cut into the wood. This prevents the screw from falling out, as a nail might. Turning the screw to the left pulls it out of the wood.\nScrews can be made of steel, iron, brass, bronze, plastic, etc.\nThere are also machine screws and self-tapping screws. Machine screws are bolts which have screw threads. The threads matched with nuts with female threads.\nScrew threads are measured either in millimeters or in numbers. They are used in furniture, doors, appliances, etc.\nScrewing and screws.\nScrewing is the neatest way of holding together two materials. If no glue is involved, then the screwing can be dismantled.\nThese are three different types of screw.\nDo not place screws in line as this weakens the wood.\nUse the right size screwdriver for the screw head. A screwdriver that is too slim can damage the slot, too wide can tear the materials. Screw threads in both wood and metal can become stripped, resulting in loss of holding power, and can also be difficult to remove.\nA screw is a type of simple machine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":35},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":50},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":108},{"uri":"Nail","surface_form":"nail","offset":127},{"uri":"Spiral","surface_form":"spiral","offset":160},{"uri":"Groove","surface_form":"groove","offset":167},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":223},{"uri":"Screwdriver","surface_form":"screwdriver","offset":246},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":485},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":492},{"uri":"Brass","surface_form":"brass","offset":498},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":505},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":513},{"uri":"Bolts","surface_form":"bolts","offset":601},{"uri":"Screw_thread","surface_form":"screw thread","offset":618},{"uri":"Nut_(hardware)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":658},{"uri":"Simple_machine","surface_form":"simple machine","offset":1329}]}
