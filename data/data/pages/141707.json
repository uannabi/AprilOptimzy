{"id":141707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby","text":"Wallabies are marsupials from the islands of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and New Guinea. They are small- to medium-sized kangaroos. There are 30 different types of wallabies that live in many types of habitats, including rocky areas, grasslands, forests and swamps.\nDescription.\nWallabies range in size from the size of a rabbit to almost 6\u00A0ft (1.8 m) long. The soft, woolly fur can be gray, brown, red or almost black. The belly is lighter. Females (called fliers) have a pouch in which the young live and drink milk. Males (called boomers) are larger than females. Babies are called joeys. They have short arms with clawed fingers. strong, legs, and long, four-toed feet with claws. They can hop and jump with their powerful legs.\nDiet.\nThese herbivores (plant-eaters) eat grass, leaves, and roots. They swallow their food without chewing it and later regurgitate a cud and chew it. They need very little water; they can go for months without drinking, and they dig their own water wells.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":14},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":45},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":56},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":66},{"uri":"Kangaroo","surface_form":"kangaroo","offset":126},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":327},{"uri":"Joey_(marsupial)","surface_form":"joeys","offset":590},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":750},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":780},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":787},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":799}]}
