It has been under the rule of various empires throughout history, mostly the Persian Empires.\nIn the year 800, Islam came to north-east of Iran, (Nowadays called a part of this Land Tajikistan)\nIn 1868, Tajikistan became a Russian Colony. It later became a part of the Soviet Union.\nOn 9 September 1991, after long periods of mass protests against Soviet Government, the Parliament of Tajikistan declared independence from Soviet Union, and held first presidential elections.\nRahmon Nabiev, who ran the country during Soviet Union in the late 1970s and early 1980s, become its president. He was unable to bring any much needed reforms to the country, and so there were protests in the capital city, Dushanbe.\nThe government responded by organising a pro-government demonstration, mainly made of old Communist Party members and people from the southeast of the country brought to the city.

The greatest obstacle to improving the economy is resistance to reform. From the President down to the policeman on the street, government is characterized by cronyism and corruption. Emomali Rahmon and his family control the country's major businesses, including the largest bank, and they play hardball to protect their business interests, no matter the cost to the economy writ large... The government has limited opposition party operations and rejected electoral law reforms for the February 28, 2010 parliamentary elections. The Embassy does not expect the elections to be free and fair. There has been almost no coverage of opposition political parties by state media, and most of the population is unaware of the purpose of the elections...\"\nProvinces.\nTajikistan is divided into 4 provinces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":16},{"uri":"South-central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":27},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":71},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":101},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":115},{"uri":"Dushanbe","surface_form":"Dushanbe","offset":131},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":183},{"uri":"Farsi","surface_form":"Farsi","offset":194},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Independent_States","surface_form":"Commonwealth of Independent States","offset":241},{"uri":"South-central_Asia","surface_form":"South-central Asia","offset":386},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":412},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":420},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":436},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":452},{"uri":"Wakhan_Corridor","surface_form":"Wakhan Corridor","offset":539},{"uri":"Pamirs","surface_form":"Pamirs","offset":562},{"uri":"Uzbekistan","surface_form":"Uzbekistan","offset":578},{"uri":"Kyrgyzstan","surface_form":"Kyrgyzstan","offset":602},{"uri":"Landlocked","surface_form":"landlocked","offset":628},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":660},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":673},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":737},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":748},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":1035},{"uri":"Impact_crater","surface_form":"meteorite crater","offset":1243},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":1460},{"uri":"Persian_Empire","surface_form":"Persian Empire","offset":1499},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1533},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1645},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"Colony","offset":1653},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1691},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":1827},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1845},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1940},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"civil war","offset":2473},{"uri":"September_11%2C_2001_attacks","surface_form":"September 11, 2001 attacks","offset":2708},{"uri":"Emomali_Rahmon","surface_form":"Emomali Rahmon","offset":3061},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":3667}]}
