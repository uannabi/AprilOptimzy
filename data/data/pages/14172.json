{"id":14172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fear is a feeling or an emotion. When a person has fear, they are afraid or scared. A person who fears something does not want it to happen. The fear response comes from sensing danger. It leads to the fight-or-flight response. In extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) there may be a freeze response or paralysis.\nIn humans and animals, fear is adjusted by cognition and learning. Thus fear is rational or appropriate, or it is irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia.\nFear is the body's way of protecting itself from doing things that may be dangerous. For example, if one has a fear of jumping off a cliff, he/she will not do it. This saves one from death. In this case, fear is a good thing but in others, it can be bad. An example of fear being bad is if it stops one from doing something important, like going to see a doctor.\nThere is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and fear is one of them. The fear response helps survival by triggering appropriate behavioral responses. It has been preserved throughout evolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":37},{"uri":"Danger","surface_form":"danger","offset":191},{"uri":"Fight-or-flight_response","surface_form":"fight-or-flight response","offset":215},{"uri":"Cognition","surface_form":"cognition","offset":374},{"uri":"Learning","surface_form":"learning","offset":388},{"uri":"Phobia","surface_form":"phobia","offset":505},{"uri":"Protect","surface_form":"protect","offset":539},{"uri":"Danger","surface_form":"dangerous","offset":587},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":646},{"uri":"Innate","surface_form":"innate","offset":914},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1069}]}
