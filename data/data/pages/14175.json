{"id":14175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language","text":"Hebrew is a Semitic language. It was first spoken in Israel. Many Jewish people also speak Hebrew, as Hebrew is part of Judaism. The Academy of the Hebrew Language is the main institution of Hebrew.\nIt was spoken by Israelites a long time ago, during the time of the Bible. After Judah was conquered by Babylonia, the Jews were taken captive to Babylon and started speaking Aramaic. Hebrew was no longer used much in daily life, but it was still known by Jews who studied religious books.\nIn the 20th century, many Jews decided to make Hebrew into a spoken language again. It became the language of the new country of Israel in 1948. People in Israel came from many places and decided to learn Hebrew, the language of their common ancestors, so that they could all speak one language. However, Modern Hebrew is quite different from Biblical Hebrew, with a simpler grammar and many loanwords from other languages, especially English.\nAs of today, Hebrew has been the only dead language that had been made into a living language again.\nThe Bible was originally written in Biblical Hebrew, Biblical Aramaic and Koine Greek.\nGrammar.\nHebrew is a Semitic language and so that it is a lot like Arabic. Hebrew words are made by combining a root with a pattern. In Israeli Hebrew, some words are translated from European languages like English, French, German, and Russian. Many words from the Old Testament were given new meanings in Israeli Hebrew. People learning Hebrew need to study the grammar first so that they can read correctly without vowels.\nIn Israeli Hebrew, there is no verb \"to be\" in the present tense, but only in the future and the past tenses. In Biblical Hebrew, there are no tenses but only two aspects: imperfect and perfect. The imperfect is something like the future and the present tenses. The perfect is something like the past tense. Mishnaic Hebrew was spoken as well as Judeo-Aramaic in the time of Jesus and in the time of the Bar-Kokhba revolt (2nd century AD) until the Byzantine Empire of Justinian (6th century AD).\nThe Hebrew alphabet has been adapted to write Yiddish, another Jewish language. However, Yiddish sounds different from Hebrew since it is a Germanic language.\nAlphabet.\nThe Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. Five of them change when they are at the end of a word. Hebrew is read and written from right to left. The first three letters, aleph, beth and gimel, are also used in mathematics in the context of transfinite numbers.\nThe Hebrew alphabet is an \"abjad\" and so only the consonants are written, and readers must supply the vowels. Since that can be difficult, the vowels can be marked as dots called \u201Cnikkud\u201D or \u201Ctnuah\u201D (plural \u201Dnikkud\u201D signs and \u201Ctnuot\u201D respectively.) In Modern Hebrew, some letters can denote vowels, which are called \"matres lectionis\" (mothers of the reading) since they greatly help reading. Vav (or Waw) can make the 'oo' sound (/u/ in IPA) like in food. Yodh (or Yud) can make the 'ee' sound (/i/ in IPA) like in feed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic language","offset":12},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":53},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jewish people","offset":66},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":120},{"uri":"Academy_of_the_Hebrew_Language","surface_form":"Academy of the Hebrew Language","offset":133},{"uri":"Israelite","surface_form":"Israelite","offset":216},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":267},{"uri":"Judah","surface_form":"Judah","offset":280},{"uri":"Babylonia","surface_form":"Babylonia","offset":303},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":318},{"uri":"Babylon","surface_form":"Babylon","offset":345},{"uri":"Aramaic","surface_form":"Aramaic","offset":374},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":496},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":618},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":864},{"uri":"Loanword","surface_form":"loanword","offset":881},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":924},{"uri":"Language_death","surface_form":"dead language","offset":971},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":1038},{"uri":"Aramaic","surface_form":"Aramaic","offset":1096},{"uri":"Koine_Greek","surface_form":"Koine Greek","offset":1108},{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic language","offset":1142},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1188},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1337},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":1345},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":1357},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":1386},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":1484},{"uri":"Present_tense","surface_form":"present tense","offset":1597},{"uri":"Future_tense","surface_form":"future","offset":1628},{"uri":"Past_tense","surface_form":"past tense","offset":1643},{"uri":"Judeo-Aramaic","surface_form":"Judeo-Aramaic","offset":1892},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":1921},{"uri":"2nd_century","surface_form":"2nd century","offset":1969},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":1995},{"uri":"Justinian","surface_form":"Justinian","offset":2015},{"uri":"6th_century","surface_form":"6th century","offset":2026},{"uri":"Yiddish","surface_form":"Yiddish","offset":2089},{"uri":"Jewish_languages","surface_form":"Jewish language","offset":2106},{"uri":"Germanic_languages","surface_form":"Germanic language","offset":2183},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":2223},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":2416},{"uri":"Transfinite_number","surface_form":"transfinite numbers","offset":2446},{"uri":"Yodh","surface_form":"Yodh","offset":2924}]}
