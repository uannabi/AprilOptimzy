{"id":14185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)","text":"Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game character. He is a 15-year old blue hedgehog who can run at the speed of sound. By curling into a ball and spinning quickly, he can do a helpful \"Spin Attack\" which he uses to defeat the villains and save the day. He has been in many games made by the company Sega, but also in television series, books and comics (published in America by Archie Comics). He has many friends, including Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a two-tailed fox that can fly by spinning his tails very quickly or Knuckles the Echidna (who is strong, and has been in Sonic games since \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\"). With them, he fights against his arch nemesis Doctor Eggman, an evil scientist attempting to conquer the world.\nIn games.\nSonic is the mascot of Sega, which created it in the early 1990s. At first, Sega wanted Doctor Eggman to be their mascot, and a good guy. But, the people in Sega liked the new idea of making a blue hedgehog as the mascot. Doctor Eggman settled as the bad guy instead. Sonic\u2019s franchise has grown, and more characters are displayed in games.\nIn cartoons.\nHe appeared in his own made-for-video movie in 1999.\nIn most of the cartoons from the 1990s his voice was provided by Jaleel White (who was best known at the time for his role as Steve Urkel on the television show \"Family Matters\") and in later cartoons his voice was provided by Jason Griffith. Sonic also stars in his latest cartoon from Japan. It is called \"Sonic X\", although Sonic X has ended.\nIn comic books.\nArchie Comics in America has been making comics with Sonic as the main character. He is also shown with famous characters like Knuckles and Tails, but with also a few new ones. Some of the characters are not in any Sonic games, but some are in a very old cartoon, \"Sonic the Hedgehog SatAM\", made by DiC in 1993.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":24},{"uri":"Hedgehog","surface_form":"hedgehog","offset":71},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":295},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":313},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":332},{"uri":"Comics","surface_form":"comics","offset":342},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":363},{"uri":"Archie_Comics","surface_form":"Archie Comics","offset":374},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":456},{"uri":"Knuckles_the_Echidna","surface_form":"Knuckles the Echidna","offset":511},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":742},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":752},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":788},{"uri":"Doctor_Eggman","surface_form":"Doctor Eggman","offset":951},{"uri":"Franchise","surface_form":"franchise","offset":1005},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":1115},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":1121},{"uri":"1999","surface_form":"1999","offset":1130},{"uri":"Jaleel_White","surface_form":"Jaleel White","offset":1201},{"uri":"Jason_Griffith","surface_form":"Jason Griffith","offset":1363},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1423},{"uri":"Archie_Comics","surface_form":"Archie Comics","offset":1498},{"uri":"DiC","surface_form":"DiC","offset":1798},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":1805}]}
