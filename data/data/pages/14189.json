{"id":14189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution","text":"=\"preserve\">Resolution is what can qualify a monitor in computer science. It is the number of pixels displayed on a given surface.\nFor example: a \"640 by 480 display\", which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to bottom (as in a VGA display), and therefore has a total number of 640 \u00D7 480 = 307,200 pixels or 0.3 megapixels, is what is meant by 640 \u00D7 480 display resolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_monitor","surface_form":"monitor","offset":45},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":94},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":122}]}
