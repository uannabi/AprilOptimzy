{"id":14192,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfort%2C_Kentucky","text":"Frankfort is the capital city of the U.S. state of Kentucky. It has been the state capital since December 8, 1792. It is the county seat of Franklin County, and has been since 1795. It's located between Lexington and Louisville Kentucky.\nFrankfort is beside the Kentucky River. This is how the city earned its name, because the land was owned by pioneer Stephen Frank. First called \"Frank's Ford\", the name was soon shortened to Frankfort.\nWithin a century the population of Frankfort grew from 9,487 in 1900, to 27,741 in 2000. The members of the city commission and the mayor are elected by the citizens.\nThe mayor of Frankfort in 2008 is Gippy Graham.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":17},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":25},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":37},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":51},{"uri":"December_8","surface_form":"December 8","offset":97},{"uri":"1792","surface_form":"1792","offset":109},{"uri":"Franklin_County%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Franklin County","offset":140},{"uri":"1795","surface_form":"1795","offset":176},{"uri":"Kentucky_River","surface_form":"Kentucky River","offset":262}]}
