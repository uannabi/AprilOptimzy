The adult male has a red or black neck ring and the hen and immature birds of both sexes show little or no neck rings. Both sexes have a distinctive green colour.\nRose-ringed parakeets measure on average in length, including the tail feathers, a large portion of their total length. Their average single-wing length is about. In the wild, this is a noisy species with an unmistakable squawk. Captive birds can be taught to speak. It is herbivorous and not migratory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":113},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":140},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"south Asia","offset":151},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":167},{"uri":"Sexually_dimorphic","surface_form":"sexually dimorphic","offset":217},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":471},{"uri":"Bird_sound","surface_form":"squawk","offset":621},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migratory","offset":693}]}
