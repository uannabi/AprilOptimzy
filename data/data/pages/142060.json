{"id":142060,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Declaration","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Pakistan Declaration (titled Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?) was a pamphlet published in January 1933 by Choudhary Rahmat Ali in which the word Pakistan was used for the first time.\nThe pamphlet was written when Pakistan was part of British India. The pamphlet asked that \"the five Northern units of India\" - Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan (or Pakstan) become an independent state and not part of India.\nAfter the pamphlet was published the name of Pakistan became very popular and led to the Pakistan Movement. Fourteen years after the pamphlet was published, in 1947, Pakistan became an independent state.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pamphlet","surface_form":"pamphlet","offset":101},{"uri":"Choudhary_Rahmat_Ali","surface_form":"Choudhary Rahmat Ali","offset":139},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":178},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"units","offset":325},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"India","offset":334},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":477},{"uri":"Pakistan_Movement","surface_form":"Pakistan Movement","offset":573}]}
