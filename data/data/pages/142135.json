{"id":142135,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism","text":"Sexual dimorphism is a concept in biology. It means that the male and the female of a species look noticeably different. The word comes from the Greek: \"di\" (two) and \"morphe\" (form).\nIt is the most common type of polymorphism. It may be the result of sexual selection, that is, competition between members of the same species for reproduction. More generally, sexual dimorphism is inherited, which means the differences between males and females have survival value.\nThe features that distinguish the two sexes of a species are called secondary sex characteristics. They are not directly part of the reproductive system. They are the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in survival and reproduction.\nSome animals show these differences only during mating season. Deer shed their antlers and peacocks shed their tails out of season. This minimises the key disadvantage of sexual dimorphism, which is, it makes the male much easier to be seen by predators.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":23},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":34},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":61},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":74},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":86},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":145},{"uri":"Polymorphism","surface_form":"polymorphism","offset":214},{"uri":"Sexual_selection","surface_form":"sexual selection","offset":252},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":319},{"uri":"Heritable","surface_form":"inherited","offset":382},{"uri":"Secondary_sex_characteristic","surface_form":"secondary sex characteristic","offset":536},{"uri":"Reproductive_system","surface_form":"reproductive system","offset":601},{"uri":"Sexual_selection","surface_form":"sexual selection","offset":646},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"traits","offset":667}]}
