He was bred, after the manner of his Latin forefathers, to agriculture, to which he devoted himself when not engaged in military service. But, having attracted the notice of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome, and successively held the offices of Cursus Honorum: Tribune (214 BC), Quaestor (204 BC), Aedile (199 BC), Praetor (198 BC), Consul (195 BC) together with his old patron, and finally Censor (184 BC).\nLate in life, he encouraged the Romans to start the Third Punic War to destroy Carthage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":21},{"uri":"Tusculum","surface_form":"Tusculum","offset":57},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":80},{"uri":"Cato_the_Younger","surface_form":"Cato the Younger","offset":200},{"uri":"Plebeian","surface_form":"Plebeian","offset":261},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":436},{"uri":"Lucius_Valerius_Flaccus","surface_form":"Lucius Valerius Flaccus","offset":551},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":594},{"uri":"Cursus_honorum","surface_form":"Cursus Honorum","offset":637},{"uri":"Tribune","surface_form":"Tribune","offset":653},{"uri":"Quaestor","surface_form":"Quaestor","offset":671},{"uri":"Aedile","surface_form":"Aedile","offset":690},{"uri":"Praetor","surface_form":"Praetor","offset":707},{"uri":"Roman_consul","surface_form":"Consul","offset":725},{"uri":"Censor_(ancient_Rome)","surface_form":"Censor","offset":783},{"uri":"Third_Punic_War","surface_form":"Third Punic War","offset":852},{"uri":"Carthage","surface_form":"Carthage","offset":879}]}
