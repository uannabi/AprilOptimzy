{"id":142144,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavirondo","text":"Kavirondo is the old name of the region around Kavirondo Gulf (now Winam Gulf) as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of British East Africa (The \"Nilotic Kavirondo\" and the \"Bantu Kavirondo\"). Broadly, this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the Nzoia River, on the western slopes of Mount Elgon, and along the northeast coast of Victoria Nyanza.\nSuggested origins of the name \"Kavirondo\" include\nOrigins and divisions.\nKavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of tribes: The Bantu immigrated from the south and the other Nilotic, came from the north. The Bantu appear to have been the first. The Nilotic tribes are probably an offshoot of the Acholi. They appear to have crossed the lake to reach their current home, the country around Kavirondo Gulf. Of the two groups the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors, and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race (Hobley). Their further progress north was stopped by the southward movement of the Nilotic tribes, while the Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of Elgumi people (themselves probably of Nilotic origin) from the east.\nThe Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types: the Awa-Rimi, the Awa-Ware and the Awa-Kisii. Their Bantu neighbors call the Nilotic Kavirondo \"Ja-Mwa\". The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is \"Ja-Luo\", but the Bantu Kavirondo call them \"Awa-Nyoro\". The two groups have many characteristics in common.\nThe Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects, totemically.\nCulture and society.\nTraditionally, these people seem to be naked. The men of the Nilotic Kavirondo start to wear a small piece of goat-skin on their penis when they become fathers. This is called \"Sembe\". Even though this covering is practically useless as a covering, ettiquette says it must still be worn. Even those men who wear clothes must wear the goat-skin, when they are fathers.\nMen of the tribe have traveled more, and have had more contact with white people. Some of the tribesmen now wear European-style clothing. Women traveled less, or were more conservative. They kept the nudity, or the few garments they had before.\nAmong the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fiber suspended from a girdle behind. This tassel looks like a tail from a distance. The first travelers to Africa talked about a \"tailed race\". The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but not the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders.\nSome of the Bantu tribes practice circumcision, the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the women's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body.\nThe Kavirondo are known for being independent, eager, and ready to fight. They are seen as honest, and as having a high sexual morality, traits common among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than men. For this reason, polygamy is common.\nAmong the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price, an offer usually accepted, as the women are excellent agricultural laborers. The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy, endeavoring always to marry outside their clan. Girls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood. It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return the marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's adultery was formerly punished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of adultery. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid in installments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment; if a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event, which is celebrated by feasting and dances. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days; among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession, the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a neighbor, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose, picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Niotic tribes. Names are not male and female, and a daughter often bears her fathers name.\nThe Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the Bantu tribes, the Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe. Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the veranda of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath the veranda of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fiber worn round the neck and waist.\nA chief chooses, sometimes years before his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his children.\nWhile some tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes, occasionally of stone. Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs, and fairly broad verandas all round.\nA portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly in the middle of the hut, sits the hut owner, his wives, children, brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep.\nCooking pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full-grown man has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus. Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart and only after the men have finished.\nThough a peaceful people the Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood-courses and broad-bladed swords. Some use slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used; firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of vendetta. When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine (generally goats dung), to defend him from the spirit of the dead man. The Awa-Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies.\nIn the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality. Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild malaria, while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia. Epidemics of small-pox have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy, pierce a hole in the chest. There are no medicine-men: the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts scars on his wife's body to ensure him good luck.\nOf dances, the Kavirondo have the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large lyre-shaped instrument. They also use various drums.\nThe Ja-Luo women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments. Like the aggry beads of West Africa these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, generally blue in color, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain. The natives believe they come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and color to ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from ancient cities in Baluchistan.\nReligion and beliefs.\nThey appears to practice a vague ancestor worship, but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the spirits of good and evil. To the former, cattle and goats are sacrificed.\nThe Kavirondo have great faith in divination from the entrails of a sheep. Nearly everybody and everything are ominous of good or evil to the Kavirondo.\nThey have few myths or traditions; the antbear is the chief figure in their beast-legends.\nThey believe in witchcraft and practice trial by ordeal.\nEconomy.\nThe Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people: both men and women work in the fields with large iron hoes. In addition to sorghum, Eleusine and maize, tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked. Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child-bearing women. Hemp is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people.\nThe Kavirondo keep cattle, sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the snout being held until the animal dies. From Eleusine a beer is made.\nThe Kavirondo are plucky hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut.\nTraditional Kavirondo industries are salt-making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Winam_Gulf","surface_form":"Winam Gulf","offset":67},{"uri":"British_East_Africa","surface_form":"British East Africa","offset":145},{"uri":"Nilotic_Kavirondo","surface_form":"Nilotic Kavirondo","offset":171},{"uri":"Bantu_Kavirondo","surface_form":"Bantu Kavirondo","offset":199},{"uri":"Nzoia_River","surface_form":"Nzoia River","offset":284},{"uri":"Mount_Elgon","surface_form":"Mount Elgon","offset":322},{"uri":"Victoria_Nyanza","surface_form":"Victoria Nyanza","offset":368},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":514},{"uri":"Bantu_people","surface_form":"Bantu","offset":526},{"uri":"Nilotic","surface_form":"Nilotic","offset":572},{"uri":"Acholi","surface_form":"Acholi","offset":694},{"uri":"Elgumi","surface_form":"Elgumi","offset":1149},{"uri":"Totemism","surface_form":"totemically","offset":1605},{"uri":"Nakedness","surface_form":"naked","offset":1678},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":1749},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":1768},{"uri":"Ettiquette","surface_form":"ettiquette","offset":1888},{"uri":"Circumcision","surface_form":"circumcision","offset":2669},{"uri":"Polygamy","surface_form":"polygamy","offset":3129},{"uri":"Exogamy","surface_form":"exogamy","offset":3514},{"uri":"Adultery","surface_form":"adultery","offset":3904},{"uri":"Adultery","surface_form":"adultery","offset":4023},{"uri":"Bantu_people","surface_form":"Bantu","offset":5208},{"uri":"Veranda","surface_form":"veranda","offset":5843},{"uri":"Vendetta","surface_form":"vendetta","offset":8223},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":8693},{"uri":"Dysentery","surface_form":"dysentery","offset":8735},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":8749},{"uri":"Small-pox","surface_form":"small-pox","offset":8773},{"uri":"Scar","surface_form":"scar","offset":9372},{"uri":"Lyre","surface_form":"lyre","offset":9626},{"uri":"Divination","surface_form":"divination","offset":10415},{"uri":"Antbear","surface_form":"antbear","offset":10573},{"uri":"Witchcraft","surface_form":"witchcraft","offset":10641},{"uri":"Trial_by_ordeal","surface_form":"trial by ordeal","offset":10665},{"uri":"Sorghum","surface_form":"sorghum","offset":10820},{"uri":"Eleusine","surface_form":"Eleusine","offset":10829},{"uri":"Hemp","surface_form":"hemp","offset":10861},{"uri":"Sesamum","surface_form":"sesamum","offset":11085}]}
