{"id":142176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Five Families are the five major Italian-American Mafia crime families which have controlled organized crime in New York City since the 1930s. The Five Families, under the suggestion of Salvatore Maranzano and Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, were responsible for the establishment of The Commission, a council that changed how things worked with Mafia activities in the United States.\nThe Colombo family was once known as the Profaci Crime Family, until a coup caused a name change in the early 1960s. Former Godfather Joe Massino had wanted to change the name of the Bonanno Family to the Massino Family but since his arrest and defection it is unlikely to happen. The DeCavalcante crime family, based in nearby Elizabeth, NJ, also has ties to the five New York families.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian-American","surface_form":"Italian-American","offset":50},{"uri":"Crime_family","surface_form":"crime families","offset":73},{"uri":"Organized_crime","surface_form":"organized crime","offset":110},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":129},{"uri":"Salvatore_Maranzano","surface_form":"Salvatore Maranzano","offset":203},{"uri":"Lucky_Luciano","surface_form":"Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano","offset":227},{"uri":"The_Commission_(mafia)","surface_form":"The Commission","offset":294},{"uri":"Mafia","surface_form":"Mafia","offset":356},{"uri":"Joe_Massino","surface_form":"Joe Massino","offset":529},{"uri":"DeCavalcante_crime_family","surface_form":"DeCavalcante crime family","offset":680}]}
