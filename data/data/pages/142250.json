{"id":142250,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy","text":"The Royal Academy (RA), is an art institution based in Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. It is a club for top painters and sculptors. They elect their own members, and give regular exhibitions of art works.\nThe Royal Academy was formed to rival the Society of Artists after an leadership dispute between two leading architects, Sir William Chambers and James Paine. Paine won, but Chambers used his strong connections with King George III to create the Royal Academy, in 1768. It was formally launched the following year.\nMembership of the Royal Academy is up to 80 practising artists, each elected by ballot of the General Assembly of the Royal Academy. They are known as Royal Academicians (RA, or more traditionally as R.A.). The Royal Academy is governed by these Royal Academicians.\nSir Joshua Reynolds was its first president, and Benjamin West its second.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":30},{"uri":"Piccadilly","surface_form":"Piccadilly","offset":73},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":85},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":114},{"uri":"Sculptor","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":127},{"uri":"Exhibition","surface_form":"exhibition","offset":185},{"uri":"Society_of_Artists","surface_form":"Society of Artists","offset":253},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":320},{"uri":"William_Chambers_(architect)","surface_form":"William Chambers","offset":336},{"uri":"James_Paine","surface_form":"James Paine","offset":357},{"uri":"George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George III","offset":427},{"uri":"Joshua_Reynolds","surface_form":"Joshua Reynolds","offset":796},{"uri":"Benjamin_West","surface_form":"Benjamin West","offset":841}]}
