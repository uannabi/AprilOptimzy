{"id":14226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocarina","text":"An ocarina is a kind of flute that is not made out of a tube. Because the ocarina is in a round or box-like shape, its sound is a little different from other flutes.\nHistory.\nThe ten-hole ocarina was first made by Giuseppe Donati, in Italy, in 1853. Instruments like the ocarina had been made for hundreds of years before that in South America, China, and Africa. In Europe, a form called the gemshorn was made in the 16th century. The gemshorn was made from an animal horn.\nIn the 19th century, groups of ocarina players, with different sized ocarinas, played classical and folk music. Italian ocarinas became known throughout the world, because of this.\nIn the United States the ocarina was called the sweet potato, because its shape is like a sweet potato.\nIn 1928, the Japanese began making ocarinas. They added two small holes to the old kind of ocarinas. Japanese 12-hole ocarinas can play a larger scale than 10-hole ocarinas.\nEnglish Ocarina.\nIn the 1960s, the English ocarina was invented. It has four finger holes, and may have one or two thumb holes. English ocarinas are made in many shapes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":24},{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":56},{"uri":"Round","surface_form":"round","offset":90},{"uri":"Box","surface_form":"box","offset":99},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":234},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":330},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":345},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":356},{"uri":"Gemshorn","surface_form":"gemshorn","offset":393},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical","offset":561},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":575},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":663},{"uri":"Sweet_potato","surface_form":"sweet potato","offset":704},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":773}]}
