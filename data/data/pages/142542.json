{"id":142542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer","text":"A galvanometer is a type of ammeter. It is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current. It is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The term has been expanded to include uses of the same mechanism in recording, positioning, and servomechanism equipment.\nOperation.\nThe most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument, often called a meter. It is used to measure the direct current (flow of electric charge) through an electric circuit. The D'Arsonval/Weston form used today is constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.\nWhen a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform, so that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation.\nTangent galvanometer.\nA tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used for the measurement of electric current. It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837.\nA tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0\u00B0 to 90\u00B0. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ammeter","surface_form":"ammeter","offset":28},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":85},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":221},{"uri":"Servomechanism","surface_form":"servomechanism","offset":360},{"uri":"Meter_(electronics)","surface_form":"meter","offset":472},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":691},{"uri":"Torsion","surface_form":"torsion","offset":780},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":788},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"direct current","offset":851}]}
