After the First World War Congress reorganized the U.S. land forces. The National Defence Act of 4 June 1920 authorized a Regular Army, a National Guard, and an Organized Reserve (Officers Reserve Corps and Enlisted Reserve Corps) of unrestricted size. The Organized Reserve later became the Army Reserve.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military_reserve_force","surface_form":"reserve force","offset":51},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":72},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":175},{"uri":"United_States_National_Guard","surface_form":"National Guard","offset":262},{"uri":"1908","surface_form":"1908","offset":309},{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":338},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":378}]}
