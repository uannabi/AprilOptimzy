{"id":142574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery","text":"A rechargeable battery, also called a storage battery or a secondary cell, is a battery that can be recharged (refilled) over and over again with electricity. A battery that is not rechargeable is called a primary cell or disposable battery (A battery that is thrown in the garbage when it can not be used anymore). Rechargeable batteries can be recycled.\nRechargeable batteries are sometimes better than disposable batteries. They can be reused many times before being thrown away. They make less pollution because of this. Reusing them can cost less money since they can be used over and over.\nRechargeable batteries are not good sometimes. Each battery costs more to make at the factory and has more dangerous ingredients than disposable batteries.\nRechargeable batteries can be used for many smaller electronics such as MP3 players and flashlights. Almost all mobile phones and laptop computers use them. They are also used for car batteries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battery","surface_form":"battery","offset":80},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":146},{"uri":"Primary_cell","surface_form":"primary cell","offset":206},{"uri":"Recycling","surface_form":"recycled","offset":346},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"pollution","offset":498},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":682},{"uri":"Ingredients","surface_form":"ingredients","offset":713},{"uri":"MP3_player","surface_form":"MP3 player","offset":824},{"uri":"Flashlight","surface_form":"flashlight","offset":840},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":864},{"uri":"Laptop_computer","surface_form":"laptop computer","offset":882},{"uri":"Car_battery","surface_form":"car batteries","offset":932}]}
