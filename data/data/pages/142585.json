{"id":142585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Klingon language (\"codice_2\",) is a language that was made for the Klingons in the \"Star Trek\" universe. It is a constructed language, not one that developed naturally. Only a few people can speak the Klingon language well enough to talk in it. The Klingon Language Institute helps people learn Klingon.\nHistory.\nThe first Klingon words were made by the actor James Doohan in 1979 for the first Star Trek movie. When they made the third movie in 1984, Gene Roddenberry wanted to have a real language for the Klingons. So it was the linguist (a language scientist) Marc Okrand who made the Klingon language. He has written some books about the Klingon language.\nGrammar.\nThe Klingon language feels like talking backwards. Marc Okrand wanted the language to be as complicated as possible. He did this to make it sound very extraterrestrial. The word order in a sentence is always object-verb-subject. So the English sentence \"I see the cat\" is said as \"the cat see I\" in Klingon.\nWriting.\nWhen writing in Klingon, some letters are always in uppercase and some are lowercase. This never changes because the letters are spoken differently when they are written differently.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":53},{"uri":"Klingon","surface_form":"Klingon","offset":84},{"uri":"Star_Trek","surface_form":"Star Trek","offset":101},{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":112},{"uri":"Constructed_language","surface_form":"constructed language","offset":130},{"uri":"Klingon_Language_Institute","surface_form":"Klingon Language Institute","offset":266},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":371},{"uri":"James_Doohan","surface_form":"James Doohan","offset":377},{"uri":"The_Motion_Picture","surface_form":"first Star Trek movie","offset":406},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":454},{"uri":"Gene_Roddenberry","surface_form":"Gene Roddenberry","offset":469},{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"linguist","offset":549},{"uri":"Marc_Okrand","surface_form":"Marc Okrand","offset":581},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":644},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"extraterrestrial","offset":838},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":895},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":902},{"uri":"Subject","surface_form":"subject","offset":907},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":923},{"uri":"Letter_case","surface_form":"uppercase","offset":1056},{"uri":"Letter_case","surface_form":"lowercase","offset":1079}]}
