{"id":142593,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentil_soup","text":"Lentil soup (\"shorbit adas\" or \"shurba al-'adas\", \"nezid adashim\") is a soup. It is served hot and made with lentils. It is popular all over the Middle East. Usually it is a vegetarian soup, but can also be made with meat stock. Red or green lentils may be used and in some recipes the lentils are boiled with vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, parsley and onion, and then pureed. Things commonly added include garlic, cumin, and lemon juice. Sometimes croutons are added to make it look good.\nLentil soup is mentioned in the Bible: In Genesis 25:34, Esau is prepared to give up his birthright for a pot of fragrant red lentil soup being cooked by his brother, Jacob.\nThe ancient Greek dramatist, Aristophanes, mentions lentil soup in his plays: He describes it as the \"sweetest of delicacies.\"\nLentil soup was once a food for the poor. Today, it is recognized as highly nutritious and provides a good source of protein, fiber, iron and potassium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soup","surface_form":"soup","offset":72},{"uri":"Lentil","surface_form":"lentil","offset":109},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":145},{"uri":"Vegetarian","surface_form":"vegetarian","offset":174},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":217},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":310},{"uri":"Carrot","surface_form":"carrot","offset":329},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":338},{"uri":"Parsley","surface_form":"parsley","offset":348},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":360},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":414},{"uri":"Cumin","surface_form":"cumin","offset":422},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":433},{"uri":"Crouton","surface_form":"crouton","offset":456},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":529},{"uri":"Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":539},{"uri":"Esau","surface_form":"Esau","offset":554},{"uri":"Jacob","surface_form":"Jacob","offset":664},{"uri":"Aristophanes","surface_form":"Aristophanes","offset":700},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":915},{"uri":"Fiber","surface_form":"fiber","offset":924},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":931},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":940}]}
