{"id":142648,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group","text":"e=\"preserve\">A minority or subordinate group is a group that does not make up most of the population of a society. For example: minor group of religion, race, language, LGBT, and persons with disabilities.\nA minority is not always a minority of numbers \u2014 it may be any group that is not normal with respect to a leading group in terms of social status, education, employment, wealth, and political power, and can be an object of discrimination. For example, women may be considered a minority even if there are as many women as men because they have less power than men.\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by United Nations protects the right of minority group in Article 27 and Council of Europe also affirms protection for them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":143},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":153},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":159},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":169},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabilities","offset":192},{"uri":"Social_status","surface_form":"social status","offset":338},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":353},{"uri":"Employment","surface_form":"employment","offset":364},{"uri":"Wealth","surface_form":"wealth","offset":376},{"uri":"Power","surface_form":"power","offset":398},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":429},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":458},{"uri":"International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights","surface_form":"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights","offset":571},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":627},{"uri":"Council_of_Europe","surface_form":"Council of Europe","offset":697}]}
