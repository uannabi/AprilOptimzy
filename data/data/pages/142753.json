{"id":142753,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherglen","text":"Rutherglen (pronounced: ruh-ther-glen) is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. \"Rutherglen\" comes from the Gaelic \"An Ruadh Ghleann\", meaning \"the red valley\". In 1975, it lost its own local council and administratively became a component of the City of Glasgow. In 1996 Rutherglen was reallocated to the South Lanarkshire council area.\nRutherglen remains the oldest royal burgh in Scotland, being more than 500 years older than Glasgow. It was a centre of heavy industry, having a long coal mining tradition which died out by 1950, and was until the 1960s home to the infamous White's chemical works, which was responsible for huge swathes of the area from southern Glasgow across to the town of Cambuslang being polluted with chromium waste. Rutherglen, and most of the towns encircling the city, are now dormitory suburbs of Glasgow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Lanarkshire","surface_form":"South Lanarkshire","offset":52},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":71},{"uri":"Scottish_Gaelic_language","surface_form":"Gaelic","offset":109},{"uri":"South_Lanarkshire","surface_form":"South Lanarkshire","offset":307},{"uri":"Subdivisions_of_Scotland","surface_form":"council area","offset":325},{"uri":"Royal_burgh","surface_form":"royal burgh","offset":369},{"uri":"Heavy_industry","surface_form":"heavy industry","offset":459},{"uri":"Coal_mining","surface_form":"coal mining","offset":489},{"uri":"Cambuslang","surface_form":"Cambuslang","offset":699},{"uri":"Chromium","surface_form":"chromium","offset":730},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":819}]}
