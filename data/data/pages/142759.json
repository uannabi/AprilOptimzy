{"id":142759,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire","text":"Aberdeenshire () is the name of both a county and of one of the 32 unitary council areas in Scotland. The two are not the same area.\nCounty.\nAberdeenshire stretches from the east coast of Scotland up into the mountains. It is between Kincardineshire and Angus (south) and Banffshire (west). Aberdeen is the county town.\nAberdeenshire is mainly countryside and mountain, except in Aberdeen. Aberdeen is one of Britain's richest towns because it serves the North Sea oil rigs.\nFraserburgh is a large fishing port.\nCouncil area.\nThe Aberdeenshire council area takes in the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire and half of Banffshire. It does not include Aberdeen City though, which is a Council Area in its own right. However, Aberdeenshire Council does have its headquarters at Woodhill House, in Aberdeen; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outside its area's border.\nAberdeenshire borders Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south, and Highland and Moray to the west.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":39},{"uri":"Unitary_authority","surface_form":"unitary","offset":67},{"uri":"Council_area_(Scotland)","surface_form":"council areas","offset":75},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":92},{"uri":"Kincardineshire","surface_form":"Kincardineshire","offset":234},{"uri":"Angus","surface_form":"Angus","offset":254},{"uri":"Banffshire","surface_form":"Banffshire","offset":272},{"uri":"Aberdeen","surface_form":"Aberdeen","offset":291},{"uri":"Fraserburgh","surface_form":"Fraserburgh","offset":475},{"uri":"Aberdeen_City","surface_form":"Aberdeen City","offset":669},{"uri":"Aberdeen","surface_form":"Aberdeen","offset":813},{"uri":"Angus","surface_form":"Angus","offset":927},{"uri":"Perth_and_Kinross","surface_form":"Perth and Kinross","offset":937},{"uri":"Highland_(council_area)","surface_form":"Highland","offset":973},{"uri":"Moray","surface_form":"Moray","offset":986}]}
