{"id":142825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane%E2%80%93Typhoon_Paka","text":"Hurricane Paka (international designation: \"9728\", JTWC designation: \"05C\", PAGASA designation: Rubing, also known as \" Typhoon Paka\") was the last tropical cyclone in the 1997 Pacific hurricane and typhoon season, and was among the strongest Pacific typhoons in the month of December. Paka, which is the Hawaiian name for Pat, developed on November 28 from a trough well to the southwest of Hawaii. The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration, and on December 7 it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean. Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity, and on December 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the Marshall Islands. On December 16, Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of 230\u00A0km/h (145\u00A0mph), and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on December 18 over open waters. Subsequently, it underwent a steady weakening trend, and on December 23 Paka dissipated.\nTyphoon Paka first impacted the Marshall Islands, where it dropped heavy rainfall and left $80\u00A0million in damage (1997\u00A0USD, $100\u00A0million 2007\u00A0USD). Later, it passed just north of Guam, where strong winds destroyed about 1,500\u00A0buildings and damaged 10,000\u00A0more; 5,000\u00A0people were left homeless, and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon. Damage on the island totaled $500\u00A0million (1997\u00A0USD, $645\u00A0million 2007\u00A0USD), which warranted the retirement of its name. Paka also caused light damage in the Northern Marianas Islands, and overall the storm caused no reported deaths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippine_Atmospheric%2C_Geophysical_and_Astronomical_Services_Administration","surface_form":"PAGASA","offset":76},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":148},{"uri":"1997_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":185},{"uri":"1997_Pacific_typhoon_season","surface_form":"typhoon","offset":199},{"uri":"Hawaiian_language","surface_form":"Hawaiian","offset":305},{"uri":"November_28","surface_form":"November 28","offset":341},{"uri":"Trough_(meteorology)","surface_form":"trough","offset":360},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":392},{"uri":"December_7","surface_form":"December 7","offset":470},{"uri":"December_10","surface_form":"December 10","offset":597},{"uri":"Marshall_Islands","surface_form":"Marshall Islands","offset":663},{"uri":"December_16","surface_form":"December 16","offset":684},{"uri":"Guam","surface_form":"Guam","offset":709},{"uri":"Rota_(island)","surface_form":"Rota","offset":718},{"uri":"December_18","surface_form":"December 18","offset":808},{"uri":"December_23","surface_form":"December 23","offset":898},{"uri":"Marshall_Islands","surface_form":"Marshall Islands","offset":959},{"uri":"List_of_retired_Pacific_hurricane_names","surface_form":"retirement of its name","offset":1392},{"uri":"Northern_Marianas_Islands","surface_form":"Northern Marianas Islands","offset":1453}]}
