{"id":142826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Pauline","text":"Hurricane Pauline was a destructive hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season and one of the deadliest.\nPauline formed in the eastern Pacific on October 6. It strengthened rapidly, reaching category four on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on the next day. After a brief period of weakening to a category three, it re-intensified back to a category four, moving roughly parallel to the Mexican coast.Pauline then made landfall, slamming into Mexico. Heavy rains and high winds caused damage as the storm skirted the coast.\nThere were 300-400 deaths, and heavy damage to Acalpulco. The name was retired and replaced by Patricia for the 2003 Pacific hurricane season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":36},{"uri":"1997_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1997 Pacific hurricane season","offset":53},{"uri":"October_6","surface_form":"October 6","offset":150},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","offset":216},{"uri":"Acalpulco","surface_form":"Acalpulco","offset":577},{"uri":"2003_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2003 Pacific hurricane season","offset":642}]}
