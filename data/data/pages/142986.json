Until 1975 Banff was the county town of Banffshire.\nSport.\nBanff and surrounding areas have a local football team, Deveronvale F.C. and a rugby team, Banff RFC.\nDuff House Royal Golf course is bordered by the River Deveron and Duff House.Some interesting holes which can be difficult depending on the wind.\nMacduff also has a golf course known as Royal Tarlair. Built on land which ends on precipitous cliffs, lost balls really are lost.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Banff\" is uncertain but may be derived from the Scottish Gaelic \"Banbh\" or \"Banbha\", a sow, \"buinne\", a stream, or a contraction of \"Bean-naomh\", the holy woman (as is reflected in the town's coat-of-arms). Currently, the languages spoken in the town and in its vicinity tend to be the Doric dialect of Scots, and English.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scottish_Gaelic_language","surface_form":"Gaelic","offset":7},{"uri":"Banff_Bay","surface_form":"Banff Bay","offset":82},{"uri":"Burgh","surface_form":"burgh","offset":118},{"uri":"Aberdeenshire_(unitary)","surface_form":"Aberdeenshire","offset":128},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":143},{"uri":"County_town","surface_form":"county town","offset":178},{"uri":"Banffshire","surface_form":"Banffshire","offset":193},{"uri":"Deveronvale_F.C.","surface_form":"Deveronvale F.C.","offset":268},{"uri":"Banff_RFC","surface_form":"Banff RFC","offset":303},{"uri":"Scottish_Gaelic","surface_form":"Scottish Gaelic","offset":660},{"uri":"Doric_dialect_(Scotland)","surface_form":"Doric dialect","offset":898},{"uri":"Scots_language","surface_form":"Scots","offset":915},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":926}]}
