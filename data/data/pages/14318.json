{"id":14318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx","text":"The Bronx is the northern part of New York City, United States. The name came from Bronck's Farms, owned by a settler called Jonas Bronck. The Bronx was once the southern part of Westchester County, but is now one of the five boroughs of New York City as well as a county in New York State called Bronx County. The Bronx River flows south out of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, New York, through the middle of The Bronx, and into Long Island Sound.\nTwo places to visit in The Bronx are the Bronx Zoo and Yankee Stadium, where the New York Yankees baseball team plays.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":34},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":49},{"uri":"Settler","surface_form":"settler","offset":110},{"uri":"Westchester_County%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Westchester County","offset":179},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":226},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":265},{"uri":"Yonkers","surface_form":"Yonkers","offset":346},{"uri":"Mount_Vernon%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Mount Vernon, New York","offset":358},{"uri":"Long_Island_Sound","surface_form":"Long Island Sound","offset":424},{"uri":"Bronx_Zoo","surface_form":"Bronx Zoo","offset":484},{"uri":"Yankee_Stadium","surface_form":"Yankee Stadium","offset":498},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":524}]}
