{"id":143242,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Christ","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Community of Christ is a Mormon movement. From 1872 to 2001, it was known as Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). It was founded in the 1860s. It did not recognise Brigham Young as a Prophet, but instead followed Joseph Smith III, the son of the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith. Unlike the followers of Young who went to Utah they remained were they were, in the Midwestern United States, mainly in Missouri. A number of court cases established this Church as the follower of law of the church established by Smith. for this reason it has the most manuscripts and the oldest Temple.\nIn general, their beliefs are closer to mainline Protestant Christianity. Unlike other Latter-day Saints movements, they have a classic view of the Trinity. Their baptism is therefore recognised as a valid Christian one.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mormonism","surface_form":"Mormon","offset":42},{"uri":"Brigham_Young","surface_form":"Brigham Young","offset":208},{"uri":"Joseph_Smith","surface_form":"Joseph Smith","offset":312},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":368},{"uri":"Midwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Midwestern United States","offset":410},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":446},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":595},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":679},{"uri":"Trinity","surface_form":"Trinity","offset":778},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptism","offset":793},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":836}]}
