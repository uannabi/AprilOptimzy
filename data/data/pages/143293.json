{"id":143293,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_(grammar)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In grammar, case changes what a noun, adjective or pronoun does in a sentence. It is a set of forms which depend on the syntax (how the words go together). Case is an example of inflection, which is often an affix, a part of a word that is added to other words, that signals a grammatical relationship. Long ago, Old English used several cases, but Modern English uses only two cases for nouns.p197\nHistory of case.\nIn many languages like Latin, German, Russian, Spanish, Korean and Japanese, a noun's case changes the end of a word depending on the noun's role in the sentence. Nouns change their endings to show that they are doing something, that something is done to them, that they just happen to be there during the action or that they own something. Therefore, the order that the words are put together in a sentence is less important than in English, whose word order changes the meaning of a sentence.\nModern English.\nIn English, case is not used much. Instead, word order and auxiliary verb<nowiki/>s (helpers) are more important.\nEnglish adjectives unchanged: \"red hat\", \"red hats\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":16},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":45},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":51},{"uri":"Pronoun","surface_form":"pronoun","offset":64},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":133},{"uri":"Inflection","surface_form":"inflection","offset":191},{"uri":"Affix","surface_form":"affix","offset":221},{"uri":"Signal","surface_form":"signal","offset":280},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":326},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":452},{"uri":"German_langauge","surface_form":"German","offset":459},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":467},{"uri":"Spanish_(language)","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":476},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":485},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":496},{"uri":"Word_order","surface_form":"word order","offset":984},{"uri":"Auxiliary_verb","surface_form":"auxiliary verb","offset":999}]}
