{"id":14332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle","text":"A triangle is a shape, or a part of two dimensional space. It has three straight sides and three vertices. The three angles of a triangle always add up to 180\u00B0 (180 degrees). It is the polygon with the least possible number of sides. A triangle with vertices \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" is written as formula_1.\nUses.\nTriangles are extremely useful. The study of geometry related to triangles is called trigonometry. Some people have spent their entire lives studying triangles for use in trigonometry.\nModern computers usually use triangles to make more complex graphic images or shapes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":16},{"uri":"2D","surface_form":"two dimensional","offset":36},{"uri":"Space_(physics)","surface_form":"space","offset":52},{"uri":"3_(number)","surface_form":"three","offset":66},{"uri":"Side","surface_form":"side","offset":81},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"vertices","offset":97},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":117},{"uri":"Degree_(angle)","surface_form":"degrees","offset":165},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":185},{"uri":"Trigonometry","surface_form":"trigonometry","offset":389},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":496}]}
