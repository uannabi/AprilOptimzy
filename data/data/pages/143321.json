{"id":143321,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit","text":"e=\"preserve\">An LC circuit is an electronic circuit made up of an inductor and a capacitor.\nLC circuit's resonant frequency is equal to: formula_1\nThe angular frequency \u03C9 has units of radians per second.\nLC circuits are used for creating signals at a particular frequency, or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal. An ideal LC circuit does not have resistance.\nAt LC circuit energy saves in the capacitor's electric field.\nformula_1\nU is energy and q is electric charge.\nAt LC circuit energy also save in the inductor's magnetic field.\nformula_1\nU is energy and i is electric current that flows in inductor.\nLet's analyze an LC circuit's vibration. Vibrating LC circuit's total energy is U.\nformula_1\nBecause circuit's resistance is 0, there is no energy that transmits to heat energy, and U is maintained regularity.\nformula_1\nSo LC circuit's vibration is shown like that\nformula_1\nFirst consider the Electrical impedance of the series LC circuit. The total impedance is given by the sum of the inductive and capacitive impedances\nformula_1\nBy writing the inductive impedance as formula_1 and capacitive impedance as formula_1\nResultingly the series connected circuit, when connected to a circuit in series, will act as a band-pass filter having zero impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuits.\nThe same analysis may be applied to the parallel LC circuit. The total impedance is then given by\nformula_1\nand after substitution of formula_1 and formula_1 we have\nformula_1\nformula_1.\nResultingly the parallel connected circuit will act as band-stop filter having infinite impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic circuit","offset":33},{"uri":"Inductor","surface_form":"inductor","offset":66},{"uri":"Capacitor","surface_form":"capacitor","offset":81},{"uri":"Resonant_frequency","surface_form":"resonant frequency","offset":105},{"uri":"Angular_frequency","surface_form":"angular frequency","offset":151},{"uri":"Radian","surface_form":"radian","offset":184},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":262},{"uri":"Resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":385},{"uri":"Band-pass","surface_form":"band-pass","offset":1259},{"uri":"Band-stop_filter","surface_form":"band-stop filter","offset":1586}]}
