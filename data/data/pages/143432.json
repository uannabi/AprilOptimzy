{"id":143432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_model","text":"A computer-based model is a computer program that is designed to simulate what might or what did happen in a situation. They are used in many ways including in astronomy, economics and sciences such as physics and biology. Computer models are used in fields such as earthquake performance simulation and making models of buildings.\nComputer modelling often uses numerical analysis to approximate the real solution of the problem. Simulation techniques are then used to get values. Numerical weather predictions are too inaccurate to give a good local prediction of the weather, so other methods are used to adjust them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":28},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"simulate","offset":65},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":160},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":171},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":185},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":202},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":214},{"uri":"Earthquake_performance_simulation","surface_form":"earthquake performance simulation","offset":266},{"uri":"Building_model","surface_form":"models of buildings","offset":311},{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":362},{"uri":"Approximation","surface_form":"approximate","offset":384},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"Simulation","offset":430},{"uri":"Numerical_weather_prediction","surface_form":"Numerical weather prediction","offset":481}]}
