{"id":143475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau","text":"The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau that covers most of South India. It is triangular, surrounded by three mountain ranges. It extends over eight Indian states (principally, Telangana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu).\nThe plateau covers, 43 percent of India's landmass.\nThe uplands, areas of higher landmass, form a triangle that is nested in the familiar downward-pointing triangle of the Indian sub-continent's coastline. In the south of India, the plateau is largely over above sea level. In the north it is mostly about above sea level.\nThe plateau is extremely large, and there are many habitats: different ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation, climate, geology and animals. The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains.\nOn the west of the plateau are the Western Ghats and in the east are the Eastern Ghats. These mountain ranges rise from their nearby coastal plains and nearly meet at the southern tip of India. The mountains make the southward-pointing vertex of a triangle. The northern boundary of the triangle is made up by the Satpura Range and Vindhya Range. These northern ranges separate the plateau from the heavily populated riverine plains of northern India.\nOrigin of name.\nThe name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word \"dakkhin\", which comes from the Sanskrit word \"dak\u1E63i\u1E47a-\" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.\nThe Deccan Traps.\nThe Deccan Traps are a main cause of the special geography and geology of South India. They are a large igneous province on the Deccan Plateau of west-central India (between 17\u201324N, 73\u201374E) and one of the largest volcanic features on the planet. They consist of multiple layers of solidified flood basalt that are more than thick and cover an area of. The term 'trap', used in geology for such rock formations, is derived from the Dutch word for stairs, referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.\nHistory.\nThe Deccan Traps formed between 60 and 68 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats (near present-day Mumbai) some 66\u00A0million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted fewer than 30,000\u00A0years in total. The gases released in the process may have played a role in the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary extinction event, which included the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. The consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in Central America but that the Deccan eruptions also disrupted the planet's climate.\nBefore the Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics, it is estimated that the original area covered by the lava flows was as large as 1.5\u00A0million km\u00B2, about half the size of modern India. The present area of directly observable lava flows is estimated to be around.\nThe release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary climate change. Data point to an average fall in temperature of 2\u00A0\u00B0C (3.6\u00A0\u00B0F) during this period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":30},{"uri":"South_India","surface_form":"South India","offset":58},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":109},{"uri":"Telangana","surface_form":"Telangana","offset":176},{"uri":"Maharashtra","surface_form":"Maharashtra","offset":187},{"uri":"Andhra_Pradesh","surface_form":"Andhra Pradesh","offset":200},{"uri":"Karnataka","surface_form":"Karnataka","offset":216},{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":227},{"uri":"Tamil_Nadu","surface_form":"Tamil Nadu","offset":238},{"uri":"Percent","surface_form":"percent","offset":274},{"uri":"Highland_(geography)","surface_form":"uplands","offset":307},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":514},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":625},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":645},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":692},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":701},{"uri":"Himalaya","surface_form":"Himalaya","offset":768},{"uri":"Western_Ghats","surface_form":"Western Ghats","offset":824},{"uri":"Eastern_Ghats","surface_form":"Eastern Ghats","offset":862},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"vertex","offset":1025},{"uri":"Satpura_Range","surface_form":"Satpura Range","offset":1103},{"uri":"Vindhya_Range","surface_form":"Vindhya Range","offset":1121},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1206},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":1215},{"uri":"Prakrit","surface_form":"Prakrit","offset":1292},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":1337},{"uri":"Igneous","surface_form":"igneous","offset":1520},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1575},{"uri":"Volcanic","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":1629},{"uri":"Flood_basalt","surface_form":"flood basalt","offset":1708},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":1793},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":1810},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":2028},{"uri":"Western_Ghats","surface_form":"Western Ghats","offset":2097},{"uri":"Mumbai","surface_form":"Mumbai","offset":2129},{"uri":"Cretaceous%E2%80%93Tertiary_extinction_event","surface_form":"Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary extinction event","offset":2303},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":2360},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":2388},{"uri":"Chicxulub_crater","surface_form":"Chicxulub impact event","offset":2488},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":2663},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":2675},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":2746},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":2949},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":3027}]}
