{"id":14366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)","text":"Eris is a dwarf planet and a trans-Neptunian object (TNO). It is the second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, but it is more massive (has more mass) than Pluto. It is a \"scattered disc object\" in the Kuiper belt, further out than Pluto. It is also called a \"plutoid\" because the IAU decided to rename all trans-Neptunian dwarf planets as plutoids. Eris orbits the sun once every 557 Earth years. It has an elliptical orbit, inclined at an angle of 44\u00B0 between the plane of the orbit of the planet and the ecliptic, the plane containing Earth's orbital path.\nEris has one moon, called Dysnomia.\nDiscovery.\nEris was discovered by Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on January 5, 2005, when they were having a close look at some images of the outer Solar System taken in 2003.\nNaming.\nEris was originally called \"Xena\", after the main character of the television series '. However, there is a rule stating that all objects orbiting outside Neptune\u2019s orbit have to be named after a creation of mythology. Therefore, it was officially named Eris on September 13, 2006. Eris is named after the goddess of strife, discord, contention and rivalry in Greek mythology.\nMoon of Eris.\nEris has one moon called Dysnomia. It was discovered on September 10, 2005. Dysnomia was originally nicknamed \"Gabrielle\", after a character from the television series \"Xena: Warrior Princess\", like Eris. However, like Eris, it could not be called this. Dysnomia was named after the daughter of Eris, in Greek mythology. Dysnomia is the goddess (or spirit) of lawlessness and poor civil constitution.\nClassification.\nMedia reports have argued that Eris is the tenth planet, along with astronomers and NASA scientists. However, the definition of a planet was changed in August 2006. Under the new specifications, Eris, along with Pluto, was lowered in status to a dwarf planet.\nFuture.\nScientists are continuing to find out more about Eris and its moon, and to look for any more moons and possible rings. Because Eris is so far away, it would take 24.5 years to visit Eris with a space probe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dwarf_planet","surface_form":"dwarf planet","offset":10},{"uri":"Trans-Neptunian_object","surface_form":"trans-Neptunian object","offset":29},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":110},{"uri":"Pluto","surface_form":"Pluto","offset":154},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":194},{"uri":"Scattered_disc","surface_form":"scattered disc","offset":221},{"uri":"Kuiper_belt","surface_form":"Kuiper belt","offset":251},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":457},{"uri":"Orbital_inclination","surface_form":"inclined","offset":475},{"uri":"Ecliptic","surface_form":"ecliptic","offset":556},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":622},{"uri":"Dysnomia","surface_form":"Dysnomia","offset":635},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":918},{"uri":"Neptune_(planet)","surface_form":"Neptune\u2019s","offset":1006},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":1059},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":1157},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":1211},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":1255},{"uri":"Dysnomia","surface_form":"Dysnomia","offset":1267},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"Media","offset":1659},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":1708},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":1727},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":1743},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientists","offset":1748},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1818},{"uri":"Dwarf_planet","surface_form":"dwarf planet","offset":1905},{"uri":"Planetary_ring","surface_form":"rings","offset":2039}]}
