{"id":14385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dentition is the development of teeth and where the teeth are in the mouth. Almost all mammals have up to four different types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Animals that have different types of teeth are called \"heterodont\". If they do not, they are called \"homodont\".\nIn mammals, the young have a set of primary teeth (milk teeth) that fall out after a few years. When they fall out, adult teeth grow in. Animals that have milk teeth and adult teeth are called diphyodont.\nArchaeology.\nDentition is important in archaeology. Dentition is used to study human migration. Tooth enamel contains trace elements which show where they grew.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":45},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":82},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":100},{"uri":"Incisor","surface_form":"incisor","offset":150},{"uri":"Canine_tooth","surface_form":"canine","offset":160},{"uri":"Premolar","surface_form":"premolar","offset":169},{"uri":"Molar","surface_form":"molar","offset":184},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeology","offset":548},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migration","offset":594},{"uri":"Tooth_enamel","surface_form":"enamel","offset":611},{"uri":"Trace_element","surface_form":"trace element","offset":627}]}
