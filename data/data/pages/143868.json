{"id":143868,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino%E2%80%93Tibetan_languages","text":"The Sino-Tibetan or Trans-Himalayan languages, form a language family. This includes Chinese and the Tibeto-Burman languages and some 250 languages of East Asia. Kra-Dai languages and Hmong\u2013Mien languages are also sometimes included.\nThe largest language within this family are the Chinese languages by far with over 1.3 billion native speakers. It is also the one with the oldest writing (hanzi) going back to the Jiahu symbols in 6600 BC.\nAll these languages descend from a single proto-language. People are still working on what this sounded like.\nWhere did it come from?\nSome researchers think the Sino-Tibetan languages very likely came from the Huanghe in North-Central China (Zhongyuan). Others think they came from much further west, in southwest China or even Northeast India.\nZhang et al. (2019) did a study of 109 Sino-Tibetan languages to suggest a Sino-Tibetan homeland in northern China near the Huanghe basin. He found there was a split between Sinitic languages and the Tibeto-Burman languages approximately 4,200-7,800 years ago (with an average of 5,900 years ago). This is connected with the expansion of the Yangshao culture and Majiayao culture. Others agree by using different data; they say it came from around 7,200 years ago, around the Cishan and early Yangshao culture.\nEvolution of language.\nProto-Chinese and Proto-Tibeto-Burman had many different prefixes and suffixes. Proto-Chinese changed to Old Chinese around the Shang Dynasty. This is shown in the Book of songs. Nouns, verbs, and modifiers were all dependent on affixes (beginning of words) such as *s-, *p-, *-k. After the Warring State Period in China, Old Chinese started using tones. The suffix (end of words) *-s was also used.\nThe typical word order in Sino-Tibetan languages is object-verb. Modern Chinese, Bai, Karenic, and Mruic are exceptions.\nSOV is likely the original word order. Over time Chinese became subject\u2013verb\u2013object. However, Chinese differs from almost all other VO languages in the world in placing relative clauses before the nouns they modify.\nRelation to other language families.\nSino-Tibetan may be related to the Altaic languages. Mang Mulin, a Mongolian linguistics professor at the Inner Mongolia Normal University, began studying the origin of Mongolian words in the late 1970s.\nThere are links between Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic (from South China), and Austronesian (from Taiwan) languages.\nThere may even be connections between Chinese and the native languages of the Americas (Na-Dene) and Western Eurasia (Yeniseian).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"language family","offset":54},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":85},{"uri":"Tibeto-Burman_languages","surface_form":"Tibeto-Burman languages","offset":101},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":151},{"uri":"Kra-Dai_languages","surface_form":"Kra-Dai languages","offset":162},{"uri":"Hmong%E2%80%93Mien_languages","surface_form":"Hmong\u2013Mien languages","offset":184},{"uri":"Varieties_of_Chinese","surface_form":"Chinese languages","offset":282},{"uri":"Chinese_characters","surface_form":"hanzi","offset":390},{"uri":"Jiahu_symbols","surface_form":"Jiahu symbols","offset":415},{"uri":"Proto-language","surface_form":"proto-language","offset":483},{"uri":"Huanghe","surface_form":"Huanghe","offset":651},{"uri":"Zhongyuan","surface_form":"Zhongyuan","offset":683},{"uri":"Yellow_River","surface_form":"Huanghe","offset":910},{"uri":"Varieties_of_Chinese","surface_form":"Sinitic languages","offset":960},{"uri":"Tibeto-Burman_languages","surface_form":"Tibeto-Burman languages","offset":986},{"uri":"Yangshao_culture","surface_form":"Yangshao culture","offset":1128},{"uri":"Majiayao_culture","surface_form":"Majiayao culture","offset":1149},{"uri":"Cishan_culture","surface_form":"Cishan","offset":1262},{"uri":"Yangshao_culture","surface_form":"Yangshao culture","offset":1279},{"uri":"Proto-Tibeto-Burman_language","surface_form":"Proto-Tibeto-Burman","offset":1338},{"uri":"Shang_dynasty","surface_form":"Shang Dynasty","offset":1448},{"uri":"Classic_of_Poetry","surface_form":"Book of songs","offset":1484},{"uri":"Warring_States_period","surface_form":"Warring State Period","offset":1611},{"uri":"Old_Chinese","surface_form":"Old Chinese","offset":1642},{"uri":"Tone_(linguistics)","surface_form":"tones","offset":1668},{"uri":"Object-verb","surface_form":"object-verb","offset":1772},{"uri":"Greater_Bai_languages","surface_form":"Bai","offset":1801},{"uri":"Karenic_languages","surface_form":"Karenic","offset":1806},{"uri":"Mruic_languages","surface_form":"Mruic","offset":1819},{"uri":"Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object","surface_form":"subject\u2013verb\u2013object","offset":1905},{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic languages","offset":2129},{"uri":"Austroasiatic_languages","surface_form":"Austroasiatic","offset":2336},{"uri":"Austronesian_languages","surface_form":"Austronesian","offset":2374},{"uri":"Na-Dene","surface_form":"Na-Dene","offset":2500},{"uri":"Yeniseian","surface_form":"Yeniseian","offset":2530}]}
