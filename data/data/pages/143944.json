{"id":143944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanam_Luang","text":"Sanam Luang is a big field in front of Wat Phra Kaew and the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Thailand. Sanam Luang has another name, Tung Pra Me'ru (meaning cremation field). It was used for cremation of the King and his royal relatives. In 1855, King Rama IV changed the field's name to Sanam luang, announcing that the old name was thought unlucky.\nKing Rama I used Sanam Luang to officiate ceremonies. Then in King Rama V's era, Sanam Luang was extended and the buildings around it were destroyed. The people used Sanam Luang to perform ceremonies instead of growing rice.\nIn King Rama VI's era, Sanam Luang was used for horse racing and part of the field was turned into a golf couse.\nAt present, the Thai people still use Sanam Luang to officiate royal ceremonies for the King, princes and princesses. Sanam Luang is an important national site.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Field","surface_form":"field","offset":21},{"uri":"Wat_Phra_Kaew","surface_form":"Wat Phra Kaew","offset":39},{"uri":"Bangkok","surface_form":"Bangkok","offset":77},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":86},{"uri":"Cremation","surface_form":"cremation","offset":150},{"uri":"King_Rama_IV","surface_form":"King Rama IV","offset":240},{"uri":"King_Rama_I","surface_form":"King Rama I","offset":344},{"uri":"King_Rama_V","surface_form":"King Rama V","offset":406},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":563},{"uri":"King_Rama_VI","surface_form":"King Rama VI","offset":572}]}
