He was known for his \"seven dirty words\" routine. The routine was about seven words people should not say in the media. (The list was ironically used by many radio stations, as a guide to what kind of language was not allowed.) Comedy Central called Carlin one of the greatest stand-up comedians.\nCarlin acted in movies including \"Jersey Girl\", \"Dogma\", \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" (and its sequel), \"Scary Movie 3\", and Disney's \"Tarzan 2\". He also narrated the children's television series \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" from 1984 to 1995 (Actor Alec Baldwin later took over the role in 1998), and Portrayed Mr. Conductor on \"Shining Time Station\".\nCarlin had a history of heart problems. He had several heart attacks. He died of heart failure in Santa Monica, California at age 71.\nPersonal life.\nCarlin married Brenda Hosbrook on June 3, 1961, together they have a daughter named Kelly.
