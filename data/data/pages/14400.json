{"id":14400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language","text":"Portuguese () is a Romance language. It came from Galician-Portuguese, which was first spoken in Northwestern Iberia. It then spread south and split. During the colonial era, Portuguese was also spread to Brazil and other parts of the world.\nWhere it is spoken.\nThe Portuguese language is the third-most spoken western language (after English and Spanish). There are about 240 million native speakers, including the people of Portugal, Brazil, and Cape Verde (\"Cabo Verde\"). It is also the official language of Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique (\"Mo\u00E7ambique\"), and S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe (\"S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 e Pr\u00EDncipe\"), which have Portuguese as the \"lingua franca,\" but native languages are also spoken. It is also an official language in East Timor and Macau.\nAlso, some enclaves in Asia, such as Goa and Daman and Diu, in India; Flores, Indonesia; and Malacca, Malaysia, have Portuguese-speakers, and it is a minority language in Venezuela, Canada, Uruguay, Namibia, and the United States.\nVocabulary.\nPortuguese and English have words that mean the same and are similar as well. The words came from the same languages (usually Latin, Greek or French).\nSome English words come from Portuguese, such as tank (\"tanque\"), cacao (\"cacau\"), marmalade (marmelada from \"marmelo\" \"quince\"), caramel, molasses, mosquito, cobra, breeze (brisa), albino, coconut, zebra, pagoda, Mandarin, buccaneer, fetish, tapioca and commando.\nThe Portuguese word \"parentes\" is similar to the English word \"parents\", but it means \"relatives\", and the Portuguese word to mean \"parents\" is \"pais\".\nDifferent versions.\nPortuguese is the official language of all countries of the CPLP (\"Comunidade dos pa\u00EDses de l\u00EDngua portuguesa\", \"Community of Portuguese Language Countries\"). The Portuguese-speaking countries have more than 240 million people across the world.\nThe CPLP was formed in 1996 with seven countries: Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe. East Timor joined in 2002.\nThe CPLP nations speak Portuguese with different accents. In some regions of Brazil (the country has 81% of the world's Portuguese-speakers), \"tu(\"you\" but used only to family and close friends) is not used as much as in Portugal. Also, regional slang can be found in different areas. The Portuguese Orthographic Agreement of 1990 (Acordo Ortogr\u00E1fico de 1990) tries to get rid of some of the differences in spelling.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romance_language","surface_form":"Romance language","offset":19},{"uri":"Galician-Portuguese","surface_form":"Galician-Portuguese","offset":50},{"uri":"Iberia","surface_form":"Iberia","offset":110},{"uri":"Early_modern_period","surface_form":"colonial era","offset":161},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":205},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":277},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":426},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":436},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":448},{"uri":"Guinea-Bissau","surface_form":"Guinea-Bissau","offset":511},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":526},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":538},{"uri":"Mozambique","surface_form":"Mozambique","offset":546},{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":577},{"uri":"Lingua_franca","surface_form":"lingua franca","offset":654},{"uri":"East_Timor","surface_form":"East Timor","offset":743},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":758},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":788},{"uri":"Goa","surface_form":"Goa","offset":802},{"uri":"Daman_and_Diu","surface_form":"Daman and Diu","offset":810},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":828},{"uri":"Flores","surface_form":"Flores","offset":835},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia;","offset":843},{"uri":"Malacca","surface_form":"Malacca","offset":858},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":867},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":936},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":947},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":955},{"uri":"Namibia","surface_form":"Namibia","offset":964},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":981},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1023},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":1036},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1134},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":1141},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1150},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tank","offset":1208},{"uri":"Cacao","surface_form":"cacao","offset":1225},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":2087}]}
