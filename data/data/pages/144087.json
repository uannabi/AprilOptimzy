{"id":144087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine%2C_North_Ayrshire","text":"e=\"preserve\">Irvine (Gaelic: \"Irbhinn\") is a coastal new town in North Ayrshire, Scotland.\nIrvine was the site of Scotland's 12th century Military Capital and former headquarters of the Lord High Constable of Scotland, Hugh de Morville. It also served as the Capital of Cunninghame.\nThe town was once a haunt of Robert Burns, after whom two streets in the town are named: Burns Street and Burns Crescent. He is known to have worked in a flax mill on the Glasgow Vennell. Despite being classed as a new town, Irvine has had a long history stretching back many centuries and was classed as a Royal Burgh. There are also conflicting rumours that Mary, Queen of Scots, was briefly involved in the town's history. Some say she stayed briefly at Seagate Castle. To this day there is still an annual festival, called Marymass, held in the town.\nIrvine is the birthplace of the present Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon and the former First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell. Its twin town is Saint-Amand-les-Eaux in northern France just outside Lille.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scottish_Gaelic","surface_form":"Gaelic","offset":21},{"uri":"New_town","surface_form":"new town","offset":53},{"uri":"North_Ayrshire","surface_form":"North Ayrshire","offset":65},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":81},{"uri":"Lord_High_Constable_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Lord High Constable of Scotland","offset":186},{"uri":"Hugh_de_Morville","surface_form":"Hugh de Morville","offset":219},{"uri":"Robert_Burns","surface_form":"Robert Burns","offset":312},{"uri":"Royal_Burgh","surface_form":"Royal Burgh","offset":590},{"uri":"Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots","surface_form":"Mary, Queen of Scots","offset":643},{"uri":"Deputy_First_Minister","surface_form":"Deputy First Minister","offset":878},{"uri":"Nicola_Sturgeon","surface_form":"Nicola Sturgeon","offset":913},{"uri":"First_Minister","surface_form":"First Minister","offset":944},{"uri":"Jack_McConnell","surface_form":"Jack McConnell","offset":972},{"uri":"Saint-Amand-les-Eaux","surface_form":"Saint-Amand-les-Eaux","offset":1005},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1038},{"uri":"Lille","surface_form":"Lille","offset":1058}]}
