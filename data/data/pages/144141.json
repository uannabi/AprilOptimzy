{"id":144141,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus","text":"=\"preserve\">A retrovirus is any virus which copies itself as part of the cell's DNA by reverse transcribing its RNA. Since the cell cannot proofread the step in which RNA is converted back to DNA, errors often go unnoticed. This makes the exact sequence of a retrovirus's RNA change often. This makes it harder for retroviruses to be attacked by drugs.\nHIV is a retrovirus, which makes it very difficult to overcome using drugs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":32},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":80},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"reverse transcribing","offset":87},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":112},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":353}]}
