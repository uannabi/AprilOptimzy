{"id":144393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged_in_New_York","text":"\"MTV Unplugged in New York\" is a live album by the American rock band Nirvana. It was recorded on November 18, 1993 as a part of the \"MTV Unplugged\" television series, which many artists and bands perform on with acoustic instruments instead of electric ones. It was released on November 1, 1994, six months after the band had broken up because of the death of Kurt Cobain, who was the lead singer and guitarist.\nIt was unusual compared to other artists on the \"MTV Unplugged\" series, because Nirvana played mostly their less-famous songs and cover versions of other artists' songs. Most artists on the program played mainly their hits.\nFour singles were released from the album. This was unusual because it was a live album. The singles were \"About a Girl\", \"The Man Who Sold the World\", \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\", and \"Lake of Fire\". All of these except for \"About a Girl\" were covers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Live_album","surface_form":"live album","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":60},{"uri":"Nirvana_(band)","surface_form":"Nirvana","offset":70},{"uri":"MTV_Unplugged","surface_form":"MTV Unplugged","offset":134},{"uri":"Acoustic_music","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":213},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric ones","offset":245},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":361},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"singer","offset":391},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":402},{"uri":"Cover_version","surface_form":"cover version","offset":543},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"singles","offset":642},{"uri":"About_a_Girl_(song)","surface_form":"About a Girl","offset":744},{"uri":"The_Man_Who_Sold_the_World","surface_form":"The Man Who Sold the World","offset":760},{"uri":"Where_Did_You_Sleep_Last_Night","surface_form":"Where Did You Sleep Last Night","offset":790},{"uri":"Lake_of_Fire","surface_form":"Lake of Fire","offset":828}]}
