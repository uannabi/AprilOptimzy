{"id":144402,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicaceae","text":"\"Salicaceae\" is a family of flowering plants. Each plant has either staminate or pistillate catkins. The flowers have no petals or sepals. Each has a small scale-like bract below it. These developing catkins on willows form the well-known \"pussy-willow\" branches.\nExcept for two species of \"Populas\" (Cottonwood), all the members of \"Salicaceae\" in the Bay Area are of the genera \"Salix\" (Willows).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":18},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":28},{"uri":"Staminate","surface_form":"staminate","offset":68},{"uri":"Pistillate","surface_form":"pistillate","offset":81},{"uri":"Catkin","surface_form":"catkin","offset":92},{"uri":"Flowers","surface_form":"flowers","offset":105},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"petal","offset":121},{"uri":"Sepal","surface_form":"sepal","offset":131},{"uri":"Scale","surface_form":"scale","offset":156},{"uri":"Bract","surface_form":"bract","offset":167},{"uri":"Willow","surface_form":"willow","offset":211},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":279},{"uri":"Populas","surface_form":"Populas","offset":291},{"uri":"Cottonwood","surface_form":"Cottonwood","offset":301},{"uri":"Bay_Area","surface_form":"Bay Area","offset":353},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":373},{"uri":"Salix","surface_form":"Salix","offset":381},{"uri":"Willow","surface_form":"Willow","offset":389}]}
