{"id":14443,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romford","text":"Romford is a town in Greater London, and is outside London proper. It is in the London Borough of Havering, England. It was first recorded as a town in 1153 in the \"Red Book of the Exchequer\". The name \"Romford\" means \"wide ford\". The stream that flows through it was only later called \"the Rom River\" after the town.\nIn medieval times, this town was granted the right to have the only market for 6 2/3 miles around. This rule was used in the 1990s to stop a nearby town, Ilford, from opening a market nearby.. Romford had a brewery which now is an entertainment venue.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greater_London","surface_form":"Greater London","offset":21},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":52},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Havering","surface_form":"London Borough of Havering","offset":80},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":108},{"uri":"1153","surface_form":"1153","offset":152},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":321},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":386},{"uri":"Ilford","surface_form":"Ilford","offset":472}]}
