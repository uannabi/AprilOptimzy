{"id":144503,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patiala_and_East_Punjab_States_Union","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) was a former state of India. It was created out of the merger of several Punjabi princely states on 15 July 1948, formally becoming a state of India in 1950. The capital and principal city was Patiala, and the last Maharaja of Patiala, Yadvindra Singh, served as Governor of the state during its short existence. The Governor was appointed by the President of India, but the people of the state also elected a 60-member state assembly, first elected on 6 January 1952. The Congress Party won 26 seats and the Akali Dal 19 seats.\nOn 1 November 1956, PEPSU was merged into Punjab state. Part of the former state of PEPSU, including the southeastern portion of the state around Jind and the Narnaul enclave, presently lie within the state of Haryana, which was separated from Punjab on 1 November 1966.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_India","surface_form":"state","offset":75},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":84},{"uri":"Punjab_region","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":135},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"princely state","offset":143},{"uri":"Maharaja","surface_form":"Maharaja","offset":277},{"uri":"Congress_Party","surface_form":"Congress Party","offset":535},{"uri":"Akali_Dal","surface_form":"Akali Dal","offset":571},{"uri":"Haryana","surface_form":"Haryana","offset":801},{"uri":"Partition_(politics)","surface_form":"separated","offset":820},{"uri":"East_Punjab","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":835}]}
