Vrangel from Crimea|thumb|306x306px|Evacuation Russian Army of General Baron\nWhite \u00E9migr\u00E9 (\u0411\u0435\u043B\u043E\u044D\u043C\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043D\u0442) is a political term used to describe Russian people who left Russia because of the Russian Revolution or Civil War. The term is used in France, the United States and the United Kingdom. Sometimes the term is used to describe everyone who left the country because of changes in the government.\nHistory.\nThe words \"White \u00E9migr\u00E9\" had a very negative meaning in the Soviet Union between 1920 and 1980. After 1980, those people who left during that time are called first wave \u00E9migr\u00E9s.\nMany White \u00E9migr\u00E9s thought the White movement was something good. Some of them, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, did not like the Bolsheviks but did not like the White movement either. Others were just not interested in politics. Many of those who left are still part of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nMost White \u00E9migr\u00E9s left Russia between 1917 and 1920. Between 900,000 and two million people left. Many different classes of people left. These classes included military soldiers and officers, Cossacks, intellectuals, businessmen and landowners. Officials of the Russian Imperial Government and anti-Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War also left.\nDistribution.\nMost \u00E9migr\u00E9s left Southern Russia and Ukraine and went to Turkey. They then moved to eastern European Slavic countries, for example the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. A large number also went to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Germany and France. Berlin and Paris had large \u00E9migr\u00E9 communities.\nMany civilians and military officers in Siberia and the Far East moved to Shanghai and other surrounding areas of China, Central Asia, and Eastern Turkestan. Some moved to Japan.\nDuring and after World War II, many Russian \u00E9migr\u00E9s moved to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia.\nWhat the people believed.\nWhite \u00E9migr\u00E9s often did not like Communism. They did not believe the Soviet Union was properly Russian. They believed the period of time from 1917 until 1991 was a time of occupation by the Soviet government which was internationalist and anti-Christian.\nMany White \u00E9migr\u00E9s believed that Russia should be governed by a monarch. Others thought that the government should be chosen by popular plebiscite.\nMany White \u00E9migr\u00E9s believed that their mission was to keep the culture and way of life from the time before the revolution while living in other countries. They believe that by doing this, they could return Russia to this culture when the Soviet Union was no longer in control of the country.\nMany White \u00E9migr\u00E9s also believed that they should still fight against the Soviet dictatorship. They hoped this would help free Russia. This idea was largely inspired by General Pyotr Wrangel. When the White army was defeated, he said, \"The battle for Russia has not ceased, it has merely taken on new forms\". (\"We are not done trying to free Russia. We just have to use different ways to do so.\")\nOrganizations and activities.\nThe \u00E9migr\u00E9s formed different organisations which had the purpose of fighting against the Soviet regime. Examples of such organisations are the Russian All-Military Union, the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, and the NTS. This made the White \u00E9migr\u00E9s a target for infiltration by the Soviet secret police (i.e. operation TREST and the Inner Line). Seventy-five White army veterans served as volunteers supporting Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.\nSome White \u00E9migr\u00E9s adopted pro-Soviet sympathies, for which they were labelled \"Soviet patriots\". These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi, the Evraziitsi, and the Smenovekhovtsi.\nDuring World War II, many White \u00E9migr\u00E9s took part in the Russian Liberation Movement. On the other hand, a significant number participated in anti-Nazi movements such as the French Resistance. During the war, the White \u00E9migr\u00E9s came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German-occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to flee from the Soviet Union or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labourers and preferred to stay in the West, often referred to as the \"second wave\" of \u00E9migr\u00E9s (often also called DPs \u2013 displaced persons, see Displaced persons camp). This smaller second wave fairly quickly began to assimilate into the White \u00E9migr\u00E9 community.\nAfter the war, active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS: other organizations either dissolved, or began concentrating exclusively on self-preservation and/or educating the youth. Various youth organizations, such as the Russian scouts in exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage.\nThe White \u00E9migr\u00E9s, acting to preserve their church from Soviet influence, formed the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1924. The church continues its existence to this day, acting as both the spiritual and cultural center of the Russian Orthodox community abroad. On May 17, 2007, the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate reestablished canonical ties between the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad and the Russian Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, after more than eighty years of separation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"White_Army","surface_form":"Russian
