{"id":14470,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte","text":"e=\"preserve\">A kilobyte (kB) is a number used to measure storage space on computer hard drives or computer memory. A kilobyte originally meant 1000 bytes. Over time the meaning changed and today it is often used to mean 1024 bytes. This created some confusion as a \"kilo\" normally means 1000. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) now defines a kilobyte as being 1000 bytes. According to the IEC, the correct name for 1,024 bytes is a kibibyte.\nOne thousand kilobytes make one megabyte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hard_drive","surface_form":"hard drive","offset":83},{"uri":"Computer_memory","surface_form":"computer memory","offset":98},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":148},{"uri":"International_Electrotechnical_Commission","surface_form":"International Electrotechnical Commission","offset":297},{"uri":"Kibibyte","surface_form":"kibibyte","offset":449},{"uri":"Megabyte","surface_form":"megabyte","offset":491}]}
