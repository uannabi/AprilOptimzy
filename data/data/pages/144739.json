The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. The ships left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January 1788. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. The \"Fishburn\" was a ship of 378 tons under the command of Master Robert Brown. The ship was long and wide. It had been built in Whitby in 1780. The ship had a contract with the British Government to transport food and equipment. The owners were paid at a rate of 10 shillings per ton per month until the ship returned to Deptford.\nThe \"Fishburn\" and the \"Golden Grove\" left Port Jackson in November 1788 to return to England. She had to rest at the Falkland Islands for several days as several sailors were sick. She was returned to her owners at Deptford on May 25, 1789. No other information has been found about the ship afterwards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"First_Fleet","surface_form":"First Fleet","offset":39},{"uri":"Convict","surface_form":"convict","offset":80},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":93},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":105},{"uri":"Penal_colony","surface_form":"penal colony","offset":126},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":239},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":492},{"uri":"Deptford%2C_London","surface_form":"Deptford","offset":595},{"uri":"Port_Jackson","surface_form":"Port Jackson","offset":648},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":723}]}
