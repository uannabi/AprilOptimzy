The Mort stretches between Eraclea Mare and the mouth of the Piave river and it is a sea-lagoon, being supplied with water only by the flood-tides. Still uncontaminated, the Mort is characterized by shallow and calm waters with a sandy and muddy seabed, rich in phytoplankton.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province_of_Venice","surface_form":"province of Venice","offset":38},{"uri":"Veneto","surface_form":"Veneto","offset":58},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":66},{"uri":"Lido","surface_form":"Lido","offset":115},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":186},{"uri":"Caorle","surface_form":"Caorle","offset":291},{"uri":"Jesolo","surface_form":"Jesolo","offset":302},{"uri":"FEE","surface_form":"FEE","offset":651}]}
