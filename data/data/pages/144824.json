{"id":144824,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law","text":"With each formula_1 as the angle measured from the normal of the boundary, formula_1 as the velocity of light in the respective medium (SI units are meters per second, or m/s). formula_1 is the refractive index of the medium.\nThe index of refraction of a vacuum is 1 and the velocity of light in a vacuum is formula_1. When a wave passes the material where the index of refraction is n, the velocity of the wave becomes formula_1.\nSnell's law can be proved by Fermat's principle. Fermat's principle states that \"light travels along the path which takes the least time\".\nHistory.\nThe idea has a long history. The problem had the attention of Hero of Alexandria, Ptolemy, Ibn Sahl, and Huygens. Ibn Sahl actually discovered the law of refraction. In \"Trait\u00E9 de la Lumiere\", 1678, Huygens showed how Snell's law of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the wave nature of light.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":255},{"uri":"Fermat","surface_form":"Fermat","offset":460},{"uri":"Hero_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Hero of Alexandria","offset":641},{"uri":"Ptolemy","surface_form":"Ptolemy","offset":661},{"uri":"Ibn_Sahl","surface_form":"Ibn Sahl","offset":670},{"uri":"Huygens","surface_form":"Huygens","offset":684}]}
