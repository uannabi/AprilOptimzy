He was king for 30 years. This time has been called the \"greatest explosion of human energy ever seen in Burma\". As king, Bayinnaung created the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. This empire included much of Burma, Manipur, Chinese Shan States (southern Yunnan), Lan Na (northern Thailand), Siam (central and southern Thailand) and Lan Xang (Laos and northeastern Thailand).\nBayinnaung's made the Shan States part of the Burmese kingdoms. This removed the threat of Shan raids into Upper Burma. This had been a concern to Upper Burma since the late 13th century. The kink took control of the Shan States in 1557. He put in an administrative system that took away much of the power of the Shan saophas (chiefs). The also made changes to some of their customs to make them similar to other customs in the kingdoms. His policy for dealing with the Shan was used by all Burmese kings until the kingdom was taken control of by the British in 1885.\nHe could not use this policy everywhere in his very large empire. His empire was a group of former sovereign kingdoms. The kings of each of the kingdoms were loyal to him. He was the Cakravartin (Universal Ruler). They were not loyal to the kingdom itself. Siam left the kingdom three years after of his death in 1584. By 1599, all the sub-kingdoms had left. Bayinnaung's empire had ended.\nHe is thought to be one of the three best Burmese kings. The other two are Anawrahta and Alaungpaya. Many well known places in modern Myanmar are named after him. He is also well known in Thailand because of a popular song and book. Both are called \"Phu Chana Sip Thit\". The name means \"the Conqueror of Ten Directions.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":122},{"uri":"Toungoo_dynasty","surface_form":"Toungoo dynasty","offset":134},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":153},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":160},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explosion","offset":236},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":249},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":255},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":323},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":337},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":348},{"uri":"Manipur","surface_form":"Manipur","offset":400},{"uri":"Mong_Mao","surface_form":"Chinese Shan States","offset":409},{"uri":"Yunnan","surface_form":"Yunnan","offset":439},{"uri":"Lan_Na","surface_form":"Lan Na","offset":448},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":465},{"uri":"Ayutthaya_Kingdom","surface_form":"Siam","offset":476},{"uri":"Lan_Xang","surface_form":"Lan Xang","offset":517},{"uri":"Shan_States","surface_form":"Shan States","offset":582},{"uri":"Bamar","surface_form":"Burmese","offset":606},{"uri":"Raid","surface_form":"raid","offset":656},{"uri":"Upper_Burma","surface_form":"Upper Burma","offset":707},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":734},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative system","offset":811},{"uri":"Saopha","surface_form":"saopha","offset":878},{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":935},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policy","offset":1002},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":1111},{"uri":"Sovereign","surface_form":"sovereign","offset":1227},{"uri":"Loyalty","surface_form":"loyal","offset":1286},{"uri":"Cakravartin","surface_form":"Cakravartin","offset":1311},{"uri":"Siam","surface_form":"Siam","offset":1385},{"uri":"List_of_Burmese_monarchs","surface_form":"Burmese kings","offset":1560},{"uri":"Anawrahta","surface_form":"Anawrahta","offset":1593},{"uri":"Alaungpaya","surface_form":"Alaungpaya","offset":1607},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":1652},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":1706},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":1736},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":1745}]}
