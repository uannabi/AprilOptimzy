{"id":14510,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert","text":"A dessert is a type of food that is eaten after lunch or dinner, and sometimes after a light meal or snack. It is usually a sweet food, like ice cream, cookies, and cakes. In some countries, cheeses such as Brie cheese and fruit are served as dessert. Some desserts are decorated, like birthday cakes. Others are simple, like pudding. Many desserts are baked (cooked in an oven). Some desserts are served with whipped cream as a topping.\nThe term \"dessert\" can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatin's, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savoury to create desserts.\nBaked desserts.\nBaked desserts are made by putting the ingredients in a hot oven. Baked desserts include cakes and muffins (a mixture of flour, eggs, sugar, oil, baking powder, and flavorings); sweet breads such as banana bread and raisin bread (a mixture of flour, sugar, oil, baking powder, and flavorings); cookies such as chocolate chip cookies (a mixture of flour, eggs, sugar, oil, and flavorings). Puddings and custards (a mixture of milk, eggs, sugar, and flavorings) can be made in the oven.\nFried desserts.\nFried desserts are made using a cooking process called deep frying. To deep-fry food, a large pot filled with oil is heated, and then the food is placed into the pot. Deep-fried desserts include doughnuts.\nFrozen desserts.\nFrozen desserts are made by blending the ingredients in a freezer. Frozen desserts include ice cream (a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings), milk shakes (a mixture of ice cream, milk, and flavorings), and sherbet (also spelled \"sorbet\") (a mixture of water, sugar, and flavorings).\nChilled desserts.\nSome desserts are made without using the oven or the freezer. Trifle is an English dessert made by soaking ladyfinger biscuits in sherry, covering them with whipped cream, and then letting it chill in the refrigerator. Some types of instant pudding and instant mousse desserts can be made without cooking; a person simply mixes the instant pudding powder with milk and chills it in the refrigerator.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":23},{"uri":"Lunch","surface_form":"lunch","offset":48},{"uri":"Dinner","surface_form":"dinner","offset":57},{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":124},{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":141},{"uri":"Cookie","surface_form":"cookie","offset":152},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":165},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":191},{"uri":"Brie","surface_form":"Brie","offset":207},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":223},{"uri":"Decorated","surface_form":"decorated","offset":270},{"uri":"Pudding","surface_form":"pudding","offset":326},{"uri":"Whipped_cream","surface_form":"whipped cream","offset":410},{"uri":"Oven","surface_form":"oven","offset":854},{"uri":"Muffin","surface_form":"muffin","offset":893},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":915},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":922},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":928},{"uri":"Baking_powder","surface_form":"baking powder","offset":940},{"uri":"Banana_bread","surface_form":"banana bread","offset":993},{"uri":"Raisin_bread","surface_form":"raisin bread","offset":1010},{"uri":"Cookie","surface_form":"cookie","offset":1088},{"uri":"Pudding","surface_form":"Pudding","offset":1183},{"uri":"Custard","surface_form":"custard","offset":1196},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":1219},{"uri":"Deep_frying","surface_form":"deep frying","offset":1350},{"uri":"Doughnuts","surface_form":"doughnuts","offset":1490},{"uri":"Refrigerator","surface_form":"freezer","offset":1576},{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":1609},{"uri":"Milk_shake","surface_form":"milk shake","offset":1670},{"uri":"Sherbet","surface_form":"sherbet","offset":1734},{"uri":"Trifle","surface_form":"Trifle","offset":1891},{"uri":"Biscuit","surface_form":"biscuit","offset":1947},{"uri":"Sherry","surface_form":"sherry","offset":1959},{"uri":"Whipped_cream","surface_form":"whipped cream","offset":1986},{"uri":"Instant_pudding","surface_form":"instant pudding","offset":2062}]}
