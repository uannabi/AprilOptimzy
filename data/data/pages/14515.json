{"id":14515,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom","text":"Viacom (short for Video & Audio Communications) was an American entertainment company. It started in 1970 as Viacom International, the syndication division of CBS TV (which they once owned). In 2005, Viacom split into two companies: the original company was renamed CBS Corporation, and a new company keeping the Viacom name was created. They own Paramount Pictures, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., and others. They formerly owned the movie rental giant Blockbuster Entertainment.\nIn 2019, Viacom and CBS were merged together. This created ViacomCBS, a combination of the two companies. The merger was finished on December 4, 2019. They have also launched a streaming service called CBS All Access, which includes their library of movies and TV shows, along with original content.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":64},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":78},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":101},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":159},{"uri":"CBS_Corporation","surface_form":"CBS Corporation","offset":266},{"uri":"Paramount_Pictures","surface_form":"Paramount Pictures","offset":347},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":367},{"uri":"Nickelodeon","surface_form":"Nickelodeon","offset":372},{"uri":"Nick_Jr.","surface_form":"Nick Jr.","offset":385},{"uri":"Blockbuster_Entertainment","surface_form":"Blockbuster Entertainment","offset":450},{"uri":"CBS_Corporation","surface_form":"CBS","offset":497},{"uri":"Merger","surface_form":"merged","offset":506},{"uri":"ViacomCBS","surface_form":"ViacomCBS","offset":536}]}
