{"id":145207,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Killer","text":"\"Virgin Killer\" is the fourth album by the German heavy metal band Scorpions. It was released in 1976, and it helped the Scorpions gain fans outside Europe. The album's cover has caused controversy, as it features a naked young girl. Some of the band members have said that the cover is okay, but others have said that they feel bad about releasing it. Some magazines and websites, such as \"Cracked\" and Gigwise.com, have called it one of the worst album covers of all time.\nIn 2008, the English Wikipedia page for \"Virgin Killer\" was put on a blacklist (a list of bad content) by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK organization. Because of this, many major Internet service providers (ISPs) in the UK were banned from seeing the page. The IWF called the cover \"indecent\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":43},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":50},{"uri":"Scorpions_(band)","surface_form":"Scorpions","offset":67},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":149},{"uri":"English_Wikipedia","surface_form":"English Wikipedia","offset":488},{"uri":"Internet_Watch_Foundation","surface_form":"Internet Watch Foundation","offset":585},{"uri":"Internet_service_provider","surface_form":"Internet service provider","offset":665}]}
