{"id":145235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Baruch","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Book of Baruch, sometimes called 1 Baruch, is a deuterocanonical or apocryphal book of the Bible, meaning it is considered part of the Bible by Catholics and members of the Orthodox Church but generally not by Protestants. Even though it is not in the Hebrew Bible, it is in the Septuagint and in the Vulgate Bible, and also in Theodotion's version of the Bible. The Book claims to be have been written by the secretary of the prophet Jeremiah called Baruch in the sixth century BC, which might be true, but the Book was likely only completed in the first century BC. A manuscript of Baruch was found at the Caves of Qumran. The Book of Baruch contains prayer, a request for forgiveness, a recommendation to learn wisdom, a call to be hopeful in the face of Jerusalem's destruction, as well as a reminder to avoid worshiping idols.\nCatholic Bibles also add the Letter of Jeremiah to the Book of Baruch as a sixth chapter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deuterocanonical_books","surface_form":"deuterocanonical","offset":65},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"apocrypha","offset":85},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":108},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholics","offset":161},{"uri":"Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Orthodox Church","offset":190},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":227},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":269},{"uri":"Septuagint","surface_form":"Septuagint","offset":296},{"uri":"Vulgate","surface_form":"Vulgate Bible","offset":318},{"uri":"Theodotion","surface_form":"Theodotion","offset":345},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":373},{"uri":"Letter_of_Jeremiah","surface_form":"Letter of Jeremiah","offset":878}]}
