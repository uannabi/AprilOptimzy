{"id":145380,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic","text":"Modular arithmetic, sometimes also called clock arithmetic, is a way of doing arithmetic with integers. Much like hours on a clock, which repeat every twelve hours, once the numbers reach a certain value, called the \"modulus\", they go back to zero.\nIn general, given a modulus \"formula_1\", we can do addition, subtraction and multiplication on the set formula_1 in a way that \"wrap around\" \"formula_1\". This set is sometimes represented by the symbol formula_1, and called the set of integers modulo \"formula_1\".\nPeople talked about modular arithmetic in many ancient cultures. For instance, the Chinese remainder theorem is many centuries old. The modern notation and exact definition of modular arithmetic were first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nCongruence.\nThe number \"n\" is called the modulus'\". Another definition of congruence, that means the same thing but is sometimes more useful, is that the two integers are congruent modulo n if the difference (\"a\" - \"b\") is an integer multiple of \"n\". That is, if \"n\" is a factor of (\"a\" - \"b\"), then \"a\" and \"b\" are congruent mod \"n\".\nThe remainder when 32 is divided by 7 is 4, and the remainder when 11 is divided by 7 is also 4. This tells us that they are congruent\u2014when the modulus is 7.\nWe can use this example with the other definition too. The difference, (\"a\" - \"b\"), is 32 - 11 = 21. This shows the two numbers are congruent, because 21 = 3 \u00D7 7 and 7 is a factor of 21.\nUses.\nModular arithmetic is useful in many fields, and its applications include RSA algorithm in cryptography, primality testing in computer science, and 12-tone arithmetic in music. It is often used in calculating checksums and check digits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":78},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":94},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clock","offset":125},{"uri":"Chinese_remainder_theorem","surface_form":"Chinese remainder theorem","offset":596},{"uri":"Notation","surface_form":"notation","offset":656},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":675},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":732},{"uri":"Difference","surface_form":"difference","offset":951},{"uri":"Factor","surface_form":"factor","offset":1026},{"uri":"RSA_algorithm","surface_form":"RSA algorithm","offset":1514},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"in cryptography","offset":1528},{"uri":"Primality_test","surface_form":"primality testing","offset":1545},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":1566},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":1610},{"uri":"Checksum","surface_form":"checksums and check digits","offset":1649}]}
