The flag is the same as the flag of the earlier Kingdom of Libya, used from 1951 to 1969.\nOverview.\nThe previous flag of Libya is still used by supporters of Muammar al-Gaddafi. It was just a plain field of green. It was unique for being the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design, emblems, coat of arms, or any other details.
