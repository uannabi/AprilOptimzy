{"id":14571,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-motion","text":"Stop motion is a way of animation which makes it look like still objects are moving. Clay animation is a good example of how stop motion is used.\nStop-motion requires any camera that can make single frames (or photos). It works by shooting a single frame, moving the object a little bit, and capturing a frame again. Cartoons use a similar way; one of the main differences is that stop motion uses real objects instead of drawn.\nTim Burton, Will Vinton and the Aardman studio have used this method in their productions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animation","offset":24},{"uri":"Clay_animation","surface_form":"Clay animation","offset":85},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":171},{"uri":"Photos","surface_form":"photos","offset":210},{"uri":"Tim_Burton","surface_form":"Tim Burton","offset":429},{"uri":"Will_Vinton","surface_form":"Will Vinton","offset":441},{"uri":"Aardman","surface_form":"Aardman","offset":461},{"uri":"Studio","surface_form":"studio","offset":469}]}
