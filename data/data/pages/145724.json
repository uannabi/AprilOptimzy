{"id":145724,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dog_(1950)","text":"Hurricane Dog was the strongest hurricane in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the fourth named storm of the season. Dog began on August 30 to the east of Antigua. After passing through the northern Lesser Antilles, the storm turned to the north and became a Category 5 hurricane. Dog reached its highest strength of 185\u00A0mph (295\u00A0km/h) winds over the ocean. The hurricane weakened and passed within 200\u00A0miles (320\u00A0km) of Cape Cod before becoming extratropical on September 12.\nHurricane Dog caused high damage to the Leeward Islands, and was said to be the strongest hurricane on record in Antigua. Many buildings were destroyed or damaged on the island. In the United States, the hurricane caused damage along the coast. It damaged several boats and caused 11 people to drown. Strong winds caused large power outages across southeastern New England. Damage along Hurricane Dog's track totaled to about $3\u00A0million (1950\u00A0USD, $25.7\u00A0million 2007\u00A0USD).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":32},{"uri":"1950_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1950 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":49},{"uri":"Antigua","surface_form":"Antigua","offset":164},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":208},{"uri":"Mph","surface_form":"mph","offset":330},{"uri":"Cape_Cod","surface_form":"Cape Cod","offset":430},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":455},{"uri":"Leeward_Islands","surface_form":"Leeward Islands","offset":526},{"uri":"Antigua","surface_form":"Antigua","offset":599},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":671},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":847}]}
