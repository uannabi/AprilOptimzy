{"id":145964,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choral_scholar","text":"e=\"preserve\">A choral scholar is a student at a university who gets money to help with the fees of his or her studies (a \u201Cscholarship\u201D) in exchange for singing in the university\u2019s choir. Some private schools also have choral scholarships.\nIn the United Kingdom there are choral scholarships available at schools belonging to a cathedral or to one of the university colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. Some of these choirs are world famous for their church music such as the choirs of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, St John\u2019s College, Cambridge or New College, Oxford. Choral scholars in such choirs will be expected to sing at the services in the morning and evening (late afternoon) on Sundays as well as at Evensong on several days during the week. There will be rehearsals on most days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":48},{"uri":"Choir","surface_form":"choir","offset":180},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":246},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":327},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":377},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":388},{"uri":"King%E2%80%99s_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"King\u2019s College, Cambridge","offset":482},{"uri":"St_John%E2%80%99s_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"St John\u2019s College, Cambridge","offset":509},{"uri":"New_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"New College, Oxford","offset":541},{"uri":"Service_(religion)","surface_form":"services","offset":625},{"uri":"Evensong","surface_form":"Evensong","offset":703},{"uri":"Rehearsal","surface_form":"rehearsal","offset":759}]}
