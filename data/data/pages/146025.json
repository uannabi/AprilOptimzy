{"id":146025,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryx","text":"The Oryx (also called the sabre antelope) is a fast-running hoofed mammal that lives in dry regions of Africa and Asia (including the Arabian peninsula). They live in steppes (sparse grasslands), semi-deserts, and deserts.\nDescription.\nThese antelopes congregate in herds of 8 to 60 oryx. Newborn calves can run with the herd within minutes of their birth. Oryxes have a life span of about 20 years.\nSome people think that the unicorn of legend was based upon the oryx.\nMany types of oryxes (including the Arabian oryx and the scimitar-horned oryx) are endangered species, mostly because of overhunting and disease.\nDiet and Water.\nThe Oryx is an herbivore (a plant-eater). It eats grasses, shrubs and roots, spending most of its time grazing. Oryx are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. After a while, they regurgitate a partly-digested \"cud\" which they chew and then swallow for the last time.\nThis desert animal can go for weeks without water; it gets much of its water from the plants it eats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":103},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":114},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"steppes (sparse grasslands)","offset":167},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":214},{"uri":"Unicorn","surface_form":"unicorn","offset":427},{"uri":"Arabian_oryx","surface_form":"Arabian oryx","offset":506},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":682},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":691},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":702}]}
