It is a time for people to prepare themselves for two different things: for the coming of the baby Jesus and Christmas, and for the Second Coming of Jesus, when he shall rule over all the Earth in peace. Not all Christian people remember Advent. Some people use it as a time of fasting, study, meditation and prayer. Special Advent Calendars are made for children, with pictures or treats for each day of Advent. In a lot of countries it is very common to have an advent wreath with 4 candles, every advent Sunday one candle more will be lighted so that on Advent 4th all 4 candles are burning and its bright, a symbol for Jesus as the light is coming to us on Christmas.\nGenerally, Advent is a time when many people are very busy in preparation for Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating, buying food and gifts, writing cards and letters, and cooking the Christmas feast. Some churches use special candles during advent.\nBut most important than any Christmas preparation is preparing your heart for the birth of Jesus who lights up our way to the father and saves our lives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sunday","surface_form":"Sunday","offset":53},{"uri":"Christian_Church","surface_form":"Christian Church","offset":121},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":194},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":285},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":295},{"uri":"Second_Coming","surface_form":"Second Coming","offset":318},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":374},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":383},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":398},{"uri":"Fasting","surface_form":"fasting","offset":464},{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"study","offset":473},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"meditation","offset":480},{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":495},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":556},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":983},{"uri":"Gift","surface_form":"gift","offset":992},{"uri":"Candle","surface_form":"candle","offset":1085},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":1199}]}
