{"id":146060,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirog","text":"Pyrih (the plural is \"pyrohy\") is a Ukrainian pie that can have either a sweet or savory filling. In Russia and Belarus it is called pirog (plural is \"pirogi\").\nPastry.\nPyrih (pirog) is usually made from yeast-raised dough, but can also be made from shortcrust or puff pastry. Pyrohy or pirogi are full-sized pies, while pyrizhky or pirozhki are smaller-sized pies that can be eaten with one hand.\nThe standard shape for pyrohy is oblong with tapering ends, but rectangular or circular pyrohy are also common. They can be closed or open-faced with no crust on top (like a tart).\nFilling.\nThe filling for pyrohy may be sweet and contain cottage cheese, or fruits like apple, plums or various berries. Savory versions may consist of meat, fish, mushrooms, cabbage, buckwheat groats or potato. In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pyrohy with a savory filling are traditionally served (like pirozhki) together with borscht, or soup.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":36},{"uri":"Pie","surface_form":"pie","offset":46},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":101},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":112},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":204},{"uri":"Dough","surface_form":"dough","offset":217},{"uri":"Shortcrust_pastry","surface_form":"shortcrust","offset":250},{"uri":"Puff_pastry","surface_form":"puff pastry","offset":264},{"uri":"Pirozhki","surface_form":"pyrizhky","offset":321},{"uri":"Oblong","surface_form":"oblong","offset":431},{"uri":"Taper","surface_form":"taper","offset":443},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangular","offset":462},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circular","offset":477},{"uri":"Crust","surface_form":"crust","offset":551},{"uri":"Tart","surface_form":"tart","offset":572},{"uri":"Cottage_cheese","surface_form":"cottage cheese","offset":636},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":667},{"uri":"Plums","surface_form":"plums","offset":674},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":691},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":731},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":737},{"uri":"Mushroom","surface_form":"mushroom","offset":743},{"uri":"Cabbage","surface_form":"cabbage","offset":754},{"uri":"Buckwheat","surface_form":"buckwheat","offset":763},{"uri":"Groat","surface_form":"groat","offset":773},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":783},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":816},{"uri":"Borscht","surface_form":"borscht","offset":910},{"uri":"Soup","surface_form":"soup","offset":922}]}
