{"id":146110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship","text":"e=\"preserve\">A scholarship is financial help (money) given to someone who wants to study. Scholarships can be given by schools or by universities or colleges or any other institution where people can study or where research needs to be done. It is similar to a bursary.\nThere are very many kinds of scholarships. Some scholarships will cover all the tuition fees (money that the student needs to pay to study), others may just help towards the tuition fees. Some scholarships may include money for other things such as food and accommodation.\nSometimes the students are expected to do something in return for having a scholarship. They may, for example, be expected to do some particular work after they finish their studies, or they may need to help the institution in some way. Quite often the amount of money a student gets will depend on how much money the family has.\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that scholarship must be equally given for girls without discrimination.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":119},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":133},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":149},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":215},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":519},{"uri":"Accommodation","surface_form":"accommodation","offset":528},{"uri":"Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_against_Women","surface_form":"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women","offset":873}]}
