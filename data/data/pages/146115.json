It lives in mudflats, tidal shallows marshes, lakes, rivers and flooded paddy fields. It winters in the south down to Colombia. The great egret flies with slow wing beats and has a deep, croaking call. It is 90-102 cm long.\nDiet.\nThe great egret eats fish, lizards, frogs, crayfish, small rodents, and insects. It often hunts in shallow water, usually impaling the prey on its long, sharp bill.\nEgg and nests.\nThe great egret's nest is a platform of twigs and sticks that is built in trees or on the ground. Females lay 3-5 pale blue-green eggs in each clutch (a set of eggs laid at one time). The incubation period of the eggs is 23\u201326 days.\nReferences.\nBirds of the Indian Subcontinent-2010, Oxford University Press, Richard Grimmett, Carol Inskipp, Tim Inskipp","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heron","surface_form":"heron","offset":197},{"uri":"America","surface_form":"America","offset":213},{"uri":"Great_blue_heron","surface_form":"great blue heron","offset":241},{"uri":"Shallow","surface_form":"shallow","offset":288},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marsh","offset":297},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":378},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":511},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":517},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":526},{"uri":"Crayfish","surface_form":"crayfish","offset":533},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":549},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":562}]}
