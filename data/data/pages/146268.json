{"id":146268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Warlock","text":"e=\"preserve\">Peter Warlock (born London, 30 October 1894; died London, 17 December 1930), was an English composer. \u201CPeter Warlock\u201D was not his real name. His real name was Philip Heseltine. He was also a music critic. When he wrote about music he used his real name, but when he composed music he used the pseudonym (borrowed name) \"Peter Warlock\", which is the name by which he is usually remembered today.\nLife.\nPhilip Heseltine did not come from a musical family. When he was two years old his father died. His mother married again and went back to live in Wales, where she came from. Philip went to school at Eton College.\nHe was still a teenager when he was introduced to the composer Delius, who lived in France. They became good friends and Philip made piano arrangements of some of Delius\u2019s music. Later he wrote a book about Delius. He studied in Germany for a time, and then at Oxford where he studied classics. He learned about music by teaching himself. He did not fight in World War I. He was a conscientious objector, but also, his health was not good enough for him to be in the army.\nHe spent most of his life in London, but he did visit Ireland for a year, and also spent three years with his mother in Wales, and four years in Kent where he lived with Ernest Moeran. Heseltine and Moeran often got drunk together. He became friends with the composer Bernard van Dieren whose music influenced him a lot. He also liked poetry from the time of Queen Elizabeth I.\nHe died in his apartment from gas poisoning. It is not certain whether it was suicide, but he did let his cat out before he turned on the gas.\nHis music.\nHis music, written under the name of Peter Warlock, often has links with his literary writings. Some of the best works he wrote are his songs, especially the song-cycle \"The Curlew\", which has lyrics from poems by W. B. Yeats. One of his most popular works is the \"Capriol Suite\" for string orchestra.\nWarlock wrote many carols, such as \"Adam Lay Ybounden\", \"Tyrley Tyrlow\", and \"Bethlehem Down\".\nWarlock was not influenced by folksong like many other English composers of the time. He liked many different styles, including Renaissance music and the music of Bart\u00F3k whom he met.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":33},{"uri":"30_October","surface_form":"30 October","offset":41},{"uri":"1894","surface_form":"1894","offset":52},{"uri":"17_December","surface_form":"17 December","offset":71},{"uri":"1930","surface_form":"1930","offset":83},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":97},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":105},{"uri":"Music_critic","surface_form":"music critic","offset":204},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":560},{"uri":"Eton_College","surface_form":"Eton College","offset":613},{"uri":"Delius","surface_form":"Delius","offset":690},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":856},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":888},{"uri":"Classics","surface_form":"classics","offset":912},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":986},{"uri":"Conscientious_objector","surface_form":"conscientious objector","offset":1008},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":1046},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1129},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":1154},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":1220},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":1245},{"uri":"Ernest_Moeran","surface_form":"Ernest Moeran","offset":1270},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"drunk","offset":1316},{"uri":"Bernard_van_Dieren","surface_form":"Bernard van Dieren","offset":1368},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1399},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":1435},{"uri":"Elizabeth_I_of_England","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth I","offset":1459},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"apartment","offset":1493},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":1508},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":1556},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":1584},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":1768},{"uri":"Song-cycle","surface_form":"song-cycle","offset":1790},{"uri":"Lyrics","surface_form":"lyrics","offset":1825},{"uri":"William_Butler_Yeats","surface_form":"W.
