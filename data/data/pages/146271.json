{"id":146271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine","text":"=\"preserve\">A land mine (called a \"mine\" when a naval mine is clearly not what is meant) is an explosive weapon that is put on the ground or just underneath the ground so that it explodes when a person or vehicle goes by. They are called \"mines\" because people who put them there dig a hole in the ground (like miners who dig for coal etc.). Many people can be killed by mines, including civilian<nowiki/>s. Sometimes mines can lie in the ground and kill and injure people years after a war has ended.\nThere are different types of land mines. Big anti-vehicle mines are against vehicles. Smaller iInfantry mines are used against foot soldiers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Naval_mine","surface_form":"naval mine","offset":48},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":95},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":105},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":205},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"miners","offset":311},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":388},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":487},{"uri":"Infantry","surface_form":"iInfantry","offset":596}]}
