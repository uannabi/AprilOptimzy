The piece he composed was his \"Colour Symphony\" in which he tries to describe colours in music.\nDuring the 1920s his music became more traditional. He wrote a lot of music for movies including music for the movie \"Things to Come\" (H.G.Wells). He loved the theatre and composed music for the ballets \"Checkmate\" and \"Miracle in the Gorbals\". One of his best works is the choral symphony \"Morning Heroes\" (1930). This was written to remember those who were killed in World War I.\nAmerica.\nWhen World War II started he was in the USA.
