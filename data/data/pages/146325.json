{"id":146325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition","text":"Ammunition, often called ammo, comes from the French word \"la munition\". At first it meant all items used for war. This was from the Latin word \"munire\" (to provide). It now is used only for bullets and other projectiles that are thrown at the enemy by guns, and the gunpowder or other propellant that throws the projectiles. The group word for all types of ammunition is munitions. This means any explosive thing that can be used in combat and includes bombs, missiles, warheads, and mines (landmines, naval mines, and claymore mines). These are made in munitions factories.\nAmmunition is mainly used to attack a target. Ammunition can include flares and incendiary devices that start fires. Since the invention of the cartridge, ammunition has come to mean the putting of a projectile - the item that is sent to hit the target, and its propellant - the chemical that creates the force, into a single package.\nAmmunition is a complex subject. It includes many different weapons used by people, such as explosives and propellants, cartridges, high explosive projectiles (HE), warheads, special shells to attack armour and aircraft, carrier projectiles, fuses, mortar ammunition, small arms (revolver and pistol) ammunition, grenades, mines, flares, improved conventional munitions, and computer guided munition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":46},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":133},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":191},{"uri":"Projectile","surface_form":"projectile","offset":209},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":244},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":253},{"uri":"Gunpowder","surface_form":"gunpowder","offset":267},{"uri":"Propellant","surface_form":"propellant","offset":286},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":398},{"uri":"Combat","surface_form":"combat","offset":434},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":454},{"uri":"Missile","surface_form":"missile","offset":461},{"uri":"Warhead","surface_form":"warhead","offset":471},{"uri":"Land_mine","surface_form":"landmines","offset":492},{"uri":"Naval_mine","surface_form":"naval mine","offset":503},{"uri":"Claymore_mine","surface_form":"claymore mine","offset":520},{"uri":"Flare","surface_form":"flare","offset":645},{"uri":"Incendiary_device","surface_form":"incendiary device","offset":656},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"cartridge","offset":720},{"uri":"Projectile","surface_form":"projectile","offset":776},{"uri":"Gunpowder","surface_form":"propellant","offset":838},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":971},{"uri":"Explosive_material","surface_form":"explosives","offset":1003},{"uri":"Warhead","surface_form":"warhead","offset":1076},{"uri":"Anti-aircraft_warfare","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":1122},{"uri":"Fuse","surface_form":"fuse","offset":1153},{"uri":"Mortar_(weapon)","surface_form":"mortar","offset":1160},{"uri":"Revolver","surface_form":"revolver","offset":1191},{"uri":"Pistol","surface_form":"pistol","offset":1204},{"uri":"Hand_grenade","surface_form":"grenades","offset":1224},{"uri":"Conventional_weapon","surface_form":"conventional munitions","offset":1258},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":1286}]}
