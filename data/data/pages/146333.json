{"id":146333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate","text":"e=\"preserve\">An emirate is a political territory that is ruled by an emir, a dynastic Arab Monarch. The word emirate or amirate comes from, \"Imaarah\"; plural: \u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062A, \"Imaraat\". The United Arab Emirates is a federal state of seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven elect the federation's President and Prime Minister. Most emirates have either disappeared or become part of a larger modern state, some changed their rulers' title, e.g. to Malik (Arabic for King) or Sultan. Therefore true emirate-states have become rare.\nIn Arabic the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member of the royal family, as in Saudi Arabian governorates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":39},{"uri":"Emir","surface_form":"emir","offset":69},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"dynastic","offset":77},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"Monarch","offset":91},{"uri":"United_Arab_Emirates","surface_form":"United Arab Emirates","offset":182},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":338},{"uri":"Malik","surface_form":"Malik","offset":475},{"uri":"Sultan","surface_form":"Sultan","offset":502},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":561},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":734}]}
