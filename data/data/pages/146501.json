{"id":146501,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Reinecke","text":"Carl Reinecke (born Altona, Hamburg 23 June 1824; died Leipzig, 10 March 1910) was a Danish-born composer, conductor, and pianist.\nReinecke was born near Hamburg, which was part of Denmark at the time. Carl learned music from his father. He was soon playing the piano in public and was composing by the age of twelve.\nWhen he was 19 he travelled about giving concerts. He went as far east as Riga. In 1846 he became Court Pianist for King Christian VIII in Copenhagen. He stayed there until 1848, composing four piano concertos as well as concertos for violin, cello, harp and flute. He continued to travel, including to Leipzig where he met Schumann, Mendelssohn and Liszt.\nIn 1851 he became a professor at the Cologne Conservatory. Later he had conducting jobs in Barmen and Breslau.\nIn 1860, Reinecke was made director of the famous Gewandhaus Orchestra concerts in Leipzig, and professor of composition and piano at the Conservatorium. He became director of the Conservatorium and made it one of the best in Europe. He conducted the Gewandhaus Orchestra for 35 years and raised the standard of their playing. He conducted many first performances, including the first complete performance of Brahms's \"German Requiem\" (1869).\nPerhaps his best-known piece is the flute sonata \"Undine\". He taught many famous musicians, including Edvard Grieg, Christian Sinding, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek, Isaac Alb\u00E9niz, Johan Svendsen, Felix Weingartner and Max Bruch.\nAt the age of 80, Reinecke recorded his playing on piano roll, making him the earliest-born pianist to have his playing recorded in any way.\nHe retired in 1902, but continued to compose until the end of his life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":28},{"uri":"23_June","surface_form":"23 June","offset":36},{"uri":"1824","surface_form":"1824","offset":44},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":55},{"uri":"10_March","surface_form":"10 March","offset":64},{"uri":"1910","surface_form":"1910","offset":73},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":85},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":97},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":107},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"pianist","offset":122},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":154},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":181},{"uri":"Riga","surface_form":"Riga","offset":392},{"uri":"1846","surface_form":"1846","offset":401},{"uri":"Christian_VIII_of_Denmark","surface_form":"King Christian VIII","offset":434},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":457},{"uri":"Concerto","surface_form":"concerto","offset":518},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":553},{"uri":"Cello","surface_form":"cello","offset":561},{"uri":"Harp","surface_form":"harp","offset":568},{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":577},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":621},{"uri":"Schumann","surface_form":"Schumann","offset":642},{"uri":"Mendelssohn","surface_form":"Mendelssohn","offset":652},{"uri":"Liszt","surface_form":"Liszt","offset":668},{"uri":"Cologne_Conservatory","surface_form":"Cologne Conservatory","offset":712},{"uri":"Barmen","surface_form":"Barmen","offset":766},{"uri":"Wroc%C5%82aw","surface_form":"Breslau","offset":777},{"uri":"Leipzig_Gewandhaus_Orchestra","surface_form":"Gewandhaus Orchestra","offset":836},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":869},{"uri":"Composition_(music)","surface_form":"composition","offset":895},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1012},{"uri":"Brahms","surface_form":"Brahms","offset":1195},{"uri":"Ein_deutsches_Requiem","surface_form":"German Requiem","offset":1205},{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":1265},{"uri":"Sonata","surface_form":"sonata","offset":1271},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":1310},{"uri":"Edvard_Grieg","surface_form":"Edvard Grieg","offset":1331},{"uri":"Christian_Sinding","surface_form":"Christian Sinding","offset":1345},{"uri":"Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek","surface_form":"Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek","offset":1364},{"uri":"Isaac_Alb%C3%A9niz","surface_form":"Isaac Alb\u00E9niz","offset":1378},{"uri":"Johan_Svendsen","surface_form":"Johan Svendsen","offset":1393},{"uri":"Felix_Weingartner","surface_form":"Felix Weingartner","offset":1409},{"uri":"Max_Bruch","surface_form":"Max Bruch","offset":1431},{"uri":"Piano_roll","surface_form":"piano roll","offset":1493},{"uri":"1902","surface_form":"1902","offset":1597}]}
