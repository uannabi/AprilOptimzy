The administrative centre for the council area is in Lochgilphead.\nArgyll and Bute covers the second-largest administrative area of any Scottish council. The council area adjoins those of Highland, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire. Its border runs through Loch Lomond.\nThe present council area was created in 1996, when it was carved out of the Strathclyde region, which was a two-tier local government region of 19 districts, created in 1975. Argyll and Bute merged the existing Argyll and Bute district and one ward of the Dumbarton district. The Dumbarton ward, called 'Helensburgh and Lomond', included the burgh of Helensburgh and consisted of an area to the west of Loch Lomond, north of the Firth of Clyde and mostly east of Loch Long.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Council_area_(Scotland)","surface_form":"council area","offset":34},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":50},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":60},{"uri":"Highland_(council_area)","surface_form":"Highland","offset":333},{"uri":"Perth_and_Kinross","surface_form":"Perth and Kinross","offset":343},{"uri":"Stirling_(council_area)","surface_form":"Stirling","offset":362},{"uri":"West_Dunbartonshire","surface_form":"West Dunbartonshire","offset":375},{"uri":"Loch_Lomond","surface_form":"Loch Lomond","offset":420},{"uri":"Strathclyde","surface_form":"Strathclyde","offset":509},{"uri":"Local_government_areas_of_Scotland_1973_to_1996","surface_form":"region","offset":521},{"uri":"Local_government_(Scotland)","surface_form":"local government","offset":550},{"uri":"Regions_and_districts_of_Scotland","surface_form":"districts","offset":580},{"uri":"Ward_(politics)","surface_form":"ward","offset":677},{"uri":"Dumbarton","surface_form":"Dumbarton","offset":689},{"uri":"Burgh","surface_form":"burgh","offset":775},{"uri":"Loch_Lomond","surface_form":"Loch Lomond","offset":836},{"uri":"Firth_of_Clyde","surface_form":"Firth of Clyde","offset":862},{"uri":"Loch_Long","surface_form":"Loch Long","offset":896}]}
