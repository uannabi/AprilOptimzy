It is a remake of the 1961 animated film \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" (which was based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel \"The Hundred and One Dalmatians\"). The movie's main actor is Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil. Unlike in the earlier versions of the story, the dalmatians are played by real dalmatian actors, and none of the dalmatians talk. A sequel, \"102 Dalmatians\", was made in 2000 and was released in November. This movie is called simply \"101\" in Japan, like its sequel, which is called \"102\".\nRelease.\n\"101 Dalmatians\" was released on VHS on April 15, 1997 and as a DVD on December 12, 2000.
