{"id":146530,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wildcat","text":"The African wildcats (\"Felis silvestris lybica\") are small, fierce cats that live in forests, grasslands, and brush lands in Africa and the Middle East. They are the closest living relatives of the domestic cat.\nIt is a wildcat subspecies which occurs across northern Africa and extends around the edges of the Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea. It is the most common and widely distributed wild cat, and is listed as \"Least Concern\" by IUCN since 2002.\nThe African wildcat appears to have diverged from the other subspecies about 131,000 years ago. Some individual African wildcats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Middle East, and are the ancestors of the domestic cat. Remains of domesticated cats were found in human burials in Cyprus, done by Neolithic farmers about 9,500 years ago. Hybrids between domestic cats and African wildcats are still common today.\nDescription.\nAfrican wildcats are generally crepuscular, hunting at dawn and dusk. They are diurnal (most active during the day) during very cold weather. They are very good climbers. African Wildcats live for 12 to 15 years. They are about 50 percent larger than domesticated (tame) cats.\nDiet.\nAfrican wildcats are carnivores, like all cats. These fast, solitary hunters eat small to medium-sized mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, invertebrates, and eggs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":67},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":85},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":94},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":125},{"uri":"Wildcat","surface_form":"wildcat","offset":220},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":228},{"uri":"Northern_Africa","surface_form":"northern Africa","offset":259},{"uri":"Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Arabian Peninsula","offset":311},{"uri":"Caspian_Sea","surface_form":"Caspian Sea","offset":336},{"uri":"Least_Concern","surface_form":"Least Concern","offset":422},{"uri":"IUCN","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":440},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":597},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":640},{"uri":"Domestic_cat","surface_form":"domestic cat","offset":682},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":756},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":772},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"Hybrid","offset":813},{"uri":"Crepuscular","surface_form":"crepuscular","offset":932},{"uri":"Dawn","surface_form":"dawn","offset":956},{"uri":"Dusk","surface_form":"dusk","offset":965},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":980},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":1287},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":1303},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":1313},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":1320}]}
