It can also be served with ribbon or tube shaped pasta.\nSpaghetti alla Bolognese recipes.\nIn 1982, the Bolognese delegation, said that the recipe must only be made of beef, pancetta (a type of bacon), onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, meat broth, red wine and milk or cream. There are different recipes of Bolognese sauce. Some of the recipes contain chopped pork or pork sausage. Mushrooms are sometimes added.\nSpaghetti Bolognese is popular outside of Italy where the sauce is put on a plate of spaghetti with a little bit of grated cheese put on. In China Bolognese sauce is served with noodles and it is called Chinese spaghetti.\nHowever, these different ways of making the recipe are never eaten in Bologna.
