It stages performances at the Op\u00E9ra Bastille and Op\u00E9ra Garnier in Paris. The theatre is also the home of the Paris Op\u00E9ra Ballet.\nOther opera houses in Paris are the Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2telet, Op\u00E9ra-Comique and Th\u00E9\u00E2tre des Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es.\nHistory.\nKing Louis XIV allowed Jean-Baptiste Lully to start the \"Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique\" in 1672. This was an organization that included opera, ballet, and music. The ballet company was part of the opera company. Then Louis XIV started the ballet school, called \"Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Danse\", in 1661. From 1671 until Lully's death in 1687, the school was directed by the great dancing master Pierre Beauchamp, the man who set down the five positions of the feet.\nIn 1713 King Louis XIV made the Opera company a state institution. There was a group of professional dancers called \"Le Ballet de l'Op\u00E9ra\". From that time until 1875 they used lots of theatres, each one of which was destroyed by a fire. All these companies were called Paris Op\u00E9ra or Op\u00E9ra de Paris.\nOn 29 October 1873, the old \"Paris Op\u00E9ra\", known as the \"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre de l'Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique\", which had been used since 1821, was destroyed by a fire which burned for 27 hours. By 1875 the opera company moved to the new \"Palais Garnier\" which was part of the rebuilding of Paris by Emperor Napoleon III.\nWhen the \"Op\u00E9ra Bastille\" was built in 1989 the company chose it as their main theatre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":65},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":82},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra_Bastille","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra Bastille","offset":120},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra_Garnier","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra Garnier","offset":139},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":156},{"uri":"Paris_Op%C3%A9ra_Ballet","surface_form":"Paris Op\u00E9ra Ballet","offset":199},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_du_Ch%C3%A2telet","surface_form":"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2telet","offset":255},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra-Comique","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra-Comique","offset":276},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_des_Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre des Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es","offset":294},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"King Louis XIV","offset":331},{"uri":"Jean-Baptiste_Lully","surface_form":"Jean-Baptiste Lully","offset":354},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_de_Musique","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique","offset":388},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":464},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":471},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":483},{"uri":"Pierre_Beauchamp","surface_form":"Pierre Beauchamp","offset":717},{"uri":"Five_positions_of_the_feet","surface_form":"five positions of the feet","offset":760},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_de_l%27Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_de_Musique","surface_form":"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre de l'Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique","offset":1145},{"uri":"Palais_Garnier","surface_form":"Palais Garnier","offset":1314},{"uri":"Napoleon_III_of_France","surface_form":"Emperor Napoleon III","offset":1375},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra_Bastille","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra Bastille","offset":1407}]}
