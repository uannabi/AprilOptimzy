{"id":146796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_baileyana","text":"The Cootamundra Wattle is an Australian shrub or tree. It is in the Family Fabaceae. The tree's Latin name, \"Acacia baileyana\", is named after the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. It is one of nearly 1000 species of \"Acacia\" found in Australia. The Cootamundra Wattle at first only came from a small area in southern New South Wales near Cootamundra. It has been widely planted all over Australia. In many areas of Victoria Cootamundra Wattle has become a weed. It is taking over from acacias that were only found in Victorian.\nAlmost all wattles have cream to golden colored flowers. The small flowers are arranged in round to cylindrical clusters. Only the stamens, the male part of the flower, stick out. Many wattles have been planted in New Zealand.\nUses.\n\"A. baileyana\" is used in Europe in the cut flower industry. It is also used as food for bees in making honey.\nCultivation.\nThis plant is easy to grow. It can adapt and grow in different areas. Unfortunately it easily produces seeds and will start growing new plants in the surrounding area. It can also cross breed with other acacias, including the rare and endangered Sydney species \"Acacia pubescens\".\nA low growing, weeping form, is being grown. The fine leaves of the original Cootamundra wattle is grey-green. A new type with blue-purple leaves, known as 'Purpurea' is very popular.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian","surface_form":"Australian","offset":29},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":40},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":49},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Family Fabaceae","offset":68},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":147},{"uri":"Frederick_Manson_Bailey","surface_form":"Frederick Manson Bailey","offset":156},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":235},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":318},{"uri":"Cootamundra%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cootamundra","offset":339},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":416},{"uri":"Weed","surface_form":"weed","offset":457},{"uri":"Cylinder","surface_form":"cylindrical","offset":629},{"uri":"Stamen","surface_form":"stamen","offset":660},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":743},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":851},{"uri":"Honey","surface_form":"honey","offset":866},{"uri":"Endangered","surface_form":"endangered","offset":1121},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":1132},{"uri":"Acacia_pubescens","surface_form":"Acacia pubescens","offset":1148}]}
