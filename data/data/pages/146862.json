{"id":146862,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe%27s_Faust","text":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's \"Faust\" is the most famous play in all German literature. It was published in two parts. Part One is very dramatic, and tells the main story. Part II is extremely long, and it is meant to be read rather than acted on stage. It is about Goethe\u2019s philosophy as well as about history and politics.\nWhat the story is about.\nGoethe\u2019s \"Faust\" is a re-telling of the Faust legend which was very famous in Germany. The legend tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness. The devil (usually called Mephistopheles, as he is in Goethe\u2019s play) tells Faust he can help him to do this, but that in the end Faust will have to give him his soul and go with him to hell. Faust makes a pact (an agreement) with Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for: fine living, gold, women and honour. Faust signs the pact with his blood. Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life. However, in the end Mephistopheles wins his bet.\nHow Goethe worked on the play.\nThe subject of \"Faust\" occupied Goethe all his life. The name of Faust is mentioned in a comedy he wrote in 1769: \u201CDie Mitschuldigen\u201C. In 1773, when he was 24, he first read the poetry of Hans Sachs, the medieval German poet. He immediately started to imitate the rhythm of Sachs\u2019s poetry. This rhythm is known as \u201CKnittelvers\u201D. It had 4 accented syllables in each line and an AABB or ABAB rhyming pattern, e.g.\nIn 1887, long after Goethe\u2019s death, it was discovered that he had made a version of \u201CFaust\u201C which he never published but later decided to rewrite. This version is known as the \u201CUrfaust\u201D (\u201CUr\u201D means \u201Coriginal\u201D, i.e. the \u201COriginal Faust\u201D). It was written between 1772 and 1775. He changed a lot of it and it became \u201CFaust Part I\u201C. A fragment (small part of it) was published in 1790. Then he finished it in 1806, published it in 1808 and changed it for a new edition in 1829. Part 2 was finished in 1831, a few months before he died, and was not published until a few months after his death.\nPart One.\n\"Faust Part One\" starts off in heaven. Mephistopheles makes a bet with God: he says that he can go down to earth and meet Faust and make him do bad things.\nWe then see Faust in his study. Faust is trying to get to know all possible things. He wants to know about science, humans and religion. He tries to use magic in order to understand everything there is to know, but he thinks he is not managing to do it. For a moment he thinks of killing himself, but then hears people celebrating Easter and decides to go for a walk with Wagner, his assistant. A poodle who has no home follows Faust back to his house.\nIn Faust\u2019s study, the poodle changes into the devil (Mephistopheles). Faust makes an arrangement with the devil: the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on earth, In exchange Faust will serve the devil in hell. Faust's arrangement is that, while Mephistopheles is serving Faust, if Faust is so pleased with anything the devil gives him, that he wants to stay in that moment forever, he will die that very moment (in German he says: \u201CVerweile doch, du bist so sch\u00F6n\u201D \u2013 \u201CStay a while, you are so beautiful\u201D. It is perhaps the most famous quotation in all German literature.)\nMephistopheles persuades Faust to sign the agreement with his own blood. Faust has a few adventures and then meets Margaret (also known as Gretchen). He loves her, and by offering her jewellery, and with help of a neighbour, Martha, Gretchen lets herself into Faust's arms. Faust and Gretchen want to sleep together, so Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion so that she does not see Faust. Faust and Gretchen sleep together. Gretchen\u2019s mother dies of the potion. Gretchen discovers she is pregnant. Gretchen\u2019s brother says Faust is bad and challenges him, but Faust kills him (with the devil\u2019s help, of course). Gretchen has given birth to a baby, but she drowns it. She is found guilty of murder and is sent to prison. Faust tries to save her from death, but he cannot free her from prison. Finding that they cannot free her, Faust and the devil run away from the prison cell, while voices from heaven say that Gretchen shall be saved.\nPart Two.\n\"Faust Part Two\" is very different from Part One. It keeps referring to classical literature. The romantic story of the first Faust is forgotten, and Faust wakes in a field of fairies. He has many adventures. The piece is in five acts which each tell of different things. In the end Faust goes to heaven, because he loses only half the bet. Angels, who arrive as messengers of God\u2019s mercy, say at the end of Act 5: \"He who strives on and lives to strive/ Can earn redemption still\" (i.e. anyone who tries hard in life can still be saved).\nPeople\u2019s views about Goethe\u2019s \"Faust\".\nGoethe\u2019s \"Faust\" had an enormous influence on all art in Western countries. In Germany many writers were fascinated by the legend. They often felt that Faust represented the spirit of the German people. Dramas, epic poems and novels were written about Faust. Composers wrote operas or orchestral music about him. Thomas Mann wrote a novel \"Dr Faustus\" which compares Faust\u2019s pact with the devil to the way the German people supported Hitler.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","surface_form":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","offset":0},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":56},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":68},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":274},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":302},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":314},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":395},{"uri":"Devil","surface_form":"devil","offset":555},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":712},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":736},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":853},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"women","offset":859},{"uri":"Honour","surface_form":"honour","offset":869},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":907},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":925},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":1157},{"uri":"1769","surface_form":"1769","offset":1176},{"uri":"1773","surface_form":"1773","offset":1206},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":1246},{"uri":"Hans_Sachs","surface_form":"Hans Sachs","offset":1256},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":1272},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":1415},{"uri":"1772","surface_form":"1772","offset":1741},{"uri":"1775","surface_form":"1775","offset":1750},{"uri":"1790","surface_form":"1790","offset":1856},{"uri":"1806","surface_form":"1806","offset":1885},{"uri":"1808","surface_form":"1808","offset":1907},{"uri":"1829","surface_form":"1829","offset":1948},{"uri":"1831","surface_form":"1831","offset":1977},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"heaven","offset":2111},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":2187},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":2343},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":2352},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":2363},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":2567},{"uri":"Poodle","surface_form":"poodle","offset":2633},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":2917},{"uri":"Potion","surface_form":"potion","offset":3642},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":3780},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":3981},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":4003},{"uri":"Classical_literature","surface_form":"classical literature","offset":4310},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":4615},{"uri":"Mercy","surface_form":"mercy","offset":4621},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":4849},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":4939},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"Drama","offset":5019},{"uri":"Epic","surface_form":"epic","offset":5027},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":5032},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":5042},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":5091},{"uri":"Orchestral","surface_form":"orchestral","offset":5101},{"uri":"Thomas_Mann","surface_form":"Thomas Mann","offset":5129},{"uri":"Dr_Faustus","surface_form":"Dr Faustus","offset":5156},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":5250}]}
