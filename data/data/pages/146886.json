Nitric Acid is used in rocket fuels, to help make wood look older, and is used in explosives.\nIt can react with metals such as copper to produce a brown toxic gas called nitrogen dioxide. It is made by reaction of nitrogen dioxide with water.\nIn alchemy, it is known as aqua fortis, or strong water. It can dissolve silver but leaves gold unharmed, making it a good test for gold. The term acid test came from this test.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"H","offset":13},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"NO3","offset":14},{"uri":"Corrosive","surface_form":"corrosive","offset":29},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":56},{"uri":"Burns","surface_form":"burns","offset":83},{"uri":"Rocket_propellant","surface_form":"rocket fuels","offset":148},{"uri":"Nitrogen_dioxide","surface_form":"nitrogen dioxide","offset":295},{"uri":"Nitrogen_dioxide","surface_form":"nitrogen dioxide","offset":339}]}
