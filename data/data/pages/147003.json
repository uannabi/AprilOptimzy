{"id":147003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ra-Comique","text":"The Op\u00E9ra-Comique is an opera house and opera company in Paris. Its full name is th\u00E9\u00E2tre national de l\u2019Op\u00E9ra-Comique (\"National Op\u00E9ra Comic Theatre\").\nThe Op\u00E9ra-Comique company was started in 1714 to give somewhere to perform French operas. At the time operas throughout Europe were nearly always in Italian. Op\u00E9ra-comique (literally: Comic opera) was a French tradition. The operas in this tradition were performed with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. This is why the opera house and company were given that name.\nThe Op\u00E9ras-Comiques were more popular and less formal that the traditional Italian operas that were performed at the Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique. During the three centuries of its existence there have been several changes to it. For a time the Op\u00E9ra-Comique and the Op\u00E9ra were organized by the same institution.\nThe Op\u00E9ra-Comique put on first performances of many famous operas, especially Bizet's \"Carmen\" on 3 March 1875 and Debussy's only opera, \"Pell\u00E9as et M\u00E9lisande\", on 30 April 1902. Berlioz's \"The Damnation of Faust\" was also first performed there on 6 December 1846. That first performance was a disaster.\nThe building in which the Op\u00E9ra-Comique performs is called the \"salle Favart,\". It is not the same building as in 1714. Two previous buildings were burnt down in 1838 and 1887. The present building was built in 1898.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera_house","surface_form":"opera house","offset":24},{"uri":"Opera_company","surface_form":"opera company","offset":40},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":57},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":226},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":271},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":300},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra-comique","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra-comique","offset":309},{"uri":"Dialogue","surface_form":"dialogue","offset":428},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_de_Musique","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique","offset":645},{"uri":"Bizet","surface_form":"Bizet","offset":917},{"uri":"Carmen","surface_form":"Carmen","offset":926},{"uri":"Claude_Debussy","surface_form":"Debussy","offset":954},{"uri":"Pell%C3%A9as_et_M%C3%A9lisande_(opera)","surface_form":"Pell\u00E9as et M\u00E9lisande","offset":977},{"uri":"Berlioz","surface_form":"Berlioz","offset":1018},{"uri":"The_Damnation_of_Faust","surface_form":"The Damnation of Faust","offset":1029}]}
