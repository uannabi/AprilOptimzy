{"id":147105,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Airwaves","text":"e=\"preserve\">Angels and Airwaves (AvA) is an American alternative rock band. It was formed by former Blink-182 singer and guitarist, Thomas DeLonge. The members of the band were Atom Willard, former Offspring drummer; Matt Wachter, former bassist of 30 Seconds to Mars; and David Kennedy, former guitarist of Hazen Street and Boxcar Racer.\nDeLonge created the band angels and airwaves to bring good music to people ears. The band performed amazing live performances and was well liked by Delonge's fans. Most of the songs have long built up intros with guitars, synthesizer, drums and keyboards. Delonge showed over time that his live voice had improved since his time singing for Blink 182.\nAngels and Airwaves released their first album, \"We Don't Need To Whisper\" in 2005. The second studio album, \"I-Empire\" was released in October 2007. It was a more lighthearted album with a faster beat. AvA has toured very much. They have said that they will be playing for the second year in a row at Vans Warped tour. They will be playing the entire tour.\nDeLonge has covered a few songs from Blink 182 but he has never played the full song in respect to his former band mates. He has played slowed versions of \"Down\", \"I Miss You\", \"Not Now\", and \"Reckless Abandon\". He only plays these songs by himself with his guitar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":45},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":54},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":71},{"uri":"Blink-182","surface_form":"Blink-182","offset":101},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":111},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":122},{"uri":"Thomas_DeLonge","surface_form":"Thomas DeLonge","offset":133},{"uri":"Atom_Willard","surface_form":"Atom Willard","offset":178},{"uri":"Offspring","surface_form":"Offspring","offset":199},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":209},{"uri":"Matt_Wachter","surface_form":"Matt Wachter","offset":218},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bassist","offset":239},{"uri":"30_Seconds_to_Mars","surface_form":"30 Seconds to Mars","offset":250},{"uri":"David_Kennedy","surface_form":"David Kennedy","offset":274},{"uri":"Hazen_Street","surface_form":"Hazen Street","offset":309},{"uri":"Boxcar_Racer","surface_form":"Boxcar Racer","offset":326},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fans","offset":498},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":516},{"uri":"Introduction","surface_form":"intros","offset":541},{"uri":"Synthesizer","surface_form":"synthesizer","offset":562},{"uri":"Electronic_keyboard","surface_form":"keyboards","offset":585},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":733},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":787},{"uri":"Beat","surface_form":"beat","offset":889},{"uri":"Vans_Warped_tour","surface_form":"Vans Warped tour","offset":994},{"uri":"Cover_(music)","surface_form":"covered","offset":1062},{"uri":"Respect","surface_form":"respect","offset":1138}]}
