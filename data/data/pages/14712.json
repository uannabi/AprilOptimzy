{"id":14712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana","text":"Botswana (officially called the Republic of Botswana) is a country in southern Africa. The capital of Botswana is Gaborone.\nGeography.\nThe countries that border Botswana are Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Namibia. It is also possible to travel from Botswana directly into Zambia by crossing the Zambezi River by ferry.\nBotswana is landlocked. All of Botswana's trade must be brought in over land or by airplane.\nThe two most important geographical features in Botswana are the Okavango Delta and the Kalahari Desert.\nCulture.\nPeople from Botswana are called \"Batswana\". The population of Botswana is about 2.2 million. This is only 2.7 persons per km\u00B2, a small number for a country of this size. This is because most of the country is desert and very dry.\nBotswana has two official languages: Setswana and English. Setswana is the national language (also called \"Tswana\").\nGovernance.\nBotswana is a democracy. The people vote for their political leaders. Those leaders vote for the president. In 2008 Ian Khama became the fourth president of Botswana.\nPresident Khama won elections in 2009 and 2014. The current President of Botswana is Dr. Eric K. Mokgweetsi who took over from Dr. Ian Khama Seretse Khama in 2018.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Botswana has been growing very fast since it became an independent country in 1966. The people of Botswana have had the world's fastest growth in standard of living since that time.\nBotswana's economy comes mostly from mining. This includes diamonds, metals (including copper) and minerals (including salt). Botswana is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. In 1999, Botswana produced over 30 million carats (6,000 kg) of diamonds from the three Debswana mines. That is about 25% of worldwide production.\nTourism is also important to the country. Many people come to Botswana each year to see its wildlife.\nThe currency of Botswana is called the \"pula\" (which means rain). It is made up of 100 \"thebe\" (which means shield). In 2017, one US dollar was about 10.32 pulas.\nIn popular culture.\nThe \"No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" books by Alexander McCall Smith are set in Botswana. The HBO television series based on the books was filmed in Botswana.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":59},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":79},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":91},{"uri":"Gaborone","surface_form":"Gaborone","offset":114},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":174},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":184},{"uri":"Namibia","surface_form":"Namibia","offset":202},{"uri":"Zambia","surface_form":"Zambia","offset":269},{"uri":"Zambezi_River","surface_form":"Zambezi River","offset":292},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":309},{"uri":"Landlocked","surface_form":"landlocked","offset":328},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":358},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographical features","offset":432},{"uri":"Okavango_Delta","surface_form":"Okavango Delta","offset":474},{"uri":"Kalahari_Desert","surface_form":"Kalahari Desert","offset":497},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":571},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":732},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":779},{"uri":"Tswana_language","surface_form":"Tswana","offset":860},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":896},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":943},{"uri":"Ian_Khama","surface_form":"Ian Khama","offset":998},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":1026},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":1226},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent country","offset":1292},{"uri":"Standard_of_living","surface_form":"standard of living","offset":1383},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":1456},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":1478},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":1488},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":1506},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":1518},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":1538},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":1581},{"uri":"Carat_(mass)","surface_form":"carats","offset":1656},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"Tourism","offset":1760},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"wildlife","offset":1852},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":1866},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":1921},{"uri":"Shield","surface_form":"shield","offset":1970}]}
