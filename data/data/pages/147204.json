{"id":147204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Atlantic_hurricane_season","text":"The 1994 Atlantic hurricane season was the time from June 1 to November 30, 1994 when hurricanes officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. However, in this season no Tropical Cyclone formed after November 30, the end of the season because the last storm, Hurricane Gordon died on November 21, just nine days before the 30th.\nThe season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes, which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The strongest, Hurricane Florence, it's top winds were at a Category 2 storm with winds of 110\u00A0mph (175\u00A0km/h). Aside from Chris, Florence, and Gordon, none of the storms became hurricanes. A famous hurricane from 1994 would probably be Hurricane Gordon. Hurricane Gordon was a strange long lived November hurricane that killed at least 1,100 people in Haiti.\nTropical Storm Alberto.\nAlberto formed from a north-moving tropical depression north of the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula on July 2. Tropical Storm Alberto continued north, making landfall near Destin, Florida on July 3 as a moderately strong tropical storm. The storm weakened quickly to a tropical depression, which then moved around Georgia and Alabama until it dissipated on July 7. Damage was guessed at $500\u00A0million (1994\u00A0USD) and 30 deaths were caused by the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto.\nTropical Depression Two.\nTropical Depression Two formed near South Carolina on the 19th. The depression moved north making landfall in South Carolina and dissipated on July 23rd. No damage or deaths reported.\nTropical Storm Beryl.\nBeryl formed off the Florida Panhandle on August 15, only twelve hours before it made landfall near Panama City, Florida. Beryl quickly strengthened before landfall and reached its top winds of 60\u00A0mph. Beryl caused inland flooding as it moved through Georgia, across the Carolinas, and all the way to Connecticut where it was absorbed by a frontal system. Damage was guessed at $73\u00A0million (1994 USD). Though it caused no deaths, a lot of people were injured by the 37 tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.\nHurricane Chris.\nChris formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 17, and reached hurricane strength the next day. It moved to the northwest and turned north and brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm on the 21st. Chris continued north, and dissipated without causing any damage\nTropical Depression Five.\nThe wave that would become Tropical Depression Five was tracked beginning on August 17. The wave was upgraded into a depression on August 29 near the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula. Tropical Depression Five made landfall in Tampico on the 31st and dissipating the same day over Mexico. No damage was caused by Tropica Depression Five.\nTropical Storm Debby.\nTropical Storm Debby formed on September 10, just east of the lesser antilies. The storm crossed some of the islands, and dissipated south of Puerto Rico on the 11th. Nine people dead because of Tropical Storm Debby. Damage estimates are not available. It cause flooding and mudslides in Saint Lucia.\nTropical Storm Ernesto.\nErnesto formed southwest of Cape Verde on September 22 it became Tropical Storm Ernesto. It moved north for two days, and by the 24th had weakened to a tropical depression. Two days later Ernesto dissipated without affecting any land.\nTropical Depression Eight.\nTropical Depression Eight formed on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Eight on September 24 near Honduras. Tropical Depression Eight made landfall in Mexico and dissipated the next day over Guatemala. Some reports show that the remnants of Eight became Tropical Depression Ten.\nTropical Depression Nine.\nTropical Depression Nine form off the coast of Africa on September 26. It was upgraded to the ninth depression of the 1994 season, 150 miles southeast from the Cape Verde Islands the next day. The depression moved north and dissipated on September 29.\nTropical Depression Ten.\nAn area of disturbed weather, related to Tropical Depression Eight, moved across the northwest Caribbean Sea and the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula. A tropical wave moved into the area, causing an increase in showers and cloudiness. The wave became Tropical Depression Ten on September 29 about 150 miles off the coast of Cuba. The system became better-organized and when the depression moved into the Gulf of Mexico, it was absorbed by a non-tropical system on 30th. Tropical Depression Ten caused $5\u00A0million in damage (1994\u00A0USD).\nHurricane Florence.\nFlorence, at first formed as a subtropical depression in the central Atlantic on November 2. As it northwest, it took on tropical characteristics and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence on the 4th. It reached hurricane strength, then turned to the northeast and on November 6, as it was picked up by a strong trough. Two days later Florence was absorbed by the same trough that made it turn northeast. There was no reported damage.\nHurricane Gordon.\nHurricane Gordon was a very deadly and damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean, Florida and parts of North Carolina. The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates range between 500-2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Damage was guessed to be at $400\u00A0million (1994 US dollars).\nNor'easter.\nAround Christmas in 1994 a nor'easter may have had tropical characteristics, though it was not called a tropical system. It affected the Mid-Atlantic and New England causing damage at $21 million.\nRetirement.\nNo names retired as a result all name would be used again in 2000","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":122},{"uri":"Hurricane_Gordon_(1994)","surface_form":"Hurricane Gordon","offset":801},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":917},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula","offset":1016},{"uri":"Destin%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Destin, Florida","offset":1106},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":1248},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":1260},{"uri":"USD","surface_form":"USD","offset":1340},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":1474},{"uri":"Florida_Panhandle","surface_form":"Florida Panhandle","offset":1665},{"uri":"Panama_City%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Panama City, Florida","offset":1744},{"uri":"Carolinas","surface_form":"Carolinas","offset":1915},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":1945},{"uri":"USD","surface_form":"USD","offset":2040},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":2203},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":2223},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":2348},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":2750},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":2971},{"uri":"Saint_Lucia","surface_form":"Saint Lucia","offset":3117},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":3182},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":3485},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":3574},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":3667},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":3941},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":4153},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":4447},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":4628},{"uri":"US_dollars","surface_form":"US dollars","offset":5569},{"uri":"Christmas_1994_nor%27easter","surface_form":"nor'easter","offset":5621},{"uri":"2000_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2000","offset":5864}]}
