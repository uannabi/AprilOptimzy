Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design.\nThe units soon became non-standard and two were sold back to the manufacturer who exported them to Trinidad and Tobago. Another unit was converted into departmental service, and survived in BR ownership until the early 1980s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":4},{"uri":"Diesel_multiple_unit","surface_form":"diesel multiple unit","offset":47},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":78},{"uri":"Wickham_%26amp%3B_Co","surface_form":"Wickham & Co","offset":86},{"uri":"Trinidad_and_Tobago","surface_form":"Trinidad and Tobago","offset":263}]}
