{"id":147236,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_111","text":"The Class 111 DMUs were based on 2s, but with different engines. The only external body difference was on the final batch of cars where a four character headcode box was fitted above the front cab windows, with the destination indicator on top of a reduced height centre window.\nThe first cars built, part of an order for 339 Met-Camm cars, were 4 power/trailer sets for the LMR Manchester area built in early 1957. One of these had supercharged 230 hp 6-cylinder engines. This was followed by ten 3-car sets comprising DMBS/TS/DMC for the NER at Bradford, then a further twenty 3-car sets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Rail_Class_101","surface_form":"2s","offset":33},{"uri":"Headcode","surface_form":"headcode","offset":153},{"uri":"Metro_Cammell","surface_form":"Met-Camm","offset":326},{"uri":"London_Midland_Region_of_British_Railways","surface_form":"LMR","offset":375},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":379},{"uri":"Eastern_Region_of_British_Railways","surface_form":"NER","offset":540},{"uri":"Bradford","surface_form":"Bradford","offset":547}]}
