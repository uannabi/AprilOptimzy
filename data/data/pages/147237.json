{"id":147237,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_112","text":"The Class 112 DMUs used the standard Cravens body used for Class 105s but had a single Rolls-Royce engine of 238\u00A0hp per car, and they were all formed into 'power twins'- two car sets with both vehicles powered.\nThere were two batches built, the first 50 vehicles (25 sets) had standard mechanical transmission via a gearbox and were allocated the Class 112. The second batch of 50 cars (25 sets) had hydraulic transmission, and became Class 113s.\nThe cars were built for services in the LMR Central Division and in the Liverpool - St Helens area, where the gradients in the Lancashire & Yorkshire area required more power. Both types also spent some time working from Cricklewood.\nThe gross weight of a set with all seats occupied was approximately 70 tons, giving 6.8 hp per ton. Empty, it was 8.1 hp/ton, which compared favourably with 5.7 hp/ton that the Cravens power/trailer had.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Rail_Class_105","surface_form":"Class 105s","offset":59},{"uri":"Rolls-Royce_Limited","surface_form":"Rolls-Royce","offset":87},{"uri":"Horsepower","surface_form":"hp","offset":113},{"uri":"London_Midland_Region","surface_form":"LMR","offset":487},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":519},{"uri":"St_Helens%2C_Merseyside","surface_form":"St Helens","offset":531},{"uri":"Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway","surface_form":"Lancashire & Yorkshire","offset":574},{"uri":"Cricklewood","surface_form":"Cricklewood","offset":668}]}
