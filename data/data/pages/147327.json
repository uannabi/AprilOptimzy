She contacted the Black Hills Institute, whose staff retrieved and prepared the bones.\nFirst, ownership disputes were settled in court. There was a long dispute between the owners of the land, the Sioux tribe, the United States Department of the Interior, and the Black Hills Institute, whose staff had done the work.\nThe fossil was then auctioned in October 1997 for US$8.36 million, the highest amount ever paid for a dinosaur fossil.\nAfter preparation, the skeleton became a permanent feature at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. The money had been raised by public subscription.\nGout.\nSome researchers think the skeleton shows evidence that Sue suffered from the painful condition known as gout.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus rex","offset":99},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":118},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":200},{"uri":"Sioux","surface_form":"Sioux","offset":438},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_the_Interior","surface_form":"United States Department of the Interior","offset":455},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":563},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":701},{"uri":"Field_Museum_of_Natural_History","surface_form":"Field Museum of Natural History","offset":744},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":779},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":788},{"uri":"Gout","surface_form":"gout","offset":959}]}
