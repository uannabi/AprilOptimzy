{"id":147506,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College","text":"Dartmouth College () is a private, coeducational university in Hanover, New Hampshire. Incorporated as \"Trustees of Dartmouth College,\"\nit is a member of the Ivy League and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. In addition to its undergraduate liberal arts program, Dartmouth has medical, engineering, and business schools, as well as 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences. With a total enrollment of 5,848, Dartmouth is the smallest school in the Ivy League.\nThe college was established in 1769 by Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock who wanted to use the college to Christianize the Native Americans. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial,\" citing \"Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward\" and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 1800s. Dartmouth alumni, from Daniel Webster to the many donors in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, have been famously involved in their college.\nDartmouth is on a rural 269-acre (1.1\u00A0km\u00B2) campus in the Upper Valley region of New Hampshire. Given the College's isolated location, participation in athletics and the school's Greek system is high. Dartmouth's 34 varsity sports teams compete in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. Students are also well known for preserving a variety of strong campus traditions.\nIn 2010 Dartmouth College joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with University of T\u00FCbingen (Germany), Durham University (UK), Queen\u2019s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Private_university","surface_form":"private","offset":26},{"uri":"Coeducation","surface_form":"coeducation","offset":35},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":49},{"uri":"Hanover%2C_New_Hampshire","surface_form":"Hanover","offset":63},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":72},{"uri":"Ivy_League","surface_form":"Ivy League","offset":158},{"uri":"Colonial_Colleges","surface_form":"Colonial Colleges","offset":189},{"uri":"Dartmouth_Medical_School","surface_form":"medical","offset":316},{"uri":"Thayer_School_of_Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":325},{"uri":"Tuck_School_of_Business","surface_form":"business","offset":342},{"uri":"Congregational_church","surface_form":"Congregational","offset":543},{"uri":"Eleazar_Wheelock","surface_form":"Eleazar Wheelock","offset":567},{"uri":"Booz_Allen_Hamilton","surface_form":"Booz Allen Hamilton","offset":661},{"uri":"Dartmouth_College_v._Woodward","surface_form":"Trustees of Dartmouth College v.
