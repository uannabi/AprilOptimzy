{"id":147538,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpuss","text":"\"Bagpuss\" is a popular children's television series shown on BBC television. It was shown in 1974. Although only 13 episodes were made, it was so popular that it was repeated regularly until 1987. The series was made by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate through their company Smallfilms.\nThe character Bagpuss was a toy cat. Bagpuss was described in each programme as \"an old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams\".\nWhen Emily had left, Bagpuss would wake up. The programme changed from sepia to colour film, and the toys in the shop would come to life. There was Gabriel the toad, a rag doll called Madeleine, and a wooden woodpecker which was a bookend (something to stop a row of books falling over) called Professor Yaffle. Professor Yaffle spoke like a clever professor. He had a German accent and wore a pince-nez. He would look at the object and tell the audience what it was used for. There were also some mice. They lived in the \u201Cmouse organ\u201D (a pun on the word mouthorgan). The mouse organ played music and the mice squeaked in high voices. All the voices except those of Madeleine and Gabriel were done by Oliver Postgate who also wrote the stories.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":23},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":34},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":61},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":65},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":116},{"uri":"Peter_Firmin","surface_form":"Peter Firmin","offset":220},{"uri":"Oliver_Postgate","surface_form":"Oliver Postgate","offset":237},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":267},{"uri":"Smallfilms","surface_form":"Smallfilms","offset":275},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":291},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy","offset":315},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":319},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"programme","offset":354},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":382},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":511},{"uri":"Photographic_film","surface_form":"film","offset":518},{"uri":"Toad","surface_form":"toad","offset":591},{"uri":"Rag_doll","surface_form":"rag doll","offset":599},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":632},{"uri":"Woodpecker","surface_form":"woodpecker","offset":639},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":698},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":780},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":800},{"uri":"Accent","surface_form":"accent","offset":807},{"uri":"Pince-nez","surface_form":"pince-nez","offset":825},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":877},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":929},{"uri":"Pun","surface_form":"pun","offset":970},{"uri":"Mouthorgan","surface_form":"mouthorgan","offset":986},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":1022},{"uri":"Voice","surface_form":"voice","offset":1058},{"uri":"Oliver_Postgate","surface_form":"Oliver Postgate","offset":1132},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"stories","offset":1167}]}
