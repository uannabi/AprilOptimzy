{"id":147627,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship","text":"=\"preserve\">Intern is the job title given to people who work in an organization which has an internship program. It is similar to an apprenticeship, but is the term more commonly used if the work takes place in office environments. The work in an internship is expected to be part of a desired learning experience for the intern. The specific requirements for being an intern vary widely.\nInternship positions are posted online similarly to job postings, but focus instead on engaging students in real world projects before they have completed their studies. Internships are usually temporary positions, often lasting between one school term and one year.Interns are sometimes given longer term job opportunities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Job_title","surface_form":"job title","offset":26},{"uri":"Apprenticeship","surface_form":"apprenticeship","offset":133},{"uri":"Job_postings","surface_form":"job postings","offset":441}]}
