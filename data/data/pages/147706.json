It was used as a drug, for good health, and as a coloring agent (a medium to dark brown) until the 1920s. Eating ground mumified corpses is a form of cannibalism.\nThe powder was said to work against almost any disease. To mummify a corpse, tar was used. It was said this tar had magical powers. It was also said to be an aphrodisiac.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mumia_Abu-Jamal","surface_form":"Mumia Abu-Jamal","offset":49},{"uri":"Powder","surface_form":"powder","offset":122},{"uri":"Mummification","surface_form":"mummies","offset":146},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":172},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":187},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":204},{"uri":"1920s","surface_form":"1920s","offset":254},{"uri":"Corpse","surface_form":"corpse","offset":284},{"uri":"Cannibalism","surface_form":"cannibalism","offset":305},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":365},{"uri":"Tar","surface_form":"tar","offset":395},{"uri":"Magical","surface_form":"magical","offset":434},{"uri":"Aphrodisiac","surface_form":"aphrodisiac","offset":476}]}
