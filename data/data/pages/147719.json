{"id":147719,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Nuclear_Futures","text":"\"Non-Nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy\" is a 1975 book by Amory B. Lovins and John H. Price. The book says that the nuclear power debate is not about technical disputes but relates to different personal views (personal values). The personal values that make a high-energy society work are all too apparent, and the values associated with an alternate view relate to thrift, simplicity, diversity, neighbourliness, craftsmanship, and humility.\nLovins and Price say that these two different sets of personal values lead to two very different policy paths relating to future energy supplies. The first is high-energy nuclear, centralized, electric; the second is lower energy, non-nuclear, decentralized, less electrified, softer technology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amory_B._Lovins","surface_form":"Amory B.
