It is about south of Grosseto, on a lagoon, which is an important Natural Reserve.\nHistory.\nOrbetello was an ancient Etruscan village, which in 280 BC went under the control of the Romans, who had founded their colony of Cosa.\nIn the Middle Ages it was controlled by the Aldobrandeschi family, who held it until the 14th century, when it was bought by the city of Orvieto. After some years, Orbetello was captured by the Sienese Republic. In the mid-16th century it was part of the Spanish puppet State of Presides, becoming its capital. Later it was under the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and, from the late 19th century, the new Kingdom of Italy.\nIn 1927-1933, Italo Balbo's \"air cruises\" started from Orbetello's lagoon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province_of_Grosseto","surface_form":"province of Grosseto","offset":41},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":63},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":73},{"uri":"Grosseto","surface_form":"Grosseto","offset":101},{"uri":"Lagoon","surface_form":"lagoon","offset":116},{"uri":"Natural_Reserve","surface_form":"Natural Reserve","offset":146},{"uri":"Etruscan_civilization","surface_form":"Etruscan","offset":197},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":261},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":291},{"uri":"Cosa","surface_form":"Cosa","offset":301},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":314},{"uri":"Aldobrandeschi","surface_form":"Aldobrandeschi","offset":351},{"uri":"Orvieto","surface_form":"Orvieto","offset":444},{"uri":"Republic_of_Siena","surface_form":"Sienese Republic","offset":501},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":562},{"uri":"Stato_dei_Presidi","surface_form":"State of Presides","offset":577},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Tuscany","offset":641},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Italy","surface_form":"Kingdom of Italy","offset":705},{"uri":"1927","surface_form":"1927","offset":726},{"uri":"1933","surface_form":"1933","offset":731},{"uri":"Italo_Balbo","surface_form":"Italo Balbo","offset":737}]}
