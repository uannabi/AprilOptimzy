{"id":147959,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_153","text":"The British Rail Class 153 \"Sprinter\" is a single-car diesel multiple unit train.\nIn the early 1990s, British Rail took the decision that running 2-car trains on rural routes was inefficient, and identified the need for single-carriage trains. Initially consideration was given to splitting the Met-Cam Class 156 units to form class 152 units, however due to various problems with the Class 155 units, the decision was taken to split these units instead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":4},{"uri":"Sprinter_(train)","surface_form":"Sprinter","offset":28},{"uri":"Diesel_multiple_unit","surface_form":"diesel multiple unit","offset":54},{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":102},{"uri":"British_Rail_Class_156","surface_form":"Met-Cam Class 156","offset":295},{"uri":"British_Rail_Class_155","surface_form":"Class 155 units","offset":385}]}
