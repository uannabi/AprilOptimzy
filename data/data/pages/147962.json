{"id":147962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_157","text":"=\"preserve\">Class 157 was the designation applied to a range of Diesel multiple unit trains of the Sprinter family planned for regional use, in particular for the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive. As well as the class number, British Rail reserved carriage numbers in the 526xx and 576xx series for these units.\nAs the Privatisation of British Rail began, this project became unviable as resources were concentrated on the privatisation process, leading to the famous 1064-day 'drought' of new train orders. By the time this period was over, plans had moved on and Stratchclyde ended up receiving a batch of Class 170 units.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diesel_multiple_unit","surface_form":"Diesel multiple unit","offset":64},{"uri":"Sprinter_(train)","surface_form":"Sprinter","offset":99},{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":235},{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":345},{"uri":"British_Rail_Class_170","surface_form":"Class 170","offset":617}]}
