{"id":14801,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep","text":"Meryl Streep (born Mary Louise Streep; June 22, 1949) is an American actress. She has appeared in many movies, including \"Falling in Love\", \"The Bridges of Madison County\", and \"The House of Spirits\". She was born in New Jersey. Streep is considered one of the best actresses of her time. She has won three Academy Awards and has been nominated for twenty-one in total. President Barack Obama awarded her the 2010 National Medal of Arts.\nEarly life.\nStreep was born in Summit, New Jersey. Her mother, Mary Wolf (n\u00E9e Wilkinson; 1915\u20132001), was a commercial artist and an art editor, and her father, Harry William Streep, Jr. (1910\u20132003), was a pharmaceutical executive. She has two brothers, Dana David and Harry William III. Her patrilineal ancestry traces back to Loffenau, Germany, from where her second great-grandfather, Gottfried Streep, emigrated to the United States, and where one of her ancestors served as mayor. Another line of her father's family was from Giswil in the canton of Obwalden, a small town in Switzerland. Her mother had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Some of Streep's maternal ancestors lived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and were descended from 17th century immigrants from England. Her eighth great-grandfather, Lawrence Wilkinson, was one of the first Europeans to settle Rhode Island. Streep is also a distant relative of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, and records show that her family is among the first purchasers of land in the state. One of Streep's maternal great-grandmothers, Grace Strain, was from Creeslough, County Donegal, Ireland.\nPersonal life.\nStreep is married to Don Gummer since September 30, 1978. They have four children, son Henry Wolf Gummer (born November 13, 1979) and daughters Mary Willa Gummer (born August 3, 1983), Grace Jane Gummer (born May 9, 1986), and Louisa Jacobson Gummer (born June 12, 1991).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":60},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":69},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":103},{"uri":"Falling_in_Love","surface_form":"Falling in Love","offset":122},{"uri":"The_Bridges_of_Madison_County","surface_form":"The Bridges of Madison County","offset":141},{"uri":"The_House_of_Spirits","surface_form":"The House of Spirits","offset":178},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":217},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":307},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":380},{"uri":"National_Medal_of_Arts","surface_form":"National Medal of Arts","offset":414},{"uri":"Summit%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Summit, New Jersey","offset":469},{"uri":"Loffenau","surface_form":"Loffenau","offset":765},{"uri":"Giswil","surface_form":"Giswil","offset":968},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":982},{"uri":"Obwalden","surface_form":"Obwalden","offset":992},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1018},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":1128},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":1145},{"uri":"William_Penn","surface_form":"William Penn","offset":1363}]}
