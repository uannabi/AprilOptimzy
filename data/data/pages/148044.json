{"id":148044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail","text":"High-speed rail is a type of passenger rail transport that operates significantly faster than the normal rail traffic. Early Shinkansen trains had a top speed of 200km/h. Various definitions are used in different contries.\nAccording to the European Union, high-speed trains must run at least 200km/h (125 mph) on existing lines, and at least on newly built ones.\nAccording to the United States Federal Railroad Administration, they should go above 90\u00A0mph (145\u00A0km/h) but there is no single standard, and lower speeds can be required by local constraints.\nAs of 2020, speeds of 300 to 350 km/h are common in regular operation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rail_transport","surface_form":"rail transport","offset":39},{"uri":"Shinkansen","surface_form":"Shinkansen","offset":125},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":240},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":380},{"uri":"Federal_Railroad_Administration","surface_form":"Federal Railroad Administration","offset":394}]}
