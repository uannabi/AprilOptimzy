{"id":14811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit","text":"Fahrenheit (more precisely, a degree Fahrenheit) is a unit of measurement used to measure temperature. The conversion rate to Celsius is C= 5/9 x (F \u2212 32). The degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated \u00B0F.\nHistory.\nThis temperature scale was made in 1724 by a German scientist named Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. In the twentieth century, the unit became less used, and the degree Celsius more used. Fahrenheit is still often used in the United States. In the United Kingdom, Fahrenheit is used on some websites, and on weather forecasts. The main reason for this is that the older population is more familiar with Fahrenheit.\nThe degree Fahrenheit is considered by many to be old fashioned and outdated way of measuring temperature. The degree Celsius has largely replaced Fahrenheit's use. However, Fahrenheit is understood by many ordinary people, whereas the Celsius scale is more abstract. The needs of ordinary people are often quite different to the needs of professional scientists and technicians.\nOverall, the use of the degree Fahrenheit is in decline throughout most of the world, with the USA being the main exception.\nExamples.\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32\u00B0 and boils at 212\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit of measurement","offset":54},{"uri":"Daniel_Gabriel_Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit","offset":274},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":369},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":426},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":448}]}
