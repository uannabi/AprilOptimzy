{"id":148233,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatidae","text":"The anatidae are the biological family of birds that includes the ducks, geese and swans.\nThese birds are common and widespread, and live in or near water. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, on all the world's continents except Antarctica and on most of the world's islands and island groups.\nThese are birds that are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving. The family has about 146 species in 40 genera. They are usually herbivorous, and are monogamous breeders. A number of species do annual migrations. A few species have been domesticated for agriculture, and many others are hunted for food and recreation. Five species have become extinct since 1600, and others are close to extinction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":42},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":66},{"uri":"Goose","surface_form":"geese","offset":73},{"uri":"Swan","surface_form":"swan","offset":83},{"uri":"Cosmopolitan_distribution","surface_form":"cosmopolitan distribution","offset":173},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":237},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":312},{"uri":"Adapted","surface_form":"adapted","offset":327},{"uri":"Diving","surface_form":"diving","offset":398},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":445},{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":470},{"uri":"Monogamy","surface_form":"monogamous","offset":491},{"uri":"Animal_migration","surface_form":"annual migrations","offset":535},{"uri":"Domesticated","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":578},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":729}]}
