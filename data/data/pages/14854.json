{"id":14854,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina","text":"North Carolina is one of the 50 states of the United States. The capital of North Carolina is Raleigh and the biggest city in the state is Charlotte. North Carolina is split into 100 counties and these counties have many cities and towns.\nNorth Carolina was one of the original thirteen colonies and was where the first English colony in America lived. As of July 1, 2014, there are about 10,146,788 people living in the state.\nIn 2018, North Carolina was ranked number one on Forbes' Best States for Business ranking for a second year in a row.\nPolitics.\nUntil recently, North Carolina had long leaned Democratic. In presidential elections, it has voted Democratic twice as many times as it has voted Republican. In presidential elections from 1968 to 2004, North Carolina supported the Democrat only in 1976, when he came from the South. However, from presidential elections from the century of 1868 to 1964, inclusive, North Carolina voted for the Democrat in all 25 elections except for 1928. Despite the fact that North Carolina is steadily growing conservative, the governor, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat.\nRaleigh.\nRaleigh is also the capital of North Carolina.\nCharlotte.\nCharlotte is the most populous city in North Carolina.\nAsheville.\nAsheville is in West North Carolina. The population is 84,000 or so.\nGeography.\nNorth Carolina touches South Carolina on the south, Georgia on the southwest, Tennessee on the west, Virginia on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The state is divided into three distinct geographical areas, the Coastal Plains to the east, the centrally located Piedmont region, and the mountain ranges of Appalachia to the west. The eastern seaboard of the state is lined with a string of barrier islands known as The Outer Banks.\nNorth Carolina is known for its varying weather across the geographically diverse regions of the state.\nCoastal Plain (East North Carolina).\nThe eastern part of the state is touched by the Atlantic Ocean, and usually has moderate temperatures all year long with the summer average high temperature usually not above 90\u00A0\u00B0F in the summer and not under 40\u00A0\u00B0F in the winter. However, it can get as hot as the low 100s\u00A0\u00B0F and as cold as 20\u00A0\u00B0F. Most years there is less than one inch of snow and some years pass with no snow at all. The coastal plain usually gets a tropical storm every 3 or 4 years.\nPiedmont (Middle North Carolina).\nThe average temperature normally does not go above 90\u00A0\u00B0F in most parts of the Piedmont in summer, but can go over 100\u00A0\u00B0F when there is a heat wave. Ice pellets and freezing rain are normal in this part of North Carolina, but the mountain ranges protect the Piedmont from the worst winter weather. Snow in this region rarely lasts more than 48 hours before melting. Weak tornadoes are often seen in the Piedmont, but only 140 people have died by tornadoes from 1950-2012 in the entire state.\nMountains (West North Carolina).\nThe average temperature almost never goes above 80\u00A0\u00B0F in the summer and is usually in the high 30\u2019s or low 40\u2019s in the winter in the mountain region of North Carolina. About 14 to 20 inches of snow fall each year with some of the higher elevations getting 50 inches each winter. The wettest part of the mountains gets 90 inches of rain.\nThe Beginning.\nBefore the English came, about 30 Native American groups lived in North Carolina. In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh started two colonies in what is now known as North Carolina, but they did not last long. One of these, the Roanoke Colony later became known as the \"Lost Colony\" and is still known as one of the great unsolved mysteries of early American history to this day. Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the America, was born in the Roanoke Colony.\nThe first permanent settlers in North Carolina came from the state of Virginia in 1655 because there was not enough farmland in Virginia. Later the land was cut up into present-day North Carolina and South Carolina. The name \"Carolina\" comes from the Latin for Charles (\"Carolus\") after King Charles I.\nThe Seaborne Slave Trade of North Carolina from the North Carolina Historical Review reports that slaves imported to North Carolina prior to the Revolution from extant records came mainly from the West Indies, most particularly Montego Bay, Jamaica; Barbados; Antigua; and the Bahamas; a small number from mainland colonies; and an even smaller number directly from Africa, though imports between the years 1772-1775 rarely exceeded 150 slaves annually (Minchinton).\nThe economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of tobacco.\nThe American Revolutionary War.\nNorth Carolina was an important state during the American Revolutionary War.\nThe Civil War.\nIn 1860, North Carolina was a slave state. About 1/3 of the people in the state were slaves. North Carolina fought as part of the Confederacy during the Civil War, but it was the last state to leave the Union. The state sent about 125,000 troops to fight in the war and about 40,000 of them died. Even during the war some people in North Carolina did not support the Confederacy, mostly because the Confederacy believed in slavery. The first Confederate soldier to be killed was from North Carolina.\nFarming and Manufacturing.\nFarms in North Carolina grow many different foods such as grapes, peanuts, Christmas trees, poultry and eggs, wheat, corn, cucumbers, apples, greens, tobacco, hogs, milk, cattle, sweet potatoes, and soybeans. North Carolina grows more tobacco than any other state in the country. Furniture making is an important industry in North Carolina, but over the past few years many jobs have moved to other countries like China and India.\nBanking and Technology.\nCharlotte, the biggest city in North Carolina, is the second biggest banking city in the United States, making banking very important in North Carolina. BB&T and Bank of America have their main offices in the state.\nTechnology is also important in North Carolina. There are many companies that make computer software and video games in the state. Winston-Salem is a center for innovation in biomedical and material sciences and information technology called the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter. Research Triangle Park near the state capital of Raleigh is one of the largest research parks in the world.\nMedical Research and Care.\nNorth Carolina has four hospitals that are nationally ranked with many NICUs at a IV rating (highest possible rating in the United States). Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center is reported by the U.S. News & World Report as one of the top hospitals in the nation. Brenner Children's Hospital and Health Services is designated a Nurse Magnet facility and it was rated in 2014 as one of America's best children's hospitals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S.
