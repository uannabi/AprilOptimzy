{"id":14903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider","text":"Cider (or cyder) is a drink made from fruit juice, most often from apples.\nIn Europe and Oceania it is an alcoholic drink that is made from apple juice, through a process called fermentation. In the United States and parts of Canada, cider containing alcohol is called hard cider or alcoholic cider, while \"cider\" or \"apple cider\" means less-sweet, usually unfiltered, apple juice.\nIn the United States and Canada people drink a special kind of cider around Halloween and Thanksgiving. This cider is usually unfiltered, rather thick, and it is often heated and spiced with cinnamon before drinking it. This is different from the cider in Europe, which usually is not heated.\nHow cider is made.\nUsually to make cider, apples with a high concentration of tannins are chosen. The fermentation of the apples takes place at around 4-15\u00B0 Celsius. The temperature influences the duration of the fermentation. The temperature at which the fermentation occurs also has an effect on the taste of the cider.\nShortly before all the sugar has been fermented away, the cider is put in a new barrel which is made air-tight. The rest of the sugar will then become carbonic acid. This will also add to the life-span of the cider (no pasteurisation is needed).\nCider is also the starting-point for distilling Calvados. This alcoholic drink is famous and very expensive.\nWhere cider is made.\nCider is made almost anywhere where there are cider-apple trees, most notably\nIn France, Normandy is the first region as to the production of cider-apples (300 000 tonnes), and the first in cider production (7000 kilolitres).\nIn France, some ciders can benefit from a protected naming. This is the \"cidre normand\" and the \"cidre breton\".\nFrance is the country in the world that produces the biggest quantity of cider.\nThe United Kingdom produces the most varieties, and along with Ireland holds the biggest market for cider.\nKinds of cider.\nIn France, the most popular are the first, second and fourth categories. In the English-speaking countries, it is possible to find cider with up to 12\u00B0 of alcohol.\nWhen to drink cider.\nThe French and Spanish cuisines have recipes where cider is needed to make them. The French and Spanish also often drink cider instead of wine made from grapes.\nIn Europe, many young people drink cider. Cider costs less than wine, and is often served in pubs and other places where young people go.\nThe effects of cider are the same as those of any alcoholic drink.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":22},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":38},{"uri":"Juice","surface_form":"juice","offset":44},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":67},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":78},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":89},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":106},{"uri":"Apple_juice","surface_form":"apple juice","offset":140},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":178},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":199},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":226},{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":342},{"uri":"Filtration","surface_form":"unfiltered","offset":357},{"uri":"Halloween","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":458},{"uri":"Thanksgiving","surface_form":"Thanksgiving","offset":472},{"uri":"Tannin","surface_form":"tannin","offset":753},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":777},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":832},{"uri":"Taste","surface_form":"taste","offset":977},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":1020},{"uri":"Barrel","surface_form":"barrel","offset":1077},{"uri":"Carbonic_acid","surface_form":"carbonic acid","offset":1148},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distilling","offset":1280},{"uri":"Calvados_(drink)","surface_form":"Calvados","offset":1291},{"uri":"Tonne","surface_form":"tonne","offset":1537},{"uri":"Kilolitre","surface_form":"kilolitre","offset":1586},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":2122},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":2252},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pubs","offset":2353}]}
