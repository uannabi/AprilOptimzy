{"id":14946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95","text":"Windows 95 is an operating system by Microsoft released in 1995. Windows 95 added many new features to the last Windows operating system, which was Windows 3.x. It is the first windows to be part of Windows 9x. Windows 95 was also the first Windows with the \"Start\" button. Since then it has been used in all Windows operating systems. It was also the first Windows that added surfing the Internet, due to the foundation of it. Although Windows 95 is thought of as a full operating system, it works over MS-DOS. Windows 95 is like a visual version of DOS. This means that Windows 95 can run both MS-DOS programs and Windows ones, but programs made just for Windows 95 will not work in DOS.\nWindows 95 was Microsoft's first operating system to support long file names. Before that, file names could only be eight characters (letters, numbers, or symbols) long, plus the file extension. Windows 95 was also Microsoft's first operating system to fully support CD-ROMs, though Windows 3.x could also access CD-ROMs.\nIt was popular from 1995 until 1998 when Microsoft replaced it with Windows 98. Microsoft ended extended support for Windows 95 on December 31, 2001.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["OS version"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":17},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":37},{"uri":"Windows_3.x","surface_form":"Windows 3.x","offset":148},{"uri":"Windows_9x","surface_form":"Windows 9x","offset":199},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":389},{"uri":"MS-DOS","surface_form":"MS-DOS","offset":504},{"uri":"File_extension","surface_form":"file extension","offset":869},{"uri":"CD-ROM","surface_form":"CD-ROM","offset":957},{"uri":"Windows_3.x","surface_form":"Windows 3.x","offset":973},{"uri":"Windows_98","surface_form":"Windows 98","offset":1080}]}
