{"id":14948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck","text":"Prince Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck-Sch\u00F6nhausen Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 \u2013 30 July 1898) was an aristocrat and statesman of the 19th century in Europe. As Prime Minister of Prussia from 1862 to 1890, he was mainly responsible for unifying most of the many independent German countries into the new German Empire in 1871. He became the first chancellor of the empire.\nHe was \"Graf von Bismarck-Sch\u00F6nhausen\" (Count Bismarck-Sch\u00F6nhausen) in 1865, then since 1871 \"F\u00FCrst\" von Bismarck (Prince Bismarck) and since 1890 the \"Herzog von Lauenburg\" (Duke of Lauenburg). At first he did not want the duke title but accepted it later.\nUnification of Germany.\nIn the 1860s he engineered a series of wars that unified most of the German states except Austria into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. He got that by 1871 and \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".\nBismarck conducted wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1871). All were to get more land for the German Empire. The war against France was very significant in the long run. France lost AlsaceLorraine. The German victory, under the brilliant Helmuth von Moltke, made Germany the most important country in Central Europe.\nAfter the death of the emperor and of his son (Frederick III) in 1888, a new era began, without Bismarck and the elder von Moltke, and with Kaiser Wilhelm II on the throne.\nPolicy at home.\nBismarck was very conservative and was strongly connected to the monarchy. He was not a big supporter of democracy. His most important goal was to make Prussia stronger, and he achieved that by the unification of Germany. Bismarck tried to stop the socialist movement and to reduce the power of the Catholic Church.\nOne way to stop socialism was to make the working class happy. He did so by introducing many social reforms like public health and accident insurance, as well as pensions for old people. Bismarck's pension scheme was the forerunner of the modern welfare state.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lauenburg","surface_form":"Lauenburg","offset":60},{"uri":"Aristocrat","surface_form":"aristocrat","offset":107},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":139},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":155},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Prussia","offset":166},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":279},{"uri":"Chancellor","surface_form":"chancellor","offset":352},{"uri":"Graf","surface_form":"Graf","offset":386},{"uri":"F%C3%BCrst","surface_form":"F\u00FCrst","offset":472},{"uri":"Herzog_von_Lauenburg","surface_form":"Herzog von Lauenburg","offset":530},{"uri":"Unification_of_Germany","surface_form":"unified most of the German states","offset":709},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":750},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":774},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":1083},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1118},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_war","surface_form":"war against France","offset":1186},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":1255},{"uri":"Lorraine","surface_form":"Lorraine","offset":1261},{"uri":"Von_Moltke","surface_form":"Helmuth von Moltke","offset":1311},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":1374},{"uri":"Frederick_III","surface_form":"Frederick III","offset":1437},{"uri":"Kaiser","surface_form":"Kaiser","offset":1530},{"uri":"Wilhelm_II","surface_form":"Wilhelm II","offset":1537},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":1731},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":1828},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":1878},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":1911},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":1937},{"uri":"Pension","surface_form":"pension","offset":2057},{"uri":"Welfare_state","surface_form":"welfare state","offset":2141}]}
