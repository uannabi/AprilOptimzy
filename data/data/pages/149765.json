The name \"Stuyahok\" means \"going down river place\". In 2008 a new airport was built at a cost of $3,000,000.\nThe village of New Stuyahok has been moved at least three times. It moved down the river from the first site in 1918. In 1942 this site was seen to be still too far up the river and being flooded too often, so the village moved to its current site. A school and a post office were built in 1961.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":18},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":26}]}
