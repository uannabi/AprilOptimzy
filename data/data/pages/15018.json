{"id":15018,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge_music","text":"Grunge music or Seattle sound (as it is called sometimes) is a style of rock music that has elements of punk rock and heavy metal. It started in the mid- 1980s in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, especially in the states of Washington and Oregon. It became more popular in the early 1990s. Grunge songs often had lyrics with nihilism, depression, unhappiness, or apathy as themes. The widespread use of heroin as a recreational drug found its way into the lyrics and careers of numerous grunge rockers, notably Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley of \"Alice in Chains\".\nThe songs often had light (or clean) guitar sounds in the verses, and the high energy boost of distorted (or dirty) guitars in the choruses. The line-up for these bands was the typical rock band of guitars, bass, drums and vocal.\nAlthough grunge as a movement became less popular by the last 1990s, its influence is still heard in many bands. Grunge musical sounds were copied by post-grunge bands such as Foo Fighters and Nickelback and nu metal bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit.\nSound.\nGrunge music uses music from punk rock and heavy metal. Grunge guitar players use distorted electric guitar. Like punk and heavy metal, grunge bands use electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":16},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock music","offset":72},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":104},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":118},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":235},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":250},{"uri":"Nihilism","surface_form":"nihilism","offset":336},{"uri":"Apathy","surface_form":"apathy","offset":374},{"uri":"Heroin","surface_form":"heroin","offset":414},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":522},{"uri":"Layne_Staley","surface_form":"Layne Staley","offset":538},{"uri":"Alice_in_Chains","surface_form":"Alice in Chains","offset":555},{"uri":"Post-grunge","surface_form":"post-grunge","offset":953},{"uri":"Foo_Fighters","surface_form":"Foo Fighters","offset":979},{"uri":"Nickelback","surface_form":"Nickelback","offset":996},{"uri":"Nu_metal","surface_form":"nu metal","offset":1011},{"uri":"Korn","surface_form":"Korn","offset":1034},{"uri":"Limp_Bizkit","surface_form":"Limp Bizkit","offset":1043},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":1092},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":1106},{"uri":"Distortion_(music)","surface_form":"distorted","offset":1145},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric guitar","offset":1155},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric guitar","offset":1216},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":1233},{"uri":"Drummer","surface_form":"drummer","offset":1248},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":1262}]}
