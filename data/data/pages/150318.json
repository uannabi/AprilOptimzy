{"id":150318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding","text":"Skateboarding is the act of riding on a skateboard. A person who skateboards is most often called a \"skateboarder\".\nSkateboarding can be a hobby, an art, a job, or a way of moving around. Skateboarding has been changed by many skateboarders over many years. A 2002 report by \"American Sports Data\" found that there were 18.5 million skateboarders in the world. Of those skateboarders, 85 percent were under 18 years old, and 74 percent were male.\nHistory.\nSkateboarding started when surfers in California wanted to take surfing to the street. Soon, the first skateboard was invented in the 1950s. From there, the new culture of skateboarding was created.\nTricks.\nThe basic tricks of skateboarding are ollies, kickflips, shuv-its, and 180s (\"one-eighties\"). These are the tricks that new skateboarders often try. An \"ollie\" is when someone pops the board and gets off the ground. A kickflip is done by doing an ollie and rotating the board. A \"shuv-it\" is done by turning the board 180\u00B0 while staying above the board. A \"180\" is done by turning the board 180\u00B0, along with the skateboarder. There are also variations of these tricks, such as the \"tre flip\", which is a 360\u00B0 shuv-it and a kickflip.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skateboard","surface_form":"skateboard","offset":40},{"uri":"Hobby","surface_form":"hobby","offset":139},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":149},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":156},{"uri":"Transportation","surface_form":"moving around","offset":173},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":265},{"uri":"Percent","surface_form":"percent","offset":388},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":441},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":494}]}
