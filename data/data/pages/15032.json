{"id":15032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea","text":"Eritrea is a country on the eastern coast of Africa. Its official name is The State of Eritrea.\nGeography.\nEritrea is located on the coast on the Red Sea. It is north of the Bab-el-Mandeb and the Horn of Africa. Eritrea has borders with the countries of Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. The land area of Eritrea is 101,000\u00A0km\u00B2, and it is one of the smallest countries in Africa.\nHistory.\nEritrea became an independent country on 24 May 1993. It is one of the newest countries in the world.\nMany different countries have ruled the land that is now called Eritrea. Between 1885 and 1941 it was a colony of Italy. Between 1941 and 1952, the United Nations put it under the protection of United Kingdom. After 1952, Eritrea became a part of Ethiopia. This was the reason for a long civil war between the Eritreans and the government of Ethiopia.\nEventually, in 1993, Eritrea became an independent country after a vote by its people.\nGovernment.\nEritrea is known for being the most oppressive country in Africa, sometimes considered to be the \"North Korea of Africa\". The nation has been accused of many human rights violations, severely limited freedoms, and many arbitrary (made-up) arrests.\nAdministrative divisions.\nEritrea is divided into six administrative regions. These areas are then divided into 58 districts.\nCulture.\nThe population of Eritrea is about 5.6\u00A0million. About 0.5\u00A0million people live in Asmara. People from Eritrea are called Eritreans. Most of them speak \"Tigrinya\" or \"Tigre\" as their first language. The people usually use Tigrinya or Arabic for official business.\nEritrea has nine ethnic groups. These are the Afar people, the Bilen people, the Hedareb people, the Kunama, the Nara, the Rashaida, the Saho, the Tigre, and Tigray-Tigrinya.\nThe currency of Eritrea is called the Nakfa. Eritrea is a very poor country. Almost half of Eritrea's economy comes from Eritreans who live abroad. They send money home to their families. Most of the rest comes from farming.\nFootball and cycling are the most popular sports in Eritrea. In recent years, Eritrean athletes have also seen increasing success in the international arena.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"eastern","offset":28},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":45},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":133},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":146},{"uri":"Bab-el-Mandeb","surface_form":"Bab-el-Mandeb","offset":174},{"uri":"Horn_of_Africa","surface_form":"Horn of Africa","offset":196},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":254},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":261},{"uri":"Djibouti","surface_form":"Djibouti","offset":275},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":294},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":404},{"uri":"24_May","surface_form":"24 May","offset":427},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":434},{"uri":"1885","surface_form":"1885","offset":569},{"uri":"1941","surface_form":"1941","offset":578},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":592},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":602},{"uri":"1941","surface_form":"1941","offset":617},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":626},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":636},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":682},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":735},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"civil war","offset":776},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":907},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":1326},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":1509},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1554},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":1763},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":1861},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":1975},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"Football","offset":1984},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"cycling","offset":1997}]}
