{"id":15033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Dole","text":"Sanford Dole (April 23, 1844 \u2013 June 9, 1926) was an American politician. Dole was a part of a group of businessmen who first forced a new Hawaiian national constitution on the country during King David Kalakaua's reign and then after his death removed Queen Liliuokalani from the throne and took control of the country in 1893. They removed the queen by threatening to use the warships of the U.S. Navy had in Honolulu harbor.\nQueen Liliuokalani did not want her people to be harmed so she agreed to do what the revolutionists wanted. The Queen went to Washington and talked to the American President, Grover Cleveland. Cleveland decided that this had been an act of war against the Hawaiian Kingdom. Cleveland ordered Sanford Dole, the President of the newly formed republic, to make Liliuokalani the queen again.\nDole refused to do this. He said that President Cleveland was interfering. Dole remained the president of Hawaii from 1894 until 1900 after Cleveland was elected out of office. The newly elected American president William McKinley signed the Newsland Resolution. The Newsland Resolution made Hawaii a territory of the United States. This ended any legal or military chance of restoring the Queen and the Hawaiian Kingdom.\nDole served as governor of Hawaii from 1900 until 1903, he was the first when he accepted a position as United States District Court judge. He remained a judge until 1915.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"April_23","surface_form":"April 23","offset":14},{"uri":"1844","surface_form":"1844","offset":24},{"uri":"June_9","surface_form":"June 9","offset":31},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":39},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":52},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":61},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":103},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":138},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":156},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":176},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":191},{"uri":"David_Kalakaua","surface_form":"David Kalakaua","offset":196},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":213},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"Queen","offset":252},{"uri":"Liliuokalani","surface_form":"Liliuokalani","offset":258},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warship","offset":377},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"U.S. Navy","offset":393},{"uri":"Honolulu","surface_form":"Honolulu","offset":410},{"uri":"Harbor","surface_form":"harbor","offset":419},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":512},{"uri":"Washington%2C_DC","surface_form":"Washington","offset":553},{"uri":"President_(United_States)","surface_form":"President","offset":591},{"uri":"Grover_Cleveland","surface_form":"Grover Cleveland","offset":602},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":667},{"uri":"Hawaiian_Kingdom","surface_form":"Hawaiian Kingdom","offset":683},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":908},{"uri":"1894","surface_form":"1894","offset":933},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":944},{"uri":"William_McKinley","surface_form":"William McKinley","offset":1029},{"uri":"Newsland_Resolution","surface_form":"Newsland Resolution","offset":1057},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":1116},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"legal","offset":1163},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1172},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":1252},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":1276},{"uri":"1903","surface_form":"1903","offset":1287},{"uri":"United_States_District_Court","surface_form":"United States District Court","offset":1341},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":1370},{"uri":"1915","surface_form":"1915","offset":1403}]}
