{"id":150682,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Mine_Music","text":"\"Make Mine Music\" is a 1946 animated movie, produced by Walt Disney Productions and first released to movie theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on August 15, 1946. The 8th animated movie in the Disney animated movie canon, the movie stars Nelson Eddy, Dinah Shore, Benny Goodman, and The Andrews Sisters.\nSegments.\nThe movie is made of ten parts, or segments.\nProduction.\nDuring World War II, much of Walt Disney's staff was drafted into the United States Army, and those that were still there were called upon by the U.S. government to make training and propaganda films. As a result, the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the movie division alive during this difficult time, the studio released four package films including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music.\nRelease.\nTo date, \"Make Mine Music\" is the only movie in the Disney animated features canon not to gain a Region 4 and Region 2 DVD release. Its only home video release was on DVD on June 6, 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection title.\nReception.\n\"Make Mine Music\" ended up being a slight disappointment itself, particularly from Walt Disney's point of view. It was not well received by the critics either. Years later, the segments were individually released as short subjects or used in various Disney television programs.\nThe movie was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":28},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":37},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Walt Disney Productions","offset":56},{"uri":"Movie_theater","surface_form":"movie theater","offset":102},{"uri":"RKO_Radio_Pictures","surface_form":"RKO Radio Pictures","offset":120},{"uri":"List_of_Disney_animated_movies","surface_form":"Disney animated movie canon","offset":189},{"uri":"Nelson_Eddy","surface_form":"Nelson Eddy","offset":234},{"uri":"Dinah_Shore","surface_form":"Dinah Shore","offset":247},{"uri":"Benny_Goodman","surface_form":"Benny Goodman","offset":260},{"uri":"The_Andrews_Sisters","surface_form":"The Andrews Sisters","offset":279},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":374},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":396},{"uri":"Draft","surface_form":"draft","offset":420},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":437},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. government","offset":513},{"uri":"Propaganda_film","surface_form":"propaganda film","offset":550},{"uri":"Movie_studio","surface_form":"studio","offset":585},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":655},{"uri":"Package_films","surface_form":"package films","offset":729},{"uri":"Segment_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"segments","offset":792},{"uri":"List_of_Disney_animated_movies","surface_form":"Disney animated features canon","offset":876},{"uri":"Region_4","surface_form":"Region 4","offset":921},{"uri":"Region_2","surface_form":"Region 2","offset":934},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Gold_Classic_Collection","surface_form":"Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection","offset":1021},{"uri":"Point_of_view","surface_form":"point of view","offset":1172},{"uri":"Film_criticism","surface_form":"critics","offset":1219},{"uri":"Television_program","surface_form":"television program","offset":1332},{"uri":"1946_Cannes_Film_Festival","surface_form":"1946 Cannes Film Festival","offset":1384}]}
