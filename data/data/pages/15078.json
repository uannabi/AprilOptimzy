{"id":15078,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1","text":"BBC Radio 1 (often known as Radio 1) is an international radio station that is based in the United Kingdom. It is owned by BBC and BBC Radio. Radio 1 started broadcasting at 7.00 am on September 30, 1967. Tony Blackburn presented the first (later known as Breakfast) programme on the station. The station is meant to be listened to mainly by people aged 15\u201329.\nBefore the launch of Radio 1, the BBC ran three radio stations (the BBC Light Programme, the BBC Home Service and the BBC Third Programme), but these were considered old fashioned and were closed down in 1967. They were replaced with Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4.\nThe launch of Radio 1 in 1967 was because of the popularity of pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. They had been outlawed by Act of Parliament, and the BBC needed to provide alternative radio stations.\nRadio 1 also has a sister station, BBC Radio 1Xtra.\nProgramming.\nThe daytime shows (Monday-Thursday 4.00 - 19.00, Friday 4.00 - 18.00, Saturday 6.00 - 16.00 and Sunday 6.00 - 19.00) are very speech-focused and use an extensive playlist to introduce unknown and emerging material alongside more established, \"top 40\" hits from the recent past (usually in a 5-year cycle).\nThe nighttime shows focus specifically on new music, with each show devoted to a particular genre. These genres include electronica, dance, hip-hop, rap and rock. All programs during this time are playlisted and presented by the DJs without any influence of the station's music editor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":43},{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio station","offset":57},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":92},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":123},{"uri":"BBC_Radio","surface_form":"BBC Radio","offset":131},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":158},{"uri":"Tony_Blackburn","surface_form":"Tony Blackburn","offset":205},{"uri":"Pirate_radio","surface_form":"pirate radio","offset":679},{"uri":"Radio_Caroline","surface_form":"Radio Caroline","offset":709},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_1Xtra","surface_form":"BBC Radio 1Xtra","offset":863},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronica","offset":1319}]}
