{"id":150886,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene_oxime","text":"e=\"preserve\">Phosgene oxime, also called dichloroformoxime or CX, is a chemical weapon, and a nettle agent that damages skin and other body parts. It was first made in the year 1929. When it is solid, it has no color. When it is liquid, it is yellow-brown. It has a strong, very bad odor. The chemical formula phosgene oxime is CCl2NOH.\nThis chemical has no real use, so accidental exposure is does not happen often. Exposure to CX is almost certainly the result of its use as a weapon.\nSigns of phosgene oxime poisoning.\nPhosgene oxime is toxic if breathed, eaten, or placed on the skin or by the skin. In a very short time, the signs of poisoning are seen. If breathed, it harms the lungs and may eventually lead to pulmonary edema. The effects on the skin include hives, itching, and necrosis of the skin. It also causes watering of the eyes and even can cause blindness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_weapon","surface_form":"chemical weapon","offset":71},{"uri":"Nettle","surface_form":"nettle","offset":94},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":229},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":293},{"uri":"Chemical_warfare","surface_form":"weapon","offset":479},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":540},{"uri":"Lungs","surface_form":"lungs","offset":685},{"uri":"Pulmonary_edema","surface_form":"pulmonary edema","offset":718},{"uri":"Hives","surface_form":"hives","offset":767},{"uri":"Necrosis","surface_form":"necrosis","offset":787},{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blindness","offset":864}]}
