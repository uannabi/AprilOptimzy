{"id":151062,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation","text":"A workstation is a computer used for scientific or technical calculations, or purposes. These computers are usually expensive, high-end computers. They are different from the ordinary computers used for text-processing. Very often they have operating systems that allow several users to work at the computer at the same time. Very often, workstations are connected to a computer network. Computer terminals may be used to access them. Currently, almost all workstations use a unix or unix-like operating system.\nWorkstation computers often use a 64-bit server-class CPU such as the Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron, and some have more than one CPU. They may also have more memory than a normal desktop computer, and they often have 10000 or 15000 RPM hard drives or solid-state drives. Some workstations have devices that are not commonly used on normal desktop computers, such as ECC (error-corrected) memory, SCSI, fibre channel, and 10 gigabit Ethernet.\nSome technologies that were once only found on workstations have now become common in normal PCs, such as multi-core processors, solid-state drives, hardware-accelerated graphics, 24-bit color, broadband Internet access, virtual memory, pre-emptive multitasking, and OpenCL.\nCommon uses for workstations include computer-aided design (CAD), 3D graphics and animation, video and audio production, weather modeling, and other simulations and scientific work.\nRISC vs x86.\nTraditionally, workstations used a RISC processor, such as MIPS, PowerPC, or SPARC architecture CPUs. Modern workstations use x86_64 processors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":19},{"uri":"Scientific","surface_form":"scientific","offset":37},{"uri":"Technical","surface_form":"technical","offset":51},{"uri":"Text-processing","surface_form":"text-processing","offset":203},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":241},{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"computer network","offset":370},{"uri":"Computer_terminal","surface_form":"Computer terminal","offset":388},{"uri":"Unix","surface_form":"unix","offset":476},{"uri":"Unix-like","surface_form":"unix-like","offset":484},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":553},{"uri":"Central_processing_unit","surface_form":"CPU","offset":566},{"uri":"Hard_drive","surface_form":"hard drive","offset":744},{"uri":"Solid-state_drive","surface_form":"solid-state drive","offset":759},{"uri":"SCSI","surface_form":"SCSI","offset":904},{"uri":"Fibre_channel","surface_form":"fibre channel","offset":910},{"uri":"Ethernet","surface_form":"Ethernet","offset":940},{"uri":"Computer-aided_technologies","surface_form":"computer-aided design","offset":1262},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":1318},{"uri":"Audio","surface_form":"audio","offset":1328},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":1346},{"uri":"Computer_model","surface_form":"simulation","offset":1374},{"uri":"RISC","surface_form":"RISC","offset":1455},{"uri":"X86","surface_form":"x86_64","offset":1546}]}
