The concert hall where they are held is called the Wiener Musikverein. The music traditionally consists of waltzes, marches and polkas by the Strauss family. The concert is shown on television to about one billion people in 44 countries.\nMusic and setting.\nThe music always includes pieces from the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I, Johann Strauss II, Josef Strauss and Eduard Strauss). The music consists mainly of waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and marches. Sometimes other Austrian composers are included. In 2009, for the first time, music by Josef Haydn was played. It was the 4th movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 45, known as the \"Farewell Symphony\". It was performed because the year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death.\nThese concerts have been held in the \"Gro\u00DFer Saal\" (Large Hall) of the Wiener Musikverein since 1939. Since 1980 the flowers that decorate the concert hall are a gift each year from the city of Sanremo, Liguria, Italy. On television the viewers can also see ballet dancers who dance to the music. These dancers are often dancing in Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace, Schloss Esterh\u00E1zy, the Vienna State Opera or in the Wiener Musikverein itself.\nThe concert always ends with three encores after the main programme. The first encore is a fast polka. The second encore is Johann Strauss II's \"Blue Danube Waltz\". The audience start to clap as soon as the music for this famous waltz starts. The last encore is the \"Radetzky March\". The audience like to clap along to the music.\nThe concert was first performed in 1939.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vienna_Philharmonic_Orchestra","surface_form":"Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra","offset":41},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":76},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":87},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":161},{"uri":"Concert_hall","surface_form":"concert hall","offset":182},{"uri":"Wiener_Musikverein","surface_form":"Wiener Musikverein","offset":229},{"uri":"Waltz_(music)","surface_form":"waltz","offset":285},{"uri":"March_(music)","surface_form":"marches","offset":294},{"uri":"Polka","surface_form":"polka","offset":306},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":360},{"uri":"Johann_Strauss_I","surface_form":"Johann Strauss I","offset":493},{"uri":"Johann_Strauss_II","surface_form":"Johann Strauss II","offset":511},{"uri":"Josef_Strauss","surface_form":"Josef Strauss","offset":530},{"uri":"Eduard_Strauss","surface_form":"Eduard Strauss","offset":548},{"uri":"Waltz_(music)","surface_form":"waltz","offset":594},{"uri":"Polka","surface_form":"polka","offset":603},{"uri":"Mazurka","surface_form":"mazurka","offset":611},{"uri":"March_(music)","surface_form":"marches","offset":624},{"uri":"Josef_Haydn","surface_form":"Josef Haydn","offset":720},{"uri":"Musikverein%2C_Vienna","surface_form":"Wiener Musikverein","offset":983},{"uri":"Sanremo","surface_form":"Sanremo","offset":1106},{"uri":"Liguria","surface_form":"Liguria","offset":1115},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":1170},{"uri":"Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace","surface_form":"Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace","offset":1244},{"uri":"Schloss_Esterh%C3%A1zy","surface_form":"Schloss Esterh\u00E1zy","offset":1263},{"uri":"Vienna_State_Opera","surface_form":"Vienna State Opera","offset":1286},{"uri":"Encore","surface_form":"encore","offset":1377},{"uri":"Johann_Strauss_II","surface_form":"Johann Strauss II","offset":1466},{"uri":"The_Blue_Danube","surface_form":"Blue Danube Waltz","offset":1487}]}
