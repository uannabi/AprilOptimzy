{"id":15117,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Frog","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Crazy Frog is a 3D animated creature, featured on music albums.\nHistory.\nBefore becoming a ringtone to download onto mobile phones, The Crazy Frog started as a TruboForce 3D animated creature. It was called \u201CThe Annoying Thing\u201D in 2003 by its creator, Erik Wernquist of Sweden. With big eyes and a bigger mouth, the high resolution anthropomorphic \u201Cthing\u201D is dappled grey-blue and nude save for a helmet, goggles and biker vest. All original videos and images also show small male humanoid genital in a relaxed state that move realistically. Some sources pixel out or remove the genitals.\nMusic remixes.\nMembers of Bass Bumpers had a dance remix of Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s \u201CAxel-F\u201D the Beverly Hills Cop theme, adding Daniel Maldemahl\u2019s impression of a moped engine (Ring-a-ding-dong) and a Max Headroom, \u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D (among other dubbed words). In the music video for that remix the \u201CThing\u201D says featured bites from Daniel\u2019s bit (Ding, ding.) and zooms around on a mimed bike to escape a robot minion on a hover bike.\nThe internet and media dubbed it both a Frog and crazy. Erik went along with it.\nFirst, it was simply a vocal imitation of a two stroke, internal combustion engine. Daniel Malmedahl of Sweden created a recording of his imitation in 1997 that eventually spread through peer to peer file sharing on the Internet.\nSales and revenue.\nThe company that sells Crazy Frog ringtones (Jamba!) has made \u00A314 million from it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":36},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":67},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":73},{"uri":"Ringtone","surface_form":"ringtone","offset":108},{"uri":"Mobile_phones","surface_form":"mobile phones","offset":134},{"uri":"TruboForce","surface_form":"TruboForce","offset":177},{"uri":"Erik_Wernquist","surface_form":"Erik Wernquist","offset":269},{"uri":"Anthropomorphic","surface_form":"anthropomorphic","offset":349},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":459},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":470},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":493},{"uri":"Genital","surface_form":"genital","offset":507},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":572},{"uri":"Bass_Bumpers","surface_form":"Bass Bumpers","offset":632},{"uri":"Harold_Faltermeyer","surface_form":"Harold Faltermeyer","offset":666},{"uri":"Axel-F","surface_form":"Axel-F","offset":688},{"uri":"Daniel_Maldemahl","surface_form":"Daniel Maldemahl","offset":732},{"uri":"Moped_engine","surface_form":"moped engine","offset":767},{"uri":"Max_Headroom","surface_form":"Max Headroom","offset":805},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"Frog","offset":1079},{"uri":"Crazy","surface_form":"crazy","offset":1088},{"uri":"Internal_combustion","surface_form":"internal combustion","offset":1176},{"uri":"Daniel_Malmedahl","surface_form":"Daniel Malmedahl","offset":1204},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":1373},{"uri":"Jamba%21","surface_form":"Jamba!","offset":1414}]}
