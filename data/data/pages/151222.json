{"id":151222,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_System_of_Higher_Education","text":"The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) is the second largest provider of higher education in Pennsylvania after the Commonwealth system and a large public university system in the United States. It is the tenth-largest university system in the United States and 43rd largest in the world. The system is made up of 14 state-owned schools, all of which are NCAA Division II members.\nHistory.\nThe \"Normal School Act of 1857\" was passed on the last day of session on 20 May 1857. Its passage created 12 school districts. Afterward, the School Code of 1911 mandated that Pennsylvania purchase all the schools. The \"normal\" schools evolved from state normal schools, to state teacher's colleges, to state colleges. Act 188, which was signed into law on November 12, 1982 and came into effect on July 1, 1983, established the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and converted those state colleges into universities.\nUniversities and locations.\nPASSHE universities also operate four branch campuses. The Office of the Chancellor is situated in the capital city of Harrisburg at the Dixon University Center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Higher_education","surface_form":"higher education","offset":93},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":113},{"uri":"Public_university","surface_form":"public university","offset":168},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":200},{"uri":"World%27s_largest_universities","surface_form":"tenth-largest","offset":225},{"uri":"NCAA","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":375},{"uri":"Division_II","surface_form":"Division II","offset":380},{"uri":"November_12","surface_form":"November 12","offset":767},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":780},{"uri":"July_1","surface_form":"July 1","offset":809},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":817},{"uri":"Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Harrisburg","offset":1087},{"uri":"Dixon_University_Center","surface_form":"Dixon University Center","offset":1105}]}
