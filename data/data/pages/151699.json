{"id":151699,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4_Extra","text":"BBC Radio 4 Extra is a British digital radio station. It plays comedy, drama, and children's programmes 24 hours a day. It was called BBC 7 when it started in 2002 and was later renamed BBC Radio 7 in 2008.\nNot many people knew what Radio 7 was, so its name was completely changed in 2011 to make it sound closer to BBC Radio 4, which is run by the same person.\nThe shows on Radio 4 Extra are mostly old programmes which were once on BBC Radio 4, although they have made some new programmes. It can be heard on digital (DAB) digital radios and also on the Internet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":23},{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":31},{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio station","offset":39},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":63},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":71},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":82},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":134},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_4","surface_form":"BBC Radio 4","offset":316},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":533},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":556}]}
