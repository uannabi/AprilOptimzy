{"id":151714,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Chinese herbs do not grow in China only. If you find the right climate and soil type, you can grow many of those herbs overseas. For instance, American Ginseng is grown in Wisconsin State.\nHerbal tea.\nHow do people take the raw herbs? Raw herbs are usually taken orally by extracting the essence out of them. The natural way being practiced since ancient time is to boil and brew the herbal package in water to get a dark brown solution called herb tea that never tastes good. One hour of brewing should be good enough. Then you drink one or two cups a day. Honey or sugar may be added to make it taste less bad. The herbal package can be conveniently modified by changing some ingredients to make it work for you. So an herbal package is really tailor-made for you only.\nTablet form.\nRaw herbs can be dried and grounded into a powder then compressed into a tablet which is better than buying your own tablets or having to buy gel capsules\nCapsule form.\nRaw herbs can be made into capsules at home. All you need is a tailor-made package of raw herbs. Turn it into fine powder with a powerful grinder, and put the powder into empty gel capsules. When you swallow the capsules, your digestive system has to extract the essence out of the raw herb powder. Whereas if you drink the herb tea, the essence extraction is already done after brewing. The herbal solution will readily be absorbed by your body. Furthermore, the herb tea has a history spanning over two thousand years. How many years of history does the tablet or capsule have besides offering convenience?\nUsage of some Chinese herbs.\n(1) *** (Tonify Qi) ***\nbai zhu \u767D\u672E rhizoma Atractylodis

Graminei\nNotes.\n(1)The terms used here reflect typical TCM usage (as translated literally from individual Chinese characters), and may not reflect their meanings in TCM, namely, meanings that are normative, figurative or metaphorical when read in context. The meanings of these terms are therefore different from that in common English usage. In particular, they are not to be used for purposes of self-diagnosis, much less for self-medication. For example, \"Xia Huo\" means \"To reduce fire\", but \"fire\" here does not refer to combustion involving oxygen. Even within TCM, there are various meanings of \"fire\", and it can refer to \"real\" or \"false\" fire. The 3 herbs mentioned above cannot be used to reduce \"false fire\", or fires of yin deficiency in the zhang organs.\n(2) An example of the non-literal use of transliterated characters is \"long gu\" which literally means \"dragon bones\". This term cannot possible refer to Chinese dragons, since they do not exist. However, one can easily buy \"long gu\" from any TCM herbal shop. Another term that cannot be taken literally is \"di long\" which literally means \"earth dragon\".\n(3) Although the above herbs are common in TCM prescriptions, they cannot be purchased if we refer only to their Latin names. One likely reason is that TCM pharmacists rarely, if ever, use the Latin names of the herbs. The Chinese names, or the transliterated names (pinyin) should be used instead. For example, if we ask for \"flos Lonicerae\" we will almost certainly get a blank look. However, if we ask for \"Jin Yin Hua\" or \u91D1\u94F6\u82B1 we will connect immediately, even though the pharmacist may speak any of the large number of Chinese dialects (such as Cantonese, where the herb is known as \"Kum Gen Fa\", or Golden Silver Flower, in Hong Kong). Wherever possible, use the written form (\u91D1\u94F6\u82B1) to avoid miscommunication and/or mis-pronunciation, since there is no dialect form of the written language.\n(4) There are a large number of synonyms of the herb names, in both Chinese, English and Latin. This makes it even more essential to use the written form of the Chinese names to ensure accuracy.\n(5) Some herbs are prone to adulteration, substitution, or both. For example, Ling Zhi Cao (Cordyceps) can be substituted with an inactive form of the herb. If an extract is first made with water, the herb will be tasteless when dried and re-used/recycled. On the other hand, the genuine Ling Zhi tastes bitter, but few consumers would know the difference, especially if the herb is mixed in a prescription and boiled together with other herbs. The pharmacists themselves may not be aware, as some may trust their suppliers implicitly, and do not conduct regular testing.\n(6) Animal-based \"herbs\" are prone to substitution or adulteration, including Xiong Dan (bear bile / gall bladder) which looks very much like Niu Dan (bovine bile /gall bladder) when the gall bladder is dried, although Niu Dan is far less bitter in taste. Some are simply unavailable because they are banned in many countries. These include tiger parts, such as Hu Gu (tiger bone) which is substituted by bobcat bone, and Chuan San Jia (scales of the pangolin) which has no animal-based substitute. Niu Huang (bovine gallstone) is unavailable in many Western countries and Singapore because of its potential impact on pregnant women, although Niu Huang Pills with about 2% of Niu Huang are available in many Asian countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Qi","surface_form":"Qi","offset":1622},{"uri":"Yang","surface_form":"Yang","offset":1692},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"Blood","offset":1957},{"uri":"Yin","surface_form":"Yin","offset":2164},{"uri":"Ma_huang","surface_form":"ma huang","offset":4248},{"uri":"Musk_deer","surface_form":"Moschus","offset":6492},{"uri":"Calculus_Bovis","surface_form":"calculus Bovis","offset":6513}]}
