{"id":15206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland","text":"Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 - June 24, 1908) was the 22nd (1885\u20131889) and also the 24th (1893\u20131897) President of the United States. He was the only president to serve a second term that did not begin as soon as the first had ended. Cleveland was the first Democrat elected as President after the Civil War.\nHe was known for his honesty, integrity, and having a firm stance against corruption. He believed in small government (he wanted the government to tax less and spend less). He used the presidential veto power over 500 times, far more than most other presidents, to reject bills he disagreed with. He did not want the United States to get its military involved in Latin America.\nCleveland was born on March 18, 1837 in Caldwell, New Jersey. He was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland studied at New York Institute for the Blind. He was married to Frances Folsom, who was over 20 years younger. In fact, many people expected Cleveland to marry her mother Emma. He was the first President to marry in the White House. They had one child, Ruth Cleveland, during his presidency.\nDuring his second term, he had an emergency surgery for jaw cancer on a boat in the middle of a river to avoid publicity. Cleveland died on June 24, 1908 from a heart attack in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 71.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":113},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":269},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":309},{"uri":"Veto","surface_form":"veto","offset":518},{"uri":"Caldwell%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Caldwell, New Jersey","offset":738},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cleveland, Ohio","offset":777},{"uri":"New_York_Institute_for_the_Blind","surface_form":"New York Institute for the Blind","offset":815},{"uri":"Frances_Folsom_Cleveland_Preston","surface_form":"Frances Folsom","offset":867},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":1023},{"uri":"Jaw_cancer","surface_form":"jaw cancer","offset":1151},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1256},{"uri":"Princeton%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Princeton, New Jersey","offset":1272}]}
