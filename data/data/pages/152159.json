It is made up of two ancient (very old) French towns: Camptort and Ogenne. They were combined (made into one) on May 12, 1841.\nAccording to Pierre de Marca, a famous historian, the name \"Ogenne\" can be traced back to the 11th century. It was first called \"Ogene\" in the 11th century, then \"Oiena\" in the 13th century. In around 1350 it was called \"Sent-Jacme d'Ojenne\", and in 1385 it was called \"Oyene.\" Finally in 1548 it was called \"Ogena\".\nThe name \"Camptort\" comes from the 13th century. It was first called \"Campus tortus\" in 1235. It was called some other names: \"Cam-tort\" (1385), \"Quamptort\" (1540), \"Sanctus Stephanus de Camptort\" (1674), \"Cantor\" (1755), and \"Camptor\" (1793.)\nTwo streams run through the town. One stream is the Saley, a tributary of the Gave d'Oloron (a river). The other stream is the La\u00E0, a tributary of the Gave de Pau (also a river.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Commune_in_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":21},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Atlantiques","offset":36},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"d\u00E9partement","offset":58},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":99},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":128},{"uri":"Camptort","surface_form":"Camptort","offset":161},{"uri":"Ogenne","surface_form":"Ogenne","offset":174},{"uri":"Pierre_de_Marca","surface_form":"Pierre de Marca","offset":247},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":273},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":328},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":799},{"uri":"Saley","surface_form":"Saley","offset":847},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":856},{"uri":"Gave_d%27Oloron","surface_form":"Gave d'Oloron","offset":873},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":890},{"uri":"La%C3%A0","surface_form":"La\u00E0","offset":922},{"uri":"Gave_de_Pau","surface_form":"Gave de Pau","offset":946}]}
