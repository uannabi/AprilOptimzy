{"id":15218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean","text":"The Caribbean or Caribbean Area (Dutch: \"Cariben\" or \"Caraiben\", French: \"Cara\u00EFbe\" or more commonly \"Antilles\"; Spanish: \"Caribe\") is a region of the Americas. It includes the Caribbean Sea, its islands (more than 7,000 islands, small islands and cays, most of them surrounding the sea), and the coastal islands of north South America and east Central America.\nGeography.\nThe Caribbean is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to its east and north, the coast of South America to its south, the coast of Central America to its southwest, and by the Gulf of Mexico to its northwest.\nThe West Indies is the name for the group of the islands of the Bahamas and the \"Antilles\". The Antilles are divided into two groups: the larger \"Greater Antilles\", on the north limit of the Caribbean Sea, and the \"Lesser Antilles\", on the east and south.\nThe Caribbean islands have many different types of land. Because of this, the islands have many different kinds of plants and animals, even uncommon ones.\nFamous islands in the Caribbean include Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. The countries of Dominican Republic, and Haiti are on Hispaniola.\nThere is also a lot of white sandy beaches and hot sun there.\nName.\nThe name Caribbean comes from \"Carib\", indigenous people living in the Lesser Antilles and north South America when the Europeans came to the Americas.\nHistory.\nThe 18th century saw many countries trying to colonize the islands. Because of this, Caribbean culture is very similar to those of Africa, India, and many countries in Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":33},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":65},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":112},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":136},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":146},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":176},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":195},{"uri":"Cay","surface_form":"cay","offset":247},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":321},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":344},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":405},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":447},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":456},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":497},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":542},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":639},{"uri":"Greater_Antilles","surface_form":"Greater Antilles","offset":721},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":790},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"many different types of land","offset":858},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"different kinds","offset":927},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":946},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":957},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":1026},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":1032},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":1041},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":1057},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":1086},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":1110},{"uri":"Carib","surface_form":"Carib","offset":1234},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":1242},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":1274},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1300},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1323},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":1368},{"uri":"Colonize","surface_form":"colonize","offset":1410},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1459},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1495},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1503},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1532}]}
