{"id":15220,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea","text":"The Caribbean Sea is a tropical sea in the center of the Caribbean area. The body of water is part of the Atlantic Ocean. The sea is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Sea has many islands, which are popular among North American tourists because of their tropical climate. The Caribbean Sea is famous around the world as a tourist destination.\nHistory.\nChristopher Columbus came across a group of islands in the Caribbean region. When he did so, he thought he had reached another part of the world. Because of this, he named the islands the \u2018West Indies\u2019. However, later it was realized that he found an entire region. It still had its natural resources. The name \u2018Caribbean\u2019 was later given to it by the Amerindian tribe, the Caribs. That is how it got its name: the Caribbean Sea.\nThis entire region covers an area of 1,063,000 sq. miles. It covers from Mexico to the boundaries of South America.\nThis sea is just as deep as it is wide. Its deepest point is believed to be even lower than 25,220 ft, 7,686 m. That makes this point one of the lowest points on the surface of the earth, and the Caribbean Sea one of the deepest seas in the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropical","offset":23},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":32},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":57},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":85},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":106},{"uri":"Southeast","surface_form":"southeast","offset":133},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":150},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":365},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":409},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":434},{"uri":"Natural_resource","surface_form":"natural resource","offset":648},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":868},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":896}]}
