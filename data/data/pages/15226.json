{"id":15226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire","text":"An empire is a set of lands or regions that are ruled by an emperor. Usually the emperor will have governors, viceroys or client kings who each rule one land or region. An empire will usually also have many different cultures.\nWell-known empires include the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire.\nToday, the only monarch to use the title \"emperor\" is the Emperor of Japan, although his power is mostly ceremonial and the \"de facto\" head of government is the Prime-Minister of Japan.\nThe Mongol Empire was the largest land empire in history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":60},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":99},{"uri":"Viceroy","surface_form":"viceroy","offset":110},{"uri":"Client_state","surface_form":"client kings","offset":122},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":217},{"uri":"Persian_Empire","surface_form":"Persian Empire","offset":258},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":278},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":296},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":316},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":340},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Emperor of Japan","offset":414},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremonial","offset":461},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":481},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":491},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime-Minister","offset":517},{"uri":"Mongol_Empire","surface_form":"Mongol Empire","offset":546}]}
