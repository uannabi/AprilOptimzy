{"id":15229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventor","text":"An inventor is a person who makes new inventions, devices that perform some kind of function. The devices are mostly electrical or mechanical. Someone that invents new ideas or methods on how to do things may also be called an inventor. Inventors can receive a patent.\nMany inventors make small changes to old inventions. For example, people have invented new ways to make clocks over history. Early clocks were sundials, later clocks used water, and pendulums. Modern clocks are often electronic. Other machines such as vehicles are made of many inventions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invention","offset":38},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electrical","offset":117},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":131},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":168},{"uri":"Method","surface_form":"method","offset":177},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":261},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invention","offset":310},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clock","offset":373},{"uri":"Sundial","surface_form":"sundial","offset":412},{"uri":"Pendulum","surface_form":"pendulum","offset":451},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":521}]}
