{"id":15231,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology","text":"Meteorology is the science that focuses on the Earth's atmosphere. People who study meteorology are called meteorologists. Meteorologists record air pressure, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, weather patterns, and other information. Meteorologists use this data to understand weather and to predict it. Meteorology is a major branch of earth science. Meteorologists study the causes of particular weather conditions using information obtained from the land, sea and upper atmosphere.\nIn addition to forecasting, meteorologists study the impact of weather on the environment and conduct research into weather patterns, climate change and models of weather prediction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":55},{"uri":"Air_pressure","surface_form":"air pressure","offset":145},{"uri":"Wind_speed","surface_form":"wind speed","offset":159},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":185},{"uri":"Humidity","surface_form":"humidity","offset":198},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":208},{"uri":"Earth_science","surface_form":"earth science","offset":352},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":468},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":474},{"uri":"Atmosphere_of_Earth","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":488}]}
