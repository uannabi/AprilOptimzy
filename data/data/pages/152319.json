{"id":152319,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_succession_to_the_British_throne","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died.\nAt present the first in line is Charles, Prince of Wales, followed by his eldest son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and then Prince William's son, Prince George of Cambridge.\nTraditionally, males came before females in the line of succession. However, the law changed on 26 March 2015, so at present, for people born after 28 October 2011 the succession is decided only by age: older children come before younger children. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession.\nExcluded from the line of succession are Catholics and illegitimate children.\nLine of succession.\nNo official, complete version of the line of succession is currently maintained. Any person's actual position in the line of succession may change when people are born or when they die. This list shows only those people who are descended from the sons of George V.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales","surface_form":"Charles, Prince of Wales","offset":202},{"uri":"Prince_William%2C_Duke_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"Prince William, Duke of Cambridge","offset":256},{"uri":"Catholics","surface_form":"Catholics","offset":797},{"uri":"George_V","surface_form":"George V","offset":1109}]}
