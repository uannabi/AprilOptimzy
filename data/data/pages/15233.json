There are other slightly different versions: this is the most usual one.\nOut of those structures only the Great Pyramid still exists in the 21st century. Most of the wonders were built by the Greeks. Earlier versions listed the Walls of Babylon and the Palace of Cyrus the Great.\nSeven wonders of the modern world.\nThis version was decided by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\nSeven natural wonders of the world.\nNew7Wonders of the World was an idea to choose new wonders of the world from a selection of 200 existing monuments. The mission began in 2001 and ended in 2007 with the announcement of the winners. The popularity poll was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New7Wonders Foundation in Z\u00FCrich, Switzerland.
