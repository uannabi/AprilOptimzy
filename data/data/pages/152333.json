{"id":152333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugello_region","text":"Mugello is a landscape north of Florence in northern Italy. It is separated by the Santerno River's valley by the Futa Pass.\nIn ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (the Magelli tribe, whence the name), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left sparse traces, as the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to numerous castles, and was later acquired by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built there partician villas, like those of the Medici in Cafaggiolo and the Trebbio. Recent is the creation of the artificial Lake of Bilancino on the Sieve (river) river.\nThe area gave name to the Mugello Circuit (Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello) which is a race track that hosts an annual Moto GP event.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":32},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":53},{"uri":"Santerno","surface_form":"Santerno","offset":83},{"uri":"Futa_Pass","surface_form":"Futa Pass","offset":114},{"uri":"Ligurians","surface_form":"Ligurians","offset":195},{"uri":"Etruscan_civilization","surface_form":"Etruscan","offset":247},{"uri":"Gauls","surface_form":"Gauls","offset":265},{"uri":"Republic_of_Florence","surface_form":"Republic of Florence","offset":445},{"uri":"House_of_Medici","surface_form":"Medici","offset":544},{"uri":"Villa_Medicea_di_Cafaggiolo","surface_form":"Cafaggiolo","offset":554},{"uri":"Villa_Medicea_del_Trebbio","surface_form":"the Trebbio","offset":569},{"uri":"Sieve_(river)","surface_form":"Sieve (river)","offset":648},{"uri":"Mugello_Circuit","surface_form":"Mugello Circuit","offset":695},{"uri":"Autodromo_Internazionale_del_Mugello","surface_form":"Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello","offset":712},{"uri":"Moto_GP","surface_form":"Moto GP","offset":793}]}
