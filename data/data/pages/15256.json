{"id":15256,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Carp (plural: carp or carpes) is a fish that lives in fresh water, such as rivers and lakes. In Europe and Asia carp are loved as a fishing and eating fish. However, carp are a really big problem in countries such as the U.S. and Australia. They make the water dirty by causing the mud at the bottom to move and in these countries people hate them.\nSome popular ornamental fishes like the koi and goldfish are also carp.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":52},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":71},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":92},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":103},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":113},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":124},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":149},{"uri":"Ornament","surface_form":"ornament","offset":379},{"uri":"Koi","surface_form":"koi","offset":406},{"uri":"Goldfish","surface_form":"goldfish","offset":414}]}
