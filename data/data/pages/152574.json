{"id":152574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence","text":"A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource. When there are several such caches for the same resource, as shown in the picture, this can lead to problems. Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data, and that the data in the caches makes sense (called \"data integrity\"). Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence.\nThere may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource, as data in the cache may no longer make sense, or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others. A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system. As can be seen in the figure, if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block, the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory,without knowing. Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory.\nDefinition.\nThese conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously. However, this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture. A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made. The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors.\nCache coherence mechanisms.\nDistributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.\nThe two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory-based. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping is not scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system. As the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (>64 processors) use this type of cache coherence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cache","surface_form":"cache","offset":2},{"uri":"Memory_coherence","surface_form":"memory coherence","offset":422},{"uri":"CPU","surface_form":"CPU","offset":679},{"uri":"Multiprocessing","surface_form":"multiprocessing","offset":689},{"uri":"Distributed_shared_memory","surface_form":"Distributed shared memory","offset":1570}]}
