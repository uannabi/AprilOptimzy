{"id":15271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring","text":"A herring is a small teleost fish of the genus \"Cluptea\". Best-known of this family is probably the Atlantic Herring. There are 15 different species of herring. When herrings migrate in the water they usually do this in large numbers; this is then called a \"school\" of herring. Like other fish, they do this for protection: see shoaling and schooling.\nHerrings can be eaten. They are often smoked or pickled.\nA red herring is used to describe a plot device in mystery fiction that leads the reader to a wrong solution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Teleost","surface_form":"teleost","offset":21},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":29},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":41},{"uri":"Atlantic_Herring","surface_form":"Atlantic Herring","offset":100},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":141},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migrate","offset":175},{"uri":"Shoaling_and_schooling","surface_form":"shoaling and schooling","offset":328},{"uri":"Smoking","surface_form":"smoke","offset":390},{"uri":"Pickle","surface_form":"pickle","offset":400},{"uri":"Trope","surface_form":"plot device","offset":445}]}
