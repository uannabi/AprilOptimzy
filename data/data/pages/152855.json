He won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, with Paul Ehrlich, for finding out how immunity fights disease.\nMechnikov was a protozoologist who became better known for the discovery of macrophages in 1882. He discovered how they dealt with germs by phagocytosis. Macrophages are found in virtually all tissues, and patrol for potential pathogens by amoeboid movement.\nHe is also credited with coining the term gerontology in 1903, for the emerging study of ageing and longevity.\nHe was born in Kharkov (now Kharkiv), Russian Empire (now Ukraine)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":57},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":67},{"uri":"Zoologist","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":75},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":97},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":153},{"uri":"Paul_Ehrlich","surface_form":"Paul Ehrlich","offset":197},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immunity","offset":231},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":247},{"uri":"Macrophage","surface_form":"macrophage","offset":332},{"uri":"Phagocytosis","surface_form":"phagocytosis","offset":396},{"uri":"Tissue_(biology)","surface_form":"tissues","offset":449},{"uri":"Pathogens","surface_form":"pathogens","offset":483},{"uri":"Amoeboid_movement","surface_form":"amoeboid movement","offset":496},{"uri":"Gerontology","surface_form":"gerontology","offset":557},{"uri":"Kharkiv","surface_form":"Kharkiv","offset":654},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":664},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":684}]}
