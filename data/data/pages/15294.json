Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert, and a lengthy coastline along the\u00A0Atlantic Ocean and\u00A0Mediterranean Sea.\nMorocco has a population of over 33.8\u00A0million and an area of 446,550\u00A0km2(172,410\u00A0sq\u00A0mi). Its capital is\u00A0Rabat, and the largest city is\u00A0Casablanca. Other major cities include\u00A0Marrakesh,\u00A0Tangier,\u00A0Tetouan,\u00A0Sal\u00E9,\u00A0Fes,\u00A0Agadir,\u00A0Meknes,\u00A0Oujda,\u00A0Kenitra, and\u00A0Nador. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours. Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by\u00A0Idris I\u00A0in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the\u00A0Almoravid\u00A0and\u00A0Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of\u00A0Iberia\u00A0and Northwestern Africa.\u00A0Marinid\u00A0and\u00A0Saadi<nowiki/>dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North African country to avoid\u00A0Ottoman\u00A0occupation. The\u00A0Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1666. In 1912 Morocco was divided into\u00A0French\u00A0and\u00A0Spanish protectorates, with an\u00A0international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of\u00A0Arab,\u00A0indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.\nMorocco claims the\u00A0non-self-governing territory\u00A0of\u00A0Western Sahara\u00A0as its\u00A0Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991.\u00A0Peace processes\u00A0have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.\nMorocco is a\u00A0constitutional monarchy\u00A0with an elected parliament. The\u00A0King of Morocco\u00A0holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the\u00A0military, foreign policy and religious affairs.\u00A0Executive power\u00A0is exercised by the\u00A0government, while\u00A0legislative power\u00A0is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the\u00A0Assembly of Representatives\u00A0and the\u00A0Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called\u00A0dahirs\u00A0which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the\u00A0Prime Minister\u00A0and the president of the Constitutional court.\nMorocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are\u00A0Arabic\u00A0and\u00A0Tamazight. The\u00A0Moroccan dialect, referred to as\u00A0\"Darija\", and\u00A0French\u00A0are also widely spoken. Morocco is a member of the\u00A0Arab League, the\u00A0Union for the Mediterranean, and the\u00A0African Union. It has the\u00A0fifth largest economy of Africa.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nThe Berber Roman client King\u00A0Ptolemy of Mauretania.\nThe area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since\u00A0Paleolithic times, sometime between 190,000 and 90,000\u00A0BC.\u00A0During the\u00A0Upper Paleolithic, the\u00A0Maghreb\u00A0was more fertile than it is today, resembling a\u00A0savanna\u00A0more than today's arid landscape.\u00A0Twenty-two thousand years ago, the\u00A0Aterian\u00A0was succeeded by the\u00A0Iberomaurusian\u00A0culture, which shared similarities with Iberian cultures. Skeletal similarities have been suggested between the\u00A0Iberomaurusian\u00A0\"Mechta-Afalou\" burials and European\u00A0Cro-Magnon\u00A0remains. The Iberomaurusian was succeeded by the\u00A0Beaker culture\u00A0in Morocco.\nMitochondrial DNA\u00A0studies have discovered a close link between\u00A0Berbers\u00A0and the\u00A0Saami\u00A0of Scandinavia. This supports theories that the\u00A0Franco-Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe\u00A0was the source of late-glacial expansions of hunter-gatherers who repopulated northern Europe after the last\u00A0ice age.\nNorth Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging\u00A0Mediterranean\u00A0world by the\u00A0Phoenicians, who established trading colonies and settlements in the early Classical period. Substantial Phoenician settlements were at\u00A0Chellah,\u00A0Lixus\u00A0and\u00A0Mogador.Mogador was a Phoenician colony as early as the early 6th century BC.[\"page\u00A0needed\"]\nAncient Roman ruins of\u00A0Volubilis.\nMorocco later became a realm of the North African civilisation of\u00A0ancient Carthage\u00A0as part of its empire. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the\u00A0Berber kingdom of Mauretania\u00A0under king\u00A0Baga.\u00A0This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the present state of\u00A0Mauritania) dates at least to 225\u00A0BC.\nMauretania\u00A0became a\u00A0client\u00A0kingdom of the\u00A0Roman Empire\u00A0in 33 BC. Emperor\u00A0Claudius\u00A0annexed Mauretania directly as a\u00A0Roman province\u00A0in 44 AD, under an imperial\u00A0governor\u00A0(either a\"procurator Augusti\", or a\u00A0\"legatus Augusti pro praetore\").\nDuring the\u00A0crisis of the 3rd century, parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berber tribes. Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities (such as\u00A0Septum (Ceuta)\u00A0in\u00A0Mauretania Tingitana\u00A0and\u00A0Cherchell\u00A0in\u00A0Mauretania Caesariensis) by the late 3rd century.\nEarly Islamic era.\nThe\u00A0Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, that started in the middle of the 7th century, was\u00A0achieved\u00A0early into the following century. It brought both the Arabic language and\u00A0Islam\u00A0to the area. Although part of the larger\u00A0Islamic Empire, Morocco was initially organized as a subsidiary province of\u00A0Ifriqiya, with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in\u00A0Kairouan.\nThe indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their\u00A0customary laws. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration.\u00A0The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the\u00A0Kingdom of Nekor, an emirate in the\u00A0Rif Mountains. It was founded by\u00A0Salih I ibn Mansur\u00A0in 710, as a client state to the\u00A0Rashidun Caliphate. After the outbreak of the\u00A0Berber Revolt\u00A0in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the\u00A0Miknasa\u00A0of\u00A0Sijilmasa\u00A0and the\u00A0Barghawata.\nAccording to medieval legend,\u00A0Idris ibn Abdallah\u00A0had fled to Morocco after the Abbasids massacre of his tribe in Iraq. He convinced the\u00A0Awraba\u00A0Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs in\u00A0Baghdad\u00A0and he founded the\u00A0Idrisid dynasty\u00A0in 788. The Idrisids established\u00A0Fes\u00A0as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major\u00A0regional power. The Idrissids were ousted in 927 by the\u00A0Fatimid Caliphate\u00A0and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the\u00A0Maghrawa\u00A0of Sijilmasa in 980.\nBerber dynasties.\nThe\u00A0Almohad\u00A0realm at its greatest extent, c. 1212\nFrom the 11th century onwards, a series of powerful Berber\u00A0dynasties arose. Under the\u00A0Almoravid dynasty\u00A0\u00A0and the\u00A0Almohad dynasty, Morocco dominated the Maghreb, much of present-day Spain and Portugal, and the western Mediterranean region. From the 13th century onwards the country saw a massive migration of\u00A0Banu Hilal\u00A0Arab tribes. In the 13th and 14th centuries the\u00A0Merinids\u00A0held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the\u00A0Almohads\u00A0by military campaigns in Algeria and Spain. They were followed by the\u00A0Wattasids. In the 15th century, the\u00A0Reconquista\u00A0ended Muslim rule in central and southern\u00A0Spain\u00A0and many\u00A0Muslims\u00A0and\u00A0Jews\u00A0fled to Morocco.\nPortuguese\u00A0efforts to control the Atlantic sea trade in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco even though they managed to control some possessions on the Moroccan coast but not venturing further afield inland.\nOn another note and according to Elizabeth Allo Isichei, \"In 1520, there was a\u00A0famine\u00A0in Morocco so terrible that for a long time other events were dated by it. It has been suggested that the population of Morocco fell from 5 to under 3\u00A0million between the early sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.\"\nSharifian dynasties.\nFormer Portuguese\u00A0fortress of Mazagan\u00A0in\u00A0El Jadida\nIn 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the\u00A0Islamic prophet,\u00A0Muhammad: first the\u00A0Saadi dynasty\u00A0who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the\u00A0Alaouite Dynasty, who remained in power since the 17th century.\nUnder the Saadi Dynasty, the country repulsed\u00A0Ottoman<nowiki/>incursions and a\u00A0Portuguese\u00A0invasion at the\u00A0battle of Ksar el Kebir\u00A0in 1578. The reign of\u00A0Ahmad al-Mansur\u00A0brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a large expedition to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the\u00A0Songhay Empire<nowiki/>in 1591. However, managing the territories across the\u00A0Sahara\u00A0proved too difficult. After the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.\nIn 1666, Morocco was reunited by the\u00A0Alaouite Dynasty, who have been the ruling house of Morocco ever since. Morocco was facing aggression from\u00A0Spain\u00A0and the Ottoman Empire allies pressing westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy. Against the opposition of local tribes\u00A0Ismail Ibn Sharif\u00A0(1672\u20131727) began to create a unified state.With his Jaysh d'Ahl al-Rif (the\u00A0Riffian\u00A0Army) he seized\u00A0Tangier\u00A0from the\u00A0English\u00A0in 1684 and drove the\u00A0Spanish\u00A0from\u00A0Larache\u00A0in 1689.\nMorocco was the first nation to recognise the fledgling United States as an independent nation in 1777.\u00A0In the beginning of the\u00A0American Revolution, American merchant ships in the\u00A0Atlantic Ocean\u00A0were subject to attack by the\u00A0Barbary pirates. On December 20 1777, Morocco's Sultan\u00A0Mohammed III\u00A0declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage. The\u00A0Moroccan\u2013American Treaty of Friendship, signed in 1786, stands as the U.S's oldest non-broken friendship\u00A0treaty.\nFrench and Spanish protectorates.\nDeath of\u00A0Spanish\u00A0general\u00A0Margallo<nowiki/>during the\u00A0Melilla War.\u00A0Le Petit Journal, November 13 1893.\nMain articles:\u00A0French Morocco\u00A0and\u00A0Spanish Protectorate in Morocco\nAs Europe industrialised, North Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory, but also because of the strategic position of Morocco on two oceans.\u00A0In 1860, a dispute over Spain's Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war. Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement. In 1884, Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco.\nIn 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the\u00A0United Kingdom\u00A0of France's\u00A0sphere of influence\u00A0provoked a strong reaction from the\u00A0German Empire; and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the\u00A0Algeciras Conference\u00A0in 1906. The\u00A0Agadir Crisis\u00A0of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912\u00A0Treaty of Fez<nowiki/>made Morocco a\u00A0protectorate\u00A0of France, and triggered the\u00A01912 Fez riots.\u00A0Spain continued to operate its coastal protectorate. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of\u00A0protecting power\u00A0over the northern and southern\u00A0Saharan\u00A0zones.\nTens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco. Some bought up large amounts of the rich agricultural land, others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco a control which was also made necessary by the continuous wars among Moroccan tribes, part of which had taken sides with the French since the beginning of the conquest. Governor general, Marshall\u00A0Hubert Lyautey, sincerely admired Moroccan culture and succeeded in imposing a joint Moroccan-French administration, while creating a modern school system. Several divisions of Moroccan soldiers (Goumiers\u00A0or regular troops and officers) served in the\u00A0French army\u00A0in both\u00A0World War I\u00A0and\u00A0World War II, and in the Spanish\u00A0Nationalist Army\u00A0in the\u00A0Spanish Civil War\u00A0and after (\"Regulares\").\u00A0The institution of\u00A0slavery\u00A0was abolished in 1925.\nTangier's population included 40,000 Muslims, 31,000 Europeans and 15,000 Jews.\nBetween 1921 and 1926, a\u00A0Berber uprising\u00A0in the Rif Mountains, led by\u00A0Abd el-Krim, led to the establishment of the Republic of the Rif. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by French and Spanish troops.\nIn 1943, the\u00A0Istiqlal Party\u00A0(Independence Party) was founded to press for independence, with discreet US support. That party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.\nFrance's exile of\u00A0Sultan Mohammed V\u00A0in 1953 to\u00A0Madagascar\u00A0and his replacement by the unpopular\u00A0Mohammed Ben Aarafa\u00A0sparked active opposition to the French and Spanish protectorates. The most notable violence occurred in\u00A0Oujda\u00A0where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets. France allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.\u00A0In March 1956 the French protectorate was ended and Morocco regained its independence from France as the \"Kingdom of Morocco\". A month later Spain ceded most of its protectorate in Northern Morocco to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves (Ceuta\u00A0and\u00A0Melilla) on the Mediterranean coast. Sultan Mohammed became king in 1957.\nPost-independence.\nThe\u00A0Mausoleum of Mohammed V\u00A0in Rabat.\nUpon the death of Mohammed V,\u00A0Hassan II\u00A0became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961. Morocco held its first\u00A0general elections in 1963. However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971, there was a failed attempt to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.\nThe Spanish\u00A0enclave\u00A0of\u00A0Ifni\u00A0in the south was returned to Morocco in 1969. The\u00A0Polisario movement\u00A0was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the Spanish Sahara. On 6 November 1975 King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the Spanish Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the \"Green March\".\u00A0A month later, Spain agreed to leave the Spanish Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by Algeria. Moroccan forces occupied the territory.\nMoroccan and Algerian troops soon clashed in Western Sahara. Morocco and Mauritania divided up Western Sahara. Fighting between the Moroccan military and Polisario forces continued for many years. The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on Morocco. In 1983, Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis. In 1984, Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the\u00A0SADR's admission to the body. Polisario claimed to have killed more than 5,000 Moroccan soldiers between 1982 and 1985.\nAlgerian authorities have estimated the number of\u00A0Sahrawi refugees\u00A0in Algeria to be 165,000.\u00A0Diplomatic relations with Algeria were restored in 1988. In 1991, a UN-monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara, but the territory's status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported. The following decade saw much wrangling over a proposed referendum on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken.\nPolitical reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997 and Morocco's first opposition-led government came to power in 1998.\nProtestors in\u00A0Casablanca\u00A0demand that authorities honor their promises of political reform.\nKing Hassan II died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son,\u00A0Mohammed VI. He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation.\nMohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in 2002. Morocco unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in 2007. The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal. Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital\u00A0El Aai\u00FAn.\nIn 2002, Morocco and Spain agreed to a US-brokered resolution over the disputed island of Perejil. Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag. There were renewed tensions in 2005 as hundreds of African migrants tried to storm the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco deported hundreds of the illegal migrants. In 2006 the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year, Spanish King\u00A0Juan Carlos I\u00A0visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.\nDuring the\u00A02011\u201312 Moroccan protests, thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the\u00A0Arab Spring\u00A0protests. Despite the reforms made by Mohamed VI demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.\nPolitics.\nMorocco is a constitutional monarchy. The political powers are shared between the king Muhammad VI (the sixth) and the Head of the Government. The King is the head of state (Person in charge of the country) and the most important person.\nThe people of Morocco vote for Members of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them. The Council of Ministers defines what must be done. He makes all the important decisions. Today, the Head of Government is Abdelilah Benkirane.\nSince the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The\u00A0Assembly of Representatives of Morocco\u00A0(\"Majlis an-Nuww\u00E2b/Assembl\u00E9e des R\u00E9presentants\") has 325 members elected for a five-year term, 295 elected in multi-seat\u00A0constituencies\u00A0and 30 in national lists consisting only of women. The\u00A0Assembly of Councillors(\"Majlis al-Mustasharin\") has 270 members, elected for a nine-year term, elected by local councils (162 seats), professional chambers (91 seats) and wage-earners (27 seats).\nThe Parliament's powers, though still relatively limited, were expanded under the 1992 and 1996 and even further in the 2011 constitutional revisions and include\u00A0budgetary\u00A0matters, approving\u00A0bills, questioning ministers, and establishing ad hoc commissions of inquiry to investigate the government's actions. The lower chamber of Parliament may dissolve the government through a\u00A0vote of no confidence.\nThe latest parliamentary elections were held on\u00A0November 25, 2011, and were considered by some neutral observers to be mostly free and fair. Voter turnout in these elections was estimated to be 43% of registered voters.\nGeography.\nMorocco is next to the countries of Algeria to its east and Mauritania to its south. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the north of Morocco, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\nMorocco has a diverse geography from fertile plains, to forests, cold mountains, dry lands, and deserts. Most people live in areas close to the coast, or in fertile farms. Morocco has an area of 446,550\u00A0km\u00B2. Morocco also controls most of the Western Sahara which is 266.000\u00A0km\u00B2 big.Morocco has a coast by the\u00A0Atlantic Ocean\u00A0that reaches past the\u00A0Strait of Gibraltar\u00A0into the\u00A0Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by\u00A0Spain\u00A0to the north (a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish-controlled\u00A0exclaves,\u00A0Ceuta,\u00A0Melilla, and\u00A0Pe\u00F1\u00F3n de V\u00E9lez de la Gomera),\u00A0Algeria\u00A0to the east, and\u00A0Western Sahara\u00A0to the south. Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its\u00A0\"de facto\"\u00A0southern boundary is with\u00A0Mauritania.\nThe internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes\u00A027\u00B0\u00A0and 36\u00B0N, and longitudes 1\u00B0 and\u00A014\u00B0W. Adding Western Sahara, Morocco lies mostly between\u00A021\u00B0\u00A0and\u00A036\u00B0N, and\u00A01\u00B0\u00A0and\u00A017\u00B0W\u00A0(the\u00A0Ras Nouadhibou\u00A0peninsula is slightly south of 21\u00B0 and west of 17\u00B0).\nThe geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a\u00A0Northern African\u00A0country, bordering the\u00A0North Atlantic Ocean\u00A0and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with\u00A0Spain\u00A0and\u00A0France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.\nA large part of Morocco is mountainous. The\u00A0Atlas Mountains\u00A0are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The\u00A0Rif Mountains\u00A0are in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the\u00A0Berber people. At 446,550\u00A0km2(172,414\u00A0sq\u00A0mi), Morocco is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world (after\u00A0Uzbekistan). Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.\nSpanish territory in North Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast:\u00A0Ceuta,\u00A0Melilla,\u00A0Pe\u00F1\u00F3n de V\u00E9lez de la Gomera,\u00A0Pe\u00F1\u00F3n de Alhucemas, the\u00A0Chafarinas\u00A0islands, and the disputed islet\u00A0Perejil. Off the Atlantic coast the\u00A0Canary Islands\u00A0belong to Spain, whereas\u00A0Madeira\u00A0to the north is\u00A0Portuguese. To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded\u00A0transit passage\u00A0between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nThe Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country, from the northeast to the south west. Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the\u00A0Sahara Desert\u00A0and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, while to the south lies the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was annexed by Morocco in 1975 (see\u00A0Green March).\u00A0Morocco claims that the Western Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its\u00A0Southern Provinces.\nMorocco's capital city is\u00A0Rabat; its largest city is its main port,\u00A0Casablanca. Other cities include\u00A0Agadir,\u00A0Essaouira,\u00A0Fes,\u00A0Marrakesh,\u00A0Meknes,\u00A0Mohammedia,\u00A0Oujda,\u00A0Ouarzazat,\u00A0Safi,\u00A0Sal\u00E9,\u00A0Tangier\u00A0and\u00A0T\u00E9touan.[Br.-Bl. \u201CVegetatio.\u201D\u00A0\"Vegetatio\", vol. 11, no. 5/6, 1963, pp.\u00A0405\u2013405., www.jstor.org/stable/20034938.]\nClimate.\nThe country's\u00A0Mediterranean\u00A0climate is similar to that of southern\u00A0California, with lush forests in the northern and central mountain ranges of the country, giving way to dryer conditions and inland deserts further southeast. The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate temperatures even in summer, owing to the effect of the cold\u00A0Canary Current\u00A0off its\u00A0Atlantic\u00A0coast.\nIn the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree\u00A0endemic<nowiki/>to Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.\nSoutheast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeastern-most portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the\u00A0Sahara Desert, where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush\u00A0oases.\nIn contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal\u00A0plains\u00A0are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes from Morocco a country of contrasts.\u00A0Forested areas\u00A0cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.\nLandscape of the\u00A0Erg Chebbi\nAtlas Mountains\n\"Oceanic:\"\u00A0Determined by the cooler summers, where highs rarely go above 27\u00A0\u00B0C (80.6\u00A0\u00B0F) and in terms of Essaouira region are almost always around 21\u00A0\u00B0C (69.8\u00A0\u00B0F). The medium daily temperatures can get as low as 19\u00A0\u00B0C (66.2\u00A0\u00B0F), while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700\u00A0mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are\u00A0Rabat,\u00A0Casablanca,\u00A0K\u00E9nitra,\u00A0Sal\u00E9\u00A0and\u00A0Essaouira.\n\"Continental:\"\u00A0Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as 40\u00A0\u00B0C (104.0\u00A0\u00B0F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32\u00A0\u00B0C (89.6\u00A0\u00B0F) and 36\u00A0\u00B0C (96.8\u00A0\u00B0F). However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below 20\u00A0\u00B0C (68.0\u00A0\u00B0F), and sometimes as low as 10\u00A0\u00B0C (50.0\u00A0\u00B0F) in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also snow can fall occasionally. F\u00E8s for example registered 8\u00A0\u00B0C (17.6\u00A0\u00B0F) in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900\u00A0mm. Notable cities are\u00A0F\u00E8s,\u00A0Mekn\u00E8s,\u00A0Chefchaouen,\u00A0Beni-Mellal\u00A0and\u00A0Taza.\nSouth of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.\nNote:\u00A0Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when\u00A0sirocco\u00A0blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena don't last for more than 2 to 5 days on average.\nCountries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are\u00A0California(USA),\u00A0Portugal,\u00A0Spain\u00A0and\u00A0Algeria.\nAnnual rainfall in Morocco is different according to regions. The northwestern parts of the country receive between 500\u00A0mm and 1200\u00A0mm, while the northeastern parts receive between 350 and 600\u00A0mm. North Central Morocco receives between 700\u00A0mm and up to 3500\u00A0mm. The area from Casablanca to Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, receives between 300\u00A0mm and 500\u00A0mm. The regions from Essaouira to Agadir receive between 250\u00A0mm and 400\u00A0mm. Marrakesh region in the central south receives only 250\u00A0mm a year. The southeastern regions, basically the driest areas, receive between 100\u00A0mm and 200\u00A0mm only, and consist basically of arid and desert lands.\nBotanically speaking, Morocco enjoys a great variety of vegetation, from lush large forests of conifer and oak trees typical of the western Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal), to shrubs and acacias further south. This is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country.\nMorocco's weather is one of the most pristine in terms of the four-season experience. Most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet, snowy and humid with mild, cool to cold temperatures, while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers blooming in spring and falling leaves in autumn. This type of weather has affected the Moroccan culture and behaviour and played a part in the social interaction of the population, like many other countries that fall into this type of climate zone.presented in the\u00A0ISO 3166-1 alpha-2\u00A0geographical encoding standard by the symbol\u00A0\"MA\".\u00A0This code was used as the basis for Morocco's internet domain,\u00A0ma.\nThe capital of Morocco is Rabat. About 1.2 million people live in Rabat. The biggest city in Morocco is however Casablanca, with nearly 4 million people living there. Both Rabat and Casablanca have large ports and industrial zones. The third biggest city is Marrakesh from which the word \"Morocco\" is made.

People from Morocco are called Moroccans. Moroccans are Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African and European.\nThe official languages of Morocco are Arabic and Berber. French is also very used in companies, universities, and in some TV channels. Morocco was part of the French colonial empire for 44 years. Some people in the north (close to Spain) speak Spanish as well. Spain also occupied parts of Morocco before leaving them in 1956 and in 1975.\nMost educated Moroccans do not speak English well, or do not know it at all. In the 21st century English is being taught to students in an increasing number of schools.\nMost Moroccans follow Islam as their religion. There are very small numbers of Christians, Jews, and non-believers. Morocco is home to the oldest university in the world, the University of Karaouine.\nMilitary.\nMohammed VI, a\u00A0FREMM multipurpose frigate\u00A0of the\u00A0Royal Moroccan Navy.\nCompulsory military service in Morocco has been officially suspended since September 2006, and Morocco's reserve obligation lasts until age 50. Morocco's military consists of the Royal Armed Forces this includes the\u00A0Army\u00A0(the largest branch), the\u00A0Navy, the\u00A0Air Force, the\u00A0Royal Guard, the\u00A0Royal Gendarmerie\u00A0and the\u00A0Auxiliary Forces. Internal security is generally effective, and acts of political violence are rare (with one exception, the\u00A02003 Casablanca bombings\u00A0which killed 45 people).\nThe UN maintains a small observer force in Western Sahara, where a large number of Morocco's troops are stationed. The Saharawi group\u00A0Polisario\u00A0maintains an active militia of an estimated 5,000 fighters in Western Sahara and has engaged in intermittent warfare with Moroccan forces since the 1970s.\nForeign relations.\nMorocco is a member of the\u00A0United Nations\u00A0and belongs to the\u00A0Arab League,\u00A0Arab Maghreb Union\u00A0(UMA),\u00A0Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\u00A0(OIC), the\u00A0Non-Aligned Movement\u00A0and the\u00A0Community of Sahel-Saharan States\u00A0(CEN_SAD). Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab, and Western states. Morocco has had strong ties to the West in order to gain economic and political benefits.\u00A0France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco. From the total foreign investments in Morocco, the\u00A0European Union\u00A0invests approximately 73.5%, whereas, the Arab world invests only 19.3%. Many countries from the\u00A0Persian Gulf\u00A0and\u00A0Maghreb<nowiki/>regions are getting more involved in large-scale development projects in Morocco.\nMorocco claims sovereignty over Spanish enclaves of\u00A0Ceuta\u00A0and\u00A0Melilla.\nMorocco was the only African state not to be a member of the\u00A0African Union\u00A0due to its unilateral withdrawal on November 12 1984 over the admission of the\u00A0Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\u00A0in 1982 by the\u00A0African Union\u00A0(then called Organisation of African Unity) as a full member without the organisation of a referendum of self-determination in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Morocco rejoined the AU on January 30 2017.\nA\u00A0dispute with Spain in 2002 over the tiny island of Perejil\u00A0revived the issue of the sovereignty of\u00A0Melilla\u00A0and\u00A0Ceuta. These small enclaves on the Mediterranean coast are surrounded by Morocco and have been administered by Spain for centuries.\nMorocco has been given the status of\u00A0major non-NATO ally\u00A0by the US government. Morocco was the first country in the world to recognise US sovereignty (in 1777).\nMorocco is included in the European Union's\u00A0European Neighbourhood Policy\u00A0(ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.\nWestern Sahara status.\nMorocco annexed Western Sahara in 1975. The\u00A0Polisario Front\u00A0control the territory east of the\u00A0Moroccan\u00A0\"berm\"(wall).\nDue to the conflict over\u00A0Western Sahara, the status of the\u00A0Saguia el-Hamra\u00A0and\u00A0R\u00EDo de Oro\u00A0regions is disputed. The\u00A0Western Sahara War\u00A0saw the\u00A0Polisario Front, the Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement, battling both Morocco and Mauritania between 1976 and a ceasefire in 1991 that is still in effect. A United Nations mission,\u00A0MINURSO, is tasked with organizing a referendum on whether the territory should become independent or recognised as a part of Morocco.\nPart of the territory, the\u00A0Free Zone, is a mostly uninhabited area that the Polisario Front controls as the\u00A0Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Its administrative headquarters are in\u00A0Tindouf, Algeria. As of 2006, no\u00A0UN member state\u00A0has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.\nIn 2006, the government of Morocco has suggested\u00A0autonomous\u00A0status for the region, through the Moroccan\u00A0Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs\u00A0(CORCAS). The project was presented to the\u00A0United Nations Security Council in mid-April 2007. The proposal was encouraged by Moroccan allies such as the\u00A0United States,\u00A0France\u00A0and\u00A0Spain.\u00A0The Security Council has called upon the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.\nDivisions.\nMorocco is divided into 12 regions. The regions are divided into 62 prefectures and provinces.\nProvinces.\nMorocco is divided into 37 provinces and 2 wilayas: Agadir, Al Hoceima, Azilal, Beni Mellal, Benslimane, Boulemane, Casablanca, Chefchaouen, El Jadida, El Kelaa of Sraghna, Errachidia, Essaouira, Fez, Figuig, Guelmim, Ifrane, Kenitra, Khemisset, Rommani, Khenifra, Khouribga, Laayoune, Larache, Marrakech, Meknes, Nador, Ouarzazate, Oujda, Rabat, Sale, Settat, Safi, Sidi Kacem, Tangier, Tan-Tan, Taounate, Taroudant, Tata, Taza, Tetouan, Tiznit. Three additional provinces of Dakhla (Oued ed Dahab), Boujdour, and Es-Smara as well as parts of Tan-Tan and Laayoune fall within Moroccan-claimed Western Sahara.\nEconomy.\nMining, agriculture, fishing, and tourism are the 4 main parts of Morocco's national economy. Also, Moroccans working in Europe (about 2 million) send billions of Euros of money home to their families every year.\nTourism is becoming very important too. Many Americans and Europens come to see the historical places of Morocco, live the Berber countryside life, or enjoy the warm sun and the long and clean beaches. Marrakesh is the most liked city by tourists.\nThe currency of Morocco is called the Dirham, its code is MAD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":48},{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Berber","offset":133},{"uri":"Maghreb","surface_form":"Maghreb","offset":211},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North
