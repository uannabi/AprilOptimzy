{"id":153,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Cube","text":"Time Cube was a personal website created on 1997 by Otis Eugene Ray. On that website, Ray explained his theory of everything, known as \"Time Cube\". It described the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry, and time as rotating four \"corners\". He also said that all of modern physics is wrong. Scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested.\nThe Time Cube website was written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray said that not believing in Time Cube would be \"stupid and evil\". Some of the comments were racist and discriminatory, especially against black people and Jews. There were also many comments against gay people. Many people found the site to be difficult to understand.\nRay spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2002. At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place. Ray believed this is proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden. Ray also spoke about Time Cube at the Georgia Institute of Technology in April 2005.\nOtis Eugene Ray died on March 18, 2015. He was 87 years old. The website went down on August 2015.
