{"id":15301,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilapia","text":"Tilapia is a fish that is often farmed for food, or kept as pets in aquariums. They live in warm, fresh water, but some species live in brackish water. The fish are found in Africa, North and South America, India, and Sri Lanka.\nThey are listed as one of the worlds worst introduced species. They can quickly take over from native fish in rivers. This has happened in places like in the Endeavour River, in Queensland, Australia. These fish are thought to have been released into the river from an aquarium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":13},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"aquarium","offset":68},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":98},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":120},{"uri":"Brackish","surface_form":"brackish","offset":136},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":174},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North","offset":182},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":192},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":207},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":218},{"uri":"Introduced_species","surface_form":"introduced species","offset":272},{"uri":"Endeavour_River","surface_form":"Endeavour River","offset":387},{"uri":"Queensland%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Queensland, Australia","offset":407}]}
