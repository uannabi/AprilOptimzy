{"id":15316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anteater","text":"An anteater is a mammals of the family \"Myrmecophagidae\" and the suborder \"Vermilingua\". Anteaters live in South America and Central America.\nAnteaters eat ants and termites. They have long, sharp claws and a long, sticky tongue. The tongue can be up to 60 cm long, as long as a person's arm. The anteater opens an ant nest with its claws. Then it licks up the ants with its tongue.\nLarge anteaters that move on the ground knuckle-walk, bending their front toes under when they move the way gorillas do. Small anteaters that live in trees do not do this.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":17},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":107},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":125},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":156},{"uri":"Termite","surface_form":"termite","offset":165},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":222},{"uri":"Knuckle-walk","surface_form":"knuckle-walk","offset":423}]}
