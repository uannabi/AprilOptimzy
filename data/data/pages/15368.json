{"id":15368,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei","text":"Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei (more commonly known as Opus Dei) is an organization of the Roman Catholic Church. (\"Opus Dei\" means \"Work of God\" in Latin.) Opus Dei says that the Catholic Church gave them a special job: to tell everyone that God wants them to be close to him. This means that everyone is called by God to become a saint.\nOpus Dei was started by St. Josemar\u00EDa Escriv\u00E1, a Roman Catholic priest, in 1928. It was approved by Pope Pius XII in 1950. Now, Opus Dei has around 85,000 members in 80 different countries.\nIn 1982, Pope John Paul II decided to make Opus Dei into a personal prelature. Usually, in the Catholic Church, there are separate dioceses in different areas. Each area has its own bishop who is in charge of just that diocese. But because Opus Dei is a personal prelature, its bishopm called the Prelate, is not limited to any specific area. He is in charge of members of Opus Dei wherever they are, around the world. The prelate of Opus Dei is Monsignor Fernando Oc\u00E1riz Bra\u00F1a.\nBeginnings and goals.\nOpus Dei was started by a Roman Catholic priest, Josemaria Escriv\u00E1, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. He said that God showed him what to do. On that day he \"saw Opus Dei.\"\nOpus Dei gives classes, talks, and other help so that people can practice these teachings.\nBelief that Opus Dei is God's work.\nPope John Paul II has said that Escriv\u00E1 was led by God when he started Opus Dei.\nIn 2002, Pope Benedict XVI said that Opus Dei is God's work, not Escriv\u00E1's. He said that God just used Escriva as a tool to start his own work.\nWhat it teaches.\nEscriv\u00E1 said that the basis of a Christian life is being a child of God. If people are aware of this, then they will always be very happy. He wrote that joy comes from knowing we are children of God.\nWhat it does.\nAccording to the Catholic Church, people can find God in their daily work and activities. There they can be very close to him. They do not have to become priests or monks to become a saint. God wants them to become a saint by doing their ordinary duties and activities well. The Catholic Church gave Opus Dei the job of spreading this knowledge, and teaching people that they can be real saints just by doing ordinary things and offering them to God.\nBeliefs, newness and problems.\nPope John Paul II praised Opus Dei and said that its aim of bringing God into the place of work is something great. Cardinal Albino Luciani, who later became Pope John Paul I, said that Escriva brought about a big change in how people deal with God. Before, people saw prayers as the only way to be close to God. Luciani said that Escriva also gave importance to work. The work one does can become prayer.\nBut when Escriva started teaching this, some Jesuits in the 1940s did not understand him. They said his beliefs were against the Catholic faith, because at that time Catholics thought that only priests and nuns could become holy. Some Jesuit leaders started saying that Opus Dei had secrets which it did not want the world to know, and that Opus Dei was dangerous. In fact, they said, Opus Dei just wanted to become very powerful and to control the world.\nAll these accusations were cleared up by the Popes and Catholic officials. These officials say that Opus Dei is doing something good for the world, by teaching people how to practice good habits, like telling the truth, working hard, keeping promises, loving people, and being concerned with those who are in need.\nHowever, since the Jesuits are well-respected, a lot of people in the world believed what they said. Opus Dei has gotten a lot of criticism from Catholics and non-Catholics. They say that the members develop a strong drive to gain influence, and that the behaviour resembles that of a sect. Critics of Opus Dei also say there is a lot of gender inequality in the organization. They say Opus Dei has a very traditional view of the role of women in a Christian society. According to these critics, for Opus Dei the duty of the woman is to busy herself about the house and to raise the children of the family.\nAnother writer, Massimo Introvigne, said that Opus Dei is now being attacked by people who do not believe in God and people who think that God should not be present in the world of human beings. These people, he says, do not want religion to come back to the lives of many people in society.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":101},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":151},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":159},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":253},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":342},{"uri":"Josemar%C3%ADa_Escriv%C3%A1","surface_form":"Josemar\u00EDa Escriv\u00E1","offset":377},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":413},{"uri":"Pope_Pius_XII","surface_form":"Pope Pius XII","offset":449},{"uri":"Pope_John_Paul_II","surface_form":"Pope John Paul II","offset":548},{"uri":"Prelature_of_the_Holy_Cross_and_Opus_Dei","surface_form":"personal prelature","offset":598},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":670},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":721},{"uri":"Monsignor","surface_form":"Monsignor","offset":985},{"uri":"Fernando_Oc%C3%A1riz_Bra%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Fernando Oc\u00E1riz Bra\u00F1a","offset":995},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":1081},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":1129},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1137},{"uri":"Pope_John_Paul_II","surface_form":"Pope John Paul II","offset":1342},{"uri":"Pope_Benedict_XVI","surface_form":"Pope Benedict XVI","offset":1432},{"uri":"Employment","surface_form":"work","offset":1867},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":1952},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":1963},{"uri":"Pope_John_Paul_I","surface_form":"Pope John Paul I","offset":2438},{"uri":"Jesuit","surface_form":"Jesuit","offset":2731},{"uri":"Nun","surface_form":"nun","offset":2892},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":3688},{"uri":"Sect","surface_form":"sect","offset":3742},{"uri":"Gender_inequality","surface_form":"gender inequality","offset":3795},{"uri":"Traditional","surface_form":"traditional","offset":3863},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":4294}]}
