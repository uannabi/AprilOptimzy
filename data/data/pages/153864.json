{"id":153864,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_railway_station","text":"Leeds railway station or Leeds City Station is one of the largest railway stations in the United Kingdom. The station is the largest one in Leeds as well as being the main public transport facility in West Yorkshire. There is no larger railway interchange in Yorkshire or North East England.\nThe station is one of 17 in Great Britain to be managed by Network Rail. It is the busiest English station outside London, and the UK's second busiest station outside London after Glasgow Central.\nHistory.\nLeeds City Station was built as Leeds New Station, to operate alongside Leeds Central Station (which has since closed). Leeds City Station was rebuilt twice, once in 1963 and again in 2002. Automatic ticket barriers were installed in 2008 replacing manned ticket booths.\nFuture.\nThere are plans to build a entrance to the station from the South side. This would let passengers leave with a short walk to Bridgewater Place and Granary Wharf at the moment they have to walk from the North Side and under the station in a tunnel. As part of High Speed 2 a new station is planned to the south called Leeds New Lane railway station, this will be linked to the current railway station by a bridge. Because of the number of trains now using Leeds railway station new platforms have been proposed.\nDestinations.\nThe railway station has services to London, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston upon Hull and Scarborough. There are also many local services to Wakefield, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax, York, Harrogate and other local towns and cities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":66},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":90},{"uri":"Leeds","surface_form":"Leeds","offset":140},{"uri":"West_Yorkshire","surface_form":"West Yorkshire","offset":201},{"uri":"Yorkshire","surface_form":"Yorkshire","offset":259},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":320},{"uri":"Network_Rail","surface_form":"Network Rail","offset":351},{"uri":"Bridgewater_Place","surface_form":"Bridgewater Place","offset":902},{"uri":"Granary_Wharf","surface_form":"Granary Wharf","offset":924},{"uri":"High_Speed_2","surface_form":"High Speed 2","offset":1036},{"uri":"Leeds_New_Lane_railway_station","surface_form":"Leeds New Lane railway station","offset":1094},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1338},{"uri":"Sheffield","surface_form":"Sheffield","offset":1346},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":1357},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":1369},{"uri":"Newcastle_Upon_Tyne","surface_form":"Newcastle Upon Tyne","offset":1380},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":1401},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":1413},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":1422},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":1433},{"uri":"Kingston_upon_Hull","surface_form":"Kingston upon Hull","offset":1442},{"uri":"Scarborough","surface_form":"Scarborough","offset":1465},{"uri":"Wakefield","surface_form":"Wakefield","offset":1516},{"uri":"Bradford","surface_form":"Bradford","offset":1527},{"uri":"Huddersfield","surface_form":"Huddersfield","offset":1537},{"uri":"Halifax%2C_West_Yorkshire","surface_form":"Halifax","offset":1551},{"uri":"York","surface_form":"York","offset":1560},{"uri":"Harrogate","surface_form":"Harrogate","offset":1566}]}
