{"id":15430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity","text":"=\"preserve\">Anonymity means \"namelessness\" and comes from Greek words meaning \"without name\". It is when a person's identity or name is unknown. If a person is called anonymous, nobody knows who he or she is, or the anonymous person does not want to be found out.\nThe concept of anonymity has some important uses. It is vital for a democracy that votes cast in an election are anonymous. In that way, no-one can find out how a person voted in an election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":58},{"uri":"Identity","surface_form":"identity","offset":116},{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":128},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":332},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":347},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":364}]}
