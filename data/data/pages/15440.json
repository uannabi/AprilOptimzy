{"id":15440,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur","text":"Chester Alan Arthur (October 5, 1829 \u2013 November 18, 1886) was an American politician and the 21st President of the United States. Before becoming president, he was most noted as the Collector of Customs for the port of New York, a job he got from his political friendships. Arthur was the first President of the United States to take oath of office at his own house.\nArthur was a lawyer in New York City. Two of his cases were famous. One confirmed that any slave brought to New York was automatically set free. The other ended the racial segregation of streetcars in the city.\nAfter President James A. Garfield died, vice-president Chester Arthur replaced him. The man who killed him expected the new President to pardon him. This did not happen.\nDuring Arthur's term a major problem was that people were appointing their friends (such as himself) into high political offices instead of people who were most qualified to do the job. The problem was solved after he passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act which required people to pass tests before they could be appointed to a public job.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":65},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":74},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":98},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":219},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":295},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":390},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"racial segregation","offset":532},{"uri":"Streetcar","surface_form":"streetcar","offset":554},{"uri":"James_A._Garfield","surface_form":"James A.
