The population was 4,312 at the 2010 census.\nHistory.\nThe town was settled in 1799 on an estate donated by local landowner William Campbell in order to establish a seat of government for a new county. Greenville was not established by the state assembly until 1812, however. It was incorporated as a city in 1848.\nThe city was probably named for the Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene. Local lore holds it was named by Campbell's wife after the abundant forests seen from the town's hilltop location.\nGeography.\nGreenville is located at (37.207158, -87.176499).\nEconomy.\nThe 1987 \"Encyclopedia of Kentucky\" refers to Greenville as \"the unofficial capital of the Black Belt\", a reference to the area's production of coal and dark tobacco.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":16},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":24},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":40},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"seat","offset":65},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":117},{"uri":"Kentucky_Assembly","surface_form":"state assembly","offset":324},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"Revolutionary War","offset":435},{"uri":"Nathanael_Greene","surface_form":"Nathanael Greene","offset":461},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":808},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":822}]}
