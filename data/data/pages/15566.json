{"id":15566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur","text":"Many large mammals have little hair, because their body mass radiates proportionately less heat (elephants, rhinoceros, hippopotamus). When elephants lived in arctic conditions they did have fur (woolly mammoths).\nMarine mammals usually have little or no fur: the fur would become waterlogged. They have a layer of fat (blubber) underneath their skin. A special case is the naked mole-rat, whose hairlessness is probably an adaptation to their underground life-style.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"arctic","offset":159},{"uri":"Woolly_mammoth","surface_form":"woolly mammoth","offset":196},{"uri":"Blubber","surface_form":"blubber","offset":320},{"uri":"Naked_mole-rat","surface_form":"naked mole-rat","offset":374},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":424}]}
