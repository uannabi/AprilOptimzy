They occur in India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.\nThese are large birds, with colourful male plumage. They are difficult to see in the dense vegetation they live in.\nThe junglefowl are seed-eaters, but insects are also taken, particularly by the young birds.\nOne of the species in this genus, the Red Junglefowl, is of historical importance as the likely ancestor of the domesticated chicken.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":42},{"uri":"Pheasant","surface_form":"pheasant","offset":78},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":109},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":116},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":298},{"uri":"Red_Junglefowl","surface_form":"Red Junglefowl","offset":393},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":480}]}
