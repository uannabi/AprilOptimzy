They are the ancestors of all our domestic chickens. They were first domesticated in Asia, where they are native. Some of the less specialized domestics, such as the brown leghorns, keep color patterns similar to that of their wild ancestors. They are about two pounds in weight.\nBathing.\nRed junglefowl regularly bathe in dust to keep just the right balance of oil in their plumage. The dust absorbs extra oil and it subsequently falls off.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phasianidae","surface_form":"Phasianidae","offset":72},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":128},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":170},{"uri":"Brown_leghorn","surface_form":"brown leghorn","offset":251},{"uri":"Plumage","surface_form":"plumage","offset":460},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":492},{"uri":"Subsequent","surface_form":"subsequently","offset":503}]}
