{"id":15599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism","text":"Sexism is generally defined as discrimination based on the gender of a person\u2014looking down on people because they are male or female. Sexism may also include stereotyped roles for men and women. International laws, such as Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women or Yogyakarta Principles demand to abolish any kind of sexism. Sexism could affect a person attending a party, getting a job, joining a game, trying to get a promotion, being selected and so on.\nThe women's rights and men's rights movements claim to fight sexism.\nSexism is often associated with discrimination against women due to the history of sexism in the western world.\nHatred of women is called misogyny. Hatred of men is called misandry. Reverse sexism is misandristically being biased because you think you're disadvantaged.\nPauline M. Leet made the word \"sexism\" on November 18, 1965.\nEducation.\nWorld literacy is lower for females than for males. On 9 October 2012 the Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head on her schoolbus by Taliban gunmen because she did activism for girls' rights to education.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":31},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":59},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":118},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":126},{"uri":"Stereotype","surface_form":"stereotype","offset":158},{"uri":"Gender_role","surface_form":"roles for men and women","offset":170},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"International law","offset":195},{"uri":"Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_against_Women","surface_form":"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women","offset":223},{"uri":"Yogyakarta_Principles","surface_form":"Yogyakarta Principles","offset":301},{"uri":"Women%27s_rights","surface_form":"women's rights","offset":497},{"uri":"Men%27s_rights","surface_form":"men's rights","offset":516},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"western world","offset":659},{"uri":"Misogyny","surface_form":"misogyny","offset":700},{"uri":"Misandry","surface_form":"misandry","offset":734},{"uri":"Misandristically","surface_form":"misandristically","offset":762},{"uri":"Pakistani","surface_form":"Pakistani","offset":978},{"uri":"Malala_Yousafzai","surface_form":"Malala Yousafzai","offset":999},{"uri":"Taliban","surface_form":"Taliban","offset":1057},{"uri":"Activism","surface_form":"activism","offset":1088}]}
