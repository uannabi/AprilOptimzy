{"id":15602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War","text":"The Persian Gulf War, sometimes just called the Gulf War, was a conflict between Iraq and 34 other countries, led by the United States. It started with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on August 2, 1990. Iraq had long claimed Kuwait as part of its territory. The war ended the following spring when Iraq's armies were defeated. There were two military operations.\nOperation Desert Shield brought troops to protect Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states that Iraq had not attacked.\nOperation Desert Storm attacked Iraq's forces both in Kuwait and in Iraq. It started on 17 January, 1991 with an air strike. Ground operations started 24 February. Iraqi forces set fire to oil wells to slow the attack.The war ended on 28 February, 1991 with a ceasefire.\nThe long Iran\u2013Iraq War had ended in August 1988. Iraq owed a great amount of money to Saudi Arabia and had difficulty paying it back. Saddam Hussein declared the neighboring country of Kuwait to be siphoning Iraqi crude oil from across the border, and on August 2nd, 1990 the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait started. On January 17, 1991 the US began the Persian Gulf War with a massive US led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm.\nThe attacks were assisted by newly developed weapons, including stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and smart bombs.\nAfter 42 days of fighting U.S. President Bush declared a ceasefire on February 28. By that time most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled.\nOperation Desert storm included a bombing campaign that targeted Iraqi aircraft, anti-aircraft systems, oil refineries, weapon factories, bridges, and roads. The war was a lopsided victory for coalition forces. President George Bush decided not to depose Saddam Houssein.\nPolitical issues after Operation Desert Storm lead to the second Persian Gulf War in 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":81},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":121},{"uri":"Kuwait","surface_form":"Kuwait","offset":168},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":178},{"uri":"Operation_Desert_Shield","surface_form":"Operation Desert Shield","offset":362},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":412},{"uri":"Operation_Desert_Storm","surface_form":"Operation Desert Storm","offset":473},{"uri":"Ceasefire","surface_form":"ceasefire","offset":733},{"uri":"Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War","surface_form":"Iran\u2013Iraq War","offset":753},{"uri":"Stealth_aircraft","surface_form":"stealth aircraft","offset":1241},{"uri":"Cruise_missile","surface_form":"cruise missile","offset":1259},{"uri":"Smart_bomb","surface_form":"smart bomb","offset":1279},{"uri":"2003_invasion_of_Iraq","surface_form":"second Persian Gulf War","offset":1778}]}
