{"id":156020,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol","text":"The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), developed by the IETF and created in 1998 as RFC 2326, is a protocol for use in streaming media systems, which allows a client to remotely control a streaming media server, issuing VCR-like commands such as \"play\" and \"pause\", and allowing time-based access to files on a server.\nThe sending of streaming data itself is not part of the RTSP protocol. Most RTSP servers use the standards-based RTP as the transport protocol for the actual audio/video data. The RTSP server from RealNetworks also features RealNetworks' proprietary RDT as the transport protocol.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","surface_form":"IETF","offset":58},{"uri":"1998","surface_form":"1998","offset":78},{"uri":"Communications_protocol","surface_form":"protocol","offset":101},{"uri":"Streaming_media","surface_form":"streaming media","offset":121},{"uri":"VCR","surface_form":"VCR","offset":222},{"uri":"Real-time_Transport_Protocol","surface_form":"RTP","offset":434},{"uri":"RealNetworks","surface_form":"RealNetworks","offset":518},{"uri":"RealNetworks","surface_form":"RealNetworks","offset":545},{"uri":"RDT_stream_transport","surface_form":"RDT","offset":571}]}
