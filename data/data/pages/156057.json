The city is in northeastern Indiana, about west of the Ohio border and south of the Michigan border.\nUnder the direction of American Revolutionary War statesman Anthony Wayne, the United States Army built Fort Wayne. It was the last in a series of forts near the Miami tribe village of Kekionga in 1794. Named in Wayne's honor, the settlement established itself as a trading post for European pioneers.\nFort Wayne was known for hosting the first ever nighttime baseball game. In 1982, there was flood that forced 9,000 residents to leave their homes. It damaged 2,000 buildings and caused US$56.1 million in damage. Because of this, President Ronald Reagan visited the city.\nThe city has been an All-America City Award winner. It won in 1982, 1998, and 2009.
