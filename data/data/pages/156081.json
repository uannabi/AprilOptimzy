{"id":156081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Porte%2C_Indiana","text":"e=\"preserve\">La Porte is a city in the state of Indiana, in the United States.\nInfamous resident.\nIn April 1908 the home of resident Belle Gunness burned down. The investigation found that Belle Gunness was a killer who would lure males so she could kill them for their money. It is unknown exactly how many murders she committed-anywhere to from over a dozen to a suspected 50. There are two schools of thought of Belle Gunness fate; one is that she was killed in the fire by her accomplice Ray Lamphere [who died in prison of natural causes]; the other is that she tried to fake her own death [the remains of the woman found with Gunness children did not confirm to Gunness size and weight]. In April 1931 a woman called herself \"Esther Carlson\" was arrested in California on a charge of poisoning a man named August Lindstrom for his money; she died of natural causes before she could be tried or identified as Gunness..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":48},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":64}]}
