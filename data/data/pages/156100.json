It is known as \"Middletown USA\" because many sociological studies were conducted there because it was said to be the typical American city. The population of Muncie in 2011 was 67,430 people.\nMuncie is in Delaware County, about northeast of Indianapolis. The county was named after the Delaware Indians, a native American people, who had moved west from Ohio in the 1770's. They settled along the banks of the White River. One of the settlements was named Muncietown. In 1818 the Delaware signed a treaty with the US Government and moved out of the area to go further west.\nMiddletown.\nMuncie was chosen from the 143 cities that met the above descriptions. Since then Muncie has been studied by other sociologists looking at life in America. The Ball State University in Muncie runs the Center for Middletown Studies to continue the research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":12},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":20},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":35},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociological studies","offset":95},{"uri":"Indianapolis%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Indianapolis","offset":291},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"native American","offset":356},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":404},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":548}]}
