{"id":156711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol","text":"In computing, the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to get e-mail from a remote mail server over a IP connection. POP3 and IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol) are the two most widely accepted Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval. Almost all modern e-mail clients and servers support both.\nMany years ago, a proposal was outlined for a [http://www.pop4.org/pop4/pop4spec.html POP4 specification], complete with a working server implementation. The proposed POP4 extension adds basic folder management, multipart message support, as well as message flag management, allowing for a light protocol which supports some popular IMAP features which POP3 lacks. No progress has been found in the POP4 specification since 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computing","surface_form":"computing","offset":3},{"uri":"Application_layer","surface_form":"application-layer","offset":62},{"uri":"Internet_standard","surface_form":"Internet standard","offset":80},{"uri":"Protocol_(computing)","surface_form":"protocol","offset":98},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"e-mail","offset":121},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"e-mail","offset":143},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":169},{"uri":"Internet_protocol_suite","surface_form":"IP","offset":183},{"uri":"IMAP4","surface_form":"IMAP4","offset":207},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":814}]}
