Baker is best known for playing the Fourth Doctor in the long-running science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He played this role from 1974 to 1981. When he got the job, he was working on a building site, because it was hard to find work as an actor.\nHe is famous for playing the Doctor longer than any other actor. His version of the character is probably the best remembered by many people. As he thought of himself as a role model for children, he would always pretend to be the Doctor in real life, and sign autographs for them. He did not like to see too much violence in Doctor Who. He once changed the script so the Doctor threatened a character with a jelly baby instead of a knife.\nHe was a narrator for the comedy sketch show \"Little Britain.\"\nBaker has had many jobs as a voiceover artist. He is very recognized for his voice. In a 2005 survey of British adults, Baker's voice was the fourth most recognisable after the Queen, Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":65},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":73},{"uri":"Fourth_Doctor","surface_form":"Fourth Doctor","offset":113},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":147},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":151},{"uri":"Doctor_Who","surface_form":"Doctor Who","offset":187},{"uri":"Liverpool%2C_England","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":230},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":274},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":297},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":413},{"uri":"Royal_Army_Medical_Corps","surface_form":"Royal Army Medical Corps","offset":493},{"uri":"Grigori_Rasputin","surface_form":"Grigori Rasputin","offset":645},{"uri":"Nicholas_and_Alexandra","surface_form":"Nicholas and Alexandra","offset":682},{"uri":"Fourth_Doctor","surface_form":"Fourth Doctor","offset":743},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":777},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":793},{"uri":"Doctor_Who","surface_form":"Doctor Who","offset":812},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":1432},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"the Queen","offset":1642},{"uri":"Tony_Blair","surface_form":"Tony Blair","offset":1653},{"uri":"Margaret_Thatcher","surface_form":"Margaret Thatcher","offset":1668}]}
