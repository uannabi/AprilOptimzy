{"id":156768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory","text":"e=\"preserve\">A territory (plural: territories, from the word \"terra\", which means 'land') is an area which belongs to a person, organization, institution, animal, nation or state. In international law, a \"territory\" is an area of land which is outside the borders of a nation, but owned by that nation. Examples are: Puerto Rico as a U.S. territory, or Bermuda as a territory of the UK.\nGeneral examples of territories are states controlled by a federated government (such as Germany or the counties of a state within the States of the United States), a unitary state such as France, an occupied territory (land which has been invaded by the military of another country) or a disputed territory (such as Kashmir, which both India\u00A0and Pakistan believe is theirs).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":96},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":120},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":128},{"uri":"Institution","surface_form":"institution","offset":142},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":155},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":163},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":173},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":183},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":197},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"Example","offset":303},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":317},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":334},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":353},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":383},{"uri":"Federation","surface_form":"federated government","offset":446},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":476},{"uri":"Counties","surface_form":"counties","offset":491},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"States of the United States","offset":522},{"uri":"Unitary_state","surface_form":"unitary state","offset":554},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":576},{"uri":"Occupied_territory","surface_form":"occupied territory","offset":587},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invaded","offset":627},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":642},{"uri":"Territorial_dispute","surface_form":"disputed territory","offset":676},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":704},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":724},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":734}]}
