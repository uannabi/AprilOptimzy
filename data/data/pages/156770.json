{"id":156770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingidae","text":"Sphingidae is a family of moths (Lepidoptera), commonly known as hawk moths, sphinx moths and hornworms. It includes about 1,450 species. It is best represented in the tropics but there are species in every region.\nThey can fly fast, and their wings can be linked by wing coupling. They can hover, and can move from side to side while hovering. This may be to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lepidoptera","surface_form":"Lepidoptera","offset":33},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropics","offset":168},{"uri":"Wing_coupling","surface_form":"wing coupling","offset":267},{"uri":"Ambush_predator","surface_form":"ambush predator","offset":370},{"uri":"Flowers","surface_form":"flowers","offset":407}]}
