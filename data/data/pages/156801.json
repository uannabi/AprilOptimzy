Scientists think Mira is 200-400 light years away in the constellation Cetus. Mira is known to change size over time. Other red giant stars that do the same are called Mira variables.\nSize.\nMira has a diameter 332 to 541 times that of our sun.\nIf Mira did not change size, its diameter would be only 240 times larger than the Sun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":10},{"uri":"White_dwarf","surface_form":"white dwarf","offset":36},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red giant","offset":91},{"uri":"Cetus","surface_form":"Cetus","offset":182},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":312},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":350},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":437}]}
