{"id":156814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circe","text":"In Greek mythology, Circe (; Greek \u039A\u03AF\u03C1\u03BA\u03B7 \"K\u00EDrk\u0113\" \"falcon\") is a minor goddess of magic. Sometimes, she is described as a nymph, witch, enchantress or sorceress. In the \"Odyssey\" Homer describes her as 'The loveliest of all immortals,' living on the island of Aeaea, famous for her part in the adventures of Odysseus.\nIn most descriptions, Circe was the daughter of Helios, the god of the sun, and Perse, an Oceanid, and the sister of Aeetes, the keeper of the Golden Fleece, Perses, and Pasipha\u00EB, the Wife of King Minos and mother of the Minotaur. Other accounts make her the daughter of Hecate.\nCirce transformed her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals through the use of magical potions. She was known for her knowledge of drugs and herbs.\nThat Circe also purified the Argonauts for the death of Apsyrtus, as told in \"Argonautica\", may be an early tradition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":3},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":29},{"uri":"Falcon","surface_form":"falcon","offset":50},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":70},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":81},{"uri":"Nymph","surface_form":"nymph","offset":121},{"uri":"Witch","surface_form":"witch","offset":128},{"uri":"Enchantress","surface_form":"enchantress","offset":135},{"uri":"Odyssey","surface_form":"Odyssey","offset":169},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":178},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":249},{"uri":"Aeaea","surface_form":"Aeaea","offset":259},{"uri":"Odysseus","surface_form":"Odysseus","offset":307},{"uri":"Helios","surface_form":"Helios","offset":365},{"uri":"Perse","surface_form":"Perse","offset":397},{"uri":"Oceanid","surface_form":"Oceanid","offset":407},{"uri":"Aeetes","surface_form":"Aeetes","offset":434},{"uri":"Golden_Fleece","surface_form":"Golden Fleece","offset":460},{"uri":"Perses_(brother_of_Aeetes)","surface_form":"Perses","offset":475},{"uri":"Pasipha%C3%AB","surface_form":"Pasipha\u00EB","offset":487},{"uri":"King_Minos","surface_form":"King Minos","offset":509},{"uri":"Minotaur","surface_form":"Minotaur","offset":538},{"uri":"Hecate","surface_form":"Hecate","offset":588},{"uri":"Shapeshifting","surface_form":"transformed","offset":602},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":738},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":748},{"uri":"Argonauts","surface_form":"Argonauts","offset":784},{"uri":"Apsyrtus","surface_form":"Apsyrtus","offset":811},{"uri":"Argonautica","surface_form":"Argonautica","offset":833}]}
