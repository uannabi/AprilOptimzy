{"id":15711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Offspring","text":"The Offspring is an American punk group formed in 1984 in Garden Grove, California. Their music has covered both punk rock and pop punk.\nHistory.\nThe band was founded by Dexter Holland and Greg Kriesel after a concert of Social Distortion as \"Manic Subsidal\". As soon as Kevin \"Noodles\" Wassermann joined the band as their second guitarist in 1985, they changed their name to \"The Offspring\".\nIt would not be until ten years after forming that The Offspring saw its first piece of commercial success in its third album, \"Smash\", which was released in 1994. Regarded by many as The Offspring's classic release, and Epitaph Records' best-selling album, \"Smash\" produced four successful hit singles: \"Come Out and Play\" (which reached #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart), \"Self Esteem\", \"Gotta Get Away\" and the radio-only single \"Bad Habit\". From there, The Offspring became one of the most important punk bands of the 1990s, along with ALL, Bad Religion, Face to Face, Green Day, Guttermouth, Lagwagon, NOFX, Pennywise, Rancid, Social Distortion, The Vandals, and many others.\nTheir most recent album was released in June 2008. The exact date of release depended on the country/region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":20},{"uri":"Punk","surface_form":"punk","offset":29},{"uri":"Garden_Grove%2C_California","surface_form":"Garden Grove","offset":58},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":72},{"uri":"Social_Distortion","surface_form":"Social Distortion","offset":221},{"uri":"Smash_(album)","surface_form":"Smash","offset":521},{"uri":"Epitaph_Records","surface_form":"Epitaph Records","offset":614},{"uri":"Come_Out_and_Play","surface_form":"Come Out and Play","offset":698},{"uri":"Self_Esteem","surface_form":"Self Esteem","offset":780},{"uri":"Gotta_Get_Away","surface_form":"Gotta Get Away","offset":795},{"uri":"ALL_(band)","surface_form":"ALL","offset":945},{"uri":"Bad_Religion","surface_form":"Bad Religion","offset":950},{"uri":"Face_to_Face","surface_form":"Face to Face","offset":964},{"uri":"Green_Day","surface_form":"Green Day","offset":978},{"uri":"Guttermouth","surface_form":"Guttermouth","offset":989},{"uri":"Lagwagon","surface_form":"Lagwagon","offset":1002},{"uri":"NOFX","surface_form":"NOFX","offset":1012},{"uri":"Pennywise","surface_form":"Pennywise","offset":1018},{"uri":"Rancid","surface_form":"Rancid","offset":1029},{"uri":"Social_Distortion","surface_form":"Social Distortion","offset":1037},{"uri":"The_Vandals","surface_form":"The Vandals","offset":1056}]}
