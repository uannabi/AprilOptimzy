{"id":15726,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum","text":"A plum is a sweet fruit that grows on a plum tree. The scientific name for the tree is \"Prunus\" \"domestica\". When the fruit is dried, it is called a prune. The color \"plum\" takes its name from the fruit.\n\"Prunus domestica\" is the European plum. Most of the plums we eat are grown on varieties of this tree. Greengages and damsons are varieties of plum.\nThe plant is usually a large shrub or a small tree. It has attractive white blossom in spring. The branches often have thorns. The fruit can be up to 8\u00A0cm across, and is usually sweet (dessert plum). Some varieties are sour and require cooking with sugar. The fruit has a single large seed inside.\nSome plum trees need another plum tree growing nearby to fertilise the flowers. Without this the plum tree may not produce any fruit.\nPlum colored plums are called \"purple plums\" and are a deep purple color; other plums are reddish purple. Some other plums can be yellow, red, green or even white. The fruit has a groove running down one side, and a smooth stone (seed). The flesh of the fruit is brownish and is very juicy. The skin can be eaten. It can also be used to make jam and the juice can be used to make wine. It is closely related to the apricot.\nCultivation.\nThere are many cultivars of plum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":12},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":18},{"uri":"Prunus","surface_form":"Prunus","offset":88},{"uri":"Prune","surface_form":"prune","offset":149},{"uri":"Plum_(color)","surface_form":"plum","offset":167},{"uri":"Greengage","surface_form":"Greengage","offset":307},{"uri":"Damson","surface_form":"damson","offset":322},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":382},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":399},{"uri":"Blossom","surface_form":"blossom","offset":429},{"uri":"Thorns%2C_spines_and_prickles","surface_form":"thorns","offset":472},{"uri":"Purple","surface_form":"purple","offset":845},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":915},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":923},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":928},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":942},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":1015},{"uri":"Jam","surface_form":"jam","offset":1127},{"uri":"Juice","surface_form":"juice","offset":1139},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":1165},{"uri":"Apricot","surface_form":"apricot","offset":1200},{"uri":"Cultivar","surface_form":"cultivar","offset":1237}]}
