{"id":15733,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee","text":"A lychee (pronounced LIE-Chee) is a tropical fruit in the genus \"Litchi\". It comes from southern China. Since it is tropical, it will only grow in a warm, wet climate.\nThe inside of a lychee is a clear, pinkish-white color. The outside of the fruit is a hard spiky shell. Its seed is brown in color and very hard. The seeds are poisonous and should not be eaten. The lychee has a sweet taste, and may be frozen, made into sauces, jam, puree, or preserves. When frozen, the lychee tastes similar to sorbet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Chinese"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":36},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":45},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":58},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":97},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":159},{"uri":"Shell","surface_form":"shell","offset":265},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":284},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"color","offset":293},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":328}]}
