For example,\nMomentum is a vector quantity, which has both direction and magnitude. Its unit is \"kg m/s\" (kilogram metre per second) or \"N s\" (newton second).\nMomentum is a conserved quantity, meaning that the total initial momentum of a system must be equal to the total final momentum of the system. The total momentum remains unchanged.\nFormula.\nIn Newtonian physics, the usual symbol for momentum is the letter p; so this can be written\nwhere p is the momentum, \"m\" is the mass and v is the velocity\nIf we apply Newton's 2nd Law, we can derive\nThe meaning is that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change in momentum of the object.\nIn order to use this equation in special relativity, m has to change with speed. That is sometimes called the \"relativistic mass\" of the object. (Scientists who work with special relativity use other equations instead.)\nImpulse.\nImpulse is the change in momentum caused by a new force: this force will increase or decrease the momentum depending on the direction of the force; towards or away from the body that was moving before. If the new force (N) is going in the direction of the momentum of the body (x), the momentum of x will increase; therefore if N is going towards body x in the opposite direction, x will slow down and its momentum will decrease.\nLaw of conservation of momentum.\nIn understanding conservation of momentum, the direction of the momentum is important. In a system, momentum is added up using vector addition. Under the rules of vector addition, adding a certain amount of momentum together with the same amount of momentum going in the opposite direction gives a total momentum of zero.\nFor instance, when a gun is fired, a small mass (the bullet) moves at a high speed in one direction. A larger mass (the gun) moves in the opposite direction at a much slower speed. The momentum of the bullet and the momentum of the gun are exactly equal in size but opposite in direction. Using vector addition to add the momentum of the bullet to the momentum of the gun (equal in size but opposite in direction) gives a total system momentum of zero. The momentum of the gun-bullet system has been conserved.\nThe car's momentum: 1000\u00A0kg x 8\u00A0m/s = 8000kgm/s (Going right)\nThe truck's momentum: 6000\u00A0kg x 2\u00A0m/s = 12000kgm/s (Going left)\nThis means their total momentum is 4000kgm/s.
