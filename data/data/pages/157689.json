{"id":157689,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_huntsman_spider","text":"The brown huntsman spider (\"Heteropoda venatoria\"), also known as the giant crab spider or the cane spider, is a species of spider. found in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, including Asia, R\u00E9union Island, the Caribbean islands, the Southeastern US, and (especially) Australia.\nDescription.\nThey have a flat type of body and only a small dorsal pattern. Adults can grow to be 2.2 to 2.8\u00A0cm, and have a leg span of 7 to 12\u00A0cm. Some have colors of brown, white and black.\nFemales have a larger abdomen than males but males have longer and thinner legs with a slim body. Both have a wide, yellow to cream clypeus band around the rest of the carapace. The female also has a strong body and often carries a pillow-like egg sac under her.\nFood.\nBrown huntsman spiders do not use spider webs to feed on prey. These spiders are known to hunt by waiting and making no noise above their prey, and then rush forward when their prey get close. They are fast, agile and can move through tight spaces. They feed at night.\nIf you let them into your home, they will eat unwanted bugs and insects like cockroaches and silverfish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":124},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":146},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":159},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":201},{"uri":"R%C3%A9union_Island","surface_form":"R\u00E9union Island","offset":207},{"uri":"Caribbean_islands","surface_form":"Caribbean islands","offset":227},{"uri":"Southeastern_US","surface_form":"Southeastern US","offset":250},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":284},{"uri":"Dorsum_(biology)","surface_form":"dorsal","offset":355},{"uri":"Span","surface_form":"span","offset":423},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":509},{"uri":"Clypeus","surface_form":"clypeus","offset":619},{"uri":"Carapace","surface_form":"carapace","offset":655},{"uri":"Spider_web","surface_form":"spider web","offset":790},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":813},{"uri":"Cockroaches","surface_form":"cockroaches","offset":1102},{"uri":"Silverfish","surface_form":"silverfish","offset":1118}]}
