{"id":157944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIME_protocol","text":"The TIME service is an Internet protocol defined in RFC 868. Its purpose is to provide a site-independent, machine readable date and time.\nTIME can operate over either TCP or UDP. When operating over TCP, a host connects to a server that supports the TIME protocol on TCP port 37. The server then sends the time as a 32-bit unsigned binary number in network byte order representing a number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January, 1900 GMT and closes the connection. The host receives the time and closes the connection.\nWhen operating over UDP, the client sends a (usually empty) datagram to UDP port 37. The server responds with a single datagram of length 4 containing the time. There is no connection setup or teardown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet_Protocol","surface_form":"Internet protocol","offset":23},{"uri":"Transmission_Control_Protocol","surface_form":"TCP","offset":168},{"uri":"User_Datagram_Protocol","surface_form":"UDP","offset":175},{"uri":"Network_byte_order","surface_form":"network byte order","offset":350}]}
