{"id":158,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize","text":"Maize or Indian corn (called corn in some countries) is \"Zea mays\", a member of the grass family \"Poaceae\". It is a cereal grain which was first grown by people in ancient Central America. Approximately 1 billion tonnes are harvested every year. However, little of this maize is eaten directly by humans. Most is used to make corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.\nMaize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside. It is an angiosperm, which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is has long been a staple food by many people in Mexico, Central and South America and parts of Africa. In Europe and the rest of North America, maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed. In Canada and the United States, maize is commonly referred to as \"corn\".\nCenturies of cross breeding have produced larger plants, and specialized varieties. Corn has become an important ingredient in American foods through the use of corn starch. People have long eaten sweet corn and popcorn with little processing, and other kinds after processing into flour for making cornbread, tortilla<nowiki/>s, and other artificial foods.\nMaize has been a fruitful model organism for research in genetics for many years: see Barbara McClintock. Research has shown that artificial selection developed maize from a Mexican plant called Teosinte.\nThe genus \"Zea\".\nThere are five species and many subspecies in the genus. They are all plants similar to the cultivated maize, with less developed cobs. The wild ones are sometimes called teosintes, and they are all native to Mesoamerica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":84},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":90},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":116},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":123},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":172},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":331},{"uri":"Corn_starch","surface_form":"corn starch","offset":386},{"uri":"Corn_syrup","surface_form":"corn syrup","offset":402},{"uri":"Angiosperm","surface_form":"angiosperm","offset":479},{"uri":"Staple_food","surface_form":"staple food","offset":578},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":608},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":628},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":655},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":666},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":689},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":737},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":753},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":768},{"uri":"Plant_breeding","surface_form":"cross breeding","offset":837},{"uri":"Corn_starch","surface_form":"corn starch","offset":985},{"uri":"Sweet_corn","surface_form":"sweet corn","offset":1021},{"uri":"Popcorn","surface_form":"popcorn","offset":1036},{"uri":"Food_processing","surface_form":"processing","offset":1056},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":1106},{"uri":"Cornbread","surface_form":"cornbread","offset":1123},{"uri":"Tortilla","surface_form":"tortilla","offset":1134},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":1208},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":1239},{"uri":"Barbara_McClintock","surface_form":"Barbara McClintock","offset":1268},{"uri":"Artificial_selection","surface_form":"artificial selection","offset":1312},{"uri":"Teosinte","surface_form":"Teosinte","offset":1377},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1419},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":1436},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":1454},{"uri":"Teosinte","surface_form":"teosinte","offset":1575},{"uri":"Mesoamerica","surface_form":"Mesoamerica","offset":1613}]}
