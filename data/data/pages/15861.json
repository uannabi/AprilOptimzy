{"id":15861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_erosion","text":"Soil erosion is the washing or blowing away (by water or wind) of the top layer of soil (dirt). This is a serious problem for farmers. If the soil has eroded, the crops that make food will not grow very well.\nSoil erosion was a big problem in the Midwestern United States in the 1930s dust bowl.\nErosion also leaves large sinkholes in the ground, which can weaken buildings and even cause them to collapse. Urban areas are usually protected from soil erosion, so not many buildings collapse from erosion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":83},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":126},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":163},{"uri":"Midwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Midwestern United States","offset":247},{"uri":"Dust_Bowl","surface_form":"dust bowl","offset":285},{"uri":"Sinkhole","surface_form":"sinkhole","offset":322}]}
