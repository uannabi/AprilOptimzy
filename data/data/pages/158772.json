{"id":158772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool","text":"Tools are things used to make tasks easier. Tools have changed over time. The first tools were made in the Stone Age and Bronze Age. Throughout history, people have made many new and more complicated tools.\nSome examples of tools that are often used today are the hammer, the wrench (also called a spanner), saws, shovel, telephone, and the computer. Very basic things like knives, pens, and pencils are also tools. The bludgeon (a stick or rock used as a weapon to smash things) was one of the first tools made by humans. The knife is also one of the first tools humans made.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Task","surface_form":"task","offset":30},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":107},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":121},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":264},{"uri":"Wrench","surface_form":"wrench","offset":276},{"uri":"Saw","surface_form":"saw","offset":308},{"uri":"Shovel","surface_form":"shovel","offset":314},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":322},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":341},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knives","offset":374},{"uri":"Pen","surface_form":"pen","offset":382},{"uri":"Pencil","surface_form":"pencil","offset":392},{"uri":"Club_(weapon)","surface_form":"bludgeon","offset":420},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":456},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":515},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":527}]}
