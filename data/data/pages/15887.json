{"id":15887,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile","text":"Reptile is the common name for one of the main groups of land vertebrates. It is not used so much by biologists, who use more accurate terms.\nThe name \"reptile\" comes from Latin and means \"one who creeps\". All living reptile species are cold blooded, have scaly skin, and lay cleidoic eggs. They excrete uric acid (instead of urea), and have a cloaca. A cloaca is a shared opening for the anus, urinary tract and reproductive ducts. Reptiles also share an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals.\nMany important groups of reptiles are now extinct, for example the mosasaurs. We used to say the dinosaurs were extinct, but they survive in the form of their feathered descendants (birds). Ancient reptiles that do survive include the turtles, the crocodiles and the Tuatara, the lone survivor of its group. The great majority of present-day reptiles are snakes and lizards.\nThe study of living reptiles is called \"herpetology\".\nBirds in relation to reptiles.\nSome reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles. Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards. Theropod dinosaurs are even more closely related, because birds evolved from them.\nCladistic writers prefer a more unified (monophyletic) grouping. This puts the birds (over 10,000 species) with what people normally call reptiles. (see Sauropsida)\nTaxonomy.\nReptilia is an evolutionary grade rather than a clade. The main reason is that the term 'reptile' does not include birds, the descendents of theropod dinosaurs. Another reason is that the word 'reptile' is misleading because many extinct types were very different from living reptiles.\nSo instead of Reptilia as a taxonomic class, today many experts use Class Sauropsida (which includes all reptiles and birds, living and extinct). Class Synapsida includes mammals and all their forebears. \"Reptile\" is still the usual informal term to describe living snakes and lizards. Mammals are a genuine clade, and so Mammalia is still the taxonomic term.\nSince reptiles are not monophyletic, reclassifying them is one of the key aims of researchers. Some taxonomists, such as Benton, make Sauropsida and Synapsida as class-level taxa. The two groups split in the Carboniferous, from stem-group Amniotes (the early tetrapods, which laid cleidoic eggs).\nEye feature.\nA membrane forms an inner eyelid in reptiles and birds. Whitish or translucent, it can be drawn across the eye to protect it from dust and keep it moist. It is called the \"nictitating membrane\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":62},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":172},{"uri":"Cold_blooded","surface_form":"cold blooded","offset":237},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":262},{"uri":"Cleidoic_egg","surface_form":"cleidoic egg","offset":276},{"uri":"Uric_acid","surface_form":"uric acid","offset":304},{"uri":"Urea","surface_form":"urea","offset":326},{"uri":"Cloaca","surface_form":"cloaca","offset":344},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":389},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":475},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":588},{"uri":"Mosasaur","surface_form":"mosasaur","offset":613},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":643},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":728},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"turtle","offset":781},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":794},{"uri":"Tuatara","surface_form":"Tuatara","offset":813},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":901},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":912},{"uri":"Herpetology","surface_form":"herpetology","offset":961},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1048},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"Theropod","offset":1158},{"uri":"Dinosaurs","surface_form":"dinosaurs","offset":1167},{"uri":"Cladistic","surface_form":"Cladistic","offset":1241},{"uri":"Monophyly","surface_form":"(monophyletic)","offset":1281},{"uri":"Sauropsida","surface_form":"Sauropsida","offset":1394},{"uri":"Evolutionary_grade","surface_form":"evolutionary grade","offset":1431},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":1464},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":1557},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1566},{"uri":"Sauropsid","surface_form":"Sauropsid","offset":1776},{"uri":"Synapsid","surface_form":"Synapsid","offset":1854},{"uri":"Informal","surface_form":"informal","offset":1935},{"uri":"Snakes","surface_form":"snakes","offset":1968},{"uri":"Lizards","surface_form":"lizards","offset":1979},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":2085},{"uri":"Taxon","surface_form":"taxa","offset":2236},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":2270},{"uri":"Amniote","surface_form":"Amniote","offset":2301},{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"tetrapod","offset":2321},{"uri":"Cleidoic_egg","surface_form":"cleidoic egg","offset":2343},{"uri":"Membrane","surface_form":"membrane","offset":2374},{"uri":"Eyelid","surface_form":"eyelid","offset":2398}]}
