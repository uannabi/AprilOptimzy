{"id":158968,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Central_Pacific_cyclone","text":"The 2006 Central Pacific cyclone, also called 91C.INVEST or Storm 91C, was a strange weather event in 2006. Forming on October 30 from a mid-latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer-than-normal. It got some characteristics more normal for subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it came closer to western North America, it fell apart. Moisture from its remains then caused a lot of rainfall in British Columbia.\nStorm history.\nA cut-off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved into a place with sea surface temperatures as high as 2\u00A0\u00B0C above normal for two days. By October 31 the system had gotton convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like characteristic. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest.\nOn November 1, the system had estimated winds of 100\u00A0km/h (60\u00A0mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, moved counter-clockwise, and headed east towards the west coast of North America. On November 2, wind shear started affecting the storm, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520\u00A0mi (840\u00A0km) off the coast of Oregon.\nThis system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989\u00A0mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured.\nImpact, preparation, and records.\nAs a result, to the weather system, the American National Weather Service gave out wind watches for the Oregon Coast. The system brought heavy rain to parts of Vancouver Island.\nIf Storm 91C is really a tropical or subtropical cyclone, it has several records. Since right now it is not officially either, its holding these records is also unofficial. Because the storm formed at 36\u00B0N, this system is the northernmost formation in the eastern north Pacific basin. The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32\u00B0N before crossing the dateline. In addition, this system's track data shows that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149\u00B0W and dissipated at 135\u00B0W. Only two other known tropical cyclones had done that before.\nNature of the system.\nThis system has been thought to be a tropical, subtropical, or extratropical cyclone.\nThe system was of frontal origin... the frontal structure was eventually lost... The convective structure resembled a tropical, rather than subtropical cyclone, and the radius of maximum winds (based on QuikSCAT) was very close to the center, also more typical of tropical cyclones... on balance, it was more tropical than subtropical.\nClark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the system's structure was same with that of a subtropical or barely tropical cyclone. NASA, which is not a meteorological agency, thought that the system was a subtropical cyclone.\nIn its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said that the storm was to be an extratropical cyclone. Since this system had one-minute sustained winds of 100\u00A0km/h (60\u00A0mi/h), which are above the 60\u00A0km/h (39\u00A0mi/h) boundary between a depression and a storm, it would be able to be a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone. However, neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Centre, include this system in their yearly archives, nor is it included in the official \"best track\" file. So this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":85},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"mid-latitude cyclone","offset":137},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":279},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":299},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"rainfall","offset":433},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":445},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":488},{"uri":"Pacific","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":533},{"uri":"Sea_surface_temperature","surface_form":"sea surface temperature","offset":565},{"uri":"Convection","surface_form":"convection","offset":669},{"uri":"Eye_(cyclone)","surface_form":"eye-like","offset":715},{"uri":"Wind_shear","surface_form":"wind shear","offset":1043},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":1189},{"uri":"Observation","surface_form":"observation","offset":1249},{"uri":"Buoy","surface_form":"buoy","offset":1261},{"uri":"Low_pressure","surface_form":"low pressure","offset":1388},{"uri":"Atmospheric_circulation","surface_form":"circulation","offset":1478},{"uri":"National_Weather_Service","surface_form":"National Weather Service","offset":1666},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches","surface_form":"wind watches","offset":1700},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":1721},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":1760},{"uri":"Vancouver_Island","surface_form":"Vancouver Island","offset":1777},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone_basins","surface_form":"eastern north Pacific basin","offset":2051},{"uri":"International_Date_Line","surface_form":"dateline","offset":2173},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical","offset":2462},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":2472},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":2488},{"uri":"QuikSCAT","surface_form":"QuikSCAT","offset":2714},{"uri":"Florida_State_University","surface_form":"Florida State University","offset":2862},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":2978},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":3018},{"uri":"2006_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2006 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":3134},{"uri":"Canadian_Hurricane_Centre","surface_form":"Canadian Hurricane Centre","offset":3170},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":3229},{"uri":"Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Center","surface_form":"Regional Specialized Meteorological Center","offset":3520},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":3599},{"uri":"Central_Pacific_Hurricane_Centre","surface_form":"Central Pacific Hurricane Centre","offset":3633},{"uri":"2006_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2006 Pacific hurricane season","offset":3840}]}
