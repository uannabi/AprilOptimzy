{"id":15901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse","text":"A mouse (plural \"mice\") is a rodent, which is a kind of mammal.\nIt has a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\"Mus musculus\"). Usually, house mice are brownish-gray. It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are also common. They are known to invade homes for food and occasionally shelter.\nThese small animals are often used in science experiments, or sometimes kept as pets. Some mice carry diseases. In some places they damage crops. This causes some people to think of mice as vermin or pests. Many other people think mice are cute and fun animals.\nMice are rodents, therefore they are related to squirrels, rats, and beavers. Mice eat weeds, seeds, berries, and more. They are eaten by owls, foxes, and cats, amongst others.\nTypes of mice.\nThe word \"mouse\" should only be used for small murines, but does get used for other distantly-related small rodents. The murines are the largest subfamily of mammals. In fact, it is larger than almost all mammal orders.\nHouse mouse.\nThe common house mouse is thought of as a pest. They are found in the homes of humans.\nVole.\nVoles are \"not\" mice, they are in a different family of rodents.\nDeer mouse.\nThese are not mice either, or only distantly related. These mice live in forests. They can run and jump better than mice, and they get their common name from this.\nThe aggressive \"grasshopper mouse\" rarely eats other mice, but it does like grasshoppers and insects. It is also only a distant relative.\nMice in media.\nAnthropomorphism makes cartoon mice look and act more like people than like real mice. For example, the Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse walk, talk, and act like people. Jerry, the mouse star of Tom and Jerry cartoons, is similarly humanized.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":9},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":29},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":56},{"uri":"House_mouse","surface_form":"house mouse","offset":202},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":436},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":462},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":470},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":504},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":526},{"uri":"Crops","surface_form":"crops","offset":563},{"uri":"Vermin","surface_form":"vermin","offset":614},{"uri":"Pest_(biology)","surface_form":"pest","offset":624},{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":734},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":745},{"uri":"Beaver","surface_form":"beaver","offset":755},{"uri":"Weed","surface_form":"weed","offset":773},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":780},{"uri":"Berries","surface_form":"berries","offset":787},{"uri":"Owl","surface_form":"owl","offset":824},{"uri":"Foxes","surface_form":"foxes","offset":830},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":841},{"uri":"Murinae","surface_form":"murines","offset":925},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"orders","offset":1090},{"uri":"Anthropomorphism","surface_form":"Anthropomorphism","offset":1598},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Pictures","surface_form":"Disney","offset":1702},{"uri":"Mickey_Mouse","surface_form":"Mickey","offset":1720},{"uri":"Minnie_Mouse","surface_form":"Minnie Mouse","offset":1731},{"uri":"Tom_and_Jerry","surface_form":"Tom and Jerry","offset":1802}]}
