{"id":15902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars","text":"Advance Wars is a video game for the Game Boy Advance. It is based on earlier games for Nintendo systems such as the Famicom and Game Boy. It is a strategy game: players must think of ways to win.\nThe game can be played with two, three, or four players at a time. Each player takes turns controlling their military-style playing pieces, called \"units.\" Every unit can move along the playing field, which is split up into squares. The amount of squares a unit can move in one turn is different for each unit.\nMost units can attack other units. Each unit has its own strength and defense. Strength is how much damage the unit can do to another unit. Defense is how much damage it can avoid taking whenever it is attacked. For example, the tank unit has more defense than the soldier, so even though the helicopter always has the same amount of attacking power, it can do more damage to the soldier than the tank.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance","offset":37},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":88},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":306}]}
