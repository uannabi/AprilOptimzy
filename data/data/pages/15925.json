{"id":15925,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lucifer is another name for \"Satan\". This is because people interpret a passage in the Book of Isaiah of the Bible in a certain way. Lucifer is Latin. It is made of two parts, \"lux-lucis\" (light) and \"ferre\" (to bring).\nThere are two mentions of \"Lucifer\" in the Latin Vulgate. is used to refer to the morning star, the planet Venus that appears at dawn: once in to translate the Greek word \"\u03A6\u03C9\u03C3\u03C6\u03CC\u03C1\u03BF\u03C2\" (Phosphoros), which has exactly the same literal meaning of \"Light-Bringer\" that \"Lucifer\" has in Latin; and once in to translate \"\u05D4\u05D9\u05DC\u05DC\" (H\u00EAl\u0113l), which also means \"Morning Star\".\nLatin name for the Morning Star.\n\"Lucifer\" is the Latin name for the \"Morning Star\", both in prose and poetry, as seen in works by Marcus Terentius Varro (116\u201327 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC) and other early Latin writers\nLucifer as Devil character of the Bible.\nLucifer is the epitome of evil in the Christian religion. Lucifer is believed by some to be Satan's name when he was still an angel, but it is Latin for 'light bringer' and not originally in the Bible.\nThe word \"Lucifer\" was also used in Latin to mean the \"morningstar\", the planet Venus, and this word was used in the Latin version of Isaiah 14, where the Hebrew version was speaking to a king of Babylonia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satan","surface_form":"Satan","offset":42},{"uri":"Book_of_Isaiah","surface_form":"Book of Isaiah","offset":100},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":122},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":157},{"uri":"Vulgate","surface_form":"Vulgate","offset":282},{"uri":"Venus_(planet)","surface_form":"Venus","offset":340},{"uri":"Dawn","surface_form":"dawn","offset":362},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":393},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Morning Star","offset":664},{"uri":"Marcus_Terentius_Varro","surface_form":"Marcus Terentius Varro","offset":725},{"uri":"Cicero","surface_form":"Cicero","offset":761},{"uri":"Devil","surface_form":"evil","offset":877},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":889},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":977},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":994},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":1046},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus","offset":1133},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1241},{"uri":"Babylonia","surface_form":"Babylonia","offset":1249}]}
