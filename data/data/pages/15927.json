{"id":15927,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology","text":"Astrobiology is the study of life in outer space. The field of astrobiology looks for conditions necessary for life, like liquid water, a good temperature, or the presence of oxygen.\nSome possible places to find life in the solar system are Europa, Ganymede, moons of Jupiter, or Titan, and Enceladus, moons of Saturn. These places may have liquid water. They may be too cold to support life on their surfaces, but if they have liquid water, the water must be warm enough to support life. Astrobiologists suggest that there may be a liquid water ocean under their surfaces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":29},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":37},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":129},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":143},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":175},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":224},{"uri":"Europa_(moon)","surface_form":"Europa","offset":241},{"uri":"Ganymede","surface_form":"Ganymede","offset":249},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":268},{"uri":"Titan_(moon)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":280},{"uri":"Enceladus","surface_form":"Enceladus","offset":291},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":311}]}
