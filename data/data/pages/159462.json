{"id":159462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_(Sum_41_song)","text":"\"Always\" is a single by Sum 41, released on their first complicity album '. It is the only new song on the record, recorded especially for this release, and was released as a radio single on December 9, 2008.\nAlthough the album was released on November 26, 2008, the song was released to the public for free listening on the Universal Japan website on November 11, 2008.\nOverview.\n\"Always\" is not a typical Sum 41 song. It switches tempos back and forth during the whole song, from an acoustic slow intro to an up-tempo verse and chorus, up until a quiet piano break, again into an up-tempo chorus, and back to a totally stripped acoustic slow break from the whole tempo of the song. The song features a prominent use of piano and acoustic guitar, and has a much heavier sound than the one present on the band's last album \"Underclass Hero\".\nLike the band's last effort, \"Underclass Hero\", the song was totally produced, mixed and engineered by lead singer Deryck Whibley himself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":14},{"uri":"Sum_41","surface_form":"Sum 41","offset":24},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"complicity album","offset":56},{"uri":"Radio_airplay","surface_form":"radio","offset":175},{"uri":"Universal_Japan","surface_form":"Universal Japan","offset":325},{"uri":"Sum_41","surface_form":"Sum 41","offset":407},{"uri":"Acoustic_music","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":485},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":555},{"uri":"Acoustic_music","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":630},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":721},{"uri":"Acoustic_guitar","surface_form":"acoustic guitar","offset":731},{"uri":"Underclass_Hero_(album)","surface_form":"Underclass Hero","offset":824},{"uri":"Underclass_Hero","surface_form":"Underclass Hero","offset":872},{"uri":"Deryck_Whibley","surface_form":"Deryck Whibley","offset":957}]}
