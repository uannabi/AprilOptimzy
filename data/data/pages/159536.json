{"id":159536,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzerainty","text":"e=\"preserve\">Suzerainty (American accent: soo-zer-en-tee) happens when a country X has its own government but cannot act independently because of a more powerful country Y. This more powerful country Y is called the suzerain and can usually control the foreign relations of X (how X interacts with other countries).\nIt differs from sovereignty in that the tributary still has limited control of its own stuff and internal country affairs.\nA suzerain can also mean a feudal lord. Vassals must pay tribute to the feudal lord.\nSome examples.\nChina historically had suzerainty over Mongolia, Korea, Japan, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"General_American","surface_form":"American accent","offset":25},{"uri":"Foreign_relations","surface_form":"foreign relations","offset":253},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"sovereignty","offset":332},{"uri":"Feudal","surface_form":"feudal","offset":466},{"uri":"Lord","surface_form":"lord","offset":473},{"uri":"Vassal","surface_form":"Vassal","offset":479},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":539},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":578},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":588},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":595},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":602},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":611},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":621}]}
