African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way. Other groups of people that have been or still are being treated as second class citizens are the Dalit of India, and Arab Christians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":97},{"uri":"Legal_resident","surface_form":"legal resident","offset":108},{"uri":"Violation","surface_form":"violation","offset":168},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":181},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":195},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":230},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"segregation","offset":251},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":264},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":286},{"uri":"African","surface_form":"African","offset":319},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":341},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"apartheid","offset":360},{"uri":"Untouchables","surface_form":"Dalit","offset":503},{"uri":"Arab_Christians","surface_form":"Arab Christians","offset":523}]}
