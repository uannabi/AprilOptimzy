Ia\u015Fi used to be the capital of Moldavia.\nHistory.\nAlexandru L\u0103pu\u015Fneanu changed the capital of Moldavia from Suceava to Ia\u015Fi in 1564. One of the first churches to be built in Moldavia was built by the Greek adventurer Prince Ioan Iacob Heraclid.\nThe Tatars burned the city down in 1513. The Ottoman Empire also burned the city down in 1538 and people from the Imperial Russian army did so again in 1686. The plague spread throughout the city in 1734.\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1787 was stopped when the Peace of Ia\u015Fi happened. Alexander Ypsilanti and the Filiki Eteria came into the city and took it in 1822.\nIa\u015Fi was the capital of Moldavia from 1568 to 1859. When World War I happened, Ia\u015Fi became the capital of Romania. This happened when the Central Powers took Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Bucharest became the capital again when Imperial Germany was defeated.\nGeography.\nIa\u015Fi can be found on the Bahlui River, which is a tributary of the Jijia. Forests and uplands are very common. These woods and hills include the monasteries of Cet\u0103\u0163uia, Frumoasa, and Galata. People have thought that Ia\u015Fi was built on seven hills (Cet\u0103\u0163uia, Galata, Copou-Aurora, Bucium-P\u0103un, \u015Eorogari, Repedea and Breazu in Romanian).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":10},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":43},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":108},{"uri":"Moldavia","surface_form":"Moldavia","offset":145},{"uri":"Alexandru_L%C4%83pu%C5%9Fneanu","surface_form":"Alexandru L\u0103pu\u015Fneanu","offset":164},{"uri":"Suceava","surface_form":"Suceava","offset":222},{"uri":"1564","surface_form":"1564","offset":241},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":264},{"uri":"Built","surface_form":"built","offset":279},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":314},{"uri":"Ioan_Iacob_Heraclid","surface_form":"Ioan Iacob Heraclid","offset":338},{"uri":"Nogais","surface_form":"Tatars","offset":363},{"uri":"1513","surface_form":"1513","offset":394},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":404},{"uri":"1538","surface_form":"1538","offset":448},{"uri":"Imperial_Russia","surface_form":"Imperial Russia","offset":473},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":490},{"uri":"1686","surface_form":"1686","offset":511},{"uri":"Bubonic_plague","surface_form":"plague","offset":521},{"uri":"Spread","surface_form":"spread","offset":528},{"uri":"1734","surface_form":"1734","offset":558},{"uri":"Russo-Turkish_War%2C_1787-1792","surface_form":"Russo-Turkish War of 1787","offset":568},{"uri":"Peace_of_Ia%C5%9Fi","surface_form":"Peace of Ia\u015Fi","offset":615},{"uri":"Alexandro_Ypsilanti_(1792%E2%80%931828)","surface_form":"Alexander Ypsilanti","offset":639},{"uri":"Filiki_Eteria","surface_form":"Filiki Eteria","offset":667},{"uri":"1822","surface_form":"1822","offset":715},{"uri":"1568","surface_form":"1568","offset":759},{"uri":"1859","surface_form":"1859","offset":767},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":778},{"uri":"Central_Powers","surface_form":"Central Powers","offset":859},{"uri":"6_December","surface_form":"6 December","offset":892},{"uri":"1916","surface_form":"1916","offset":903},{"uri":"Imperial_Germany","surface_form":"Imperial Germany","offset":949},{"uri":"Defeat","surface_form":"defeated","offset":970},{"uri":"Bahlui_River","surface_form":"Bahlui River","offset":1016},{"uri":"Jijia_River_(Prut)","surface_form":"Jijia","offset":1058},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"Forest","offset":1065},{"uri":"Upland","surface_form":"upland","offset":1077},{"uri":"Common","surface_form":"common","offset":1094},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monasteries","offset":1136},{"uri":"Cet%C4%83%C5%A3uia","surface_form":"Cet\u0103\u0163uia","offset":1151},{"uri":"Frumoasa","surface_form":"Frumoasa","offset":1161},{"uri":"Galata%2C_Ia%C5%9Fi","surface_form":"Galata","offset":1175},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":1316}]}
