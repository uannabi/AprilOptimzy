{"id":159566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania","text":"The Kingdom of Romania (or 'Romania' after 1969) was a constitutional monarchy which existed between 13 March 1881 and 30 December 1947, specified by the First (in 1866), and respectively, the Second Constitution of Roumania. Thus, the Kingdom of Romania began with the reign of King Carol I of Romania.\nFrom 1859 to 1877, Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) to a full-fledged independent kingdom. During 1918-20, at the end of World War I, Transylvania, Eastern Moldavia (Bessarabia), and Bukovina were united with the Kingdom of Romania. In 1940, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja were ceded to the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria. In 1947 the last king was compelled to abdicate from throne. Socialist republic ruled by the Romanian Communist Party replaced the monarchy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":28},{"uri":"Constitutional_monarchy","surface_form":"constitutional monarchy","offset":55},{"uri":"Carol_I_of_Romania","surface_form":"Carol I of Romania","offset":284},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":323},{"uri":"Personal_union","surface_form":"personal union","offset":346},{"uri":"Moldavia","surface_form":"Moldavia","offset":391},{"uri":"Wallachia","surface_form":"Wallachia","offset":404},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":484},{"uri":"Transylvania","surface_form":"Transylvania","offset":497},{"uri":"Bessarabia","surface_form":"Bessarabia","offset":529},{"uri":"Bukovina","surface_form":"Bukovina","offset":546},{"uri":"Bessarabia","surface_form":"Bessarabia","offset":605},{"uri":"Bukovina","surface_form":"Bukovina","offset":626},{"uri":"Northern_Transylvania","surface_form":"Northern Transylvania","offset":636},{"uri":"Dobruja","surface_form":"Southern Dobruja","offset":662},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":697},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":711},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":723},{"uri":"Communist_Romania","surface_form":"Socialist republic","offset":794},{"uri":"Romanian_Communist_Party","surface_form":"Romanian Communist Party","offset":826}]}
