{"id":159568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Trianon","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Treaty of Trianon is the peace treaty formed in 1920 by the Allies of World War I on one side, and Hungary, on the other.\nHungary lost much of its land to neighbouring countries, such as Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Hungary was partitioned, lost two thirds of her territory, and lost one-third of her Hungarian population. This brought irredentism. Hungary also had to pay World War I reparations. The treaty limited the size of the Hungarian army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":42},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":48},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_I","surface_form":"Allies of World War I","offset":77},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":116},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":204},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":213},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":232},{"uri":"Irredentism","surface_form":"irredentism","offset":364},{"uri":"World_War_I_reparations","surface_form":"World War I reparations","offset":401}]}
