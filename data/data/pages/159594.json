{"id":159594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LYR_electric_units","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) electrified urban railway lines in Liverpool and Manchester in order to improve the service offered against the competition being put up by new electric trams.\nLiverpool to Southport.\nThe line between Liverpool and Southport began using electric multiple units (EMUs) on 22 March 1904. Power was supplied from a third rail at 625 Volts direct current.\nLiverpool Overhead Railway.\nConnections were built with the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR) at Seaforth & Litherland railway station to a new station beside LOR's Seaforth Sands station. Also from the North Mersey Branch route to Aintree. From 2 July 1905 LOR trains began to run through to Seaforth and Litherland. In 1906 the L&YR electrified the line to Aintree.\nLiverpool to Ormskirk.\nElectrification to Ormskirk was completed in 1913.\nBury to Holcombe Brook.\nFrom 1913 an experimental electric service operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook. The equipment was provided by Dick, Kerr & Co. of Preston, which was developing its products for export.\nThe system used was 3,500 Volts DC from overhead lines. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1,200 V DC system chosen for the Manchester to Bury line.\nManchester to Bury.\nAfter the Holcombe Brook service, the L&YR decided to electrify the Manchester to Bury line. The system used was 1,200 V DC from a side-contact third rail. The purpose of this unusual arrangement was to prevent the service being affected by ice forming on the live rail. Sixty-six cars were built at Newton Heath works. The electrical equipment was supplied by Dick, Kerr & Co. The first public services ran on 17 April 1916,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway","surface_form":"Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway","offset":17},{"uri":"Railway_electrification_system","surface_form":"electrified","offset":57},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":92},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":106},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"tram","offset":210},{"uri":"Southport","surface_form":"Southport","offset":272},{"uri":"Electric_multiple_unit","surface_form":"electric multiple unit","offset":294},{"uri":"Third_rail","surface_form":"third rail","offset":369},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"Volt","offset":387},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"direct current","offset":393},{"uri":"Liverpool_Overhead_Railway","surface_form":"Liverpool Overhead Railway","offset":469},{"uri":"Aintree","surface_form":"Aintree","offset":640},{"uri":"Ormskirk","surface_form":"Ormskirk","offset":818},{"uri":"Bury","surface_form":"Bury","offset":934},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"Volt","offset":1090},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"DC","offset":1096},{"uri":"Overhead_lines","surface_form":"overhead lines","offset":1104},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":1304},{"uri":"Bury","surface_form":"Bury","offset":1318},{"uri":"Third_rail","surface_form":"third rail","offset":1380}]}
