{"id":15965,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballerina","text":"A ballerina is a name given to a female ballet dancer. Only very good female ballet dancers are called ballerinas. A ballerina is a principal dancer in a classical ballet company. The highest ranking female dancer in a company was usually called the prima ballerina.\nToday the term 'ballerina' has gone rather out of fashion. Now they are simply called 'Principal dancers'. Dancers in a company are ranked by the company, and paid accordingly. They have to prove themselves in lesser parts before they can get promoted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":33},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":40},{"uri":"Rank","surface_form":"rank","offset":399}]}
