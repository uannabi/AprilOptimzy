{"id":15978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan","text":"Jackie Chan (\u6210\u9F8D) (born Chan Kong-Sang on 7 April 1954) SBS, MBE, PMW is a famous and well-renown martial artist, stuntman, actor, director, producer, screenwriter, singer and entrepreneur who hails from Hong Kong. He is perhaps most famous and best known for his uncanny combination and twist of both action and comedy in his films. He has also appeared and provided the voice for his character's animated counterpart in the animated TV series \"Jackie Chan Adventures\" which originally aired from 2000-2005. He is also the famous and well-renown legendary and rich father of actor and singer Jaycee Chan.\nIn his earlier roles, Chan did all of the dangerous stunts without safety equipment. Possibly the role where this was taken farthest is \"Rumble in the Bronx\", which was his ultimate breakthrough American movie, where he subjected his already aging body to several leaps and falls, which while finally gaining his American stardom, led to injuries including a broken ankle.\nHis 2 worst injuries occurred during the making of \"Armour of God\" and \"Police Story\". Footage of the former's aftermath was shown over the credits and showed a subdued and bloodied Chan in a spinal injury stretcher. Also, a tree branch in which he was to swing off had snapped just when he did jump upon and over for it. Chan fell 10 meters onto the rocky ground.\nIn \"Police Story\", Chan was doing a stunt when and where he fell off from about 5 to 6 stories through a series of window canopies. Chan nearly became disorientated about halfway through down. Instead of landing on upon his feet, Chan fell in a head-down position. His arms became caught in the material of the last canopy. He landed on his head first and his head was then forced on to the side as he could not break his fall up with his arms.\nWhile the \"Police Story\" fall looked worse, Chan has also said that the \"Armour of God\" fall was the closest he has come to death while filming.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Member_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"MBE","offset":60},{"uri":"Martial_artist","surface_form":"martial artist","offset":97},{"uri":"Stuntman","surface_form":"stuntman","offset":113},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":123},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"director","offset":130},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":140},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"screenwriter","offset":150},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":164},{"uri":"Entrepreneur","surface_form":"entrepreneur","offset":175},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":203},{"uri":"Action","surface_form":"action","offset":301},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":312},{"uri":"Jackie_Chan_Adventures","surface_form":"Jackie Chan Adventures","offset":445},{"uri":"Jaycee_Chan","surface_form":"Jaycee Chan","offset":592},{"uri":"Stuntman","surface_form":"stunt","offset":657},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":679},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":800},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":809},{"uri":"Ankle","surface_form":"ankle","offset":971},{"uri":"Vertebral_column","surface_form":"spinal","offset":1170},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":1203},{"uri":"Meters","surface_form":"meters","offset":1313},{"uri":"Ground","surface_form":"ground","offset":1335},{"uri":"Window","surface_form":"window","offset":1458},{"uri":"Canopy","surface_form":"canopies","offset":1465},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":1588},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":1638}]}
