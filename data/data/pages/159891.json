{"id":159891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houlgate","text":"Houlgate is a small tourist resort in northwestern France along the English Channel with a beach and a casino. It is a commune in the Calvados department in the Basse-Normandie region.\nHistory.\nIt began as a hamlet in the commune of Beuzeval which was a very old parish and was part of the fiefdom of the Ach\u00E9 (or Achey). There were many different lords because several different families inherited the title through marriage, until gradually the land of the Beuzeval was sold to farmers. The parish was eventually controlled by Houlgate. On the south side of the river Drochon, between 1845 and 1850, sea bathing attracted summer visitors.\nGeography.\nHoulgate is located along the English Channel in the valley of the Drochon. The valley is mostly built up or used for animal grazing. The town's area is 4.69\u00A0km\u00B2 and the average altitude 5 m. Despite its low average height, the town contains two hills which form the natural limits of the commune.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":51},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":68},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":119},{"uri":"Calvados_(department)","surface_form":"Calvados","offset":134},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":143},{"uri":"Basse-Normandie","surface_form":"Basse-Normandie","offset":161},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":177},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":682}]}
