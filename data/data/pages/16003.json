{"id":16003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollington","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bollington is a village in Cheshire. The village is home to over twenty pubs. Bollington was home to the biggest water wheel in England and only second in Britain to the Laxey wheel in the Isle of Man. The wheel powered huge mills for the production of cotton. Two of the huge mills were the Adelphi and Clarence.\nBy 1914 Bollington had a population of around 6000 people and was dominated by fine cotton spinning. The symbol of Bollington has to be White Nancy. A small white cone-like house stands alone on top of a hill overlooking all of Bollington. It was built by the Gaskell family early in the nineteenth century. It has now been sealed.\nSport has been important in the life of Bollington. Even though the village did not have a football team successful enough to rival the cricket team it was still very popular amongst the people of Bollington. The most popular team was St Johns team which was quite successful in the lower leagues. Today there are good teams competing in the amateur leagues such as Bollington United.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":29},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":40},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pub","offset":85},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":168},{"uri":"Laxey","surface_form":"Laxey","offset":183},{"uri":"Isle_of_Man","surface_form":"Isle of Man","offset":202},{"uri":"Mill_(grinding)","surface_form":"mills","offset":238},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":266},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":352},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"nineteenth century","offset":615},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"Sport","offset":659},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":750},{"uri":"Team","surface_form":"team","offset":759},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":795}]}
