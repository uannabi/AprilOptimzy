It is in Basse-Normandie in the Calvados department in northwest France.\nThe name translates to \"Saint Mary beyond the Water\".\nHistory.\nThe village is small today. Up to the early 20th century it was a group of farms. Until a few years ago, there was no road connecting the village to Pont-Farcy. So, it was very isolated.\nGeography.\nThe village is 1 kilometer from Pont-Farcy. It is along the D307 Road. The village is a collection of farm houses. It also has a church. The total population is just 81. However this probably includes the neighbouring farms as well. Other nearby settlements are Pont-Bellanger and Beaumesnil. The nearest large towns are Villedieu-les-Poeles and Vire.\nThe village is close to the Calvados tourist spot \"Grotte de Bion\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":30},{"uri":"Basse-Normandie","surface_form":"Basse-Normandie","offset":48},{"uri":"Calvados_(department)","surface_form":"Calvados","offset":71},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":80},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":104},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translates","offset":121},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":250},{"uri":"Pont-Farcy","surface_form":"Pont-Farcy","offset":324},{"uri":"Isolated","surface_form":"isolated","offset":352},{"uri":"Pont-Farcy","surface_form":"Pont-Farcy","offset":405},{"uri":"Pont-Bellanger","surface_form":"Pont-Bellanger","offset":635},{"uri":"Beaumesnil%2C_Calvados","surface_form":"Beaumesnil","offset":654},{"uri":"Villedieu-les-Poeles","surface_form":"Villedieu-les-Poeles","offset":694},{"uri":"Vire","surface_form":"Vire","offset":719}]}
