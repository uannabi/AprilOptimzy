{"id":160459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_(Cyrillic)","text":"Ee (\u0418, \u0438) is the ninth letter in the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [i] or [ee].\nIt looks like a backwards N. The lowercase \u0438's italic looks like a \"\u0438\". Its old name was \"izhe\".\nIt came from the Greek eta and stands for the Roman I.\nThere is another letter, the decimal I (\"\u0406\", \"\u0456\"), that sounds the same as \u0418. Russian, Macedonian, Serbian and Bulgarian languages use only \u0418; and Church Slavonic and Ukrainian uses both \u0418 and \u0456. To tell the letters apart, \u0418 is sometimes called \"octal I\" because was eighth in the Cyrillic numeral system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":37},{"uri":"N","surface_form":"N","offset":110},{"uri":"Lowercase","surface_form":"lowercase","offset":117},{"uri":"Italic","surface_form":"italic","offset":131},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek","offset":198},{"uri":"Eta_(letter)","surface_form":"eta","offset":204},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Roman","offset":227},{"uri":"I","surface_form":"I","offset":233},{"uri":"Decimal_I","surface_form":"decimal I","offset":265},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":314},{"uri":"Macedonian_language","surface_form":"Macedonian","offset":323},{"uri":"Serbian_language","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":335},{"uri":"Bulgarian_language","surface_form":"Bulgarian","offset":347},{"uri":"Church_Slavonic","surface_form":"Church Slavonic","offset":383},{"uri":"Ukrainian_language","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":403}]}
