Niagara falls is very well known for both its beauty and hydroelectric power. It is been a tourist attraction, commercial site and hydroelectricity source since the 19th century.\nIt is located near Niagara Falls, New York in the United States and Niagara Falls, Ontario in Canada.The volume of water approaching the falls during peak flow season may sometimes be as much as 225,000 cubic feet (6,400 m3) per second. The cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges.\nNiagara Falls were formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age). Water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean. The Escarpment has hard limestone on top and soft shale below.\nAlthough not very high, Niagara Falls is very wide, and is probably the most popular waterfall in the world. The Horseshoe Falls are the largest out of the three falls. It is named the Horseshoe Falls because it looks like a horse shoe.\nNiagara Falls is a very popular tourist destination and many people visit it on holiday in Canada.\nNiagara Falls is one Canada's proudest places.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":51},{"uri":"Niagara_River","surface_form":"Niagara River","offset":69},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":94},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":135},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":153},{"uri":"Horseshoe_Falls","surface_form":"Horseshoe Falls","offset":191},{"uri":"American_Falls","surface_form":"American Falls","offset":249},{"uri":"Bridal_Veil_Falls","surface_form":"Bridal Veil Falls","offset":281},{"uri":"Goat_Island","surface_form":"Goat Island","offset":362},{"uri":"Luna_Island","surface_form":"Luna Island","offset":442},{"uri":"Hydroelectricity","surface_form":"hydroelectricity","offset":586},{"uri":"Niagara_Falls%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Niagara Falls, New York","offset":653},{"uri":"Niagara_Falls%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Niagara Falls, Ontario","offset":702},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":1071},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":1140},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":1213},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":1253},{"uri":"Horseshoe","surface_form":"horse shoe","offset":1517}]}
