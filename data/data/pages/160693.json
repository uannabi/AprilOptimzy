{"id":160693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatwick_Express","text":"Gatwick Express is the name of a fast train service that runs on the Brighton Main Line, a railway line between Victoria station in London and the city of Brighton and Hove in South East England, stopping at Gatwick Airport on the way. It is fast because it does not stop at any stations between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport.\nA Gatwick Express train leaves London Victoria station every 15 minutes and takes 30 minutes to get to Gatwick Airport station. After arriving at Gatwick Airport, at least every other train on weekdays and Saturdays continues non-stop to Brighton railway station. At peak hours, every train continues to Brighton, but makes two stops between Gatwick and Brighton. On Sundays, all trains end at Gatwick Airport; there are no trains to and from Brighton.\nBefore June 2008, Gatwick Express was a train operating company (TOC) and was a franchise owned by Southern, another TOC that has trains on other routes. On 22 June 2008, the Gatwick Express TOC was closed. Now the Gatwick Express is directly operated by Southern, but it is still called Gatwick Express.\nTrains.\nThe Gatwick Express service has used many types of trains over the years. Most of them were designed just for the service.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["rail company"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":38},{"uri":"London_Victoria_station","surface_form":"Victoria station","offset":112},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":132},{"uri":"Brighton_and_Hove","surface_form":"Brighton and Hove","offset":155},{"uri":"South_East_England","surface_form":"South East England","offset":176},{"uri":"London_Gatwick_Airport","surface_form":"Gatwick Airport","offset":208},{"uri":"Train_operating_company","surface_form":"train operating company","offset":826},{"uri":"Franchise","surface_form":"franchise","offset":866},{"uri":"Southern_(train_operating_company)","surface_form":"Southern","offset":885}]}
