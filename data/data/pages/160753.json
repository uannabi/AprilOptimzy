It was made up of almost all of the French region of Alsace and about a quarter of Lorraine, hence its name. France took it back in 1918 and it became part of that country as a result of Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Nazi Germany \"de facto\" took it back in 1940 but France took it back in 1945.\nThe territory has been part of France since then. In 2016 it became part of the Region of Grand Est.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":57},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":82},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":129},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":186},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":193},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":203},{"uri":"Lorraine","surface_form":"Lorraine","offset":233},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Treaty of Versailles","offset":337},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":367},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":381},{"uri":"Grand_Est","surface_form":"Grand Est","offset":535}]}
