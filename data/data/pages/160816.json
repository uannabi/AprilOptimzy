{"id":160816,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_station","text":"Paddington railway station, also known as London Paddington, is a main National Rail, and London Underground station, in the Baker Street area of northwest central London.\nThe site is old. It has been as the London end of the Great Western Railway and its successors since 1838. Much of the current mainline station dates from 1854, and was made by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The site was first served by Underground trains in 1863, and was the first western end point of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway.\nThe station has been made better not long ago. It now has an extra job as the London end point for the Heathrow Express airport service. Paddington is in Travelcard Zone 1.\nRail.\nThere are also trains to Slough, Ealing, Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead.\nTwo trains from Paddington go to Heathrow Airport. The Heathrow Express travels, and doesn't stop, at a high fare. The Heathrow Connect takes the same line but, calls at most stations.\nNational Rail.\nThe National Rail part is named London Paddington, a name used outside London, but not by many people who live there. Parts of the station, like the main train shed, were built in 1854 by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London end point for the Great Western Railway (GWR). Today, it is one of 18 UK railway stations looked after by Network Rail.\nPaddington has 14 end platforms, numbered 1 to 14. Platforms 1 to 8 are below the oldest three parts of Brunel's 1854 train shed, and platforms 9 to 12 are below the fourth part. Platforms 13 and 14 are within the Metropolitan Railway's old Bishop's Road station to the north-west. There are two through platforms, 15 and 16, used by the London Underground's Hammersmith & City and Circle lines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Rail","surface_form":"National Rail","offset":71},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":90},{"uri":"Baker_Street","surface_form":"Baker Street","offset":125},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":164},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":226},{"uri":"Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel","surface_form":"Isambard Kingdom Brunel","offset":349},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Railway","surface_form":"Metropolitan Railway","offset":474},{"uri":"Rapid_transit","surface_form":"underground railway","offset":514},{"uri":"Heathrow_Express","surface_form":"Heathrow Express","offset":638},{"uri":"Travelcard_Zone_1","surface_form":"Travelcard Zone 1","offset":689},{"uri":"Heathrow_Airport","surface_form":"Heathrow Airport","offset":755},{"uri":"Heathrow_Airport","surface_form":"Heathrow Airport","offset":821},{"uri":"Heathrow_Express","surface_form":"Heathrow Express","offset":843},{"uri":"Heathrow_Connect","surface_form":"Heathrow Connect","offset":907},{"uri":"Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel","surface_form":"Isambard Kingdom Brunel","offset":1176},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":1232},{"uri":"Network_Rail","surface_form":"Network Rail","offset":1320},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":1672},{"uri":"Hammersmith_%26amp%3B_City_line","surface_form":"Hammersmith & City","offset":1693},{"uri":"Circle_line_(London_Underground)","surface_form":"Circle","offset":1716}]}
