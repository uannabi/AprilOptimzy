{"id":160947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Rift_Valley","text":"The Great Rift Valley is a name given to the continuous geographical trench, about 6,000 kilometres (3,700\u00A0mi) in length, that runs from northern Syria in Southwest Asia to central Mozambique in East Africa. The rift is bordered by a series of mountains and active volcanoes. It is a site of faults and earthquakes.\nBasically, the western part of Africa is rifting away from the eastern part body. This causes all the geological activity at the Valley. Far in the future, a sea will run between these two parts of Africa. The Arabian peninsula is already almost separated. The whole process is part of plate tectonics. In eastern Africa, the valley divides into two, the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley.\nThere are about 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites which owe their formation to the geography and geology of the Great Rift Valley.\nThe Western Rift Valley.\nThe Western Rift is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 metres deep at Lake Tanganyika). Much of this area is inside national parks.\nLake Victoria, the second largest area freshwater lake in the world, is between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.\nThe African Great Lakes are a series of lakes formed by the action of the tectonic East African Rift on the continent of Africa. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world in terms of surface area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest in volume as well as the second deepest.\nEastern Rift Valley.\nThe lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind.\nLake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa: the name is disputed) is the most southern of the Great Lakes, and empties into the great Zambezi River via the Shire River.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geographical","surface_form":"geographical","offset":56},{"uri":"Trench","surface_form":"trench","offset":69},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":146},{"uri":"Southwest_Asia","surface_form":"Southwest Asia","offset":155},{"uri":"Mozambique","surface_form":"Mozambique","offset":181},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":195},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":244},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":265},{"uri":"Fault_(geology)","surface_form":"faults","offset":292},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":303},{"uri":"Rift_(geology)","surface_form":"rifting","offset":357},{"uri":"Arabia","surface_form":"Arabia","offset":526},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":534},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":602},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":739},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":746},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":1012},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":1059},{"uri":"Lake_Victoria","surface_form":"Lake Victoria","offset":1121},{"uri":"Tectonic","surface_form":"tectonic","offset":1400},{"uri":"Lake_Victoria","surface_form":"Lake Victoria","offset":1468},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":1502},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":1562},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":1765},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"evaporation","offset":1788},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":1820},{"uri":"Zambezi_River","surface_form":"Zambezi River","offset":1952}]}
