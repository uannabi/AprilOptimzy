{"id":161,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus","text":"Calculus is a branch of mathematics that helps us understand changes between values that are related by a function. For example, given a formula indicating how much money one gets every day, calculus would help one understand related formulas, such as how much money one has in total, and whether one is getting more or less money than before. Many of these formulas are functions of time, and one way to think of calculus is to see it as a study of functions of time.\nThere are two different types of calculus. Differential calculus divides things into small (\"different\") pieces, and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while integral calculus joins (\"integrates\") the small pieces together, and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different areas such as physics, astronomy, biology, engineering, economics, medicine and sociology.\nHistory.\nIn the 1670s and 1680s, Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany figured out calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see planets in the sky, because astronomy had always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships. Leibniz wanted to measure the space (area) under a curve (a line that is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz. Most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in physics. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it.\nThey were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world \u2014 Aristotle and Pythagoras came earlier, and so did Galileo Galilei, who said that mathematics was the language of science. But both Newton and Leibniz were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time, and can predict how they will change in the future.\nThe name \"calculus\" was the Latin word for a small stone the ancient Romans used in counting and gambling. The English word \"calculate\" comes from the same Latin word.\nDifferential calculus.\nDifferential calculus is used to find the rate of change of a variable\u2014compared to another variable.\nIn the real world, it can be used to find the speed of a moving object, or to understand how electricity and magnetism work. It is very important for understanding physics\u2014and many other areas of science.\nDifferential calculus is also useful for graphing. It can be used to find the slope of a curve, and the highest and lowest points of a curve (these are called the maximum and minimum, respectively).\nVariables can change their value. This is different from numbers because numbers are always the same. For example, the number 1 is always equal to 1, and the number 200 is always equal to 200. One often write variables as letters such as the letter x: \"x\" can be equal to 1 at one point and 200 at another.\nSome examples of variables are distance and time, because they can change. The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an average: maybe they travelled faster at some times (say on a highway), and slower at other times (say at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Certainly it is more difficult for a driver to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock\u2014without a speedometer.\nUntil calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process, and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.\nA very similar problem is to find the slope (how steep it is) at any point on a curve. The slope of a \"straight\" line is easy to work out \u2014 it is simply how much it goes up or down (\"y\" or vertical) divided by how much it goes across (\"x\" or horizontal). On a \"curve\", however, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If this is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a tangent. But there is no way to know (without complex mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.\nWhat Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly, using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope \"approached\" a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. The particular value it approached was the actual slope.\nGiven a function formula_1. \"f\" is short for function, so this equation means \"y is a function of x\". This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x (the horizontal axis) is at that time. For example, with the equation formula_1, we know that if formula_1 is 1, then formula_1 will be 1; if formula_1 is 3, then formula_1 will be 9; if \"formula_1\" is 20, then \"formula_1\" will be 400. The slope of the tangent line produced using this method here is formula_1, or 2 multiplied by \"formula_1\". So we know without having to draw any tangent line at any point on the curve formula_1 that the derivative, often written as formula_1 (marked with the prime symbol), will be formula_1 at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation, or finding the derivative.\nThe way to write the derivative in mathematics is\nformula_1\nformula_1.\nMathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules\u2014which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function.\nIntegral calculus.\nIntegral calculus is the process of calculating the area underneath a graph of a function. An example is calculating the distance a car travels: if one knows the speed of the car at different points in time and draw a graph of this speed, then the distance the car travels will be the area under the graph.\nThe way to do this is to divide the graph into many very small pieces, and then draw very thin rectangles under each piece. As the rectangles become thinner and thinner, the rectangles cover the area underneath the graph better and better. The area of a rectangle is easy to calculate, so we can calculate the total area of all the rectangles. For thinner rectangles, this total area value \"approaches\" the area underneath the graph. The final value of the area is called the \"integral\" of the function.\nIn mathematics, the integral of the function \"f(x)\" from \"a\"\u00A0 to \"b\", is written as\nformula_1.\nMain idea of calculus.\nThe main idea in calculus is called the fundamental theorem of calculus. This main idea says that the two calculus processes, differentiation and integration, are inverses of each other. That is, a person can use differentiation to undo an integration process. Also, a person can use integration to undo a differentiation. This is just like using division to \"undo\" multiplication, or addition to \"undo\" subtraction.\nIn a single sentence, the fundamental theorem runs something like this: \"The derivative of the integral of a function \"f\" is the function itself\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":24},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":106},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":371},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":838},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":847},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":858},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":867},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":880},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":891},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":904},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":952},{"uri":"Gottfried_Leibniz","surface_form":"Gottfried Leibniz","offset":980},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planets","offset":1140},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":1168},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":1317},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":1389},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematicians","offset":1598},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":1733},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":1894},{"uri":"Pythagoras","surface_form":"Pythagoras","offset":1908},{"uri":"Galileo_Galilei","surface_form":"Galileo Galilei","offset":1944},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":2202},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":2243},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"gambling","offset":2271},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":2427},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":2559},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":2575},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":2630},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":3208},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":3221},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":3256},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":3508},{"uri":"Slope","surface_form":"slope","offset":4182},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":4224},{"uri":"Straight","surface_form":"straight","offset":4247},{"uri":"Vertical","surface_form":"vertical","offset":4333},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":4386},{"uri":"Tangent_(geometry)","surface_form":"tangent","offset":4873},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":5244},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":5669},{"uri":"Vertical","surface_form":"vertical","offset":5766},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":5803},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"derivative","offset":6238},{"uri":"Prime_(symbol)","surface_form":"prime symbol","offset":6294},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":6574},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":6724},{"uri":"Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus","surface_form":"fundamental theorem of calculus","offset":7641}]}
