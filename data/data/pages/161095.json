{"id":161095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%27s_laws","text":"e=\"preserve\">Joule's laws are two: first about heat produced by an electric current, and second about how the energy of a gas relates to pressure, volume.\nWhere \"Q\" is the amount of heat, \"I\" is the electric current flowing through a conductor, \"R\" is the amount of electric resistance present in the conductor, and \"t\" is the amount of time that this happens for.\nJoule's second law says that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if volume and pressure change, but does change if temperature changes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":47},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":67},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":110},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":122},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":137},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":147},{"uri":"Internal_energy","surface_form":"internal energy","offset":398},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":426}]}
