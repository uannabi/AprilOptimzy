{"id":16130,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huckleberry","text":"Huckleberry is a name used in North America for several plants in two closely related genera in the family \"Ericaceae\": \"Gaylussacia\" and \"Vaccinium\". The huckleberry is the state fruit of Idaho.\nSome \"Vaccinium\" species, such as the red huckleberry, are always called huckleberries. Other species may be called blueberries or huckleberries in different locations.\nThere is much confusion in naming of berries in American English. The 'garden huckleberry' (\"Solanum melanocerasum\") is not a true huckleberry but a member of the nightshade family.\nThe fruit of most species of huckleberry can be eaten. The berries are small and round. They are usually less than 5\u00A0mm in diameter and contain 10 seeds. Berries range in color from bright red, through dark purple, and into the blues. In taste the berries range from tart to sweet. They have a flavor similar to that of a blueberry. Huckleberries are well liked by many mammals such as bears and humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":30},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":56},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":86},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":100},{"uri":"Ericaceae","surface_form":"Ericaceae","offset":108},{"uri":"Gaylussacia","surface_form":"Gaylussacia","offset":121},{"uri":"Vaccinium","surface_form":"Vaccinium","offset":139},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":174},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":180},{"uri":"Idaho","surface_form":"Idaho","offset":189},{"uri":"Red_huckleberry","surface_form":"red huckleberry","offset":234},{"uri":"Blueberry","surface_form":"blueberries","offset":312},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":402},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":413},{"uri":"Solanum","surface_form":"Solanum","offset":458},{"uri":"Nightshade","surface_form":"nightshade","offset":528},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":670},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":718},{"uri":"Tart","surface_form":"tart","offset":814},{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":822},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":917},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"bear","offset":933},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":943}]}
