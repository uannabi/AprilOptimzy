{"id":16131,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecake","text":"A cheesecake is a dessert cake made of cheese (usually cream cheese but sometimes ricotta), eggs, and sugar. It often has a graham cracker crumb crust, sometimes held together by melted butter. The filling has a very heavy, smooth texture. It sometimes has sour cream to make it easier to shape and may have fruit flavoring such as strawberry, blueberry, or lemon. It is often topped with fresh fruit or chocolate.\nHistory.\nCheesecake is now often thought to be part of American cooking, but it has a long history. Cheese making began around 2000, and scientists who study people in the past have found cheese molds almost as old.\nCheesecakes are known to go back to at least Greece. In the 100sAnno Domini, the writer Athenaeus's \"Dinner-Table Philosophers\" mentioned the poet Callimachus (around the 200s) used to have a book by an \"Aegimius\" about the art of making cheesecakes (, \"Plakountopouk\u00F3n S\u00FDngramma\"). Cheesecake may have been given to the sportspeople during the Olympic Games, which started in 776.\nEven before the Romans took over Greece, they had begun making cheesecakes as well. M. Porcius Cato's \"Book on Farming\" (written around 160) mentions three kinds of cakes', ', and 'for use as offerings to the gods. Placenta cakes were the closest to today's cheesecakes, since its crust and filling are made separately.\nEuropeans stopped using yeast and started adding beaten eggs to their cheesecakes around the 1700s. This made it taste more like a dessert than a cheesebread.\nCheesecake recipes were brought to the United States as people moved there from Europe. Most of today's kinds of cheesecake (\"New York-style cheesecake\") come from the kind created by William Lawrence of Chester, New York, in 1872. He was trying to make something like the soft French Neufch\u00E2tel cheese and ended up with a heavy, creamy \"unripened cheese\".\nTypes.\nThere is an all-garlic restaurant in Stockholm where they offer a garlic cheesecake.\nOther.\nSonya Thomas holds the world record for eating the most cheesecakes in a given time. She ate 11 pounds of cheesecake in nine minutes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":18},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":26},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":39},{"uri":"Cream_cheese","surface_form":"cream cheese","offset":55},{"uri":"Ricotta","surface_form":"ricotta","offset":82},{"uri":"Egg","surface_form":"egg","offset":92},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":102},{"uri":"Graham_cracker","surface_form":"graham cracker","offset":124},{"uri":"Crumb","surface_form":"crumb","offset":139},{"uri":"Crust","surface_form":"crust","offset":145},{"uri":"Melting","surface_form":"melted","offset":179},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":186},{"uri":"Filling","surface_form":"filling","offset":198},{"uri":"Sour_cream","surface_form":"sour cream","offset":257},{"uri":"Strawberry","surface_form":"strawberry","offset":332},{"uri":"Blueberry","surface_form":"blueberry","offset":344},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":358},{"uri":"Topping","surface_form":"topped","offset":377},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":395},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":404},{"uri":"American_cuisine","surface_form":"American cooking","offset":470},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":506},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"Cheese","offset":515},{"uri":"2nd_millennium_BC","surface_form":"2000","offset":542},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"scientists who study people in the past","offset":552},{"uri":"Mold","surface_form":"mold","offset":610},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":676},{"uri":"2nd_century","surface_form":"100s","offset":691},{"uri":"Anno_Domini","surface_form":"Anno Domini","offset":695},{"uri":"Greek_literature","surface_form":"writer","offset":712},{"uri":"Athenaeus","surface_form":"Athenaeus","offset":719},{"uri":"Deipnosophistae","surface_form":"Dinner-Table Philosophers","offset":732},{"uri":"Greek_poetry","surface_form":"poet","offset":773},{"uri":"Callimachus","surface_form":"Callimachus","offset":778},{"uri":"3rd_century_BC","surface_form":"200s","offset":802},{"uri":"Aegimius","surface_form":"Aegimius","offset":835},{"uri":"Sportsperson","surface_form":"sportspeople","offset":952},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":976},{"uri":"776_BC","surface_form":"776","offset":1008},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":1029},{"uri":"Roman_Greece","surface_form":"took over Greece","offset":1036},{"uri":"Cato_the_Elder","surface_form":"M.
