{"id":16132,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhubarb","text":"Rhubarb is one of about 60 plants in the genus \"Rheum\", family Polygonaceae. The vegetable rhubarb is \"Rheum rhabarbarum\" (or \"Rheum x hybridum\"). The leaves are toxic, but the red stalks are baked in pies, with sugar to soften their tart flavor.\nThere are many varieties grown for eating. The drug \"rheum\" is prepared from the rhizomes and roots of another species, \"R. officinale\" or medicinal rhubarb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":41},{"uri":"Polygonaceae","surface_form":"Polygonaceae","offset":63},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":162},{"uri":"Baking","surface_form":"baked","offset":192},{"uri":"Rhizome","surface_form":"rhizome","offset":328}]}
