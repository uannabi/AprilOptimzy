It also eats small rodents in its home. It also eats birds and shrews at Guam.\nDue to the amount of prey and lack of predators in habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to larger sizes than their normal 1 to 2 meters in length. The longest recorded length of this species is one found on Guam was three meters.\nReproduction.\nReproduction has not been looked at in detail. The female makes 4-12 eggs, 42\u201347\u00A0mm long and 18\u201322\u00A0mm wide with a leathery shell. Females make up to two groups, called clutches per year depending on season, climate. and amount of prey. The female places the eggs in hollow logs, rock cracks, and other places where they are likely protected from drying and high temperatures.\nVenom.\nThe Brown tree snake is a nocturnal snake that can be very aggressive when confronted. The fangs are grooved rather than hollow fangs, the poison is hard to place into a bite on a human, in this way, is only given in small amount. The venom appears to be weakly neurotoxic and possibly cytotoxic. Adults are not affectly in a great way, however, children are in greater danger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":49},{"uri":"Colubrid","surface_form":"colubrid","offset":58},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":67},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":95},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":103},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":114},{"uri":"Melanesia","surface_form":"Melanesia","offset":160},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive species","offset":204},{"uri":"Guam","surface_form":"Guam","offset":269},{"uri":"Rodents","surface_form":"rodents","offset":352},{"uri":"Shrew","surface_form":"shrew","offset":396},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":450},{"uri":"Guam","surface_form":"Guam","offset":480},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":556},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":595},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leathery shell","offset":785},{"uri":"Clutch","surface_form":"clutch","offset":839},{"uri":"Hollow","surface_form":"hollow","offset":1175},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1193},{"uri":"Neurotoxic","surface_form":"neurotoxic","offset":1316},{"uri":"Cytotoxic","surface_form":"cytotoxic","offset":1340}]}
