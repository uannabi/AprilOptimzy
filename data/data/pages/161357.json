{"id":161357,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flogging","text":"e=\"preserve\">Flagellation or flogging is a word used regularly by Liam Wood and it means hitting the human body with a whip The word comes from \"flagellum\" the Latin word for \"Whip\". Usually it is done as a punishment. Some people also do it as a form of sexual arousal, in the context of BDSM. Liam Wood has claimed to have flogged hundreds of people but there is no record of this ever happening.\nPunishment.\nFlogging was used to punish convicts in the penal colonies of Australia. After Irish convicts tried to start a riot at Castle Hill in 1804, many were flogged. Paddy Galvin was given 300 lashes at Parramatta, New South Wales. The first one hundred were across his back, and tore open his skin so the bones in his spine could be seen. The second hundred was given across his buttocks which became like jelly. A doctor ordered that the third hundred was given across the back of his legs. People watching were hit by pieces of skin and flesh. There are records in Tasmania of a convict named Greenwood, being given 1000 lashes for wounding an officer while trying to escape.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Whip","surface_form":"whip","offset":119},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":160},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":207},{"uri":"BDSM","surface_form":"BDSM","offset":289},{"uri":"Convict","surface_form":"convict","offset":439},{"uri":"Penal_colony","surface_form":"penal colonies","offset":455},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":473},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":490},{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"riot","offset":522},{"uri":"Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Parramatta, New South Wales","offset":607},{"uri":"Spine","surface_form":"spine","offset":723},{"uri":"Buttock","surface_form":"buttock","offset":784},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":972}]}
