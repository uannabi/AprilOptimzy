{"id":161473,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis","text":"Candidiasis, often called yeast infection or thrush, is a type of infectious disease. It is a fungal infection (mycosis). The disease is caused by any of the \"Candida\" species of yeast. \"Candida albicans\" is the most common species.\nCauses.\n\"Candida\" yeasts are common in most people. The yeast is usually controlled in the body. When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens.\nA weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop. HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis.\nAntibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast. Antibiotic kills some bacteria, and changes the balance of microorganisms in the body. This may allow the yeast to multiply.\nThroat.\nEsophageal candidiasis is an infection of the esophagus by \"Candida albicans\". The disease happens in unhealthy people. Sometimes people will get the infection when they are treated with chemotherapy. People with AIDS can also get this infection more often.\nOne sign of esophageal candidiasis is painful swallowing. Weight loss can happen when a person has esophageal candidiasis for a long time.\nMouth.\nOral candidiasis is a yeast infection of the mouth. It is located on the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is caused by \"Candida albicans\", \"Candida glabrata\" or \"Candida tropicalis\".\nSigns.\nCandida may appear as thick white or cream-coloured areas on mucosal membranes. The infected mucosa of the mouth may look inflamed. In babies the condition is called thrush. For babies, it is usually painless and causes no pain. Adults may experience discomfort or burning sensation.\nBody parts.\nCandidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or vaginitis. It can also occur on the penis or scrotum. In unhealthy patients, the \"Candida\" infection can affect the esophagus. It could get everywhere in the body. This would cause a much more serious health condition, a state called candidemia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infectious","offset":66},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":77},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":168},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":179},{"uri":"Candida_albicans","surface_form":"Candida albicans","offset":187},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":371},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":422},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":470},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":474},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":480},{"uri":"Steroids","surface_form":"steroids","offset":499},{"uri":"Stress_(medicine)","surface_form":"stress","offset":509},{"uri":"Nutrients","surface_form":"nutrients","offset":531},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"Antibiotic","offset":564},{"uri":"Steroid","surface_form":"steroid","offset":579},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"Antibiotic","offset":642},{"uri":"Esophagus","surface_form":"esophagus","offset":821},{"uri":"Candida_albicans","surface_form":"Candida albicans","offset":835},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":962},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":988},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":1071},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":1201},{"uri":"Mucous","surface_form":"mucous","offset":1252},{"uri":"Membranes","surface_form":"membranes","offset":1259},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":1276},{"uri":"Candida_albicans","surface_form":"Candida albicans","offset":1300},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":1593},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":1704},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":1763},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":1772},{"uri":"Patient","surface_form":"patient","offset":1794},{"uri":"Esophageal_candidiasis","surface_form":"esophagus","offset":1843},{"uri":"Candidemia","surface_form":"candidemia","offset":1961}]}
