{"id":16166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","text":"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is an agency of the United States Government. It investigates crime across the country. It is dedicated to national security and law enforcement. The Bureau of Investigation was founded in 1908. It was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI for short, in 1935. J. Edgar Hoover was the Director of the Bureau from its start, and continued as Director of the FBI until his death in 1972. Although the FBI works worldwide, their headquarters are in Washington DC. They have 56 main offices in cities throughout the United States.\nOrganizational structure.\nThe FBI is organized into branches and the Office of the Director. This office contains most administrative offices. An executive assistant director manages each branch. Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions. Each division is headed by an assistant director. The various divisions are further divided into sub-branches. Each sub-branch is led by deputy assistant directors. Within these sub-branches there are various sections headed by section chiefs. Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge.\nFBI Crisis Negotiation Unit.\nThe FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit (FCNU) is a 24/7 operational response to crisis and to negotiate person(s) who are threatening to commit suicide or other harmful situations after a crime has been committed. The FBI's lead negotiator contacts the person(s) involved, with a hard-wire phone line to communicate with the person(s) to try convincing them to give themselves up to local police who are on stand-by.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Agency","surface_form":"agency","offset":48},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States Government","offset":62},{"uri":"Investigation","surface_form":"investigates","offset":91},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":104},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":121},{"uri":"National_security","surface_form":"national security","offset":149},{"uri":"Law_enforcement","surface_form":"law enforcement","offset":171},{"uri":"J._Edgar_Hoover","surface_form":"J.
