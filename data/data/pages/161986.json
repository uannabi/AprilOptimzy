{"id":161986,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror","text":"Survival horror is a video game genre based on horror movies where the main character has to survive while in danger and escape, for example during a zombie attack. Survival Horror games are influenced by both Western and Japanese culture.\nThe name \"survival horror\" was first used by the horror game \"Resident Evil\", but there had been some earlier games which created the genre, among them \"Alone in the Dark\". Survival Horror games are different from other video games because the main character of the games are usually ordinary people and the amount of ammunition and resources the player has is usually not very much: to not be prepared or equipped for the situation is often important for the genre. A few Survival Horror games are \"Resident Evil\" and \"Bioshock\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game_genres","surface_form":"video game genre","offset":21},{"uri":"Horror_movie","surface_form":"horror movie","offset":47},{"uri":"Zombie","surface_form":"zombie","offset":150},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"Western","offset":210},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":222},{"uri":"Resident_Evil","surface_form":"Resident Evil","offset":302},{"uri":"Alone_in_the_Dark_(series)","surface_form":"Alone in the Dark","offset":393},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":558},{"uri":"Resident_Evil","surface_form":"Resident Evil","offset":740},{"uri":"Bioshock","surface_form":"Bioshock","offset":760}]}
