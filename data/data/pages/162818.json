{"id":162818,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromalveolate","text":"Chromalveolata is a eukaryote supergroup first proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith as a refinement of his kingdom Chromista, which was first proposed in 1981.\nThe origin of the Chromalveolata was thought to be a secondary endosymbiosis between a bikont (cell with two flagella) and a red alga. This union led to plastids containing chlorophyll c. In Cavalier-Smith's classification, the Chromalveolata was one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":20},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":104},{"uri":"Endosymbiosis","surface_form":"endosymbiosis","offset":220},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":266},{"uri":"Red_alga","surface_form":"red alga","offset":282},{"uri":"Plastid","surface_form":"plastid","offset":310},{"uri":"Chlorophyll","surface_form":"chlorophyll","offset":330}]}
