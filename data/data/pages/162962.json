{"id":162962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_reaction","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Link reaction, also known as pyruvate decarboxylation forms an important link between the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid or Krebs cycle.\nIn eukaryotes, the reaction takes place only inside the mitochondrial matrix; in prokaryotes similar reactions take place in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane.\nAcetyl CoA is then ready for use in the Krebs Cycle.\nThe Link reaction is important as acetyl-CoA is needed for the Krebs cycle to happen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Glycolysis","surface_form":"glycolysis","offset":129},{"uri":"Krebs_cycle","surface_form":"Krebs cycle","offset":163},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":179},{"uri":"Mitochondria","surface_form":"mitochondria","offset":232},{"uri":"Prokaryote","surface_form":"prokaryote","offset":257},{"uri":"Plasma_membrane","surface_form":"plasma membrane","offset":326},{"uri":"Krebs_Cycle","surface_form":"Krebs Cycle","offset":383},{"uri":"Krebs_cycle","surface_form":"Krebs cycle","offset":459}]}
