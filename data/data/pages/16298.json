{"id":16298,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso","text":"Pablo Ruiz Picasso (October 25 1881 \u2013 April 8 1973) was a Spanish painter and sculptor. He created over 20,000 images.\nHe is considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is best known as the co-founder of cubism. A work of art is cubist when the artist opts to break up objects and reassemble them in abstract and geometric form. Picasso could draw and paint when he was very young. His first word was \"l\u00E1piz\", the Spanish word for \"pencil\".\nPerhaps his most famous painting is \"Guernica\", which shows the horrors of war after the bombing of the town of Guernica. He spent most of his life in France when he was an adult.\nHe was 90 years old when a number of his works were shown in an exhibition at the Louvre in Paris. He was the first living artist to have an exhibition at the Louvre.\nPicasso had four children with three women. He died of heart failure in Mougins, France, on April 8 1973.\nChildhood.\nPablo Picasso was born on October 25 1881 in M\u00E1laga, Spain. His father was a painter and teacher Jos\u00E9 Ruiz Blasco and his mother was Mar\u00EDa Picasso L\u00F3pez. His original name was Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ram\u00EDrez but was later changed for convenience. Until 1898, he signed his pictures with the names of his father and of his mother. After around 1901, he only used his mother's name. At the age of eight, Picasso created his first oil painting called \"The Picador\". In 1891, Pablo moved with his family to Northern Spain, where his father taught at the \"Instituto da Guarda\". One year later, Pablo studied at this institute. Pablo's father was his teacher at this time. In 1896, he started to attend the art school in Barcelona after passing the entrance examination. This had over 60 portraits.\nBeginning of the Career.\nPicasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, where he lived with Max Jacob, a poet and journalist. When Max was working during the day, Pablo slept and when Max slept at night, Pablo worked. Picasso had to burn his paintings to keep himself warm. \"Lovers in the Street\" and \"Moulin de la Galette\" are examples of his Paris work from this time. Both pictures were painted in 1900.\nHe went back to Madrid in 1901 where he worked for a newspaper called \"Arte Joven\". He was responsible for illustrations. At this time, he shortened his signature from \"Pablo Ruiz y Picasso\" to \"Picasso\". This is the time his so-called \"Blue Period\" started. The two 1903 paintings, \"The Soup\" and \"Crouching Woman,\" are examples. His \"Blue Period\" ended in 1904 when he settled in Paris.\nIn 1905, Picasso made a trip to Holland. In the same year, Pablo's \"Rosa Period\" started. During this period, Picasso mostly painted circus motives. \"Girl Balancing on a Ball\" and \"The Actor\" are two early paintings from this time. This period lasted until 1907.\nPicasso's Cubism period started in 1909 and ended around 1912. This period was inspired by the French painter Paul C\u00E9zanne. This period is called \"Cubism\" because of the use of cubes and other shapes. During this time, Picasso painted musical instruments, still life objects, and also his friends.\nPicasso had his first exhibition in the United States in 1911. One year later in 1912, he had his first exhibition in Great Britain. Pablo's father died in May 1913.\nDuring the First World War.\nFrom 1912 to 1919 was Picasso's so called \"Synthetic Cubism Period\". During this time, he started to use collages in his paintings. His works from this time are called \"papiers coll\u00E9s\". He has spent his time during the First World War in Rome. In 1914, Picasso spent the whole summer in Avignon. In 1915, he started to paint realistic again. At the end of the same year, his wife Eva died. During the World War, he also worked as a designer for Sergey Diaghilev.\nIn 1917, Picasso met Olga Koklova, a Russian dancer. In the same year, he painted several realistic portraits of her and their friends. One year later, he married her. The last summer of the wartime, Picasso and his wife spent in Barcelona and Biarritz.\nAfter the First World War.\nIn 1921, Picasso's son Paul was born. Due to this occasion, he painted several paintings with his wife and his son on it. Paul was Picasso's only legitimate son. In 1925, he took part in the first Surrealist exhibition in Paris. Between 1924 and 1926, Picasso preferred to paint abstract still lives. In 1927, he got known to Marie-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se Walter. She became his model and mistress. In 1928, he started a new period where he began to make sculptural works. In 1931, he left his wife and moved with his mistress to Boisgeloup. There they lived in a country home. There, Picasso had a room for his sculptures only. Since 1932, he used Marie-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se as a model. During a travel in Spain, he started to use the bullfight as a new topic of his paintings. In 1935, Picasso's daughter, Ma\u00EFa, was born. At this time, he got divorced from his wife because of the birth of Ma\u00EFa. In 1936, Picasso got a job as director of the Prado-Museum in Madrid. During this time, the Spanish Civil War started. German bombs fell on Guernica in Spain on 26 April 1937. Picasso used this impact to paint one of his most famous paintings, Guernica. This painting was completed in about 2 months. It was first shown in the Spanish Pavilion in Paris in 1937.\nDuring the Second World War.\nIn 1938, Picasso's mother died. After the Second World War started on 1 September 1939, Picasso returned to Paris. Around 1943, he got known to the painter Fran\u00E7oise Gilot. She bore to him one son and one daughter. In 1941, he wrote his first play \"Le d\u00E9sir attrap\u00E9 par la queue\" (\"Desire Caught by the Tail\"). It was first shown in 1944. Also in 1944, Picasso joined the communist Party. Picasso spent almost the full war time in Paris.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_people","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":58},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":66},{"uri":"Sculptor","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":78},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":111},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"cubism","offset":223},{"uri":"Guernica_(painting)","surface_form":"Guernica","offset":497},{"uri":"Guernica_(town)","surface_form":"Guernica","offset":572},{"uri":"Louvre","surface_form":"Louvre","offset":722},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":732},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":862},{"uri":"Mougins","surface_form":"Mougins","offset":879},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":888},{"uri":"Malaga","surface_form":"M\u00E1laga","offset":969},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":977},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":1001},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":1369},{"uri":"Institute","surface_form":"institute","offset":1552},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":1656},{"uri":"Exam","surface_form":"entrance examination","offset":1684},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1790},{"uri":"Illustration","surface_form":"illustration","offset":2247},{"uri":"Signature","surface_form":"signature","offset":2293},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":2561},{"uri":"Circus","surface_form":"circus","offset":2662},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"Cubism","offset":2802},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":2887},{"uri":"Paul_C%C3%A9zanne","surface_form":"Paul C\u00E9zanne","offset":2902},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":2969},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"United States","offset":3130},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":3208},{"uri":"Collage","surface_form":"collage","offset":3389},{"uri":"WWI","surface_form":"First World War","offset":3503},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":3522},{"uri":"Avignon","surface_form":"Avignon","offset":3571},{"uri":"Realism","surface_form":"realistic","offset":3609},{"uri":"Sergey_Diaghilev","surface_form":"Sergey Diaghilev","offset":3729},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":3792},{"uri":"Abstract","surface_form":"abstract","offset":4307},{"uri":"Mistress","surface_form":"mistress","offset":4401},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":4696},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":4706},{"uri":"Bullfight","surface_form":"bullfight","offset":4735},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":4844},{"uri":"Board_of_directors","surface_form":"director","offset":4927},{"uri":"Prado-Museum","surface_form":"Prado-Museum","offset":4943},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":4959},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":4989},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":5023},{"uri":"Guernica_(town)","surface_form":"Guernica","offset":5037},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":5049},{"uri":"Guernica_(painting)","surface_form":"Guernica","offset":5141},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":5244},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":5330},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7oise_Gilot","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7oise Gilot","offset":5444},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":5707}]}
