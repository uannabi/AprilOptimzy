{"id":163017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campagna","text":"Campagna is a small town in the region of Campania in Italy.\nThe town, located in a mountainous district, gradually lost importance in the 20th century. All its district offices have been moved to other cities since the 1930s, and the Diocese of Campagna merged with the Archdiocese of Salerno in 1973.\nDuring World War II, Campagna was the site of an internment camp. The Bishop Giuseppe Maria Palatucci turned the camp into a shelter for Italian and foreign Jews, many of them sent there for protection by his nephew Giovanni Palatucci; Giovanni was later honored as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":32},{"uri":"Campania","surface_form":"Campania","offset":42},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":54},{"uri":"Diocese_of_Campagna","surface_form":"Diocese of Campagna","offset":235},{"uri":"Archdiocese_of_Salerno","surface_form":"Archdiocese of Salerno","offset":271},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":310},{"uri":"Internment_camp","surface_form":"internment camp","offset":352},{"uri":"Giuseppe_Maria_Palatucci","surface_form":"Giuseppe Maria Palatucci","offset":380},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":460},{"uri":"Giovanni_Palatucci","surface_form":"Giovanni Palatucci","offset":519},{"uri":"Righteous_Among_the_Nations","surface_form":"Righteous Among the Nations","offset":571},{"uri":"Yad_Vashem","surface_form":"Yad Vashem","offset":606},{"uri":"Holocaust","surface_form":"Holocaust","offset":617}]}
