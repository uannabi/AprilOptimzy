He served as Governor of Alabama serving from 1963 to 1967. He ran for President of the United States three times (1964, 1968, 1976).\nWallace was born in Cilio, Alabama. He began his long political career at the age of 33 after running for county judge.\nWhen Wallace was running for President, he was shot and paralyzed for the rest of his life.

Wallace was a longtime supporter of segregation; a policy that did not allow African-Americans to attend the same schools, or go to many of the same public places, as white people. In 1963 he stood in a schoolhouse door to prevent black students from attending the school (which would have integrated the school). In a speech, he said he would support \"segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\". He was a controversial figure. Some people saw him as a man who spoke up for the poor and was an outspoken populist. Others viewed him as a terrible person, a white supremacist who encouraged violence.\nIn time, he changed his views, and said that he was sorry to African-Americans, and other people hurt by segregation. He promoted black equality in his last term as Governor. Despite this, he remains an icon of racism today and many people think of him as one of the most evil figures in American history.\nAssassination attempt.\nDuring the 1972 presidential campaign, Wallace was shot five times by a would-be assassin, Arthur Bremer.
