{"id":163251,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster","text":"\"Homo ergaster\", also called \"African \"Homo erectus\", is an extinct chronospecies of \"Homo\" which lived in eastern and southern Africa during the early Pleistocene, between 1.8 million and 1.3 million years ago.\nThere is still disagreement on the subject of the classification and ancestry of \"H. ergaster\". However, it is now widely accepted as the direct ancestor of Asian \"Homo erectus\", \"Homo neanderthalensis\", \"Homo heidelbergensis\", and hence \"Homo sapiens\".\nIt is one of the earliest members of the genus \"Homo\", possibly ancestral to, or sharing a common ancestor with, \"Homo erectus\". Some paleoanthropologists consider \"H. ergaster\" is just the African variety of \"H. erectus\". There are Asian fossils of \"H. erectus\", which was the first human species to spread from Africa.\nThe name \"ergaster\" means \"workman\", in reference to the Acheulean hand axe industry developed by the species. The species' period in eastern and southern Africa coincided with the first part of the Pleistocene, the cooling of the global climate and the start of the ice ages. These events would have shrunk the rainforests in Africa, and expanded the savannahs and open forests to which \"ergaster\" was well suited.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chronospecies","surface_form":"chronospecies","offset":68},{"uri":"Homo","surface_form":"Homo","offset":86},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":152},{"uri":"Homo_erectus","surface_form":"Homo erectus","offset":376},{"uri":"Homo_neanderthalensis","surface_form":"Homo neanderthalensis","offset":392},{"uri":"Homo_heidelbergensis","surface_form":"Homo heidelbergensis","offset":417},{"uri":"Homo_sapiens","surface_form":"Homo sapiens","offset":451},{"uri":"Homo","surface_form":"Homo","offset":514},{"uri":"Homo_erectus","surface_form":"Homo erectus","offset":580},{"uri":"Acheulean","surface_form":"Acheulean","offset":844},{"uri":"Hand_axe","surface_form":"hand axe","offset":854},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":942},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":986},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":1054},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":1099},{"uri":"Savannah","surface_form":"savannah","offset":1139},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":1158}]}
