{"id":163508,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skillet","text":"Skillet was an American Grammy-nominated christian rock band from Memphis, Tennessee. The band formed in 1996.\nDebut titled-album and the \"Gasoline\" music video (1996-1997).\nSkillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut \"Skillet\". It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.\nHey You, I Love Your Soul and the \"More Faithful\" music video (1998-1999).\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled \"Hey You, I Love Your Soul\", which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.\nTracklist.\n1. Hey You, I Love Your Soul\n8. Your Love (Keeps Me Alive)\nInvincible and Ardent Worship and the \"Best Kept Secret\" music video (2000-2001).\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, \"Invincible\", Steorts left the band to be with his family and launch Visible Music College, a modern music ministry college located in Memphis, Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist, and Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of \"Invincible\". Because of this change, the musical style on \"Invincible\" changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of \"Invincible\" in 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.\nIn late 2000 (several months after \"Invincible\" was released), The band released the worship album, and fourth album overall, \"Ardent Worship\". The band kept much of their sound from \"Invincible\" on their next studio album \"Alien Youth\". With little time between touring and recording.\nInvincible Tracklist.\n3. Come On To The Future\n4. You Take My Rights Away\nArdent Worship Tracklist.\n5. Who Is Like Our God\n8. Jesus, Jesus (Holy and Anoinated One)\n10. How Deep The Father's Love For Us\nAlien Youth and the \"Alien Youth\" music video (2002-2003).\nSkillet released \"Alien Youth\" on August 28, 2002, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of \"Alien Youth\", Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar. The first single, the title track, was a major hit in the Christian market and drove Skillet into their first headlining shows.\nTracklist.\n7. The Thirst Is Taking Over\n14. A Little More (originally was supposed to be on \"Alien Youth\" but didn't make the record, so he re-recorded the song and released it on \"Collide\" but there is a little clip of the original recording as a hidden track)\nCollide and the \"Savior\" music video (2004-2005).\nOn May 25, 2004, \"Collide\" was released by Ardent Records and Lava Records. The album was nominated for \"Best Rock Gospel Album\" in 2005. \"Collide\" was yet another musical shift for the band.Citing P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on \"Collide\", Cooper said, \"Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me.\"\nTracklist.\n8. A Little More (originally recorded for \"Alien Youth\" but didn't get released on the record, so he re-recorded it and released it on \"Collide\")\nComatose and the \"Rebirthing\" music video (2006-2008).\nSkillet's album Comatose was released on October 3, 2006. It features the singles \"Rebirthing,\" \"Whispers in the Dark,\" \"Comatose,\" \"The Older I Get,\" \"Those Nights,\" \"The Last Night\", and \"Better Than Drugs\". The album debuted at No. 55 on the Billboard 200 and No. 4 on the US Top Christian Albums chart.[7]\nIn January 2008, Skillet announced that their drummer, Lori Peters, was retiring from the band, feeling that \"it's time for her to come off of the road and start a new chapter in her life.\"[8] Peters' last concert with Skillet was on December 31, 2007.[9] However, during the 2007 Christmas season, she took the time to train Skillet's next drummer, Jen Ledger.[9]\nOn October 21, 2008, Comatose Comes Alive was released; a CD/DVD combo featuring live recordings of the band's concert of May 9, 2008 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

He states: \"We have aggressive tracks, artsy and musical tracks, which is new territory for Skillet.
