{"id":163668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Korean_Waterway","text":"The Grand Korean Waterway plan, officially known as the Pan Korea Grand Waterway(\uD55C\uBC18\uB3C4\uB300\uC6B4\uD558, \u97D3\u534A\u5CF6\u5927\u904B\u6CB3), consists of 3 canals. They are called the Seoul-Busan Canal (GyeongBu Canal,\uACBD\uBD80\uC6B4\uD558), the Honam Canal (\uD638\uB0A8\uC6B4\uD558), and the North Korea Canal (BukHan Canal, \uBD81\uD55C\uC6B4\uD558).\nThe Seoul-Busan Canal runs between Seoul and Busan, two of South Korea's largest cities, and connecting the Han River and Nakdong River. Then the Honam Canal, which runs through ChungCheongBuk-do, ChungCheongNam-do, JeollaBuk-do, and JeollaNam-do, connects Geum River and YeongSan River. The North Korea Canal would connect SinUiJu-Pyongyang-GaeSeong, Wonsan-GaeSeong.\nThe canal was a project headed by Lee Myung Bak, who South Korea's president from 2008 to 2013. It is hugely controversial. Many Koreans object to this plan. Former president Lee said that he would not carry out this plan if many people objected to this idea, but there was a person who works in the Korea Institute of Construction Technology(\uD55C\uAD6D\uAC74\uC124\uAE30\uC220\uC5F0\uAD6C\uC6D0) has confessed that government's 'Four-Major-River Arrangement Plan' is a canal project in reality.\nGyeongBu Canal.\nThe major canal in this plan is the GyeongBu Canal(Seoul-Busan Canal, \uACBD\uBD80\uC6B4\uD558).\nRoute.\nThe GyeongBu Canal starts in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It flows along the Han River, and encounter with mountains. And then 40\u00A0km-long tunnel begins, connecting the Han River with the Nakdong River.\nControversy.\nMany Koreans are anxious about this plan. Critics of the plan say that this canal is not efficient at all. They say that mountains along the proposed route would make it difficult and expensive to construct. Currently, the major transportation method on the GyeongBu (Seoul-Busan) line is road transport, which takes 5 hours.\nHowever, ships following the GyeongBu Canal will take 25 hours to finish the trip. Critics believe this plan would just be a waste of money. In addition, it could be harmful to the environment and damage cultural treasures. On the other hand, supporters of this plan say that this canal will lessen congestion on the GyeongBu Expressway and GyeongBu Railroad line. Furthermore, sand from dredging the river bed could be sold for use in construction. They argue that this money could be used to fund the construction of the canals. However, critics argue that sand prices will be so cheap that little money will be earned from selling the sand. They say that it is only beneficial to the construction industry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seoul","surface_form":"Seoul","offset":288},{"uri":"Busan","surface_form":"Busan","offset":298},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":312},{"uri":"Han_River","surface_form":"Han River","offset":361},{"uri":"Nakdong_River","surface_form":"Nakdong River","offset":375},{"uri":"ChungCheongBuk-do","surface_form":"ChungCheongBuk-do","offset":431},{"uri":"ChungCheongNam-do","surface_form":"ChungCheongNam-do","offset":450},{"uri":"JeollaBuk-do","surface_form":"JeollaBuk-do","offset":469},{"uri":"South_Jeolla","surface_form":"JeollaNam-do","offset":487},{"uri":"Geum_River","surface_form":"Geum River","offset":510},{"uri":"YeongSan_River","surface_form":"YeongSan River","offset":525},{"uri":"SinUiJu","surface_form":"SinUiJu","offset":577},{"uri":"Pyongyang","surface_form":"Pyongyang","offset":585},{"uri":"GaeSeong","surface_form":"GaeSeong","offset":595},{"uri":"Wonsan","surface_form":"Wonsan","offset":605},{"uri":"GaeSeong","surface_form":"GaeSeong","offset":612},{"uri":"Lee_Myung_Bak","surface_form":"Lee Myung Bak","offset":656},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":675},{"uri":"Seoul","surface_form":"Seoul","offset":1204},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":1226},{"uri":"Han_River","surface_form":"Han River","offset":1258},{"uri":"Han_River","surface_form":"Han River","offset":1349},{"uri":"Nakdong_River","surface_form":"Nakdong River","offset":1368}]}
