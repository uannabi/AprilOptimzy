{"id":163837,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilia","text":"A cilium (plural \"cilia\") is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body.\nIn eukaryotes, cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.\nEukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.\nMotile cilia are found on protist ciliates like \"Paramecium\". They are how \"Paramecium\" moves around. They are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of metazoans, such as the digestive system and the trachea of the lungs.\nStatus of cilia.\nCilia are structurally almost identical with the much larger flagella. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum \"Undulipodia\". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum \"Ciliophora\". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.\nCilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":32},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryotic","offset":51},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cell","offset":62},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cell body","offset":135},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":171},{"uri":"Undulipodia","surface_form":"undulipodia","offset":228},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":299},{"uri":"Protist","surface_form":"protist","offset":413},{"uri":"Ciliate","surface_form":"ciliate","offset":421},{"uri":"Paramecium","surface_form":"Paramecium","offset":436},{"uri":"Metazoa","surface_form":"metazoa","offset":560},{"uri":"Digestive_system","surface_form":"digestive system","offset":583},{"uri":"Trachea","surface_form":"trachea","offset":608},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":623},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":708},{"uri":"Protist","surface_form":"protist","offset":755},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"Phylum","offset":804},{"uri":"Ciliate","surface_form":"Ciliate","offset":869},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":1126},{"uri":"Mitochondria","surface_form":"mitochondria","offset":1201},{"uri":"Plastid","surface_form":"plastid","offset":1218},{"uri":"Prokaryote","surface_form":"prokaryote","offset":1328},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":1341},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":1353},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":1376}]}
