{"id":16427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonmetal","text":"e=\"preserve\">Nonmetal or non-metal is a chemical element that does not have the properties of a metal. Some are gases including: hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, neon or radon and many others. An example of a solid that is a nonmetal is sulfur. It is yellow and not shiny at all. An example of a liquid that is a nonmetal is bromine. It is red. A non metal is also a good insulator for heat and cold. Usually, gases or brittle solids are non-metals. Elements on the periodic table can be classified as metal, semimetal, or non-metal.\nFive times more elements are metals than nonmetals. However, nonmetals are abundant and important. Two of the nonmetals\u2014hydrogen and helium\u2014make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one\u2014oxygen\u2014makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":40},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":96},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":112},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":129},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":139},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":147},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":155},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":165},{"uri":"Neon","surface_form":"neon","offset":175},{"uri":"Radon","surface_form":"radon","offset":183},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":222},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":250},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":309},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":338},{"uri":"Thermal_insulation","surface_form":"insulator","offset":385},{"uri":"Semimetal","surface_form":"semimetal","offset":522},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":667},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":680},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"Universe","offset":730},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":748},{"uri":"Earth%27s_crust","surface_form":"Earth's crust","offset":785},{"uri":"Oceans","surface_form":"oceans","offset":800},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":811},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compounds","offset":917}]}
