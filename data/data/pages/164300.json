{"id":164300,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fozzie_Bear","text":"=\"preserve\">Fozzie Bear is a character from \"The Muppet Show\". He is a brownish-orange colored bear. He wears a hat, and a pink and white tie. Fozzie is a comedian, so his job is to tell jokes. He is famous for not telling very good jokes. He is often heckled and insulted by two old men, Statler and Waldorf. A phrase that Fozzie is known to say is \"wakka wakka wakka.\" The phrase has no meaning, but is usually used after a joke to make the joke seem funnier. Fozzie is a fairly good friend to Kermit the Frog, although he does annoy Kermit at times. He seems to annoy Miss Piggy much more often.\nFozzie Bear was first played by Frank Oz. He is now played by Eric Jacobson.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Muppet_Show","surface_form":"The Muppet Show","offset":45},{"uri":"Tie","surface_form":"tie","offset":138},{"uri":"Statler_and_Waldorf","surface_form":"Statler and Waldorf","offset":289},{"uri":"Kermit_the_Frog","surface_form":"Kermit the Frog","offset":496},{"uri":"Miss_Piggy","surface_form":"Miss Piggy","offset":571}]}
