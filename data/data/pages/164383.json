{"id":164383,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyrieux_River","text":"The Eyrieux River is a river in Europe. It flows into the Rh\u00F4ne River.\nThe Eyrieux River runs for. It passes through three different landscapes. A plateau is found above a commune called Le Cheylard. This plateau is marked by the sugarloaf cones of old volcanoes. This land is mostly used for cattle and sheep. In its middle section, down as far as Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut and Les Olli\u00E8res-sur-Eyrieux, the river is a torrent. This means that it flows very quickly and roughly. It has a lot of flash floods. The power made by this torrent was used first for silk mills. Now it is used for micro-hydroelectricity production. It is also a popular spot for canoeists. The river never dries up in summer, because there are many dams and barrages that give it a steady flow. The lower section to the Rh\u00F4ne, at Beauchastel and La Voulte-sur-Rh\u00F4ne, opens into a valley. There are many farms in the valley. Peach orchards grow here.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":32},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B4ne_River","surface_form":"Rh\u00F4ne River","offset":58},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":133},{"uri":"Le_Cheylard","surface_form":"Le Cheylard","offset":187},{"uri":"Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut","surface_form":"Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut","offset":349},{"uri":"Les_Olli%C3%A8res-sur-Eyrieux","surface_form":"Les Olli\u00E8res-sur-Eyrieux","offset":379},{"uri":"Flash_flood","surface_form":"flash flood","offset":496},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":560},{"uri":"Hydroelectricity","surface_form":"hydroelectricity","offset":597},{"uri":"Canoe","surface_form":"canoe","offset":656},{"uri":"Beauchastel","surface_form":"Beauchastel","offset":807},{"uri":"La_Voulte-sur-Rh%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"La Voulte-sur-Rh\u00F4ne","offset":823},{"uri":"Peach","surface_form":"Peach","offset":901}]}
