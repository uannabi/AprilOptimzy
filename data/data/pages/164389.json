{"id":164389,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lewis_(musician)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gary Lewis (born Gary Harold Lee Levitch on July 31, 1945 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American musician. He is the son of actor/director and comedian Jerry Lewis. His longtime band was called The Playboys.\nLewis and his band had several hit records during the 1960s, including \"This Diamond Ring\", \"She's Just My Style\", \"Save Your Heart For Me\", \"Count Me In\", and \"Everybody Loves A Clown\". Lewis played drums onstage, but Jim Keltner often played drums on the Playboys recordings. Most of their records were produced by Snuff Garrett. Lewis was also the band's lead singer.\nLewis included a tribute to his father in the song \"Time Stands Still\", imitating Jerry Lewis's familiar comic voice on the record, and he and the Playboys performed the theme song to his 1966 comedy film \"Way... Way Out\".\nWhen Lewis was drafted into the United States Army in 1967, the Playboys disbanded. After he served in the Army, Lewis had no more hit records, but continued to perform at oldies concerts and charity shows, including some of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethons, hosted by Jerry Lewis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Newark%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Newark, New Jersey","offset":74},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":100},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":109},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":136},{"uri":"Film_director","surface_form":"director","offset":142},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedian","offset":155},{"uri":"Jerry_Lewis","surface_form":"Jerry Lewis","offset":164},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":190},{"uri":"Hit_record","surface_form":"hit record","offset":251},{"uri":"Drums","surface_form":"drums","offset":420},{"uri":"Jim_Keltner","surface_form":"Jim Keltner","offset":439},{"uri":"Snuff_Garrett","surface_form":"Snuff Garrett","offset":537},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":583},{"uri":"Tribute","surface_form":"tribute","offset":608},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"drafted","offset":829},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":846},{"uri":"Oldies","surface_form":"oldies","offset":986},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charity","offset":1006},{"uri":"Muscular_Dystrophy","surface_form":"Muscular Dystrophy","offset":1043},{"uri":"Telethon","surface_form":"telethon","offset":1083}]}
