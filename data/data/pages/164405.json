This is one of the largest families of fish, with more than 2,000 species in more than 200 genera. Most are relatively small, less than 10\u00A0cm (4\u00A0in) in length.\nAlthough few are important as food for humans, they are of great significance as prey species for commercially important fish like cod, haddock, sea bass, and flatfish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Teleost","surface_form":"teleost","offset":15},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":23},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":118},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":143},{"uri":"Cod","surface_form":"cod","offset":343},{"uri":"Haddock","surface_form":"haddock","offset":348},{"uri":"Sea_bass","surface_form":"sea bass","offset":357},{"uri":"Flatfish","surface_form":"flatfish","offset":371}]}
