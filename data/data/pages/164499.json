{"id":164499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptom","text":"=\"preserve\">Extrapyramidal syndrome is when involuntary muscle movements occur in the face and neck. This may include lip smacking, tongue movements, blinking, and head or finger spasms. The patient may have difficulty moving his arms and legs, and slur their words.\nIt occurs when dopamine is not correctly regulated by the body. It is usually a reaction to medicines, but is also caused by Parkinson's disease or a head injury.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Involuntary","surface_form":"involuntary","offset":44},{"uri":"Spasm","surface_form":"spasm","offset":179},{"uri":"Patient","surface_form":"patient","offset":191},{"uri":"Dopamine","surface_form":"dopamine","offset":282},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":359},{"uri":"Parkinson%27s_disease","surface_form":"Parkinson's disease","offset":392},{"uri":"Head_injury","surface_form":"head injury","offset":417}]}
