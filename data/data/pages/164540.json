{"id":164540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Sh%C4%81h_Pahlavi","text":"e=\"preserve\">Reza Sh\u0101h Pahlavi, also Pahlevi (b. Reza Kh\u0101n; March 16, 1878 \u2013 July 26, 1944) was the Sh\u0101h of Iran from 1925 to 1941, when he abdicated (declared that was no longer king) and passed the position on to his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1921, he and Seyed Ziya-al-Din Tabatabaei launched a coup d'\u00E9tat overthrowing the Qajar Dynasty. Reza Sh\u0101h then became minister of war, and eventually became king, which started the Pahlavi dynasty. Because of his friendship with Adolf Hitler, the British suspected that Nazi Germany was conspiring with Iran and ordered Reza Sh\u0101h to abdicate, which he then did.\nReza Sh\u0101h was originally Reza Kh\u0101n, a military officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade who could not read, and taught himself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sh%C4%81h","surface_form":"Sh\u0101h","offset":100},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":108},{"uri":"Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi","surface_form":"Mohammad Reza Pahlavi","offset":224},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":303},{"uri":"Qajar","surface_form":"Qajar","offset":332},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"Dynasty","offset":338},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":521},{"uri":"Conspiracy","surface_form":"conspiring","offset":538},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Persian","offset":675},{"uri":"Cossack","surface_form":"Cossack","offset":683}]}
