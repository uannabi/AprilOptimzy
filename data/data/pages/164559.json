Their lead singer was \"Little Anthony\" Gourdine. They began as a doo-wop group, but changed styles as musical trends changed.\nTheir hit records included \"Tears On My Pillow\", \"Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko Bop\", \"I'm On The Outside (Looking In)\", \"Goin' Out Of My Head\", and \"Hurt So Bad\". Teddy Randazzo was producer and co-songwriter of several of their hits.\nThe group faded from popularity during the late 1960s, but continued to record until 1975. Little Anthony still performed the group's old hits for many years, at oldies concerts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":41},{"uri":"Vocal","surface_form":"vocal","offset":58},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":105},{"uri":"Doo-wop","surface_form":"doo-wop","offset":159},{"uri":"Trend","surface_form":"trend","offset":204},{"uri":"Hit_record","surface_form":"hit record","offset":226},{"uri":"Teddy_Randazzo","surface_form":"Teddy Randazzo","offset":376},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":395},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":411},{"uri":"Oldies","surface_form":"oldies","offset":610}]}
