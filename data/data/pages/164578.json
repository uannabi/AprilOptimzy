Now, their year starts on January 1, but they still celebrate the New Year from April 13 to April 15.\nPeople celebrate Songkran by throwing water at each other in the streets. It is exciting. It is also known as the Water Festival. Almost everyone gets wet, even the police. People put water on old people's hands. The only people who do not get wet are monks and babies. People throw water for many reasons. The most important one is to have a clean body and mind for the New Year. In Thailand, it is very hot at that time of year. So, people do not get angry when they get wet. People believe that water will wash away bad luck. It is also a time to visit family and give gifts. People go to the temple to pray and give food to monks. They also clean the Buddha images in temples with water and perfumes.\nIn Thailand, most people are Buddhist, so they keep statues of Buddha. On April 14, people dance and sing in the streets. They also carry their statues. They throw water at the Buddha statues to clean them. The water smells nice because it has flowers in it. The streets smell good during Songkran. Sometimes there is a contest to choose the most beautiful woman.\nAnd the legend of the important ladies on Songkran Day is Nang Songkran.
