Bertha was a weak tropical storm that formed very quickly off the coast of Louisiana. Bertha made a second landfall in Texas and died only ten hours after. Bertha was only one of three storms to make landfall in both Texas and Louisiana, the other two were Allison in 2001 and Fern in 1971. Bertha left only $200,000 in damage and only one person was killed.\nNo retirement.\nSince the damage was very low the name Bertha was not retired. Bertha was used again in 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2002_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2002 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":59},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":166},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":210},{"uri":"Tropical_Storm_Allison","surface_form":"Allison","offset":348}]}
