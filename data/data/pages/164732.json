They are adapted to survive disease, intense heat, sun and humidity.\nReproduction.\nZebu can begin reproducing at around 44 months old. However, early reproduction can place stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. The carrying time of the calf averages at around 285 days, however it depends on the age and health of the mother. Male calves are carried for a shorter time than females.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":59},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":87},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":99},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":110},{"uri":"Dewlap","surface_form":"dewlaps","offset":174}]}
