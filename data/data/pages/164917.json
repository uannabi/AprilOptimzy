The summers are long and warm; the winters are soft and short.\nIn the neighbourhood are numerous old castles, little medieval walled villages, small cities built around castles and \"sacred\" places, because the Via Podiensis and the Way of St. James of Compostela are going through the Montr\u00E9al and left their traces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":13},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":37},{"uri":"Gascony","surface_form":"Gascony","offset":69},{"uri":"Gers","surface_form":"Gers","offset":85},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":90},{"uri":"Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":116},{"uri":"INSEE","surface_form":"INSEE","offset":209},{"uri":"Bastide","surface_form":"bastide","offset":338},{"uri":"Vineyard","surface_form":"vineyard","offset":464},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":519},{"uri":"Via_Podiensis","surface_form":"Via Podiensis","offset":749},{"uri":"Way_of_St._James","surface_form":"Way of St. James","offset":771}]}
