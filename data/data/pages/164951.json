{"id":164951,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_possum","text":"The pygmy possums are species of small possums that together form the marsupial family Burramyidae. They weigh 6 to 8 grams.\nThere are five living species of pygmy possum, in two genera. Four of the species are endemic to Australia, with one species also occurring in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.\nAfter the 2020 fires, pygmy possums survived on Kangaroo Island, Australia. Saving the species may depend on eliminating feral cats from the island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Possum","surface_form":"possum","offset":39},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":70},{"uri":"Grams","surface_form":"grams","offset":118},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":147},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":179},{"uri":"Endemic","surface_form":"endemic","offset":211},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":222},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":268},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":289},{"uri":"Kangaroo_Island","surface_form":"Kangaroo Island","offset":348},{"uri":"Feral","surface_form":"feral","offset":421}]}
