{"id":164956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry","text":"e=\"preserve\">A dowry (also known as trousseau or tocher) is the money, goods, or estate that is given to a woman at the time of her marriage. A dowry creates a fund for her support in case her husband dies. The dowry eventually goes to her sons and daughters of this marriage. At times a dowry was required to validate a marriage.\nDowry started as gifts that were handed out to the bride at the time of marriage to make her stay at in-laws place more comfortable. It has hence taken an ugly turn, many parts of India still have a high incidence of dowry demands. Some states with a very poor reputation with regards to dowry are - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu. This is a sad reality in Indian marriages and has gone unchecked.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":64},{"uri":"Estate","surface_form":"estate","offset":81},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":107},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":132},{"uri":"Required","surface_form":"required","offset":298},{"uri":"Validate","surface_form":"validate","offset":310}]}
