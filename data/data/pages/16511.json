{"id":16511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Care_Bears_Movie","text":"\"The Care Bears Movie\" is a Canadian/American animated movie that came out on March 29, 1985. It was produced by Nelvana Limited of Canada, and was distributed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It was the first in a trilogy(or set of three) of big-screen movies that had the Care Bears in lead roles, and the first to be based directly on a toy line. The movie's success led to a spin-off television series that premiered on ABC a year after its release.\nThere were well-known celebrities among the movie's starring line-up, such as Carole King, who wrote and sung its opening theme. John Sebastian and NRBQ also contributed to its score. The movie also had the voices of Mickey Rooney, Canadian actress Georgia Engel, and voice actress Cree Summer.\nIt was made as a full-length commercial for the title toys, and had mixed views from critics. But its $23 million gross at the box office made it the biggest animated work outside the Disney market when it came out. It is one of the most profitable releases in the animation industry (its cost was $3 million). The movie saved Nelvana from closing down when \"Rock & Rule\", the company's first production, did not do well.\nFacts.\n\"The Care Bears Movie\" holds financial records for non-Disney animation (at the time it first came out), for Canadian moviemaking (only rivalled by \"Porky's\" and, more recently, \"The Wild\"), and for its distributor Samuel Goldwyn.\nIts director, Arna Selznick, was one of three women to ever lead the production for a full-length cartoon. To this day, she is proud of these efforts, though she was aware of the strategy to promote it.\nPlot.\nIn this movie, an orphanage caretaker named Mr. Cherrywood tells the story of how the Care Bears come to help two children who do not care for anyone (Kim and Jason). The Care Bears live in Care-a-lot, a cloud-filled place up in the sky. As the two of them become friends with the Bears, a carnival magician's helper, Nicholas, turns from good to bad, because of an evil spirit he got from an old book.\nWhen the boy's evil grows more and more, the Care Bears and their Cousins (from the Forest of Feelings), along with Kim and Jason, come back to Earth to end his evil doings. In turn, the carnival and the whole world will be saved.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":28},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":37},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":46},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":55},{"uri":"Nelvana","surface_form":"Nelvana Limited","offset":113},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":132},{"uri":"The_Samuel_Goldwyn_Company","surface_form":"The Samuel Goldwyn Company","offset":163},{"uri":"Trilogy","surface_form":"trilogy","offset":213},{"uri":"Care_Bears","surface_form":"Care Bears","offset":272},{"uri":"The_Care_Bears_(TV_series)","surface_form":"television series","offset":386},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":422},{"uri":"Carole_King","surface_form":"Carole King","offset":530},{"uri":"John_Sebastian","surface_form":"John Sebastian","offset":581},{"uri":"NRBQ","surface_form":"NRBQ","offset":600},{"uri":"Mickey_Rooney","surface_form":"Mickey Rooney","offset":669},{"uri":"Georgia_Engel","surface_form":"Georgia Engel","offset":701},{"uri":"Cree_Summer","surface_form":"Cree Summer","offset":734},{"uri":"Box_office","surface_form":"box office","offset":874},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":931},{"uri":"Rock_%26amp%3B_Rule","surface_form":"Rock & Rule","offset":1106},{"uri":"Record","surface_form":"record","offset":1215},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":1231},{"uri":"Rival","surface_form":"rival","offset":1312},{"uri":"Porky%27s","surface_form":"Porky's","offset":1325},{"uri":"The_Wild","surface_form":"The Wild","offset":1355},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"director","offset":1411},{"uri":"Arna_Selznick","surface_form":"Arna Selznick","offset":1421},{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategy","offset":1586},{"uri":"Orphanage","surface_form":"orphanage","offset":1634},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":1730},{"uri":"Cloud","surface_form":"cloud","offset":1820},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":1849},{"uri":"Carnival","surface_form":"carnival","offset":1906},{"uri":"Magician","surface_form":"magician","offset":1915},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":1982},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":1987},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":2013}]}
