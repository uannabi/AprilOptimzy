However, storms can form outside these dates.

One of the 4 hurricanes (Hurricane Andrew) become a major hurricane (category 3+).\nThis season was not very deadly, but it was very damaging. There was only 66 deaths, but there was $26 billion in damage, all of which caused by Hurricane Andrew. Hurricane Andrew was the most damaging hurricane in the history of the United States, until Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nSubtropical Storm One.\nSubtropical Storm One started on April 21, more than a month before June 1, the start of hurricane season.

A wind gust near 40\u00A0mph made it seem like it would become a tropical storm. But the National Hurricane Center did not call it a tropical storm because the pressure was at 1015, which is very high for a tropical storm. Two moved sharply northeast before it died two days later, on July 26.\nHurricane Andrew.\nHurricane Andrew was the strongest hurricane of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on August 16.

The storm killed two people.\nTropical Depression Seven.\nTropical Depression Seven started on September 25 about halfway between Africa and South America. Seven lasted nearly a week before it died on October 1.\nTropical Storm Earl.\nEarl started on September 26 as a depression. This depression headed for Florida and became a tropical storm.
