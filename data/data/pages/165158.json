{"id":165158,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COROT-7b","text":"COROT-7b is an exoplanet that orbits the star \"COROT-7\" in the constellation Monoceros, 489 light years from Earth.\nIt was first detected by the French-led COROT mission and reported in 2009. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, it was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's. It was the first potential extrasolar terrestrial planet to be found. The planet is also notable for its very short orbital period: it revolves around its host star in about 20 hours.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extrasolar_planet","surface_form":"exoplanet","offset":15},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":30},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":41},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":63},{"uri":"Monoceros_(constellation)","surface_form":"Monoceros","offset":77},{"uri":"Light_years","surface_form":"light years","offset":92},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":109},{"uri":"COROT","surface_form":"COROT","offset":156},{"uri":"Kepler-10b","surface_form":"Kepler-10b","offset":218},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":333},{"uri":"Terrestrial_planet","surface_form":"terrestrial planet","offset":426},{"uri":"Orbital_period","surface_form":"orbital period","offset":504}]}
