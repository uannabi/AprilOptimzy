The next night, at another house show in Sacramento, California, Matt Striker cut a promo on Prudius, calling him a \"filthy immigrant,\" causing Prudius to attack him. Prudius then picked up the microphone and said he that he is \"proud to be in America.\"\nOn the December 18, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", Prudius made an appearance as a WWE prospect named Vladimir Kozlov, which became his ring name. For the next several weeks, Kozlov was interviewed on WWE programming, proclaiming his love for \"Double Double E\" (WWE), but drawing some heel heat for declaring his superiority over whatever wrestlers were competing at the time.\nOhio Valley Wrestling (2007-2008).\nOn July 28, 2007 in Louisville, Kentucky, he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Paul Burchill, but gave up the Championship the same night to Michael W. Kruel due to an agreement they made before.\nSmackDown (2008-2010).\nOn the April 4, 2008 episode of \"SmackDown\", Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a villain, with the unique quirk of having no entrance music and no TitanTron video \u2013 his \"entrance\" consisted of complete darkness except for a spotlight following him to the ring.

On the July 11, 2008 airing of \"SmackDown\", Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and TitanTron video as he defeated Stevie Richards.\nIn the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding \"better competition\". On the September 12, 2008 edition of \"SmackDown\", he attacked Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose rivalry between the three of them over the WWE title. Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series by defeating The Undertaker by disqualification on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\". Edge was added to the match while it was in progress, and pinned Triple H to win the match. This is because Jeff Hardy was originally supposed to compete, but was found unconscious in a Boston stairwell. At Armageddon, Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating then-ECW Champion Matt Hardy in a non-title match.
