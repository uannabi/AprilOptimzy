{"id":16564,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan","text":"Satan (meaning \"the enemy\" or \"the trouble-maker\" in Hebrew), sometimes called the Devil, is a figure found in the writings of the Abrahamic religions. Muslims, Christians and Jews believe that he tempts people to do bad things. His role is to question and tempt people's faith. They also say that he was once an angel named Lucifer.\nIn Satanism, Satan is thought to be just a metaphor for what humans want. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered to be a good force.\nIn the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith, \"Satan\" is not regarded as an independent evil power as he is in some faiths and religions, but rather signifies the \"lower nature\" of humans. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 explains: \"This lower nature in man is symbolized as Satan \u2014 the evil ego within us, not an evil personality outside.\" All other evil spirits described in various faith traditions\u2014such as fallen angels, demons, and jinns\u2014are also metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God. Actions, that are described as \"satanic\" in some Bah\u00E1'\u00ED writings, denote humans deeds caused by selfish desires.\nIn the Bible.\nMany people believe that Satan was first an angel called Lucifer that left Heaven and took many other angels with him. He did this because he thought he was as powerful as God.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":20},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":53},{"uri":"Devil","surface_form":"Devil","offset":83},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":115},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religion","offset":131},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":152},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christians","offset":161},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jews","offset":176},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":204},{"uri":"Faith","surface_form":"faith","offset":272},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":313},{"uri":"Lucifer","surface_form":"Lucifer","offset":325},{"uri":"Satanism","surface_form":"Satanism","offset":337},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":377},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":395},{"uri":"Theism","surface_form":"Theistic","offset":411},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith","offset":498},{"uri":"%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1","surface_form":"`Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1","offset":655},{"uri":"Fallen_angel","surface_form":"fallen angels","offset":856},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demons","offset":871},{"uri":"Jinn","surface_form":"jinns","offset":883},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphors","offset":898},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1001},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":1177},{"uri":"Lucifer","surface_form":"Lucifer","offset":1190},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"Heaven","offset":1208}]}
