{"id":165693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Drama_Island","text":"\"Total Drama Island\" is a Canadian animated television show created by Jennifer Pertsch and Tom McGillis, produced by FreshTV and Cartoon Network Studios and first shown on June 7, 2008 on Cartoon Network. It is shown in Canada on Teletoon. It is the first season of the \"Total Drama\" series, followed by \"Total Drama Action\", and \"Total Drama World Tour\".\nAbout the Show.\nThe game is an animated reality show where twenty-two 16-year-olds are divided into two groups of eleven each (the \"Killer Bass\" and the \"Screaming Gophers\") set in the summer camp \"Wakanakwa\" which is on an island in an unspecified zone in Muskoka, Ontario. The show spoofs many other reality shows, taking on elements of \"Survivor\", \"Fear Factor\" and \"Iron Chef\". Every week, both teams compete in a challenge. The winning team becomes immune to getting kicked off the show (called \"invincibility\"), while the losing team has to do an internal vote to select who is eliminated. That night, the losing team meets around a campfire, where Chris Mclean, the show's producer, gives each camper a marshmallow. The camper with the least votes for leaving gets the first marshmallow, the camper with the second least votes gets the second marshmallow, and so on, until the camper with the most votes for elimination is left. The camper that got the most votes is eliminated then, and must walk down the \"Dock of Shame\" to the \"Boat of The Losers\".\nInternational broadcast.\nCartoon Network has broadcast the show in many parts of Europe due to the Pan-European feed. Jetix has been broadcasting the show in The Netherlands, and the UK.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":26},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":35},{"uri":"Television_show","surface_form":"television show","offset":44},{"uri":"Jennifer_Pertsch","surface_form":"Jennifer Pertsch","offset":71},{"uri":"Tom_McGillis","surface_form":"Tom McGillis","offset":92},{"uri":"June_7","surface_form":"June 7","offset":173},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":181},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":221},{"uri":"Teletoon","surface_form":"Teletoon","offset":231},{"uri":"Total_Drama","surface_form":"Total Drama","offset":272},{"uri":"Total_Drama_Action","surface_form":"Total Drama Action","offset":306},{"uri":"Total_Drama_World_Tour","surface_form":"Total Drama World Tour","offset":332},{"uri":"Reality_show","surface_form":"reality show","offset":397},{"uri":"Bass_(fish)","surface_form":"Bass","offset":496},{"uri":"Gophers","surface_form":"Gophers","offset":521},{"uri":"Summer_camp","surface_form":"summer camp","offset":542},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":581},{"uri":"Muskoka","surface_form":"Muskoka","offset":614},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":623},{"uri":"Spoof","surface_form":"spoof","offset":641},{"uri":"Survivor_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Survivor","offset":697},{"uri":"Fear_Factor","surface_form":"Fear Factor","offset":709},{"uri":"Iron_Chef","surface_form":"Iron Chef","offset":727},{"uri":"Campfire","surface_form":"campfire","offset":996},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":1037},{"uri":"Marshmallow","surface_form":"marshmallow","offset":1067},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1497}]}
