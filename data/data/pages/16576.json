{"id":16576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwifruit","text":"Kiwifruit (\"Actinidia deliciosa\") is a fruit. It has an oval shape. It is green on the inside with small black seeds that can be eaten. The kiwi has furry brown skin that is edible but is usually removed. The skin is relatively thin. The kiwi is native to South China.\nThe fruit was named in 1959 after the kiwi, a bird and the symbol of New Zealand. Before that, its English name was Chinese gooseberry.\nThe kiwifruit is healthy and contains many vitamins and minerals. Kiwis are rich in vitamin C, vitamin K, potassium, and fiber. Kiwis have more vitamin C than an equivalent amount of orange.\nThere are different types of kiwifruit. The main types are Hayward (the most common green kiwifruit), chico, Saanichton 12, and golden kiwifruit. Golden kiwifruit are sweeter than normal green kiwifruit. Golden kiwifruit was invented by grafting and cross-pollinating different types of kiwifruit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":39},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":111},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":161},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":262},{"uri":"1959","surface_form":"1959","offset":292},{"uri":"Kiwi","surface_form":"kiwi","offset":307},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":338},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":368},{"uri":"Healthy","surface_form":"healthy","offset":422},{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":448},{"uri":"Dietary_mineral","surface_form":"minerals","offset":461},{"uri":"Vitamin_C","surface_form":"vitamin C","offset":489},{"uri":"Vitamin_K","surface_form":"vitamin K","offset":500},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":511},{"uri":"Dietary_fiber","surface_form":"fiber","offset":526},{"uri":"Orange_(fruit)","surface_form":"orange","offset":588},{"uri":"Grafting","surface_form":"grafting","offset":833},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"cross-pollinating","offset":846}]}
