{"id":16622,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City","text":"Quebec City (Ville de Qu\u00E9bec in French) is the capital of the Canadian province of Quebec. It is the second largest city in Quebec, behind Montreal. It is known for its winter fair, beautiful churches, and an old hotel called Ch\u00E2teau Frontenac. It is next to the Saint Lawrence River. There are almost 700,000 people in the whole area.\nThe city was created in 1608 at a First Nations (native) Canadian place called Stadacona. People came from France to live there. The English captured the city in 1759 during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The walls made to keep the city safe are still there. The walls that surrounded Old Quebec are the only remaining fortified city walls that still exist in the Americas north of Mexico. They were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\nQuebec City has a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\" in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification).\nMost people in Quebec City speak French. Many also speak English.\nMedia.\nQuebec City Stations\nCKMI Global Television Network","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":62},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":83},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":139},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_Frontenac","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau Frontenac","offset":226},{"uri":"Saint_Lawrence_River","surface_form":"Saint Lawrence River","offset":263},{"uri":"First_Nations","surface_form":"First Nations","offset":370},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Plains_of_Abraham","surface_form":"Battle of the Plains of Abraham","offset":514},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":753},{"uri":"Continental_climate","surface_form":"continental climate","offset":816},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":850},{"uri":"Quebec_City_Stations","surface_form":"Quebec City Stations","offset":955},{"uri":"CKMI","surface_form":"CKMI","offset":976},{"uri":"Global_Television_Network","surface_form":"Global Television Network","offset":981}]}
