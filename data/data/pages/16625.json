{"id":16625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations","text":"First Nations () are the people of native tribes who lived in the land now governed by Canada before Europeans came there. Many Canadians also use \"second Nations\" to mean people with natives in their family trees. Many say it because these nations were here long before Canada, and to make it clearer that the First Nations have many cultures, and that some of the cultures are very different from others. Some consider it a respect to those who first cultivated certain patches of land. The aboriginal people from Canada's Arctic are thought of as a different group of people, called the Inuit.\nThese First Nations are important in the world because their stories have taught us a lot about cultural values and how to live in harmony with the land.\nOther words that have been used for First Nations people, tribes, and cultures have been \"indigenous\", \"aboriginal\", \"Indian\", \"Native Indian\", \"Amerind,\" or \"native.\" Now many people say \"Indian\" only about people to India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"native tribes","offset":35},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":87},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":101},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":335},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":525},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Inuit","offset":590},{"uri":"Native_Indian","surface_form":"Native Indian","offset":879},{"uri":"Amerind","surface_form":"Amerind","offset":896},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":969}]}
