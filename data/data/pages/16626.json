{"id":16626,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick","text":"New Brunswick (postal abbreviation NB) is a province in the eastern part of Canada. The capital city of New Brunswick is Fredericton. Other large cities are Saint John and Moncton. More than 750,000 people live in New Brunswick.\nThe province is bordered by Quebec in the west, Nova Scotia in the east and the American state of Maine in the south. There is a link to Prince Edward Island also.\nThe English and French languages are both spoken in New Brunswick, and it is the only province in Canada where both languages are official. This is because about 33% of the people living in New Brunswick speak French.\nSome industries including forestry, mining, and farming are important to the province, and especially fishing since it is near the Atlantic Ocean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":44},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":76},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":88},{"uri":"Fredericton","surface_form":"Fredericton","offset":121},{"uri":"Saint_John%2C_New_Brunswick","surface_form":"Saint John","offset":157},{"uri":"Moncton","surface_form":"Moncton","offset":172},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":257},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":277},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":309},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":327},{"uri":"Prince_Edward_Island","surface_form":"Prince Edward Island","offset":366},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":397},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":409},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":416},{"uri":"Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","surface_form":"province in Canada","offset":479},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official","offset":523},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industries","offset":616},{"uri":"Forestry","surface_form":"forestry","offset":637},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":647},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":659},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":713},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":742}]}
