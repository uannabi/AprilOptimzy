{"id":166290,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_tree","text":"The curry tree (\"Murraya koenigii\"), also known as karivepallai, karivembu, karivepaku or kadipatta, is a kind of tree. It is found mostly in hot climates, and is a native plant of India. The leaves of the curry tree are called curry leaves or sweet Neem leaves.\nUsually, curry trees grow to 4-6 metres tall, and their trunk grows to 40 centimetres in diameter. Small black, shiny berries that grow on the tree can be eaten, but their seeds are poisonous.\nThe scientific name of the curry tree, \"Murraya koenegii\", was chosen to celebrate the botanist Johann Gerhard K\u00F6nig, who worked for a long time in India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":114},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":146},{"uri":"Native_plant","surface_form":"native plant","offset":165},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":181},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leave","offset":192},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":296},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"centimetre","offset":337},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":352},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":381},{"uri":"Eaten","surface_form":"eaten","offset":418},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":445},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":543},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":604}]}
