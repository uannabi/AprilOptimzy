They were successful in defeating the Axis nations. The war ended in 1945. The group of nations was later named the United Nations by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The main great powers, sometimes called \"The Big Three\", were the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.\nSome of the powers fought for a short time, or declared war but did not fight. Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland fought from 1944-1945 and before that were Axis powers.
