{"id":166319,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(military)","text":"=\"preserve\">A detachment (from the French word \"d\u00E9tachement\") is a military unit. It can be broken off from a bigger unit for a set reason or (as often seen in United States Army usage) can be a permanent unit smaller than a battalion. The term is often used to refer to a unit that is sent to a different base from the parent unit.\nA Cadet detachment usually consists of between 10 and 40 cadets. Several detachments make up a cadet company.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":35},{"uri":"Military_unit","surface_form":"military unit","offset":67},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":160},{"uri":"Permanent","surface_form":"permanent","offset":195},{"uri":"Battalion","surface_form":"battalion","offset":225},{"uri":"Different","surface_form":"different","offset":296},{"uri":"Cadet","surface_form":"cadet","offset":390},{"uri":"Company_(military)","surface_form":"company","offset":434}]}
