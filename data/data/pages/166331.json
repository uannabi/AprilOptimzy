{"id":166331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyanthropus_platyops","text":"\"Kenyanthropus platyops\" is an extinct hominid species discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999. It was by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team.\nThe fossil 3.5 to 3.2 million year old. It has a broad flat face with a toe bone that suggests it probably walked upright. Teeth are intermediate between typical human and typical ape forms.\nLeakey proposed that the fossil represents an entirely new hominine genus. Others classify it as a separate species of \"Australopithecus\", \"Australopithecus platyops\", and still others interpret it as an individual of \"Australopithecus afarensis\".\nIf some palaeoanthropologists are correct, \"Kenyanthropus\" may not even represent a valid taxon. The specimen is so distorted by matrix-filled cracks that meaningful morphological characteristics are next to impossible to assess with confidence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hominid","surface_form":"hominid","offset":39},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":47},{"uri":"Lake_Turkana","surface_form":"Lake Turkana","offset":69},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":83},{"uri":"Meave_Leakey","surface_form":"Meave Leakey","offset":137},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":162},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":320},{"uri":"Ape","surface_form":"ape","offset":338},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":417},{"uri":"Australopithecus","surface_form":"Australopithecus","offset":469},{"uri":"Australopithecus_afarensis","surface_form":"Australopithecus afarensis","offset":568},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":611}]}
