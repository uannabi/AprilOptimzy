{"id":166345,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combot","text":"Combot is a character made for the \"Tekken\" series. Its first and only appearance was in \"Tekken 4\".\nIntroduction.\nCombot is Mokujin's replacement in Tekken 4 (gameplay wise). Combot didn't mimic a different character every round like Mokujin, instead it changed fighting styles every match.\nStory.\nCombot is a humanoid robot (a robot that was made to act like humans). Lee entered it in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and he used it so he could win. He entered the tournament himself, disguising himself as a man named Violet\nCombot is not like any other humanoid robot. A powerful AI function lets it mimic any human motion it can see. With this ability, Combot can do any job from childcare, housekeeping, service industries, and even military duty.\nThis Combot is a unique version made for fighting. The making of Combot was very rushed so that it could be finished in time for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4.\nLee Chaolan\u2019s plan was to have Combot memorize different of fighting styles as it went through the tournament. Lee was trying to create the most powerful fighting robot in the world and win the Mishima Zaibatsu at the same time.\nThe development team did not have enough time to get rid of Combot's problems. As a result, a few bugs remained in its memory when the Tournament started. These bugs stop Combot from mimicking more than one person\u2019s moves each time it starts up.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Tekken Character| title = Combot"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tekken_(series)","surface_form":"Tekken","offset":36},{"uri":"Tekken_4","surface_form":"Tekken 4","offset":90},{"uri":"Mokujin","surface_form":"Mokujin","offset":125},{"uri":"Tekken_4","surface_form":"Tekken 4","offset":150},{"uri":"Mokujin","surface_form":"Mokujin","offset":235},{"uri":"Lee_Chaolan","surface_form":"Lee","offset":370},{"uri":"Violet_(Tekken)","surface_form":"Violet","offset":524}]}
