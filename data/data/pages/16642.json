This can include using a wheelchair, a cane or walking stick, hearing aids, a teletypewriter (TTY) and using specially designed software and hardware for the personal computer.\nPeople who use a wheelchair or cane/walking stick cannot walk up or down stairs in a building. They need to use ramps and elevators when going into and moving around in a building. Wide doorways and accessible toilets also make it easier for people with physical disabilities to use.\nPrejudice towards people with disabilities is common. This is sometimes called 'ableism'. A person with such a prejudice is called an ablecentrist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wheelchair","surface_form":"wheelchair","offset":210},{"uri":"Hearing_aid","surface_form":"hearing aid","offset":247},{"uri":"Teletypewriter","surface_form":"teletypewriter","offset":263},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":343},{"uri":"Prejudice","surface_form":"Prejudice","offset":646},{"uri":"Ableism","surface_form":"ableism","offset":726},{"uri":"Ablecentrist","surface_form":"ablecentrist","offset":780}]}
