It was the sixth yearly draft and the seventh overall.\nThe WWE draft is run by World Wrestling Entertainment. It is a way to add to their rosters after separating into two separate rosters (Raw and SmackDown!) in 2002. This is known as the WWE Brand Extension.\nECW was added as WWE's third brand in 2006. Under the brand extension, superstars are brand exclusive. This means they belong to and perform on brand. A brand uses its brand's show to perform. For example, SmackDown Superstars perform on SmackDown.\nThe draft was shown on an episode of Raw.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"WWE_Draft","surface_form":"WWE Draft","offset":22},{"uri":"April_13","surface_form":"April 13","offset":43},{"uri":"2009","surface_form":"2009","offset":53},{"uri":"Phillips_Arena","surface_form":"Phillips Arena","offset":65},{"uri":"Atlanta%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Atlanta, Georgia","offset":83},{"uri":"World_Wrestling_Entertainment","surface_form":"World Wrestling Entertainment","offset":180},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"Raw","offset":291},{"uri":"WWE_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown!","offset":299},{"uri":"WWE_Brand_Extension","surface_form":"WWE Brand Extension","offset":341},{"uri":"Extreme_Championship_Wrestling_(WWE)","surface_form":"ECW","offset":362},{"uri":"WWE_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown","offset":600},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"Raw","offset":648}]}
