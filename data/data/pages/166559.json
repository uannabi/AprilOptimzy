{"id":166559,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm","text":"Ernst Julius R\u00F6hm (28 November 1887 in Munich \u2013 1 July 1934 in Munich) was a leader and co-founder of the German Sturmabteilung, the Stormtroopers. He also was a member of the German Reichstag, where he was a minister from 1933 to 1934. He was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives, in 1934. Adolf Hitler gave the order to murder R\u00F6hm.\nDuring the First World War, R\u00F6hm fought as an officer. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.\nEarly life.\nErnst R\u00F6hm was born in Munich on 28 November 1887. He was the third child of a chief train inspector, Julius R\u00F6hm, and his wife, Emilie R\u00F6hm. He had one older brother and one older sister. His sister's son was Bernhard Lippert, a German diplomat.\nIn 1906, after his Abitur (school exams) in Munich, R\u00F6hm joined the Bavarian army as a Fanjunkare. Two years later he became a Lieutenant.\nFirst World War.\nIn 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, he was an adjutant and fought on the Western Front. He was wounded three times, and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. He was badly hurt in that year and lost a piece of his nasal bone. He worked for the Bavarian government in the War Department for the first time. Two years later, in 1918, he was given the rank of a captain (German: \"Hauptmann\").\nAfter the First World War, R\u00F6hm went to the Freikorps (Free Corps) of Franz Ritter von Epp. He wanted to fight against the Communists in Munich. With this group, he went to fight against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In July 1919, the Freikorps became part of the Reichswehr.\nInvolvement in the Nazi Party.\nIn 1919, R\u00F6hm joined the German Workers' Party (German: \"Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (DAP)\"). This was the precursor of the Nazi party. One year later, he became a member of the German Nazi Party. He received the membership number 623. R\u00F6hm helped Hitler establish relationships with the Bavarian politicians and the industrialists. Two years later, R\u00F6hm and Hitler started the Sturmabteilung (SA), attracting many men from the Freikorps. It was founded as a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. Hitler made R\u00F6hm the leader of the SA.\nR\u00F6hm took a part in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The Nazi Party tried to overthrow the government, but failed. R\u00F6hm was arrested and charged with high treason. The judges decided he was guilty on 1 April 1924. R\u00F6hm went to prison for five months and lost his job in the army. Following the court trial, both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung became illegal.\nIn 1924, R\u00F6hm helped start the \"Frontbann\", an alternative to the Sturmabteilung. After an argument with Adolf Hitler, R\u00F6hm retired as leader of the SA. He said that he was only a soldier and not a politician. Between 1928 and 1930, he worked for the Bolivian military as an advisor.\nLeader of the Sturmabteilung.\nOn 1 November 1930, he went back to Germany and joined the Nazi Party a second time. In January 1931, Adolf Hitler placed R\u00F6hm in charge of the Sturmabteilung. In just over a year, he expanded it from 70,000 to 170,000 members. In April 1932, Chancellor Heinrich Br\u00FCning banned the SA again. Franz von Papen, who was chancellor after Heinrich Br\u00FCning, annulled the ban in June. In 1933, Ernst R\u00F6hm became a \"Reichsminister\", a minister of the Reichstag. In 1934, the SA had over 4,500,000 members. The power of the SA increased. Because of this, Adolf Hitler and the Schutzstaffel (SS) started a new dispute with R\u00F6hm. The SA was about 20 times greater in membership than the \"Reichswehr\"; R\u00F6hm was dreaming to take over the \"Reichswehr\".\nHitler was afraid of R\u00F6hm's power. R\u00F6hm wanted to merge the Sturmabteilung with the general army, with him as leader. He also wanted a \"second Nazi revolution\" to make Germany more socialist. He was an anticapitalist, and at this time, Hitler was trying to befriend Germany's industrialists. Hitler planned to kill R\u00F6hm.\nNight of the Long Knives.\nR\u00F6hm arranged with Hitler that the Sturmabteilung would get four weeks holiday during the summer of 1934. The holiday started on 1 July 1934. R\u00F6hm wanted to go to Bad Wiessee for rest. On 29 June 1934, R\u00F6hm was arrested, yet had no trial. He was given the choice by Theodor Eicke: to commit suicide or be killed. On 1 July, Theodor Eicke shot R\u00F6hm as instructed by Hitler. R\u00F6hm was buried in the Munich western cemetery.\nMany Sturmabteilung leaders were killed on that same night, mostly by the Schutzstaffel and Gestapo. It was called the \"Night of the Long Knives\". The next day the German parliament passed a law with only one paragraph making the murders at the Night of the Long Knives legal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":39},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":106},{"uri":"Sturmabteilung","surface_form":"Sturmabteilung","offset":113},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"Reichstag","offset":183},{"uri":"Reichsminister","surface_form":"minister","offset":209},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":244},{"uri":"Night_of_the_Long_Knives","surface_form":"Night of the Long Knives","offset":264},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":299},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":354},{"uri":"Iron_Cross","surface_form":"Iron Cross","offset":417},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":538},{"uri":"Inspector","surface_form":"inspector","offset":544},{"uri":"Bernhard_Lippert","surface_form":"Bernhard Lippert","offset":663},{"uri":"Diplomat","surface_form":"diplomat","offset":690},{"uri":"Abitur","surface_form":"Abitur","offset":719},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":744},{"uri":"Bavarian_army","surface_form":"Bavarian army","offset":768},{"uri":"Fanjunkare","surface_form":"Fanjunkare","offset":787},{"uri":"Lieutenant","surface_form":"Lieutenant","offset":827},{"uri":"WWI","surface_form":"First World War","offset":889},{"uri":"Adjutant","surface_form":"adjutant","offset":916},{"uri":"Western_Front_(World_War_I)","surface_form":"Western Front","offset":943},{"uri":"Iron_Cross","surface_form":"Iron Cross","offset":1006},{"uri":"Nasal_bone","surface_form":"nasal bone","offset":1085},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1124},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":1230},{"uri":"Freikorps","surface_form":"Freikorps","offset":1305},{"uri":"Franz_Ritter_von_Epp","surface_form":"Franz Ritter von Epp","offset":1331},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"Communists","offset":1384},{"uri":"Reichswehr","surface_form":"Reichswehr","offset":1525},{"uri":"German_Workers%27_Party","surface_form":"German Workers' Party","offset":1593},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":1616},{"uri":"Precursor","surface_form":"precursor","offset":1672},{"uri":"NSDAP","surface_form":"Nazi party","offset":1689},{"uri":"Nationalsozialistische_Deutsche_Arbeiterpartei","surface_form":"German Nazi Party","offset":1743},{"uri":"Establish","surface_form":"establish","offset":1820},{"uri":"Relation","surface_form":"relationship","offset":1830},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":1853},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":1862},{"uri":"Industrial","surface_form":"industrial","offset":1882},{"uri":"Sturmabteilung","surface_form":"Sturmabteilung","offset":1943},{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":2024},{"uri":"Beer_Hall_Putsch","surface_form":"Beer Hall Putsch","offset":2133},{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":2261},{"uri":"Judges","surface_form":"judges","offset":2274},{"uri":"Guilty","surface_form":"guilty","offset":2296},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":2463},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":2723},{"uri":"Advisor","surface_form":"advisor","offset":2747},{"uri":"Chancellor","surface_form":"Chancellor","offset":3029},{"uri":"Heinrich_Br%C3%BCning","surface_form":"Heinrich Br\u00FCning","offset":3040},{"uri":"Franz_von_Papen","surface_form":"Franz von Papen","offset":3078},{"uri":"Cancel","surface_form":"annulled","offset":3138},{"uri":"Reichsminister","surface_form":"Reichsminister","offset":3194},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"Reichstag","offset":3229},{"uri":"Schutzstaffel","surface_form":"Schutzstaffel","offset":3353},{"uri":"Reichswehr","surface_form":"Reichswehr","offset":3463},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":3706},{"uri":"Anticapitalism","surface_form":"anticapitalist","offset":3727},{"uri":"Bad_Wiessee","surface_form":"Bad Wiessee","offset":4035},{"uri":"Theodor_Eicke","surface_form":"Theodor Eicke","offset":4138},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":4163},{"uri":"Cemetery","surface_form":"cemetery","offset":4283},{"uri":"Schutzstaffel","surface_form":"Schutzstaffel","offset":4367},{"uri":"Gestapo","surface_form":"Gestapo","offset":4385},{"uri":"Night_of_the_Long_Knives","surface_form":"Night of the Long Knives","offset":4413},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"parliament","offset":4464},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":4484}]}
