{"id":166601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Wikipedia","text":"The Chinese Wikipedia (In Chinese: /) is the Chinese-language edition of Wikipedia. This edition was started in October 24, 2002. The Chinese Wikipedia can show the same article in many different scripts, in both Simplified and Traditional script.\nIt is the 15th largest edition by article count.\nAs of August 8, 2020, it had 1,135,768 articles.\nName origin.\nIn the English language, \"Wikipedia\" is a portmanteau word made by \"Wiki\" (A technology that allows many people working together) and \"encyclopedia\". At first, \"Wikipedia\" did not have a Chinese name. The site was called \"Zhongwen Wikipedia\" (\u4E2D\u6587Wikipedia, Chinese Wikipedia). On October 21, 2003, Wikipedia's Chinese name \"Weiji Baike\" (\u7EF4\u57FA\u767E\u79D1/\u7DAD\u57FA\u767E\u79D1, meaning Weiji Encyclopedia) was decided by the Chinese wiki community (13 people voted). The pronunciation of \"Weiji\" is like the pronunciation of \"Wiki\". \"Wei\" (\u7EF4/\u7DAD) means rope that can link things, or net. \"Ji\" (\u57FA) means basic, or base. So \"Weiji Baike\" means \"the encyclopedia on the Internet that covers human's all basic knowledge\".\nAutoconfirmation.\nUnlike other Wikipedias, users who register an account on the Chinese Wikipedia need to make at least 50 edits and have an account for more than 7 days before being autoconfirmed, which allows the user to edit semi-protected pages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":26},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese-language","offset":45},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":73},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"scripts","offset":196},{"uri":"Simplified_Chinese","surface_form":"Simplified","offset":213},{"uri":"Traditional_Chinese","surface_form":"Traditional","offset":228},{"uri":"Portmanteau_word","surface_form":"portmanteau word","offset":401},{"uri":"Wiki","surface_form":"Wiki","offset":427},{"uri":"Encyclopedia","surface_form":"encyclopedia","offset":494},{"uri":"%E7%BB%B4","surface_form":"\u7EF4","offset":869},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":880},{"uri":"%E5%9F%BA","surface_form":"\u57FA","offset":921}]}
