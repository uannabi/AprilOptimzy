{"id":166608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keymer","text":"Keymer is a village in West Sussex, England. It can be found on the B2116 road 2.4 miles south of Burgess Hill.\nKeymer used to be a village on its own until it was merged into the modern day village of Hassocks. Keymer's records go back as far as The Domesday Book. Keymer is situated just to the east of Hassocks and is only a matter of a few hundred yards from the boundary with East Sussex. It has a fine parish church unusually called St Cosmas and St Damian Church. The oldest part of Keymer can be found in the area of this church and the Greyhound Pub.\nTo the north-east of Keymer can be found Oldland Mill dating from the 17th Century. It is one of the few remaining windmills still standing in the south-east. The new burial ground that is now run by Hassocks Parish Council can be found located to the east of the Greyhound Pub.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UK place"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":12},{"uri":"West_Sussex","surface_form":"West Sussex","offset":23},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":36},{"uri":"Burgess_Hill","surface_form":"Burgess Hill","offset":98},{"uri":"Hassocks","surface_form":"Hassocks","offset":202},{"uri":"The_Domesday_Book","surface_form":"The Domesday Book","offset":247},{"uri":"East_Sussex","surface_form":"East Sussex","offset":381},{"uri":"Oldland_Mill","surface_form":"Oldland Mill","offset":601}]}
