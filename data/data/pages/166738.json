Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15. Its strongest winds were 150\u00A0mph (240\u00A0h), classifying it as a Category\u00A04 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\nThe storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew, twelve years earlier. In the United States, Charley caused ten\u00A0deaths and $15.4\u00A0billion in damage (2004\u00A0USD).\nThe destruction from Hurricane Charley.\nCharley did its damage in a very similar manner to Andrew: high winds caused almost all the damage, and both storms made landfall at low tide, preventing the storm surges from causing damage like they usually do when hurricanes make landfall. Both were compact storms upon landfall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":33},{"uri":"2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2004 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":100},{"uri":"Miles_per_hour","surface_form":"mph","offset":204},{"uri":"Kilometres_per_hour","surface_form":"h","offset":213},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","offset":265},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":337},{"uri":"Hurricane_Andrew","surface_form":"Hurricane Andrew","offset":408}]}
