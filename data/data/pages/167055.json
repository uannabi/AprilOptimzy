{"id":167055,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a field is a certain kind of algebraic structure. In a field, one can add (formula_1), subtract (formula_1), multiply (formula_1) and divide (formula_1) two numbers (with division only possible if formula_1 is non-zero). A field is a special ring in which division is possible. Both the set of rational numbers and the set of real numbers are examples of fields. One can also use the symbol formula_1 as a variable for a field.\nExamples of fields.\nIn fact, among the subsets of complex numbers, the largest field is formula_1 and the smallest field is formula_1. The set of integers, formula_1, is not a field, because the result of a division is not always an integer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Algebraic_structure","surface_form":"algebraic structure","offset":58},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"add","offset":99},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtract","offset":116},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiply","offset":138},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"divide","offset":163},{"uri":"Ring_(mathematics)","surface_form":"ring","offset":271},{"uri":"Rational_number","surface_form":"rational numbers","offset":323},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":355},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":603}]}
