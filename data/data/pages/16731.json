They are the living members of the family Tachyglossidae'\".\nEchnidas have a long, tube-like mouth with a sticky tongue. They are also covered in spines. They have mammary glands, and lay eggs.\nThe echidna has a method of protecting itself. With its long, sharp claws, they quickly dig a hole until only their spines are showing when they are hiding in the hole. The predator will not be able to get it without injuring itself on the spines.\nWhen there is a fire, the echidna will dig down out of reach of the fire.\nPrey.\nThe short-beaked echidna (\"Tachyglossus\") eats termites and ants. The three \"Zaglossus\" species also eat other small insects and grubs. Echidnas pick up the prey with their sticky tongues.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anteater","surface_form":"anteater","offset":19},{"uri":"Monotreme","surface_form":"monotreme","offset":34},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":58},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":75},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":122},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":179},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":199},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":274},{"uri":"Claw","surface_form":"claw","offset":348},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":453},{"uri":"Short-beaked_echidna","surface_form":"short-beaked echidna","offset":612},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":668},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"grubs","offset":737},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":765}]}
