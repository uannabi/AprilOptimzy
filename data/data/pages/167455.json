{"id":167455,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics","text":"Dianetics is an alternative mental health therapy created by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, who published a book on the subject in 1950 under the name \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\". It is about the way people think. Hubbard also started the religion of Scientology, which uses Dianetics.\nThe photo at the right shows a person learning about Dianetics by doing a stress test. The idea of the stress test is to show people something in their own minds.\nMost psychologists think that Dianetics is a pseudoscience. That means that it is not really a science, and it only looks like one.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":61},{"uri":"L._Ron_Hubbard","surface_form":"L.
