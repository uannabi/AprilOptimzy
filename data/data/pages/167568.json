{"id":167568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A metropolis is a word that means a very big city, that usually has over 500,000 people living in it. A metropolis often has many smaller towns and cities inside its area. The word is very old and began in Greece.\nIn a broader sense, it refers to the city or state of origin of a colony (as of ancient Greece), a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or a large important city.\nIn the past many large cities were called a metropolis due to their size or importance; such as: Alexandria, Angkor, Antioch, Athens, Babylon, Baghdad, Beirut, Benares, Byblos, Cahokia, Carthage, Constantinople, Corinth, Damascus, Dholavira, Ephesus, Great Zimbabwe, Harappa, Jerusalem, Leptis Magna, Nanjing, Nineveh, Macchu Picchu, Mohenjo-Daro, Rome, Sarai, Side, Siracuse, Tenochtitlan, Teotihuacan, Tikal, Tyre, Xian and Ur.\nModern Metropolises.\nThe modern metropolises are increasing day by day in this world since pre-21st century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":59},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":220},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":294},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"ancient Greece","offset":308},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":502},{"uri":"Antioch","surface_form":"Antioch","offset":522},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":531},{"uri":"Babylon","surface_form":"Babylon","offset":539},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":548},{"uri":"Beirut","surface_form":"Beirut","offset":557},{"uri":"Benares","surface_form":"Benares","offset":565},{"uri":"Byblos","surface_form":"Byblos","offset":574},{"uri":"Carthage","surface_form":"Carthage","offset":591},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":601},{"uri":"Corinth","surface_form":"Corinth","offset":617},{"uri":"Damascus","surface_form":"Damascus","offset":626},{"uri":"Ephesus","surface_form":"Ephesus","offset":647},{"uri":"Great_Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Great Zimbabwe","offset":656},{"uri":"Harappa","surface_form":"Harappa","offset":672},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":681},{"uri":"Nanjing","surface_form":"Nanjing","offset":706},{"uri":"Nineveh","surface_form":"Nineveh","offset":715},{"uri":"Mohenjo-Daro","surface_form":"Mohenjo-Daro","offset":739},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":753},{"uri":"Side","surface_form":"Side","offset":766},{"uri":"Tenochtitlan","surface_form":"Tenochtitlan","offset":782},{"uri":"Teotihuacan","surface_form":"Teotihuacan","offset":796},{"uri":"Tikal","surface_form":"Tikal","offset":809},{"uri":"Tyre%2C_Lebanon","surface_form":"Tyre","offset":816},{"uri":"Ur","surface_form":"Ur","offset":831}]}
