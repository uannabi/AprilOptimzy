{"id":167608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory","text":"=\"preserve\">Order theory is a field of mathematics. It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set. Given a binary relation it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order. It is also possible to say that a certain element \"comes before\" another one, for that relation. Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is \"smaller than\" the other.\n\"reflexive: \"each element of the set is within a relation with itself.\n\"anti-symmetric:\" if A and B are in relation, and B is also in a relation with A, then A must be equal to B.\n\"transitive: \"if A and B in a relation, and B is in a relation with C, then A and C must be in a relation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":39},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":122},{"uri":"Binary_relation","surface_form":"binary relation","offset":135}]}
