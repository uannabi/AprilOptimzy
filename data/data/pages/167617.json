{"id":167617,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring","text":"Hermann Wilhelm G\u00F6ring (12 January 1893 in Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria, Bavaria, Germany\u00A0\u2013 15 October 1946 in Nuremberg, Middle Franconia, Bavaria, Germany) was a German politician and military leader of Germany. As second in command after Hitler, he was one of the most powerful leaders of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Between 1932 and 1945, he was President of the German Reichstag and also a minister of the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler. In the Second World War, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the German air force. G\u00F6ring was responsible for the creation of the concentration camps and the Gestapo, the official secret Nazi police, which he handed over to SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In 1941, he gave Reinhard Heydrich the order to arrange the Final Solution to kill millions of Jews.\nG\u00F6ring was one of the 25 people charged at the Nuremberg Trials. The court decided he was guilty. The judgment on 1 October 1946 said that he was to be hanged, but he killed himself by swallowing a tablet of cyanide a few hours before he could be executed.\nEarly life.\nHermann G\u00F6ring, son of Ernst Heinrich G\u00F6ring and Franziska G\u00F6ring (born Tiefenbrunn), was born in Rosenheim, Bavaria. G\u00F6ring's father was a judge. The German chancellor Otto von Bismarck made Ernst G\u00F6ring the first \"Reichskommissar\" (Governor-General) of \"South West Africa\" (today: Namibia), in 1885.\nHermann G\u00F6ring had two brothers, Albert G\u00F6ring and Karl Ernst G\u00F6ring, and two sisters, Olga Therese Sophie G\u00F6ring and Paula Elisabeth Rosa G\u00F6ring.\nHe spent the first three years of his life at the home of a friend of his mother, because G\u00F6ring's father was in Namibia. From 1901, he lived at his godfather Hermann von Epenstein mansion. Hermann's mother had an affair (a romantic relationship with someone other than her husband) with von Epenstein. He attended the grammar schools in F\u00FCrth and Ansbach. In the games he played as a child, the story was always about war.\nIn 1905, he went to a military school in Karlsruhe. He got his Abitur, and an officer exam, in 1912. He then went to the Bavarian Prinz Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) in Mulhouse.\nFirst World War.\nWhen the First World War started, G\u00F6ring had the rank of Lieutenant. He served in the infantry. In 1915, because of his rheumatism, he had to go to a hospital. His friend, Bruno Loerzer, got him to join the air force. In France, he flew as an observer, a person who looked for targets and enemy planes. Because of this, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class in 1915. In 1916, he was trained to fly a plane. On 14 March 1916, he shot down his first bomber. In 1917, he became the leader of the 27th Flying Group. In 1918, after he shot his 19th plane, he was awarded the Pour le M\u00E9rite (also called \"The Blue Max\"). This was the highest air force award in Germany. After the death of Manfred von Richthofen, he became the leader of the flying group \"The Red Baron\".\nWeimar Republic.\nBetween 1919 and 1921, G\u00F6ring worked as a stunt pilot in Scandinavia. In November 1922, he met Adolf Hitler and became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). G\u00F6ring married Carin in Stockholm on 3 February 1923. In 1923 he was leading the SA (\"Oberste SA-F\u00FChrer\"), and he took part in the Beer Hall Putsch and was wounded. After this, he went to Austria. Because of pain, a doctor injected him with morphine but he became dependent on it. Between 1925 and 1926, he had two treatments in Sweden at the L\u00E5ngbro mental hospital. He came back to Germany in 1927. In 1928, he became a member of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. He was a member of the Reichstag until the end of the Second World War. In 1932, the NSDAP became the most powerful party of the Reichstag. G\u00F6ring then became president of the Reichstag.\nG\u00F6ring during the Third Reich.\nWhen Hitler became chancellor of the Weimar Germany in 1933, he made G\u00F6ring a minister of the Reich without a specific area of responsibility. This means that he was not the head of a ministry. In April 1933, he was made minister president of Prussia. Then, on 30 August 1933, he was made a General by Paul von Hindenburg. Between 1934 and 1935 he became minister of several agencies. His wife had died in 1931, and in 1935 he married Emmy Sonnemann in Berlin. In 1936, he sent the German Condor Legion to Spain to help Francisco Franco. After the Kristallnacht in 1938, he was in charge of removing Jewish businessmen from the German economic system. During Second World War, his biggest defeat was the loss of the air battle against Great Britain. Hitler named G\u00F6ring to be his successor if he died in 1939.\nIn 1940, he was made Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Empire) by Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. In 1941, G\u00F6ring ordered Heydrich to make a plan for the Holocaust. In 1942, he gave Fritz Sauckel the order to use the Russian population for industry-work. In 1943, G\u00F6ring had an expensive birthday party for his 50th birthday. On 20 April 1945, he left Hitler's birthday party and went to Berchtesgaden. He told Hitler that he had important things to do in south Germany. From Berchtesgaden, G\u00F6ring sent a telegram to Hitler in Berlin. In the telegram G\u00F6ring asked about taking over the affairs of state. Towards the end of the war, after the telegram, he started to talk with the Allies. Because of this, Hitler wanted to put G\u00F6ring in prison. G\u00F6ring then went to the Americans.\nOn 29 April 1945 Hitler removed G\u00F6ring from all his offices, stripped him off his party membership and ordered his arrest. He wrote this down in his testament.\nAfter the war.\nG\u00F6ring surrendered in Bavaria on 9 May 1945. The Nuremberg Trials started on 20 November 1945. On 18 March 1946, G\u00F6ring was questioned by the Allies. After this, he was imprisoned in Nuremberg. He was the third-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg. Only Reich President (former \"Gro\u00DFadmiral\") Karl D\u00F6nitz and former Deputy F\u00FChrer Rudolf Hess had higher ranks than G\u00F6ring. The judges decided he was guilty. Because of this on 1 October 1946 the court reached a verdict that he was to be hanged. One day before he was to be hanged, he committed suicide by taking a tablet of cyanide. It is not known how G\u00F6ring got the cyanide or how long he hid it but there was a claim that he was given it by an American soldier who was in love with a German woman who was in touch with him. It is not known if this is the truth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rosenheim","surface_form":"Rosenheim","offset":43},{"uri":"Upper_Bavaria_Government_Region","surface_form":"Upper
