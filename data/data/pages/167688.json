Before it was named Varuna, it had the provisional designation.\nVaruna is named after the Hindu deity Varu\u1E47a.\nPhysical characteristics.\nVaruna completes one rotation in about 3.17 hours (or 6.34 hours, depending on whether the light curve is single or double-peaked). Given the fast rotation, which is not common for objects so big, Varuna is thought to be a stretched spheroid, with a density around 1g/cm\u00B3 (close to the density of water).\nThe surface of Varuna is somewhat red and small amounts of water ice have been found on its surface.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kuiper_belt","surface_form":"Kuiper belt","offset":22},{"uri":"Dwarf_planet","surface_form":"dwarf planet","offset":62},{"uri":"Provisional_designation","surface_form":"provisional designation","offset":115},{"uri":"Light_curve","surface_form":"light curve","offset":303},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":462}]}
