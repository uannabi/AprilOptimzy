{"id":167775,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howler_monkey","text":"Howler monkeys, genus \"Alouatta\", are one of the largest New World monkeys. There are 15 species. They are native to South and Central American forests.\nThese monkeys are famous for their loud howls, which can travel three miles (4.8\u00A0km) through dense forest. They are the loudest monkey and may be the loudest land animal. Group males call at dawn and dusk, and at times during the day. The function of howling may relate to intergroup spacing and territory protection.\nThese social primates live high in the trees (the canopy) of the rain forests of Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, northern Argentina, and Bolivia. Howlers have a life span of about 20 years. They are in decline due to a loss of habitat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"New_World_monkeys","surface_form":"New World monkeys","offset":57},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":89},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South","offset":117},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":127},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":144},{"uri":"Howl","surface_form":"howl","offset":193},{"uri":"Monkey","surface_form":"monkey","offset":281},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":392},{"uri":"Canopy","surface_form":"canopy","offset":521},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":552},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":569},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":580},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":590},{"uri":"Guyana","surface_form":"Guyana","offset":599},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":607},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":624},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":639},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":729}]}
