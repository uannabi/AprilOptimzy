{"id":167829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force","text":"The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Australia. It is made up of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Air Force and a number of joint groups.\nAt first the Australian Government set up three separate armed services. In 1976, the government decided to have a single military headquarters. Over time, the three services have combined headquarters, logistics and training camps.\nThe ADF is small, but uses a lot of technology. With 53,000 full-time active-duty service people and 20,000 part-time reserve forces, it is the largest military force in Oceania. It is much smaller than most Asian military forces. The ADF does not have enough people in some highly skilled areas, but it is still able to send forces in many regions outside Australia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"military organisation","offset":42},{"uri":"Defense_(military)","surface_form":"defence","offset":84},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":95},{"uri":"Royal_Australian_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Australian Navy","offset":127},{"uri":"Australian_Army","surface_form":"Australian Army","offset":154},{"uri":"Royal_Australian_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Australian Air Force","offset":175},{"uri":"Government_of_Australia","surface_form":"Australian Government","offset":245},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":421},{"uri":"Logistics","surface_form":"logistics","offset":435},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":501},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":635},{"uri":"Asian","surface_form":"Asian","offset":673}]}
