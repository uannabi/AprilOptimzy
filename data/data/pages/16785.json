{"id":16785,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll","text":"e=\"preserve\">Midway Atoll was the site of a famous battle in World War II, the Battle of Midway. The United States of America took control of the atoll in the 19th century when nobody lived there.\nWildlife.\nMidway Atoll is now home to 67-70% of the world's Laysan Albatross population, and 34-39% of the global Black-footed Albatross.\nWhile Midway supports nearly three million birds, each seabird species has carved out a specific site on the atoll in which to nest. Seventeen different species of seabird can be found, the rarest of which is the Short-tailed Albatross, otherwise known as the \u201CGolden Gooney.\u201D Fewer than 2,200 are believed to exist due to excessive feather hunting in the late nineteenth century.\nOver 250 different species of looli marine life are found in the of lagoon and surrounding waters. The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals raise their pups on the beaches. Monk seals are benthic foragers and rely on the Midway Atoll\u2019s reef fish, squid, octopus and crustaceans. Green sea turtles, another threatened species, occasionally nest on the island. The first was found in 2006 on Spitsy Rinaia Island and another in 2007 on Sand Island. A resident pod of 300 spinner dolphins live in the lagoons and nearshore waters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":61},{"uri":"Battle_of_Midway","surface_form":"Battle of Midway","offset":79},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":101},{"uri":"Atoll","surface_form":"atoll","offset":146},{"uri":"Albatross","surface_form":"Albatross","offset":264},{"uri":"Albatross","surface_form":"Albatross","offset":561},{"uri":"Hawaiian_monk_seal","surface_form":"Hawaiian monk seal","offset":841},{"uri":"Benthos","surface_form":"benthic","offset":909},{"uri":"Green_turtle","surface_form":"Green sea turtles","offset":1000},{"uri":"Spinner_dolphin","surface_form":"spinner dolphin","offset":1190}]}
