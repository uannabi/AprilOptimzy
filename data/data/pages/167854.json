{"id":167854,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Night_of_Champions","text":"e=\"preserve\">Night of Champions is a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event run by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).\nThe event started as a pay-per-view under the name Vengeance in 2001, replacing Armageddon for that year due to the possible insensitivity of the latter's name with respect to the September 11 attacks. In 2002, Vengeance took over Fully Loaded's pay-per-view spot. The 2003 event was belonged to the SmackDown! brand, while from 2004 to 2006, the events were Raw only. In 2005, Vengeance was moved again, this time changing positions with The Great American Bash.\nThe 2007 event was named, as all nine WWE championships were defended that night. In 2008, the event was renamed to Night of Champions, keeping the format of the 2007 event, but dropping the Vengeance name. In 2009, the event was moved back to July.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":44},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":67},{"uri":"World_Wrestling_Entertainment","surface_form":"World Wrestling Entertainment","offset":99},{"uri":"WWE_Armageddon","surface_form":"Armageddon","offset":216},{"uri":"September_11_attacks","surface_form":"September 11 attacks","offset":316},{"uri":"WWF_Fully_Loaded","surface_form":"Fully Loaded","offset":367},{"uri":"WWE_Friday_Night_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown!","offset":436},{"uri":"WWE_Brand_Extension","surface_form":"brand","offset":447},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"Raw","offset":495},{"uri":"WWE_The_Bash","surface_form":"The Great American Bash","offset":575}]}
