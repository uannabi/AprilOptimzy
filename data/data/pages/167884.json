The pigment carmine is used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, rouge, yogurt, cosmetics, food additives, and crimson ink.\nThe first recorded use of \"carmine\" as a color name in English was in 1523.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":52},{"uri":"Ruby","surface_form":"rubies","offset":68},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":230},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":391},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":426},{"uri":"Carminic_acid","surface_form":"carminic acid","offset":454},{"uri":"Scale_insect","surface_form":"scale insect","offset":485},{"uri":"Cochineal","surface_form":"cochineal","offset":512},{"uri":"Polish_cochineal","surface_form":"Polish cochineal","offset":530},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":602},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":805}]}
