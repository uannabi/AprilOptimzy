{"id":167946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant","text":"The gravitational constant, called formula_1 in physics equations, is an empirical physical constant. It is used to show the force between two objects caused by gravity. The gravitational constant appears in Isaac Newton's universal law of gravitation.\nformula_1 is about N\u22C5m2/kg2, and is denoted by letter formula_1.\nIt usually appears in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, and in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. It is also known as the universal gravitational constant, Newton's constant, and colloquially as Big G'\". It should not be confused with \"small g\" (\"g\"), which is the local gravitational field of the Earth (equivalent to the free-fall acceleration).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":48},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":56},{"uri":"Empiricism","surface_form":"empirical","offset":73},{"uri":"Physical_constant","surface_form":"physical constant","offset":83},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":161},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":208},{"uri":"Sir_Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Sir Isaac Newton","offset":340},{"uri":"Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation","surface_form":"law of universal gravitation","offset":359},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":396},{"uri":"General_theory_of_relativity","surface_form":"general theory of relativity","offset":414},{"uri":"Gravity_of_Earth","surface_form":"g","offset":593}]}
