Because he was Jewish, he swore his oath on a Hebrew Bible, instead of a Christian Bible, and while wearing a kippah. At the time, British laws did not let Jews have important positions like these, and Hart was expelled from the assembly. He was elected again in 1808 and expelled again.\nHe did not run for public office again. He continued to live in Trois-Rivi\u00E8res where he was a successful businessman and well-respected member of the community. He served in the militia during the War of 1812 and became colonel in 1830.\nHe came from a very important and rich family. His father, Aaron Hart, was member of the British forces, and a well-known businessman in Canada. His brothers, Moses and Benjamin, were important businessmen at Trois-Rivi\u00E8res and Montreal.
