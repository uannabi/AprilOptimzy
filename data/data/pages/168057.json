{"id":168057,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resaca_Confederate_Cemetery","text":"Resaca Confederate Cemetery in Resaca, Georgia is home to over 400 confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War, also known as the War Between the States. This particular cemetery is designated for the soldiers that fought in the Battle of Resaca which took place May 14 and 15, 1864. Although the battle lasted two days, there are only three graves where the death date is listed as May 15, 1864. The remaining graves are listed as May 14, 1864. There are 424 graves marked 'unknown'.\nHistory.\nAfter the battle, a family known as the Green family returned to their plantation and the sight that met them there was almost more than they could bear. The bodies of confederate soldiers were buried in crude makeshift graves all across the yard. Compelled by a since of respect to those who had fallen in action, Mary J. Green and her sister began collecting the bodies to bury properly. Though poverty was rampant the Green daughters wrote friends asking for any amount money they could give. Col. John Green gave his daughters 2.5 acres of land for use as a cemetery for these soldiers. With the money collected and the land provided, the Green daughters and their mother began work on what we now call the Resaca Confederate Cemetery.\nThe Resaca Confederate Cemetery was founded on October 25, 1866. This cemetery and one in Winchester, Virginia were both dedicated on the same day. Each group thought they were the first confederate cemetery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":108}]}
