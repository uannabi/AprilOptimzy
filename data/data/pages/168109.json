{"id":168109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function","text":"The Dirac delta function, often written as formula_1, is a made-up concept by mathematician Paul Dirac. It is a really pointy and skinny function that pokes out a point along a wave. Loosely speaking, it has the value of zero everywhere except at formula_1, in such a way that the area between the function and the \"x\"-axis adds up to 1. The delta function is often used in sampling theory, where its pointiness is useful for getting clean samples.\nThe integral of the Dirac delta function is the Heaviside function. Thus Dirac delta function can be view as the derivative of Heaviside function.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paul_Dirac","surface_form":"Paul Dirac","offset":92},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integral","offset":453},{"uri":"Heaviside_Function","surface_form":"Heaviside function","offset":497}]}
