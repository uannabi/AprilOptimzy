In fact, it will work just as well with a variety of starting values. Here is an example when the starting value is 3: \"The sum of the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_1 degrees.\"\nThe initial starting value is 3, and the interior angles of a triangle is formula_1 degrees.\nAssume that the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_1 degrees. Add on a triangle which makes the figure a formula_1-sided polygon, and that increases the count of the angles by 180 degrees formula_1 degrees. Since both the base case and the inductive case are handled, the proof is now complete.\nThere are a great many mathematical objects for which proofs by mathematical induction works. The technical term is a \"well-ordered set\".\nInductive definition.\nThe same idea can work to \"define\" a set of objects, as well as to prove statements about that set of objects.\nThere is a set of axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers which is based on mathematical induction. This is called \"Peano's Axioms\".
