{"id":168214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypeptide","text":"A polypeptide is a string or linear chain of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins. A single polypeptide chain might make up the entire primary structure of a simple protein; more complex proteins are formed when two or more polypeptides link together. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids.\nPolypeptides are made when mRNA is translated, a process involving ribosomes, tRNA and amino acids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":119},{"uri":"MRNA","surface_form":"mRNA","offset":367},{"uri":"Ribosome","surface_form":"ribosome","offset":407},{"uri":"TRNA","surface_form":"tRNA","offset":418}]}
