{"id":168254,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_gun","text":"A potato gun or Potato cannon is a type of cannon that uses combustion or air pressure to fire a projectile. They are called potato guns because potatoes are a commonly used projectile.\nThere are two main types of potato guns. Combustion guns use a flammable fuel and igniter to move an object. Another type uses compressed air. Potato guns are usually built of PVC or ABS (a type of plastic) piping.\nParts.\nCombustion potato guns have 4 parts. These are the barrel, combustion chamber, a cap, and an igniter.\nOperation.\nA potato cannon can move a 2\" diameter potato projectile over 100 yards at a speed of 40 mph. This makes potato guns dangerous.\nOperation.\nA air powered potato cannon is much stronger than a combustion cannon. A combustion potato gun will launch projectiles at a pressure of about 10-20 psi. Air powered guns often use pressures over 100 psi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cannon","surface_form":"cannon","offset":43},{"uri":"Combustion","surface_form":"combustion","offset":60},{"uri":"Air_pressure","surface_form":"air pressure","offset":74},{"uri":"Projectile","surface_form":"projectile","offset":97},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":145},{"uri":"Flame","surface_form":"flammable","offset":249},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":259},{"uri":"Combustion","surface_form":"igniter","offset":268},{"uri":"PVC","surface_form":"PVC","offset":362},{"uri":"ABS","surface_form":"ABS","offset":369},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":384},{"uri":"Pipe","surface_form":"piping","offset":393},{"uri":"Barrel_(weapons)","surface_form":"barrel","offset":459},{"uri":"Yard","surface_form":"yard","offset":587},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":598},{"uri":"Mph","surface_form":"mph","offset":610},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":784}]}
