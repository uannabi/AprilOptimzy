{"id":168405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka","text":"e=\"preserve\">The haka (; plural \"haka\", in both M\u0101ori and English) is a ritual dance of the Maori, the native people of New Zealand. Sometimes, a haka is performed to excite friends and to scare enemies. In peace time, a haka is performed as a challenge.\nThere are many different haka. Each tells a story. The most famous haka is \"Ka Mate\". The Ka Mate haka is performed by many New Zealand sports teams before games. Another famous haka is 'Kapo O Pango' which is performed by New Zealand's rugby union team. This team is called the All Blacks.\nWomen are not usually allowed to perform haka. Instead, they sing and chant in support.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_language","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":48},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":58},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":72},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":79},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"Maori","offset":92},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":120},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemies","offset":195},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"story","offset":299},{"uri":"Rugby_union","surface_form":"rugby union","offset":492},{"uri":"All_Blacks","surface_form":"All Blacks","offset":534},{"uri":"Sing","surface_form":"sing","offset":607},{"uri":"Chant","surface_form":"chant","offset":616}]}
