{"id":168574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau_word","text":"e=\"preserve\">A portmanteau word () is made of other words, or parts of words. It comes from putting two (or more) other words together, like \"motel\", from \"motor\" and \"hotel\".\nOrigin.\n\"Portmanteau\" originally meant a type of suitcase with two separate parts for storage.\nThe first use as a word combination appeared in Lewis Carroll's book \"Through the Looking-Glass\". There Humpty Dumpty explains that some of the unusual words in \"Jabberwocky\" are other words packed together into one word, as two parts of a portmanteau suitcase are packed together.\nExamples.\n\"Portmanteau\" itself is an example, combining the French words for carry (porter) and coat (manteau) into a coat carrier. \"Wikipedia\" is a portmanteau of wiki (Hawaiian for fast) and encyclopedia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suitcase","surface_form":"suitcase","offset":225},{"uri":"Lewis_Carroll","surface_form":"Lewis Carroll","offset":319},{"uri":"Through_the_Looking-Glass","surface_form":"Through the Looking-Glass","offset":341},{"uri":"Humpty_Dumpty","surface_form":"Humpty Dumpty","offset":375},{"uri":"Jabberwocky","surface_form":"Jabberwocky","offset":433},{"uri":"Hawaiian_language","surface_form":"Hawaiian","offset":723},{"uri":"Encyclopedia","surface_form":"encyclopedia","offset":746}]}
