{"id":168643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_experiment","text":"ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is the biggest experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nIt is one of the seven particle detector experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, TOTEM, LHCb, and LHCf) built at the LHC. LHC is a new particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. ATLAS is 46\u00A0metres long and 25\u00A0metres in diameter, weighing about 7,000\u00A0tonnes. The project is led by Fabiola Gianotti. The project has 2,000 scientists and engineers at 165 institutions in 35 countries. The project began operation on 10 September 2008. ATLAS studies highly massive particles which could not be studied using earlier lower-energy accelerators. ATLAS may start new theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Large_Hadron_Collider","surface_form":"Large Hadron Collider","offset":66},{"uri":"Particle_detector","surface_form":"particle detector","offset":118},{"uri":"A_Large_Ion_Collider_Experiment","surface_form":"ALICE","offset":149},{"uri":"Compact_Muon_Solenoid","surface_form":"CMS","offset":163},{"uri":"TOTEM","surface_form":"TOTEM","offset":168},{"uri":"LHCb","surface_form":"LHCb","offset":175},{"uri":"LHCf","surface_form":"LHCf","offset":185},{"uri":"Built","surface_form":"built","offset":191},{"uri":"Particle_accelerator","surface_form":"particle accelerator","offset":222},{"uri":"CERN","surface_form":"CERN","offset":294},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":303},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":328},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":357},{"uri":"Tonne","surface_form":"tonne","offset":388},{"uri":"Fabiola_Gianotti","surface_form":"Fabiola Gianotti","offset":418},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":458},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":473},{"uri":"Elementary_particle","surface_form":"particles","offset":599},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":656},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theories","offset":697},{"uri":"Particle_physics","surface_form":"particle physics","offset":709},{"uri":"Standard_Model","surface_form":"Standard Model","offset":737}]}
