{"id":168663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trapping","text":"Animal trapping, or simply trapping, is the use of a device to catch an animal. Animals may be trapped for a variety of purposes, including food, wildlife management, hunting and pest control.\nThere are many kinds. For a deadfall trap, a trapper digs a deep hole in the ground and hides it so the animal falls in the hole and can not get out. A snare is a noose that tightens around the neck or other part of the animal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":53},{"uri":"Catch","surface_form":"catch","offset":63},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":72},{"uri":"Wildlife_management","surface_form":"wildlife management","offset":146},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":167},{"uri":"Pest_control","surface_form":"pest control","offset":179},{"uri":"Hole","surface_form":"hole","offset":258}]}
