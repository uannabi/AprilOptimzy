{"id":168668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material","text":"=\"preserve\">Building material is any material which is used for a construction purpose. Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, sand, wood and rocks, even twigs and leaves have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic.\nBricks are man-made, and so is plaster, concrete, stucco and many other materials. However, they are usually still made out of natural materials, bricks being a good example. They are based on clay. Steel is based on natural types of iron.\nOne example of a man-made imitation is scagliola, which can imitate more expensive natural materials such as marble.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Raw_material","surface_form":"material","offset":37},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":66},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":133},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":139},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":145},{"uri":"Twig","surface_form":"twig","offset":166},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":176},{"uri":"Synthetic","surface_form":"synthetic","offset":323},{"uri":"Brick","surface_form":"Brick","offset":334},{"uri":"Plaster","surface_form":"plaster","offset":365},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":374},{"uri":"Stucco","surface_form":"stucco","offset":384},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":527},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"Steel","offset":533},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":568},{"uri":"Scagliola","surface_form":"scagliola","offset":613},{"uri":"Marble","surface_form":"marble","offset":683}]}
