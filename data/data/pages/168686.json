{"id":168686,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travertine","text":"Travertine is a terrestrial sedimentary rock. It is a natural chemical precipitate of carbonate minerals; aragonite or calcite. This happens from solution in ground and surface waters, and/or geothermally heated hot-springs. Similar (but extremely porous) deposits formed from ambient-temperature water are known as tufa.\nThe Colosseum built by the Romans, was made of travertine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":16},{"uri":"Sedimentary_rock","surface_form":"sedimentary rock","offset":28},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitate","offset":71},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":86},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":96},{"uri":"Aragonite","surface_form":"aragonite","offset":106},{"uri":"Calcite","surface_form":"calcite","offset":119},{"uri":"Hot_spring","surface_form":"geothermally heated hot-springs","offset":192},{"uri":"Porous","surface_form":"porous","offset":248},{"uri":"Tufa","surface_form":"tufa","offset":316},{"uri":"Colosseum","surface_form":"Colosseum","offset":326},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":349}]}
