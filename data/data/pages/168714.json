Before working at Citadel, he spent 16 years as CEO of Infinity Radio, owned by Viacom.\nIn late 2004, Suleman was in the news for cutting Howard Stern's radio show from four Citadel stations because of Stern's frequent discussions about Stern's move to Sirius Satellite Radio.\nIn 2007, he was put forward to get the Group Executive of the Year award by Radio & Records magazine. Other people who were close to getting the award included John Hogan of Clear Channel, Peter Smyth of Greater Media, David Field of Entercom, Lew Dickey of Cumulus, and Don Benson of Lincoln Financial.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Writer"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chief_executive_officer","surface_form":"CEO","offset":111},{"uri":"Citadel_Broadcasting","surface_form":"Citadel Broadcasting","offset":118},{"uri":"CBS_Radio","surface_form":"Infinity Radio","offset":206},{"uri":"Viacom","surface_form":"Viacom","offset":231},{"uri":"Howard_Stern","surface_form":"Howard Stern","offset":289},{"uri":"Sirius_Satellite_Radio","surface_form":"Sirius Satellite Radio","offset":404},{"uri":"Radio_%26amp%3B_Records","surface_form":"Radio & Records","offset":504},{"uri":"John_Hogan_(executive)","surface_form":"John Hogan","offset":588},{"uri":"Clear_Channel","surface_form":"Clear Channel","offset":602},{"uri":"Peter_Smyth","surface_form":"Peter Smyth","offset":617},{"uri":"Greater_Media","surface_form":"Greater Media","offset":632},{"uri":"David_Field","surface_form":"David Field","offset":647},{"uri":"Entercom","surface_form":"Entercom","offset":662},{"uri":"Lew_Dickey","surface_form":"Lew Dickey","offset":672},{"uri":"Cumulus","surface_form":"Cumulus","offset":686},{"uri":"Don_Benson","surface_form":"Don Benson","offset":699},{"uri":"Lincoln_Financial","surface_form":"Lincoln Financial","offset":713}]}
