He uses a type of theory called critical theory, where he studies how people use power. He also uses the theory of American pragmatism, which studies if something is true or not by the effects of actions. He is known for his work on the theory of the public sphere.

Because Horkheimer had asked Habermas to make some changes to his dissertation. Habermas did not want to do this, and thought that the Frankfurt School was not correct in its views of modern culture. Habermas left the Frankfurt School (a school of thought rather than one made of bricks and mortar).\nHe finished his \"habilitation\", or highest academic degree, in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth.

Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl L\u00F6with got him this job. In 1964 Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's job in philosophy and sociology.\nHe was in charge of the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his main work, \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt as head of the Institute for Social Research. After retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas wrote many books and articles. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the, which is the highest honour awarded in German research.
