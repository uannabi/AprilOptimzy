{"id":168901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption","text":"Corruption is a system that starts out good but somehow goes wrong. The word comes from a Latin word meaning \"Rotting\". Corruption could be a government doing what they say is good, but instead oppress people, or an official doing something wrong. It can also mean a computer file or computer program which malfunctions or becomes infected with a computer virus.\nSometimes the term just means bribery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":16},{"uri":"Good","surface_form":"good","offset":39},{"uri":"Rotting","surface_form":"Rotting","offset":110},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":142},{"uri":"Oppression","surface_form":"oppress","offset":194},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":216},{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"computer file","offset":267},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":284},{"uri":"Computer_virus","surface_form":"computer virus","offset":347},{"uri":"Bribery","surface_form":"bribery","offset":393}]}
