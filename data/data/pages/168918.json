It is about thinking how the mind works, and how it relates to the world. It also deals with consciousness, which is also researched in psychology and physics.\nMind-body problem.\nThe mind-body problem is the main problem that is talked about in philosophy of mind. It is the problem of how our minds and our bodies are related, and what exactly the mind is. Many different answers have been come up with to solve the mind-body problem. Most of them fall into the two groups of dualism and monism.\nDualism.\nDualism is the belief that minds and bodies are separate things. One of the main dualist views comes from Ren\u00E9 Descartes and is named Cartesian dualism after him. It is also called substance dualism because he thought that minds and bodies were two completely different substances (like matter) in the world.\nMonism.\nMonism is the opposite of dualism because it is the belief that minds and bodies are not separate things. Many monist views are called materialism because they think that minds are not anything different from matter just like bodies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":34},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":65},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":164},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":207},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":222},{"uri":"Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)","surface_form":"dualism","offset":548},{"uri":"Monism","surface_form":"monism","offset":560},{"uri":"Dualism","surface_form":"Dualism","offset":577},{"uri":"Ren%C3%A9_Descartes","surface_form":"Ren\u00E9 Descartes","offset":683},{"uri":"Cartesian_dualism","surface_form":"Cartesian dualism","offset":711},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":864},{"uri":"Monism","surface_form":"Monism","offset":894},{"uri":"Materialism","surface_form":"materialism","offset":1029}]}
