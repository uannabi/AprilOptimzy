{"id":168995,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_journalism","text":"Video game journalism is a branch of journalism that covers the reporting and discussion of video games. Usually, it covers the revealing of new games, the preview of new games, and the reviewing of new games. Recently, there has been a large growth in new online gaming websites and blogs.\nHistory of print based gaming magazines.\nThe first video gaming magazine that is still in publication is the industry-oriented (made for people who make video games) Play Meter magazine. The first consumer (made for players of video games, not the people who make them) magazine specializing in video gaming was the U.K. magazine Computer and Video Gaming. It began in November, 1981. Two weeks later the first U.S. magazine, Electronic Games Magazine, was started. The oldest consumer gaming magazine still sold today is Computer Gaming World.\nHistory of web based gaming magazines.\nThe first regularly published web based magazine was either Game Zero Magazine (went online in November 1994) or Intelligent Gamer Online (individual issues were downloadable in 1993 but the site was not online until April 1995). Right now, online gaming magazines and websites have many advantages over print-based magazines. New information on future releases can be placed on online publications immediately, but the publishers have to wait until the next issue to put new information in print based magazines.\nEthics.\nThere have been many criticisms of the ethical standards of the video game journalism industry.\nGameDaily's Chris Buffa Wrote a series of articles in July and August 2006.\nNew Games Journalism.\nNew Games Journalism is a term that was first used in 2004 by journalist Kieron Gillen. In New Games Journalism, personal experiences with a game, other personal experiences, and references to other types of media are used to explore the design, play, and culture of a game. This type of journalism focuses more on the subjective experience of an individual playing a game rather that an objectively reviewing the gameplay of a game. New games journalism has been criticized for wasting the reader's time with useless information, and for giving the reader a bad review of the mechanics, play control, and A.I. of a game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_games","surface_form":"video games","offset":92},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":400},{"uri":"Play_Meter_magazine","surface_form":"Play Meter magazine","offset":457},{"uri":"Consumer","surface_form":"consumer","offset":488},{"uri":"Computer_and_Video_Gaming","surface_form":"Computer and Video Gaming","offset":621},{"uri":"Electronic_Games_Magazine","surface_form":"Electronic Games Magazine","offset":717},{"uri":"Computer_Gaming_World","surface_form":"Computer Gaming World","offset":813},{"uri":"Kieron_Gillen","surface_form":"Kieron Gillen","offset":1664}]}
