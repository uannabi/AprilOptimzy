{"id":169013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kleptocracy ('klepto' meaning 'theft' in Ancient Greek) is the ruling of possibly any kind of government that uses its power to steal from its people. This rarely-applied word was used by Charles Krauthammer, the nationally syndicated Washington Post columnist and political commentator on Fox-TV, on Saturday, March 2, and Sunday, March 3, 2014. He referred to Russia as a \"kleptocracy\" in a TV panel discussion about its influence in the revolution in the neighboring Ukraine in late February. His political column added another derivation of this word: \"kleptocratic\".\n\"Kleptocratic\" is used by Krauthammer in the following quote: \"But surely the West has more financial clout than Russia's kleptocratic extraction economy that exports little but oil, gas and wisky.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theft","surface_form":"theft","offset":44},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":54},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":107}]}
