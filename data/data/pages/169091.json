{"id":169091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number","text":"=\"preserve\">A mach number is a number that describes speed. It is a measure of the speed of an object compared to the speed of sound. Mach number is given as a percentage compared to the local speed of sound. For example, half the speed of sound = Mach 0.5.\nformula_1\nWhere v is the speed of the object, and a is the speed of sound.\nIt is named after the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach. When writing a speed as a Mach number, the number comes after \"Mach.\" For example, the Concorde airplane could fly at Mach 2, and a satellite re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at about Mach 25.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":31},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":53},{"uri":"Speed_of_sound","surface_form":"speed of sound","offset":118},{"uri":"Percentage","surface_form":"percentage","offset":160},{"uri":"Speed_of_sound","surface_form":"speed of sound","offset":317},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":355},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":364},{"uri":"Concorde","surface_form":"Concorde","offset":473}]}
