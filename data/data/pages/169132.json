It is played by riding on iced tracks with a sled. Modern tracks are made of concrete, coated with ice. Artificial bobsleigh tracks are also available.\nInternational bobsled competitions are governed by the F\u00E9d\u00E9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT).\nThe first bobsleds were built in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in the late 19th century by rich tourists from Britain who were staying at the Palace Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":44},{"uri":"Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympic Games","offset":68},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":116},{"uri":"Sled","surface_form":"sled","offset":135},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":167},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":189}]}
