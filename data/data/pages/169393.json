{"id":169393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Green Revolution was a spread of technology by Norman Borlaug, who earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 and is held to have saved over a billion people from starving to death, from the 1930s to the 1960s. It was made up of the creation of different types of cereal grains that grew more food than average, more use of modern systems for watering crops, making management more modern, and the spread of hybridized seeds, man-made fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.\nBackground.\nIn the 20th century, big spending in modern and scientific research for agriculture led to the growth of more food in industrial countries. The Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation helped to change these scientific technologies to fit the conditions in developing countries. The first research was on rice and wheat, two of the most important food crops for developing countries. Irrigation and the growth of better plant types, in addition to more use of fertilizers and pesticides, led to more food growth in Asia and Latin America, starting in the late 1960s. The term \u201CGreen Revolution\u201D was used to mean the large growth in agriculture <nowiki/>that happened at this time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norman_Borlaug","surface_form":"Norman Borlaug","offset":64},{"uri":"List_of_Nobel_Peace_Prize_winners","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":95},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":116},{"uri":"Starvation","surface_form":"starving to death","offset":174},{"uri":"1930s","surface_form":"1930s","offset":202},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":215},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"watering crops","offset":354},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizers","offset":446},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticides","offset":463},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmers","offset":477},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":570},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":805},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":814},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"Irrigation","offset":884},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":960},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":976},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":1060},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1132}]}
