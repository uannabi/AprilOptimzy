{"id":16947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating","text":"Figure skating is both an art and a sport, in which people skate around on ice, doing jumps and spins. It is done at the Winter Olympics, and it has its own world championships. The name means to make figures or patterns on the ice. People skate with music.\nIn figure skating, sometimes women or men skate alone, or they skate in couples. Couples dancing includes \"pairs\" and ice dancing. Pairs skating has jumps, and sometimes the man lifts the woman in the air. These things are not done in ice dancing. In ice dancing, the woman must be held in the man's arms. Another kind of figure skating is synchronized skating done in groups.\nHistory.\nThe first ever figure skating club was started in 1742 in Edinburgh, Scotland. World Championships began in 1896 (the first in St. Petersburg, Russia). Before the Winter Olympic Games were started, competitions in figure skating were part of the Summer Olympic Games, in 1908 and 1920.\nRules.\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) made the rules.\nSingles Skating.\nSingles skating is composed of a Short Program and a Free Skate. Both of them have a technical score and a presentation score.\nJudges.\nUnder the ISU Judging System the Judges focus entirely on evaluating the quality of each element performed (technical aspect) and the quality of the performance. There will be a panel of 9 Judges per segment. Out of these 9 scores, the highest and lowest score of each element or program component are ignored and the average will be taken.\nTechnical Score.\nThe score for the element is composed of a \u201CBase Value\u201D of each element and the \u201CGrade of Execution - GOE\u201D. GOE is that the Judge grades the quality of the element on a scale of +5 to -5. The total of all the elements scores gives the Technical Score.\nPresentation Score.\nThe Judges award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10.00 with increments of 0.25 for the Presentation Score to grade the overall presentation of the performance. There are five items in the Presentation Score.\nJumps.\nThere are six types of jump that ISU decides to score. The following items are listed in order of the score (difficulty). There are two types of jumps: edge jump and toe jump. The Axel, loop, and Salchow are edge jumps and the lutz, flip and toe loop are toe jumps.\nSpins.\nSpins are classified as Sit spins, Upright spins or Camel spin. Each of them has various variations. Any position which is not basic is a non-basic position.\nThe position of this spin is that the upper part of the skating leg is at least parallel to the ice.\nThe position of this spin is any position with the skating leg is extended or slightly bent which is not a camel position.\nThe position of this spin is any position where the free leg backwards and the knee is higher than the hip level, however Layback, Biellmann and similar variations are still considered upright spins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":26},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":36},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":75},{"uri":"Jumping","surface_form":"jumps","offset":86},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympics","offset":121},{"uri":"Ice_dancing","surface_form":"ice dancing","offset":376},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":702},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":713},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":771},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":787},{"uri":"Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympic Games","offset":807},{"uri":"Summer_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Summer Olympic Games","offset":890},{"uri":"1908_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1908","offset":915},{"uri":"1920_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1920","offset":924},{"uri":"ISU","surface_form":"ISU","offset":2020}]}
