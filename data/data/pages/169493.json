{"id":169493,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow","text":"The crossbow, or arbalest, is a bow which consists of a bow-like arc called \"prod\" and cross-wise body called \"stock\" and trigger mechanism. The crossbow is an invention in which the stock, a piece of wood is mounted on two other crossing pieces. Crossbows shoot short arrows called \"bolts\" which are similar to arrows. The crossbow was first created by the Chinese people in circa 6 B.C. The Greeks invented crossbow separately in 4th century B.C. The Romans called the weapon \"arcuballista\". Crossbow was a very popular weapon in the Middle Ages as it was strong and accurate and could be used as a sharpshooter weapon. The Arabs call crossbow \"qaws Ferengi\", \"Frankish bow\", as the Crusaders used crossbow a lot. A good crossbow can shoot the bolt with such immense power that it may pierce armour. Against unarmoured light opponents, even a single bolt may be lethal.\nCompared to the ordinary bow, the crossbows have good and bad sides to them. They fire much stronger and much more accurately than ordinary bows, and shooting accurately with a crossbow is easier to learn than shooting with an ordinary bow. On the other hand, because the prod is short and therefore very stiff, a crossbow will take much longer time to load, and a crossbow does not have as good accurate range than a longbow. Many crossbows have crank or windlass mechanisms to pull the string in drawn position. Also many crossbows do have safety mechanisms to prevent an accidental shot.\nCrossbow shooting is today a popular sport.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bow_(weapon)","surface_form":"bow","offset":32},{"uri":"Trigger","surface_form":"trigger","offset":122},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":536},{"uri":"Sharpshooter","surface_form":"sharpshooter","offset":601},{"uri":"Frankish","surface_form":"Frankish","offset":663},{"uri":"Crusaders","surface_form":"Crusaders","offset":685},{"uri":"Longbow","surface_form":"longbow","offset":1290},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":1500}]}
