She was a teacher in physical education. \u201CI wasn\u2019t all that young,\u201D as she told later. \u201CI did go to university and I did teach school for a year. I had my feet planted fairly firmly on the ground when it all began.\u201D But also sang and made records. One of her records, \"Snowbird\", became a hit late in 1970. The song was not about Christmas, but was popular during the Christmas season. The record became a perennial through association with the holiday.\nMurray later had hits with remakes of Beatles (\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\") and Monkees songs (\"Daydream Believer\"). She also recorded \"Shadows in the Moonlight\" and \"A Little Good News\", which became popular.\nShe publicly retired from a singer in the music industry in 2008 when she had the last concert tour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist&lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"June_20","surface_form":"June 20","offset":25},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":34},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":45},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"Pop","offset":54},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"Country","offset":62},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":70},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":96},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":119},{"uri":"Vinyl_record","surface_form":"records","offset":348},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":410},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":439},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":487},{"uri":"Perennial","surface_form":"perennial","offset":515},{"uri":"Association","surface_form":"association","offset":533},{"uri":"Beatles","surface_form":"Beatles","offset":601},{"uri":"Monkees","surface_form":"Monkees","offset":650}]}
