{"id":16972,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS","text":"MS-DOS is a computer operating system by Microsoft Corporation. It stands for \"Microsoft Disk Operating System\", and came from an operating system Microsoft bought called 86-DOS, originally called QDOS, or \"Quick and Dirty Operating System.\" The operating system used a command-line interface for the user to input commands. It was popularly used in PCs before a GUI operating system called Microsoft Windows came out, and still is used in some places today.\n2 was made to replace MS-DOS, but that replacement did not succeed. MS-DOS was the framework behind Windows operating systems until an operating system known as Windows XP.\nMS-DOS is a text-based operating system, meaning that a user works with a keyboard to input data and receives output in plain text. Later, MS-DOS often had programs using a mouse and graphics to make work more simple and quick. (Some people still believe that working without graphics is really more efficient.) It is called a disk operating system because it was originally made to be loaded into a computer's memory with a floppy disk each time the computer is started (booted) up.\nMS-DOS was released as proprietary software, but decades later after most users had gone to other systems, it was released as free software.\nHow-To Books.\nMany books were written on how to use MS-DOS. A popular introductory book was \"MS-DOS for Dummies\", by Dan Gookin, the book in the \"For Dummies\" series of easy to follow instruction books.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":21},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":41},{"uri":"Command-line_interface","surface_form":"command-line interface","offset":270},{"uri":"PC","surface_form":"PC","offset":350},{"uri":"GUI","surface_form":"GUI","offset":363},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":391},{"uri":"2","surface_form":"2","offset":459},{"uri":"Windows_XP","surface_form":"Windows XP","offset":620},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"programs","offset":788},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":805},{"uri":"Disk_operating_system","surface_form":"disk operating system","offset":959},{"uri":"Floppy_disk","surface_form":"floppy disk","offset":1057},{"uri":"Booting","surface_form":"booted","offset":1104},{"uri":"MS-DOS_for_Dummies","surface_form":"MS-DOS for Dummies","offset":1350},{"uri":"For_Dummies","surface_form":"For Dummies","offset":1403}]}
