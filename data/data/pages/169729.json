{"id":169729,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeles_Avenue","text":"Steeles Avenue is an east-west street that forms the northern city border of Toronto and the southern border of York Region, Ontario, Canada. It is 38.75\u00A0km within Toronto, between Albion Road and the Scarborough-Pickering border.\nWest of Albion Road, Steeles continues into Peel Region, where it is also known as Peel Regional Road 15. It runs through Brampton and into the Halton Region town of Milton. It stops at Appleby Line on top of the Niagara Escarpment due to the Crawford Lake Conservation Area being there, and then the road starts again just east of Guelph Line and goes until the Milborough Townline on the border of Milton and Hamilton. East of the Toronto-Pickering border, it becomes Taunton Road.\nName.\nSteeles is named after J. C. Steele, who owned a tavern on the street where it joins with Yonge Street.\nOntario's Worst Road.\nSteeles Avenue was listed as the worst road by the CAA in October 2006, and as the fifth worst road in October 2007. In October 2008, it was re-listed as worst road in Ontario. Reasons are potholes and the quality of the road. Soon after the CAA's listing, some parts of the road between Dufferin Street and Bayview Avenue were resurfaced.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":67},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":77},{"uri":"York_Region","surface_form":"York Region","offset":112},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":125},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":134},{"uri":"Albion_Road_(Toronto)","surface_form":"Albion Road","offset":181},{"uri":"Regional_Municipality_of_Peel","surface_form":"Peel Region","offset":275},{"uri":"Brampton%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Brampton","offset":353},{"uri":"Halton_Region","surface_form":"Halton Region","offset":375},{"uri":"Milton%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Milton","offset":397},{"uri":"Niagara_Escarpment","surface_form":"Niagara Escarpment","offset":444},{"uri":"Crawford_Lake_Conservation_Area","surface_form":"Crawford Lake Conservation Area","offset":474},{"uri":"Hamilton%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Hamilton","offset":642},{"uri":"Pickering%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Pickering","offset":672},{"uri":"Yonge_Street","surface_form":"Yonge Street","offset":811},{"uri":"Canadian_Automobile_Association","surface_form":"CAA","offset":898},{"uri":"Dufferin_Street","surface_form":"Dufferin Street","offset":1135},{"uri":"Bayview_Avenue","surface_form":"Bayview Avenue","offset":1155}]}
