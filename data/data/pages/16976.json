{"id":16976,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider","text":"An Internet service provider, or ISP, maintains, installs and provides internet connection to residential or commercial areas. Some examples of ISP clients include - homes, coffee shops, hotels, libraries, offices. They usually charge a fee for installing the connection and a monthly fee for maintaining it.\nThe internet is basically a web of interconnected networks - which are maintained by a huge number of different ISPs. They keep connected around the world by giving their clients access to other ISP networks. This is called peering.\nMany ISPs have other services such as e-mail and web hosting service.\nISPs offer different types of connections such as dial-up, DSL, through optical fiber wires, through a cable television connection, or wireless. Communications satellite connections are used mainly in remote areas. Dial-up is the slowest connection, while a direct fiber-optic connection is usually the fastest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":313},{"uri":"Client","surface_form":"client","offset":480},{"uri":"Peering","surface_form":"peering","offset":533},{"uri":"Electronic_mail","surface_form":"e-mail","offset":580},{"uri":"Web_hosting_service","surface_form":"web hosting service","offset":591},{"uri":"Dial-up","surface_form":"dial-up","offset":662},{"uri":"DSL","surface_form":"DSL","offset":671},{"uri":"Optical_fiber","surface_form":"optical fiber","offset":684},{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable television","offset":715},{"uri":"Wireless","surface_form":"wireless","offset":747},{"uri":"Communications_satellite","surface_form":"Communications satellite","offset":757}]}
