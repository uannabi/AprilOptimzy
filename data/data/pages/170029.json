It was found in March 2000 by Ignacio Ferrin and announced on October 24, 2000. It was given the name Huya, after \"Juy\u00E1,\" the Wayuu rain god, in August 2003 by the International Astronomical Union.\nSize.\nAt the time when it was found, Huya was the biggest and brightest TNO yet found. It was found using data collected by at the CIDA Observatory in Venezuela. Astronomers think it's about 530\u00A0km in diameter.\nSurface.\nThe object has a red-sloped reflectance spectrum, saying that the surface could be rich in organic material such as tholins.\nOrbit.\nGiven the long orbit that TNOs have around the sun, Huya comes to opposition in early May of each year at an apparent magnitude of 19.3.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provisional_designation","surface_form":"provisional designation","offset":36},{"uri":"Trans-Neptunian_object","surface_form":"trans-Neptunian object","offset":66},{"uri":"Ignacio_Ferrin","surface_form":"Ignacio Ferrin","offset":126},{"uri":"Huya","surface_form":"Huya","offset":198},{"uri":"Wayuu","surface_form":"Wayuu","offset":222},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":260},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":445},{"uri":"Spectrum","surface_form":"reflectance spectrum","offset":542},{"uri":"Tholin","surface_form":"tholin","offset":630},{"uri":"Trans-Neptunian_object","surface_form":"TNOs","offset":672},{"uri":"Opposition_(astronomy)","surface_form":"opposition","offset":712},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":755}]}
