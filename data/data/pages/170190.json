It can also mean the same thing as \"an eye for an eye\".\nLawyers sometimes use this saying to mean \"an even trade\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Latin_phrases_(Q)","surface_form":"Latin phrase","offset":32},{"uri":"Context","surface_form":"context","offset":121},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":222},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"Lawyer","offset":353}]}
