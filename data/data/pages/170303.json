{"id":170303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament","text":"e=\"preserve\">A tournament is a competition with large number of players, all taking part in a sport or game. The word and general meaning come from the medieval tournament or \"tourney\". The word is still used sometimes used for a military event such as the Royal Tournament.\nThese two types of tournament are different. All golf tournaments meet are of the first type, but match play tournaments are in the second. Football (soccer) leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many places over a period of up to a year. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the Wimbledon tennis championship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competition","offset":31},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":94},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":103},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":152},{"uri":"Royal_Tournament","surface_form":"Royal Tournament","offset":257},{"uri":"Golf_tournament","surface_form":"golf tournament","offset":324},{"uri":"Match_play","surface_form":"match play","offset":373},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"Football (soccer)","offset":415},{"uri":"English_Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":450},{"uri":"The_Championships%2C_Wimbledon","surface_form":"Wimbledon tennis championship","offset":650}]}
