{"id":170636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher","text":"There are also different sizes of fire extinguishers. Bigger fire extinguishers can be used for a longer time. Hand-held fire extinguishers vary between 0.5 and 14\u00A0kg. A 2\u00A0kg extinguisher works for about two to four seconds, the 12\u00A0kg model for about eighteen seconds. There are also bigger fire extinguishers, mounted on a cart or a vehicle. These are used to fight fires at airports, for example.\nTo be useful, fire extinguishers need to be checked at regular intervals. Usually, there are laws about this duration, concerning fire extinguishers in public buildings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":376}]}
