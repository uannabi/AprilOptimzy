{"id":170637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minke_whale","text":"The minke whale (also known as the lesser rorqual) is the smallest of the baleen whales that lives in many places in the world. It is the smallest rorqual whale (the large baleen whales). A large one is about 30 feet long and weighs 10 tons. They are black or gray with white on their belly and a white \"armband\" across their flippers. It is the only baleen whale that is still hunted for money. The Minke whale can swim quite fast.\nDescription.\nThe minke whales are the second smallest baleen whale. Only the pygmy right whale is smaller. Males measure an average of and females in length. Both sexes typically weigh 4 - 5 t (3.9\u20134.9 long tons; 4.4\u20135.5 short tons) as adults. The maximum weight may be as much as 14 t (14 long tons; 15 short tons). They become adults after 6 to 8 years.\nThe minke whale is a black/gray/purple color. Common minke whales (Northern Hemisphere variety) have a white band on each flipper. The body is usually black or dark-gray above and white underneath. Most of the back, including dorsal fin and blowholes, appears at once when the whale comes to the surface to breathe.\nMinke whales usually live for 30\u201350 years. In some cases they may live for up to 60 years.\nThe gestation time for minke whales is 10 months. Calves measure at birth. The newborns nurse for five to possibly 10 months. Breeding is mostly done during the summer months. Calving is thought to happen every two years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baleen_whale","surface_form":"baleen whale","offset":74},{"uri":"Rorqual","surface_form":"rorqual","offset":147},{"uri":"Pygmy_right_whale","surface_form":"pygmy right whale","offset":510},{"uri":"Dorsal_fin","surface_form":"dorsal fin","offset":1015},{"uri":"Gestation","surface_form":"gestation","offset":1200},{"uri":"Lactation","surface_form":"nurse","offset":1284}]}
