{"id":170643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering","text":"=\"preserve\">Gerrymandering is when a political group tries to change a voting district to create a result that helps them or hurts the group who is against them. It is named after Elbridge Gerry (1744-1814) of the Democratic-Republican Party, which later coalesced into the modern Democratic Party. Gerrymandering works by wasting votes. It puts more votes of winners into the district they will win so the losers win in another district.\nExample.\nIf we have Group A and Group B both trying to win in a district. Group A has 40 votes and Group B has 50. In another district Group A knows Group B will win for sure. Group A changes the voting district so that 11 votes are moved to the other district. Now they will win 40 votes to 39.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Voting","surface_form":"voting","offset":71},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":78},{"uri":"Elbridge_Gerry","surface_form":"Elbridge Gerry","offset":180},{"uri":"Democratic-Republican_Party","surface_form":"Democratic-Republican Party","offset":214},{"uri":"Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":281}]}
