{"id":170646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage","text":"=\"preserve\">Suffrage is the right to vote. Most countries allow citizens to vote once they are legally an adult. In the past not all people were allowed to vote. In general, most countries today do not stop people of a different race or sex from voting.\nSuffrage can also apply to states themselves. Article V. of the U. S. Constitution does not allow any amendment to take away the States' equal suffrage in the Senate.\nSuffrage can also mean the right to be a public official. Some people call the right to run for office candidate eligibility. Full suffrage means both the right to vote and the right to seek office.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Voting","surface_form":"vote","offset":37},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":64},{"uri":"Amendment","surface_form":"amendment","offset":356},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"State","offset":383},{"uri":"Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":413},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":469}]}
