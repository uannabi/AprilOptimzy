The user has 30 days to activate Windows and after 30 days, the computer will not run properly until it is activated.\nActivation Process.\nWhen Windows is first installed, there will be a little icon on the screen with a message asking for Windows to be activated.\nThen an activation wizard will appear and the user has 2 options on activating Windows. Activation could be done on the Internet, or on the telephone. The quickest way to activate is by the Internet, but if that fails, then the user would need to call Microsoft for the activation ID. The activation ID would be read by the representative and then the user would type in the key on the activation Wizard screen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":67},{"uri":"Windows_XP","surface_form":"Windows XP","offset":80},{"uri":"Windows_Server_2003","surface_form":"Windows Server 2003","offset":95}]}
