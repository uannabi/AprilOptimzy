{"id":170721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_%C3%A0_clef","text":"e=\"preserve\">Roman \u00E0 clef (said like it rhymes with \"a don a day\") means \"novel with a key\" in French. It is a phrase used for talking about literature and movies. A roman \u00E0 clef is a type of story that's true for the most part except for details like the name of the main character. The \"key\" part of the meaning\u2013what someone needs to unlock the real story\u2013changes from book to book. For some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person. For others it is knowing that the main character is really the author.\nAuthors usually write these types of stories (instead of telling the whole truth) to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved can't sue them. A couple of movies that are written like this are Citizen Kane (a movie about a man a lot like William Randolph Hearst) and Dreamgirls (a movie about a Motown group a lot like The Supremes).\nBecause it comes from French, the plural of roman \u00E0 clef is \"romans \u00E0 clef\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":95},{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"phrase","offset":111},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":141},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":156},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversy","offset":634},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":672},{"uri":"Citizen_Kane","surface_form":"Citizen Kane","offset":772},{"uri":"William_Randolph_Hearst","surface_form":"William Randolph Hearst","offset":817},{"uri":"Dreamgirls","surface_form":"Dreamgirls","offset":846},{"uri":"Motown","surface_form":"Motown","offset":874},{"uri":"The_Supremes","surface_form":"The Supremes","offset":898},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":947}]}
