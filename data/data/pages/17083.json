{"id":17083,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore","text":"Albert Arnold \"Al\" Gore, Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is a former American politician. He was the Vice President of the United States under Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001. Before that, he was a Senator for Tennessee and a congressman. He is a Democrat.\nHe was chosen as the Democratic nominee of the 2000 United States Presidential election, but lost the electoral vote to Republican candidate George W. Bush because of Florida and the US Supreme Court ruling a 5-4 favor of Bush. Gore got more votes, though.\nAfter the election, Gore became an activist focusing on climate change. Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\nEarly life.\nAlbert Gore, Jr. was born at Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington, D.C. He is the second of two chidren. His father, Albert A. Gore Sr. was a Senator for Tennessee and congressman. His mother, Pauline LaFon Gore was one of the first women to have graduated from Vanderbilt University Law School. Gore is descended from Scots-Irish immigrants who first settled in Virginia in the mid-17th-century, and moved to Tennessee after the Revolutionary War. At least two of these ancestors, Jacob Waggoner and Lewis Stunston, owned slaves. Gore was brought up in both Washington and Tennessee. His older sister was Nancy LaFon Gore, who was born in 1938, died of lung cancer in 1984.\nPolitical career.\nGore was a Representative from 1977 to 1985 and a Senator from 1985 to 1993. In 1988 he ran for President for first time, but lost to Michael Dukakis in the Democratic primary. In 1993, he became Vice President to Bill Clinton. He ran for President in 2000, but lost to George W. Bush (many people still argue this). Even though he lost the race, Gore won in the popular vote by over 500,000 votes.\nAfter the Vice Presidency.\nGore is now a businessman, and runs and works for several companies, including Generation Investment Management, Google, Apple Computers, and TV channel Current.\nHe is also a fighter for issues involving the environment. He released a movie in 2006 about global warming and climate change called \"An Inconvenient Truth\", which was based on a slide show he had given to millions of people. In 2007, Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize which he shared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nPotential 2016 presidential campaign.\nInterest in having Gore run for the 2016 Presidential election arose in 2014 and again in 2015. Gore did not run in 2016 and has expressed no interest to run in future elections.\nPersonal life.\nHe currently lives in Nashville and was married to Tipper for 40 years. In June 2010, they filed for divorce. The Gores have 4 children and 2 grandchildren.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":72},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President of the United States","offset":95},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":137},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Senator","offset":191},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":203},{"uri":"Congressman","surface_form":"congressman","offset":219},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":240},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":271},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2000","surface_form":"2000 United States Presidential election","offset":297},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":370},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
