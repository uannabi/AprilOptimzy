{"id":170999,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whopper","text":"=\"preserve\">Whopper is a kind of hamburger sold at the fast-food chain Burger King. It is made using a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, sliced onion, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. Also, cheese can be added at the customer's request. There is also a Double Whopper available.\nA \"Whopper Jr.\" is the same as the Whopper, but in a smaller size.\nThe whopper was under controversy when Google Home read out a vandalised description of a whopper from the internet site Wikipedia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hamburger","surface_form":"hamburger","offset":33},{"uri":"Burger_King","surface_form":"Burger King","offset":71},{"uri":"Beef_patty","surface_form":"beef patty","offset":103},{"uri":"Lettuce","surface_form":"lettuce","offset":115},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":124},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":139},{"uri":"Pickles","surface_form":"pickles","offset":146},{"uri":"Ketchup","surface_form":"ketchup","offset":155},{"uri":"Mayonnaise","surface_form":"mayonnaise","offset":168},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":214}]}
