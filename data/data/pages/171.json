{"id":171,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese","text":"Cheese is a type of dairy that comes from milk. There are many types of cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, and provolone.\nMany things affect the form, texture, colour and flavour of a cheese. These include the milk (cow or goat), if the milk has been pasteurized, the amount of butterfat, bacteria and mold in the cheese, how the cheese is made, how much fat is in the cheese, and how old the cheese is. Example for cheese used in a sentence: Todd the dog likes cheese.\nThe origin of cheese.\nPeople have been making cheese since before history was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the Sumerians in about 4000 BC.\nHow cheese is made.\nCheese is made using milk. The milk of cows, goats, and sheep are most popular. Buffalo, camel, donkey and even hippopotamus milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large pots.\nMost cheeses are acidified by bacteria. This bacteria turns milk sugars into lactic acid.\nSalt is added, and a substance from the stomach of young cows called rennet. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add rennet, but curdle the cheese in other ways. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are made by fermentation of a fungus called \"Mucor miehei\". Other alternatives use species of the \"Cynara\" thistle family.\nOther ingredients are added and the cheese is usually aged for a varied length of time.\nClassifications of cheese.\nThere are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese. These are called Cheese analogues.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dairy","surface_form":"dairy","offset":20},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":42},{"uri":"Cheddar_cheese","surface_form":"cheddar","offset":88},{"uri":"Swiss_cheese","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":97},{"uri":"Provolone","surface_form":"provolone","offset":108},{"uri":"Form","surface_form":"form","offset":142},{"uri":"Texture","surface_form":"texture","offset":148},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":157},{"uri":"Flavor","surface_form":"flavour","offset":168},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":213},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":220},{"uri":"Pasteurization","surface_form":"pasteurized","offset":248},{"uri":"Butterfat","surface_form":"butterfat","offset":275},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":286},{"uri":"Mold","surface_form":"mold","offset":299},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":533},{"uri":"Sumerians","surface_form":"Sumerians","offset":644},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":731},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":737},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":748},{"uri":"Buffalo","surface_form":"Buffalo","offset":772},{"uri":"Camel","surface_form":"camel","offset":781},{"uri":"Donkey","surface_form":"donkey","offset":788},{"uri":"Hippopotamus","surface_form":"hippopotamus","offset":804},{"uri":"Pot","surface_form":"pot","offset":885},{"uri":"Acidify","surface_form":"acidified","offset":908},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":956},{"uri":"Lactic_acid","surface_form":"lactic acid","offset":968},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"Salt","offset":981},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":1002},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":1021},{"uri":"Rennet","surface_form":"rennet","offset":1050},{"uri":"Rennet","surface_form":"rennet","offset":1125},{"uri":"Vegetarianism","surface_form":"Vegetarian","offset":1170},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":1216},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungus","offset":1234},{"uri":"Cynara","surface_form":"Cynara","offset":1303},{"uri":"Thistle","surface_form":"thistle","offset":1311},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":1319},{"uri":"Ingredients","surface_form":"ingredients","offset":1333},{"uri":"Cheese_analogue","surface_form":"Cheese analogue","offset":1529}]}
