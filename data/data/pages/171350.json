{"id":171350,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandringham_House","text":"Sandringham House is in Norfolk, England. It has been in the British royal family since Albert, Prince Consort bought it for Edward VII of the United Kingdom.\nLike Balmoral, it is the private property of the monarch of the United Kingdom, not an official, government owned, building. This meant that when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 the new king, George VI, had to buy the properties from his brother.\nYork Cottage is in the grounds of Sandringham Estate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norfolk","surface_form":"Norfolk","offset":24},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":33},{"uri":"British_royal_family","surface_form":"British royal family","offset":61},{"uri":"Albert%2C_Prince_Consort","surface_form":"Albert, Prince Consort","offset":88},{"uri":"Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Edward VII of the United Kingdom","offset":125},{"uri":"Balmoral_Castle","surface_form":"Balmoral","offset":164},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":223},{"uri":"Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Edward VIII","offset":305},{"uri":"George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George VI","offset":349},{"uri":"York_Cottage","surface_form":"York Cottage","offset":404}]}
