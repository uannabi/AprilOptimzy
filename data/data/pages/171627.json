{"id":171627,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)","text":"=\"preserve\">In academic administration, a dean is a person with important authority over a specific academic unit, or over a specific area of concern, or both.\nThe term comes from the Latin \"decanus\", a leader of \"ten,\" taken from the medieval monasteries (particularly those following the Cluniac Reforms) which were often extremely large, with hundreds of monks (the size of a small college campus). The monks were organized into groups of ten for administrative purposes, along the lines of military platoons, headed by a senior monk, the decanus.\nThe term was later used to describe the head of a community of priests, as the chapter of a cathedral, or a section of a diocese (a \"deanery\").\nWhen the universities grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools, the title of dean was used for officials with various administrative duties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Academic_administration","surface_form":"academic administration","offset":15},{"uri":"Academia","surface_form":"academic","offset":100},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":184},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":235},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monasteries","offset":244},{"uri":"Cluniac_Reforms","surface_form":"Cluniac Reforms","offset":290},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":358},{"uri":"Platoon","surface_form":"platoon","offset":503},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":704}]}
