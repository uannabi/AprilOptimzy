{"id":171685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentigny%2C_Quebec","text":"Repentigny is a suburb of Montreal, which is in Quebec, Canada. It was created at about the same year as Quebec City. Before, people who lived there were farmers. Now, there are a lot of people who live there. Most of the people work in Montreal so they have to use Highway 40, which cuts the town in half.\nThe town is on the north side of the St. Lawrence River\nAlthough it is a very pleasant and calm town, there is nothing much to do. All year long, a bunch of festivals are organised, but they are mostly for children. The most popular festival is the Festival Feu Et Glace which happens during the winter.\nSince the early 2000s, the only thing that changed in the town is that they built a lot of new houses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":26},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":48},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":56},{"uri":"Quebec_City","surface_form":"Quebec City","offset":105},{"uri":"Farmers","surface_form":"farmers","offset":154},{"uri":"St._Lawrence_River","surface_form":"St. Lawrence River","offset":344},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":464},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":603}]}
