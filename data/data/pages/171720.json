{"id":171720,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law","text":"Godwin's Law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies) is a saying made by Mike Godwin in 1990. The law states: \"As a discussion on the Internet grows longer, the likelihood of a comparison of a person's being compared to Hitler or another Nazi reference, increases.\". That means that as more people talk on the Internet for a longer time, it becomes more and more likely that someone will talk about Hitler or the Nazis.\nIn 2019, Bret Stephens demonstrated both the Streisand Effect and Godwin\u2019s Law, by publishing a column in the \"New York Times\", where he compared his experience on Twitter to the plight of Jews under Hitler\u2019s regime.\nThe invocation of Godwin's Law is usually done by an individual that is losing the argument.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mike_Godwin","surface_form":"Mike Godwin","offset":81},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":142},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":228},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":246},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":318},{"uri":"New_York_Times","surface_form":"New York Times","offset":539}]}
