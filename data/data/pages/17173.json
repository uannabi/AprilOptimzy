The Dutch moved out Spanish and took over their fortresses than the Dutch started their trading business. In 1661 Koxinga came to Taiwan and expel the Dutch. And he started to reclaim Taiwan, used a system called Tuntian (a state-promoted method of agriculture), it successfully help Taipei to grow more food. Taipei officially became part of the Tianxing county of China.\nIn 1683 Taiwan got marked as part of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore,\u00A0a lot of Chinese moved into Taipei, so there were many villages and streets formed, like the Mengjia, Shilin Street, Xikou Street and Dadaocheng. Dadaocheng is a place that produces tea, it has an important impact on how Taipei became prosperous. It was the biggest external trade port that. Foreign countries started to set their business stores in Taipei.\nDivisions.\nTaipei City is divided into 12 districts. Among the notable one is Tamsui.\nAir quality.\nWhen compared to other Asian cities, Taipei has \"excellent\" capabilities for managing air quality in the city. Its rainy climate, location near the coast, and strong environmental regulations have prevented air pollution from becoming a substantial health issue, at least compared to cities in southeast Asia and industrial China. However, smog is extremely common and there is poor visibility throughout the city after rain-less days.\nMotor vehicle engine exhaust, particularly from motor scooters, is a source of air pollution in Taipei. There are higher levels of fine particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the mornings because of less air movement; sunlight reduces some pollution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":22},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":42},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":92},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":126},{"uri":"Humid_subtropical_climate","surface_form":"humid subtropical climate","offset":143},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":183},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":219},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":272},{"uri":"Greater_China","surface_form":"Greater China","offset":407},{"uri":"Global_city","surface_form":"global city","offset":441},{"uri":"Rail_transport_in_Taiwan","surface_form":"Railways","offset":507},{"uri":"Taipei_Metro","surface_form":"Taipei Metro","offset":517},{"uri":"Taiwan_High_Speed_Rail","surface_form":"high-speed rail","offset":531},{"uri":"Highway_system_in_Taiwan","surface_form":"highways","offset":548},{"uri":"Taipei_Songshan_Airport","surface_form":"Taipei Songshan","offset":664},{"uri":"Taiwan_Taoyuan_International_Airport","surface_form":"Taiwan Taoyuan","offset":684},{"uri":"Taipei_101","surface_form":"Taipei 101","offset":789},{"uri":"Chiang_Kai-shek_Memorial_Hall","surface_form":"Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall","offset":801},{"uri":"Dalongdong_Baoan_Temple","surface_form":"Dalongdong Baoan Temple","offset":832},{"uri":"Taipei_Zoo","surface_form":"Taipei Zoo","offset":857},{"uri":"National_Taiwan_University","surface_form":"National Taiwan University","offset":869},{"uri":"Hsing_Tian_Kong","surface_form":"Hsing Tian Kong","offset":897},{"uri":"Lungshan_Temple_of_Manka","surface_form":"Lungshan Temple of Manka","offset":914},{"uri":"National_Palace_Museum","surface_form":"National Palace Museum","offset":940},{"uri":"Presidential_Office_Building%2C_Taipei","surface_form":"Presidential Office Building","offset":964},{"uri":"Taipei_Guest_House","surface_form":"Taipei Guest House","offset":994},{"uri":"Ximending","surface_form":"Ximending","offset":1014},{"uri":"Night_markets_in_Taiwan","surface_form":"night markets","offset":1037},{"uri":"Maokong","surface_form":"Maokong","offset":1106},{"uri":"Yangmingshan","surface_form":"Yangmingshan","offset":1115},{"uri":"Taiwanese_hot_springs","surface_form":"hot springs","offset":1133},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":1263},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":1277},{"uri":"Koxinga","surface_form":"Koxinga","offset":1387},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":1403},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":1424},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":1457},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1639},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":1654},{"uri":"Qing_dynasty","surface_form":"Qing Dynasty","offset":1687},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asian","offset":2192},{"uri":"Air_quality","surface_form":"air quality","offset":2255},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":2684},{"uri":"Particulate","surface_form":"particulate","offset":2741},{"uri":"Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","surface_form":"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","offset":2764}]}
