{"id":171839,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary","text":"e=\"preserve\">A convergent plate boundary is the boundary that occur when two plates collide each other either a continental plate with continental plate or oceanic plate. This causes very large earth movements. Plate collision can produce earthquake, volcanoes, mountains formation, and other geological event. The Himalayas were formed by such a collision. Earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. This is because of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle.\nThe diagram shows some differences between the two types of subduction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":239},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":315},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"Earthquake","offset":358},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":374},{"uri":"Mantle_(geology)","surface_form":"mantle","offset":496},{"uri":"Subduction","surface_form":"subduction","offset":564}]}
