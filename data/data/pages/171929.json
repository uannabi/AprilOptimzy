{"id":171929,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia","text":"=\"preserve\">Myopia, also called near-sightedness or short-sightedness, is a problem with the focusing ability of the eye. It is when the eye is not able to focus properly on objects in the distance. This condition is very common and it often occurs with many members of the same family. It happens when the lens becomes a different shape (too curved) from usual, or when the eye is longer than normal, so light entering the eye focuses on a point \"in front of\" the retina, rather than right on it. This makes distant objects look blurry. People with myopia often squint while watching television or trying to see distant objects. Sudden myopia can often be the first symptom of Type II Diabetes.\nIn most cases, it can be fixed easily using glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Focus","surface_form":"focus","offset":93},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":117},{"uri":"Lens_(eye)","surface_form":"lens","offset":307},{"uri":"Retina","surface_form":"retina","offset":465},{"uri":"Squint","surface_form":"squint","offset":563},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":585},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":667},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"Type II Diabetes","offset":678},{"uri":"Glasses","surface_form":"glasses","offset":740},{"uri":"Contact_lens","surface_form":"contact lens","offset":749},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":768}]}
