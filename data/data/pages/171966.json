For example: they may be selling ice creams in the same area.\nBrothers and sisters may be rivals. For example: they may both be trying to get their mother's attention.\nCountries may be rivals. For example: they may be trying to have power over the same thing. This can be a dangerous thing which, in some cases, can lead to war.\nIn sport, two teams may be rivals.
