It is a clear liquid and is the simplest molecule in a group called nitriles. Acetonitrile is made when plastics are being made so is quite cheap. Chemists use it as a solvent for chemical reactions and in cromatography.\nAcetonitrile is flammable and can hurt our eyes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":46},{"uri":"Nitrile","surface_form":"nitrile","offset":152},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":188},{"uri":"Chemists","surface_form":"Chemists","offset":231},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":264},{"uri":"Chromatography","surface_form":"cromatography","offset":290},{"uri":"Flammable","surface_form":"flammable","offset":321},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":348}]}
