The algorithms take an input and produce a \"hash\" value (often shown in hexadecimal). The length of the \"hash\" depends on the digest length of the algorithm.\nFamily.\nThe Secure Hashing Algorithms, being Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) compliant algorithms are subject to the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":16},{"uri":"Cryptographic_hash_function","surface_form":"cryptographic hash function","offset":75},{"uri":"National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","surface_form":"National Institute of Standards and Technology","offset":120},{"uri":"Hexadecimal","surface_form":"hexadecimal","offset":247},{"uri":"Federal_Information_Processing_Standard","surface_form":"Federal Information Processing Standard","offset":378},{"uri":"Cryptographic_Algorithm_Validation_Program","surface_form":"Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program","offset":465}]}
