{"id":172272,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Lenny","text":"Hurricane Lenny was the last major hurricane, hurricane, named storm and depression of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. There are three main reasons to remember Lenny. One, it was strongest November Atlantic hurricane; two, the damage it caused in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and three, it moved the opposite way storms usually moved across the Caribbean Sea. Some people at the National Hurricane Center nicknamed it \"Wrong Way Lenny\". Lenny left $330 million in damage, this amount is likely not all the damage. This is because it was reported for U.S. territories only, such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nRetirement.\nBecause the damage was high and likely higher, the name Lenny was retired. In 2005 the name Lee was used instead. The name Lee in 2005 was not retired, so Lee is on the list for 2011 and 2017.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1999_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1999 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":91},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":193},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":251},{"uri":"Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"Virgin Islands","offset":271},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":355},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":389},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":591},{"uri":"U.S._Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"U.S. Virgin Islands","offset":611},{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2005","offset":722},{"uri":"Tropical_Storm_Lee_(2005)","surface_form":"Lee in 2005","offset":767}]}
