In 1931 he was expelled and got a job with the Nazis.\nHeydrich became German SS-Obergruppenf\u00FChrer (General) of the \"Sicherheitsdienst\". He was the head of the RSHA, which included the police and the Gestapo. He was one of those responsible for the Holocaust.\nIn 1941 Hermann G\u00F6ring gave Heydrich the order to arrange the \"Final Solution\". Heydrich was attacked in Prague on 27 May 1942 by two Czech and Slovak soldiers\ntrained by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). They had been sent (with a small support team) by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Heydrich died a week later in hospital from sepsis caused by the injuries he sustained. Afterwards the Germans killed the male population of the village Lidice, because the Germans accused that the people in the village helped the assasins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Halle","surface_form":"Halle","offset":47},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":68},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":95},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":111},{"uri":"Kriegsmarine","surface_form":"Kriegsmarine","offset":147},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":248},{"uri":"SS","surface_form":"SS","offset":255},{"uri":"Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer","surface_form":"Obergruppenf\u00FChrer","offset":258},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"General","offset":277},{"uri":"RSHA","surface_form":"RSHA","offset":337},{"uri":"Gestapo","surface_form":"Gestapo","offset":377},{"uri":"Holocaust","surface_form":"Holocaust","offset":426},{"uri":"Hermann_G%C3%B6ring","surface_form":"Hermann G\u00F6ring","offset":445},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":571},{"uri":"Slovaks","surface_form":"Slovak","offset":581},{"uri":"Special_Operations_Executive","surface_form":"Special Operations Executive","offset":620},{"uri":"Sepsis","surface_form":"sepsis","offset":788}]}
