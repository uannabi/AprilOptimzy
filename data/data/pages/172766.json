{"id":172766,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(chemistry)","text":"=\"preserve\">Cohesion, cohesive attraction, or cohesive force is a physical property of an object. It happens because of intermolecular attraction between like-molecules.\nCohesion holds hydrogen bonds together to create surface tension on water. Since water is attracted to other molecules, adhesive forces pull the water toward other molecules.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physical_property","surface_form":"physical property","offset":66},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":90},{"uri":"Intermolecular_attraction","surface_form":"intermolecular attraction","offset":120},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":159}]}
