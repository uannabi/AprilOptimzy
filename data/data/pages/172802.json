{"id":172802,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Dyson sphere is an idea about a structure that surrounds a star, first thought up by physicist Freeman Dyson, and then used in some science fiction works.\nThe idea of the Dyson sphere was the result of a thought experiment. Dyson noted that civilizations constantly increased their need for energy. He reasoned that as human civilization went on, there would come a time when it demanded more energy than the Earth could provide.\nHe proposed a system of structures designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed. His 1960 paper \"Search for artificial stellar sources of infra-red radiation\", in the journal \"Science\", was the first to present the concept of the Dyson sphere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Freeman_Dyson","surface_form":"Freeman Dyson","offset":110},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":147},{"uri":"Thought_experiment","surface_form":"thought experiment","offset":219},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":541},{"uri":"Science_(journal)","surface_form":"Science","offset":713}]}
