{"id":172909,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype","text":"The terms were invented by Wilhelm Johanssen to distinguish between inherited and environmentally produced variation. \"The distinction was not new. It had, for instance, been discussed by Francis Galton as \"nature\" vs. \"nurture\".\nThe extent to which the genotype influences the phenotype varies hugely. \"Some\" aspects of the phenotype are almost entirely determined by heredity, such as eye colour and blood types. Human language is an interesting case. The \"capacity\" to learn and speak a language is entirely inherited, but \"which\" language is spoken is entirely learnt, and hence is environmental.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wilhelm_Johanssen","surface_form":"Wilhelm Johanssen","offset":27},{"uri":"Variation_(biology)","surface_form":"variation","offset":107},{"uri":"Francis_Galton","surface_form":"Francis Galton","offset":188},{"uri":"Eye_colour","surface_form":"eye colour","offset":387},{"uri":"Blood_type","surface_form":"blood type","offset":402},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":421}]}
