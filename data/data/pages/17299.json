{"id":17299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube","text":"The fallopian tubes (also known as oviducts and uterine tubes) connect the ovaries to the uterus, and let the ovum pass into the uterus where they are able to be fertilized by sperm during sexual intercourse.There are two Fallopian tubes attached to either side of the uterus.\nOrigin.\nThey are named after the 16th century Italian anatomist, Gabriele Falloppio. The Greek word salpinx (\u03C3\u03B1\u03BB\u03C0\u03B9\u03B3\u03BE) means \"trumpet\".\nAnatomy.\nThere are two Fallopian tubes attached to either side of the end of the uterus. Each tube will end near one ovary. This place is called the fimbria. The Fallopian tubes are not attached to the ovaries, but open into the peritoneal cavity.\nIn humans, the Fallopian tubes are about 7 - 14 cm long.\nMovement.\nThe Fallopian tubes can move around the pelvis.\nFertilization.\nWhen an ovum is ready to be released from the ovary, the ovary wall breaks open and the ovum goes into the fallopian tube. There, it starts moving towards to uterus with the help of liquids and cilia on the inside walls. This can take hours or days.\nIf the ovum is fertilized while in the fallopian tube, then it sticks to the endometrium, which is the beginning of pregnancy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ovary","surface_form":"ovaries","offset":75},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":90},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"ovum","offset":110},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":176},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":189},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":310},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":323},{"uri":"Gabriele_Falloppio","surface_form":"Gabriele Falloppio","offset":342},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":366},{"uri":"Salpinx","surface_form":"salpinx","offset":377},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":402},{"uri":"Fimbria","surface_form":"fimbria","offset":561},{"uri":"Peritoneum","surface_form":"peritoneal cavity","offset":641},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":663},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"cm","offset":708},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":767},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":948},{"uri":"Fertilisation","surface_form":"fertilized","offset":1055},{"uri":"Endometrium","surface_form":"endometrium","offset":1117},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":1156}]}
