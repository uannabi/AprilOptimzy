{"id":17305,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s","text":"McDonald's is an American corporation that operates one of the largest chains of fast food restaurants in the world.\nMcDonald's has over 36,000 stores in 119 countries and territories, the second-most stores out of all fast food chains worldwide behind only the submarine sandwich chain Subway. They serve almost 54 million people each day.\nThe first McDonald's restaurant was opened by Richard and Maurice (Mac) McDonald in 1940. It was located on Route 66 in San Bernardino, California. The McDonald brothers later sold their company to Ray Kroc in Des Plaines, Illinois.\nFood.\nMcDonald's restaurants mainly serve hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, burgers, French fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes and desserts. They also have options such as salads, apples, milk, and Snack Wraps on the menu. And kids meals are available too.\nIn Australia, they sell the Frozen Coke, which is very popular.\nMore McDonald's food is sold in the United States than in any other area, which means that it is McDonald's largest market. Europe is McDonald's second largest market. The restaurants are either operated directly by McDonalds or more often by a franchisee, where the business is owned and operated by someone else to the standards set by McDonald's and with support from the McDonald's company. The company provides a central source of supply for food items and standardized menu.\nCriticism.\nIn 2014, McDonald's in Europe used chicken meat which was produced by using genetically modified animal feed, which it had not done since 2001. Greenpeace states that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each Chickenburger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.\nAlso, McDonald\u2019s menu has now become a semi-icon as in a menu that has like a chicken burger. If that chicken burger looked different from the menu\u2019s picture, that menu would be called \u201CAn McDonalds menu\u201D as McDonalds has a small but strong reputation on having pictures on the menu that looks completely different from the actual thing.\nMascot.\nThe McDonald's mascot is Ronald McDonald.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":26},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":81},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":91},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":158},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territories","offset":172},{"uri":"Submarine_sandwich","surface_form":"submarine sandwich","offset":262},{"uri":"Subway_(restaurant)","surface_form":"Subway","offset":287},{"uri":"Richard_and_Maurice_McDonald","surface_form":"Richard and Maurice (Mac) McDonald","offset":387},{"uri":"1940","surface_form":"1940","offset":425},{"uri":"U.S._Route_66","surface_form":"Route 66","offset":449},{"uri":"San_Bernardino%2C_California","surface_form":"San Bernardino","offset":461},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":477},{"uri":"Ray_Kroc","surface_form":"Ray Kroc","offset":539},{"uri":"Des_Plaines%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Des Plaines, Illinois","offset":551},{"uri":"Hamburger","surface_form":"hamburger","offset":616},{"uri":"Cheeseburgers","surface_form":"cheeseburgers","offset":628},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":643},{"uri":"French_fried_potatoes","surface_form":"French fries","offset":669},{"uri":"Breakfast","surface_form":"breakfast","offset":683},{"uri":"Soft_drinks","surface_form":"soft drinks","offset":700},{"uri":"Milkshakes","surface_form":"milkshakes","offset":713},{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":728},{"uri":"Salad","surface_form":"salad","offset":769},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":777},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":785},{"uri":"Wrap_(food)","surface_form":"Snack Wraps","offset":795},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":857},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":954},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1042},{"uri":"Franchising","surface_form":"franchisee","offset":1163},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1433},{"uri":"Genetically_modified_food","surface_form":"genetically modified animal feed","offset":1486},{"uri":"Greenpeace","surface_form":"Greenpeace","offset":1554},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":2052},{"uri":"Ronald_McDonald","surface_form":"Ronald McDonald","offset":2062}]}
