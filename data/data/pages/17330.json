This flood of dopamine is what causes a \u201Chigh.\u201D It\u2019s one of the main causes of drug addiction.\nAlthough initial drug use may be voluntary, drugs can alter brain chemistry. This can actually change how the brain performs and interfere with a person\u2019s ability to make choices. It can lead to intense cravings and compulsive drug use. Over time, this behavior can turn into a substance dependency or drug and alcohol addiction.\nThe effects of drugs on health.\nDrugs can impact almost every organ in the human body.\nLegal Implications.\nCharges involved for hard drugs are usually, but not always, harsher than for soft drugs.
