{"id":17363,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime","text":"Mime is a type of acting that does not use words or speech. Mime is all about physical movement and exaggerating your expressions. Mimes (people who practice mime) must use their actions to send a message or tell a story. They are not allowed to speak directly to the audience.\nProbably the most well-known mime was Marcel Marceau. Mime originates from Rome and Greece. Some people also believe that cavemen used mime to communicate as they could not talk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":43},{"uri":"Action","surface_form":"action","offset":179},{"uri":"Message","surface_form":"message","offset":197},{"uri":"Marcel_Marceau","surface_form":"Marcel Marceau","offset":316},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":353},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":362}]}
