{"id":173633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Poverty_and_Human_Rights","text":"\"World Poverty and Human Rights\" is a 2002 book by Thomas Pogge. In the book, Pogge says that the poorest 46 percent of people have 1.2 percent of global income, and 826 million of them do not have enough to eat. One-third of all human deaths are from poverty-related causes: 18 million annually, including 12 million children under five.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the 15 percent of people in the developed countries have 80 percent of global income. Pogge says that shifting 1 or 2 percent of our share toward poverty eradication seems morally compelling. Yet most of the rich people believe that they have no such responsibility.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thomas_Pogge","surface_form":"Thomas Pogge","offset":51},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":252},{"uri":"Developed_countries","surface_form":"developed countries","offset":405}]}
