{"id":17368,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver","text":"e=\"preserve\">A device driver is a program that lets the operating system communicate with specific computer hardware.\nComputer parts need a driver because they do not use standard commands. For example, video cards from Advanced Micro Devices (or AMD) and Nvidia do the same job, but each requires its own driver as different hardware requires different commands. Different operating systems also need different drivers, a driver written for macOS can not be used by Microsoft Windows.\nSome other computer parts do not need drivers (or the driver is built-in to the operating system) because they use a kind of standard; the operating system recognizes those parts and knows how to use those parts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_hardware","surface_form":"computer hardware","offset":99},{"uri":"Nvidia","surface_form":"Nvidia","offset":256},{"uri":"MacOS","surface_form":"macOS","offset":442},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":467}]}
