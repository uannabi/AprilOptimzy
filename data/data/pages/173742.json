{"id":173742,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent","text":"A godparent is an adult who sponsors a child during a formal religious ceremony or rite. Many religions have godparents or other adults who do something almost the same. These religions include Christianity & Judaism. Usually a godparent must be a member of the religion of the child. The role of a god parent is to also give the god child a gift, small or big, money, toys, etc. Mainly on Sundays.\nOriginally a godparent was someone who agreed to help raise the child and help them to become a good member of the religion. They may also have taken over as parent to the child if both its real parents died. Today, the role of godparent is not often a formal one, and has no real responsibility to the child. A female child of a godparent is a goddaughter. A male child of a godparent is a godson.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sponsor","surface_form":"sponsor","offset":28},{"uri":"Formal","surface_form":"formal","offset":54},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":61},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremony","offset":71},{"uri":"Rite","surface_form":"rite","offset":83},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":176},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":194},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":209},{"uri":"Responsibility","surface_form":"responsibility","offset":680}]}
