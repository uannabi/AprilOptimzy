{"id":173750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus","text":"Nystagmus, often called \"dancing eyes\", is an eye condition which causes uncontrolled, rapid, jerky, movement of the eyes, usually from side to side, but sometimes up and down or in a circular motion. Most people with nystagmus have poor vision. It causes problems in education, employment and many social situations. Nystagmus cannot be fixed by spectacles or contact lenses, although many people with nystagmus wear glasses or contact lenses to correct other eye problems.\nTreatments and research.\nThere are currently no cures for nystagmus, but UK Nystagmus Network supports and encourages medical and other research into this complex condition. Research is ongoing with a number of universities leading the way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":46},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circular","offset":184},{"uri":"Spectacles","surface_form":"spectacles","offset":347},{"uri":"Contact_lens","surface_form":"contact lens","offset":361}]}
