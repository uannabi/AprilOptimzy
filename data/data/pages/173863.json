{"id":173863,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_government-in-exile","text":"The Czechoslovak government-in-exile (sometimes called officially as: provisional government of Czechoslovakia) was an informal name given to the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee, first by British diplomatic recognition. The name was used by other World War II Allies as they followed the British in recognizing it. The Committee was originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, Edvard Bene\u0161 in Paris, France in October 1939. Unsuccessful negotiations with France for diplomatic status, as well as the impending Nazi occupation of France, forced the Committee to move to London in 1940. From there, it moved to Aston Abbots, Buckinghamshire in 1941, where it sought relative safety from the London Blitz.\nIt was the true government for Czechoslovakia throughout the Second World War. A specifically anti-Fascist government, it sought to reverse the Munich Agreement and the following German occupation of Czechoslovakia, and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. Due to this it was considered, by those countries that recognized it, the legal continuation of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government_in_exile","surface_form":"government-in-exile","offset":17},{"uri":"British_government","surface_form":"British","offset":199},{"uri":"Diplomatic_recognition","surface_form":"diplomatic recognition","offset":207},{"uri":"World_War_II_Allies","surface_form":"World War II Allies","offset":258},{"uri":"President_of_Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovak President","offset":377},{"uri":"Edvard_Bene%C5%A1","surface_form":"Edvard Bene\u0161","offset":401},{"uri":"Paris%2C_France","surface_form":"Paris, France","offset":417},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":479},{"uri":"Occupation_of_France_by_Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi occupation of France","offset":534},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":593},{"uri":"Aston_Abbots","surface_form":"Aston Abbots","offset":633},{"uri":"Buckinghamshire","surface_form":"Buckinghamshire","offset":647},{"uri":"London_Blitz","surface_form":"London Blitz","offset":713},{"uri":"Occupation_of_Czechoslovakia_by_Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":758},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":788},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"Fascist","offset":826},{"uri":"Munich_Agreement","surface_form":"Munich Agreement","offset":871},{"uri":"Occupation_of_Czechoslovakia_by_Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"German occupation of Czechoslovakia","offset":906},{"uri":"First_Republic_of_Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"First Republic of Czechoslovakia","offset":1094}]}
