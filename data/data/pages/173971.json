It was adopted by the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria on 2 March 2005. An early explanation of the Streamlined System was made in 1997 to the US and UK Antartcic place-naming authorities. They had noticed the difference from their 1952 BGN/PCGN romanization of Bulgarian. The new system became subject to comparative study at the Department of English and American Studies at Sofia University.\nSubsequently, the system was chosen by the Bulgarian Government. It is the official transliteration system to be used in all identity documents, road signs, street names, official information systems, databases, local authorities\u2019 websites etc. Eventually, the Streamlined System became part of Bulgarian law by way of the Transliteration Law passed in 2009.\nThe Streamlined system was adopted also by UN in 2012, and for official US and UK use, by BGN and PCGN in 2013. Ivanov proposes using his Romanization approach in the case of Cyrillic alphabets of other Slavic languages, notably Russian.\nBasic principles.\nIt had been proposed to modify the Streamlined System so that Bulgarian letters \u042A and \u0426 were transliterated as \"\u0102\" and \"TZ\" respectively. However, those proposals failed to gain wider acceptance, and were not adopted for official usage.\nInvertibility.\nThe system is not invertible, for \u0410, \u0416, \u0419, \u0426, \u0428, \u0429, \u042E, \u042F are transliterated in the same way as are \u042A, \u0417\u0425, \u042C, \u0422\u0421, \u0421\u0425, \u0428\u0422, \u0419\u0423, \u0419\u0410 respectively. An auxiliary, invertible variant of the system without the \u0418\u042F-exception rule is proposed by L. Ivanov, D. Skordev and D. Dobrev to be used in those special cases when the exact retrieval of Bulgarian words from their Romanized forms is a priority, with Cyrillic letters and combinations of letters\n\u042A, \u042C, \u0417\u0425, \u0419\u0410, \u0419\u0423, \u0421\u0425, \u0422\u0421, \u0422\u0428, \u0422\u0429, \u0428\u0422, \u0428\u0426 transliterated as \"`A\", \"`Y\", \"Z|H\", \"Y|A\", \"Y|U\", \"S|H\", \"T|S\", \"T|SH\", \"T|SHT\", \"SH|T\", \"SH|TS\" respectively. In order to ensure full invertibility of the system, including the case of the \u0418\u042F-exception rule, one may transliterate word-final -\u0418\u0410 as \"I|A\" rather than \"IA\". The plain streamlined transliteration word form could be retrieved from its invertible variant by simply removing the additional symbols ` and |.\nComparison with other systems.\nThe Streamlined System is based on an English-oriented transliteration, taking advantage of the global \"lingua franca\" role of English. A similar shift towards English-oriented transliteration is observed in the case of other Cyrillic alphabets such as Russian and Ukrainian, and to some extent Macedonian.\nThe Streamlined System is similar to the old 1952 BGN/PCGN System for the Romanization of Bulgarian, which had been official in the USA and the United Kingdom until 2013. The latter however transliterates the Cyrillic letters \u0425, \u042C and \u042A as \"KH\", \"\u2019\" (apostrophe) and \"\u016C\", while the former uses \"H\", \"Y\" and \"A\" instead.\nAnother similar system not adopted for official use in Bulgaria is that of A. Danchev, M. Holman, E. Dimova and M. Savova, which transliterates the Cyrillic letters \u0423 and \u042A by \"OU\" and \"U\" respectively, while the Streamlined System uses \"U\" and \"A\" for this purpose. Furthermore, the latter system transliterates the digraphs \u0410\u0419\u2022\u0430\u0439, \u0415\u0419\u2022\u0435\u0439, \u041E\u0419\u2022\u043E\u0439 and \u0423\u0419\u2022\u0443\u0439 by AI\u2022ai, EI\u2022ei, OI\u2022oi and OUI\u2022oui instead of AY\u2022ay, EY\u2022ey, OY\u2022oy and UY\u2022uy respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romanization","surface_form":"Romanization","offset":72},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":88},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographical","offset":98},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":120},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":287},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":294},{"uri":"Sofia_University","surface_form":"Sofia University","offset":521},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"Government","offset":592},{"uri":"%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B0","surface_form":"Transliteration Law","offset":862},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":1073},{"uri":"Slavic_language","surface_form":"Slavic language","offset":1101},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":1127},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":2376},{"uri":"Transliteration","surface_form":"transliteration","offset":2393},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":2564},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":2591},{"uri":"Ukrainian_language","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":2603},{"uri":"Macedonian_language","surface_form":"Macedonian","offset":2633},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":2777},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":2789}]}
