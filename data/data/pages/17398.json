{"id":17398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO","text":"The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (often just called the 3DO) is a video game console invented by The 3DO Company. It was created by Trip Hawkins, the man who created Electronic Arts. The 3DO was not built by the company itself. They had a list of instructions that other companies could use to build their own. Panasonic made the first models in 1993, and other types of the machine were sold in 1994 by Sanyo and GoldStar.\nMany good things were said about it when it was created, including being named Time Magazine's \"1993 Product of the Year\". It also had many technologies that were new and advanced. But the 3DO cost more money than the video game consoles that were already popular. This meant more people bought consoles from Sega or Nintendo instead of the 3D0. Because of this, no more 3D0s were made after 1996. It was also not advertised very well, so almost no one knew about it. Some games planned for it include \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"Myst\". The 3DO company also wanted to make another console called the M2, but it was never released.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game console","offset":65},{"uri":"Trip_Hawkins","surface_form":"Trip Hawkins","offset":131},{"uri":"Electronic_Arts","surface_form":"Electronic Arts","offset":165},{"uri":"Panasonic","surface_form":"Panasonic","offset":310},{"uri":"Sanyo","surface_form":"Sanyo","offset":403},{"uri":"LG_Corp.","surface_form":"GoldStar","offset":413},{"uri":"Time_Magazine","surface_form":"Time Magazine","offset":502},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technologies","offset":563},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":732},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":740},{"uri":"Alone_in_the_Dark","surface_form":"Alone in the Dark","offset":926},{"uri":"Myst","surface_form":"Myst","offset":950}]}
