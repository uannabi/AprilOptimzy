{"id":17410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY","text":"QWERTY is a certain typewriter or computer keyboard layout that is commonly used in some English-speaking countries. The term comes from the fact the first 6 letters of the top row of keys are Q, W, E, R, T, and Y. The QWERTY design was patented by Christopher Sholes in 1874 and sold to E. Remington and Sons during the same year.\nHistory.\nThe QWERTY layout was invented by Christopher Sholes, the inventor of the first modern typewriter. At first the letters on the typewriter were placed alphabetically. However, when the user of the typewriter learned to type quickly, the bars attached to letters became caught in one another. The typist had to stop and unstick the typebars with his hands. A business associate of Sholes named James Densmore suggested splitting up the keys to speed up typing by preventing the typebars from striking the typewriter roller at the same time and sticking together. Some people say the QWERTY layout was created to slow down typing speed, while others say it worked by separating series of English letters.\nThe alternative Dvorak Simplified Keyboard was invented in the 1930s to be more efficient than QWERTY but it remained rare.\nAccents.\nThe QWERTY layout was made to type in English, therefore it has no accent marks as they are not used in native English words. People from other countries whose own languages used accent marks (such as French, which has letters like \"\u00E9\", \"\u00EE\", and \"\u00E7\") had problems. Depending on the operating system and the application being used, one can type accents marks by holding down the Alt key while pressing several number keys in a row. As an example, holding the Alt key, pressing the number keys 1, 5, and 6, then releasing the Alt key will generate a character numbered 156 in some character set. The Control or Alt key can be also used together with a letter. In some word processors, like Microsoft Word, characters with accent marks could be found under a category named \"Special Characters\" or something similar. Windows also has a program called \"Character Map\" that can be used to find and copy characters that could be pasted into other applications later on.\nInternational Variants.\nSome languages use the similar AZERTY layout. Some QWERTY keyboards for different languages and countries may look different.\nBelgian and French.\nThe keyboards made in Belgium and France switch the letters Q and W with the letters A and Z. They also move the letter M to the right of L. These types of keyboards are called AZERTY keyboards.\nCzech.\nSome keyboards for the Czech language use QWERTZ keyboards. They switch the Z and Y like the German version, but use \"\u016F\" to the right of L and \u00FA next to P. The row that normally has numbers has the accents \u011B, \u0161, \u010D, \u0159, \u017E, \u00FD, \u00E1, \u00ED, \u00E9. The user of the keyboard uses the shift key to make numbers.\nScandinavia.\nDanish and Norwegian layouts switched \u00C6, \u00D8, and \u00C5 where Swedish and Finnish use the letters \u00C4 and \u00D6.\nFaroese.\nFaroese keyboards add \u00C6 and \u00D8 next to L, and \u00C5 and \u00D0 next to P.\nGerman.\nGerman keyboards add an \u00DC to the right of P\u2014and \u00D6, \u00C4 to the right of L\u2014and switch the Z and Y keys both because Z is a much more common letter than Y in German.\nHungarian.\nHungarian keyboard add an \u00C9 and \u00C1 after L, \u00D6 above O, \u00DC above P, \u0150 after P, \u00DA after \u0150, \u00D3 above \u00DA, \u00CD under A, and switch Z and Y, like in German.\nIcelandic.\nIcelandic layouts add \u00D0 to the right of P, \u00C6 to the right of L, \u00D6 to the right of 0 in the top row and \u00DE to the rightmost place in the bottom row.\nItalian.\nItalian typewriter keyboards use a QZERTY layout where Z is swapped with W and M is at the right of \"L\". Computers use a QWERTY keyboard with \u00E8 to the right of P and \u00F2 to the right of L.\nLithuania.\nLithuanian keyboards use a layout known as \u0104\u017DERTY, where \u0104 appears in place of Q above A, \u017D in place of W above S, with Q and W being available either on the far right side or by use of the Alt Gr key. Depending on the software used. Sometimes, Lithuanian symbols replace the numbers.\nPortuguese.\nPortuguese keyboards maintain the QWERTY layout but add the key \u00C7 after the L key. The Spanish version has the letter \u00D1, the \u00C7.\nRomanian.\nRomanian keyboards have a QWERTZ layout, swapping Y with Z; \u0103 and \u00EE are added to the right of the letter P, while \u0219 and \u021B are added to the right of the letter L; \u00E2 replaces the backslash character. Changes are also made to the upper number keys, the numbers remain the same, but some of the symbols are shuffled. The most notable change is that hyphen (-) is swapped with slash (/).\nSpanish.\nSpanish keyboards add \u00F1 and \u00D1 characters to the right of the L instead of the semicolon and colon.\nTurkish.\nTurkish layouts add \u011E and \u00DC to the right of P, \u015E and \u0130 to the right of L, \u00D6 and \u00C7 to the right of M.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Keyboard_(computer)","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":43},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":89},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":237},{"uri":"Inventor","surface_form":"inventor","offset":399},{"uri":"Typewriter","surface_form":"typewriter","offset":428},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"letters","offset":453},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1026},{"uri":"Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard","surface_form":"Dvorak Simplified Keyboard","offset":1059},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1214},{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"accent marks","offset":1243},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":1340},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1377},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":1458},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"application","offset":1483},{"uri":"Microsoft_Word","surface_form":"Microsoft Word","offset":1864},{"uri":"Clipboard_(computing)","surface_form":"pasted","offset":2099},{"uri":"AZERTY","surface_form":"AZERTY","offset":2195},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":2332},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":2344},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"right","offset":2439},{"uri":"Czech_language","surface_form":"Czech language","offset":2535},{"uri":"Accent","surface_form":"accent","offset":2710},{"uri":"Shift_key","surface_form":"shift key","offset":2779},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":2819},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":2830},{"uri":"Hungarian_language","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":3173},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":3310},{"uri":"Typewriter","surface_form":"typewriter","offset":3493},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":3683},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":4067},{"uri":"Semicolon","surface_form":"semicolon","offset":4588},{"uri":"Colon","surface_form":"colon","offset":4602}]}
