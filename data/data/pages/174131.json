{"id":174131,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araluen_Zieria","text":"The Araluen Zieria (\"Zieria adenophora\"), is a small shrub found in only one place, on a slope above the Araluen Creek, near Araluen, New South Wales, Australia. In 2001 there were only 56 known plants. The plants were first collected in 1888, and they were then thought to have become extinct. The Zieria was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\nWhat the plant looks like.\nIt is a small shrub, which is related to the boronia plants. It is about tall and 50 cm wide, though some plants have grown up to tall. It has a small white or pink flower with four petals, about long. The plant has flowers in spring, from August to October. It also has small green leaves which are trifoliate, as being in three parts like a clover leaf. The leaves have a strong smell.\nWhere they grow.\nThe plants have only been found near the Araluen Creek. They are growing on a steep, rocky, hillside.\nEndangered.\nThe plant has been listed as Endangered under the Australian Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. It is endangered because there are so few of the plants and they are only found in one place. A bushfire could destroy all the plants. There is also a danger from wild goats in the area. The goats do not eat the Zieria, but they could walk on the new seedlings and crush them. The goats might eat all the other plants which could lead to erosion and the soil could be washed away. Weeds growing around the plants might also stop new Zierias from growing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":53},{"uri":"Araluen%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Araluen, New South Wales","offset":125},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":151},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":286},{"uri":"Boronia","surface_form":"boronia","offset":414},{"uri":"Clover","surface_form":"clover","offset":712},{"uri":"Bushfire","surface_form":"bushfire","offset":1259},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":1331},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":1501}]}
