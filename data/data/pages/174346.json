{"id":174346,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity","text":"e=\"preserve\">Liberal Christianity is a term which is used for several movements in Christianity. These movements formed between the 18th and 20th century. Their philosophical and theological ideas have been influenced by those of Enlightenment. They are not \"liberal\" in a political sense. They want to remain independent from dogmas defined by the different Christian Churches. When Liberal Christians interpret the Bible, they reject Biblical inerrancy and Papal authority. A Liberal Christian may have certain beliefs that are the same as those of more conservative Christians. Well known proponents include Hans K\u00FCng, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Albert Schweitzer.\nConservative theologians and scholars strongly criticise:' the uncontrollable relativism, pluralism and ultimate nihilism, to which the subjective method of liberal theology was bound sooner or later to give rise'","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":83},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th","offset":132},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":141},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophical","offset":161},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theological","offset":179},{"uri":"Enlightenment","surface_form":"Enlightenment","offset":230},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":273},{"uri":"Dogma","surface_form":"dogma","offset":327},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":417},{"uri":"Biblical_inerrancy","surface_form":"Biblical inerrancy","offset":436},{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Papal","offset":459},{"uri":"Authority","surface_form":"authority","offset":465},{"uri":"University_of_T%C3%BCbingen","surface_form":"Hans K\u00FCng","offset":611},{"uri":"Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin","surface_form":"Pierre Teilhard de Chardin","offset":622},{"uri":"Albert_Schweitzer","surface_form":"Albert Schweitzer","offset":653},{"uri":"Relativism","surface_form":"relativism","offset":750},{"uri":"Pluralism","surface_form":"pluralism","offset":762},{"uri":"Nihilism","surface_form":"nihilism","offset":785},{"uri":"Objectivity_(philosophy)","surface_form":"subjective","offset":808}]}
