{"id":174368,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy","text":"e=\"preserve\">A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the womb. This is usually done by a gynecologist.\nWomen who undergo a hysterectomy can no longer bear children. Hysterectomies are done for certain forms of cancer of the reproductive system (affecting womb, cervix, ovaries), or tumors.\nA woman may have her uterus removed because she has a tumor. A tumor can be cancer. Another type of tumor can be benign. The uterus may be removed because organs in the pelvic area have moved down. When organs move, the uterus may move down, too. A hysterectomy may be able to fix this problem. A hysterectomy can be done for other reasons. These are endometriosis, bleeding, and pain that does not stop.\nWhen a woman has a hysterectomy other organs may be removed. Removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes can be part of the hysterectomy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":31},{"uri":"Womb","surface_form":"womb","offset":53},{"uri":"Gynecologist","surface_form":"gynecologist","offset":85},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":206},{"uri":"Cervix","surface_form":"cervix","offset":257},{"uri":"Ovary","surface_form":"ovaries","offset":265},{"uri":"Tumor","surface_form":"tumor","offset":278}]}
