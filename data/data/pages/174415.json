{"id":174415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper","text":"The Last Supper is the final meal that, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus shared with his apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Apostle Paul tells of this supper in his first letter to the Corinthians. The Synoptic Gospels all tell of Jesus using the bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood. the Gospel of John does not include those details but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples. This has led to some Christian groups having a ritual of foot washing as a sign of humility.\nThe Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the purpose for Eucharist, also known as \"Holy Communion\" or \"The Lord's Supper\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gospel","surface_form":"Gospel","offset":47},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":64},{"uri":"Twelve_apostles","surface_form":"apostles","offset":86},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":98},{"uri":"Crucifixion_of_Jesus","surface_form":"his crucifixion","offset":115},{"uri":"St._Paul","surface_form":"Apostle Paul","offset":136},{"uri":"First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians","surface_form":"first letter to the Corinthians","offset":177},{"uri":"Synoptic_Gospels","surface_form":"Synoptic Gospels","offset":214},{"uri":"Gospel_of_John","surface_form":"Gospel of John","offset":312},{"uri":"Maundy_Thursday","surface_form":"Maundy Thursday","offset":565},{"uri":"Eucharist","surface_form":"Eucharist","offset":623}]}
