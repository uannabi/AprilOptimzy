{"id":174419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius","text":"e=\"preserve\">Suetonius was a Roman historian. His most important work is called \"De Vita Caesarum,\" or \"Lives of the Caesars\". It includes the biographies of twelve successive Roman rulers, from Julius Caesar to Domitian.\nSuetonius was born when Vespasian was emperor, so scholars say he must have been born before 79 c.e. His father was from Rome's equestrian social class. He worked as a secretary for Emperor Hadrian but he was accused of something having to do with the empress Sabina and was forced to retire in 121 c.e. He wrote \"De Vita Caesarum\" after that.\nWesterners during the medieval and early modern periods thought \"De Vita Caesarum\" was a very good book. Many scholars have read and translated it. It has been printed in more than 100 separate versions since 1500 a.d.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":29},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":35},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":195},{"uri":"Domitian","surface_form":"Domitian","offset":212},{"uri":"Vespasian","surface_form":"Vespasian","offset":246},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"social class","offset":361},{"uri":"Hadrian","surface_form":"Hadrian","offset":412}]}
