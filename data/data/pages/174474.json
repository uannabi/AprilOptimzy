{"id":174474,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle","text":"The golden eagle (\"Aquila chrysaetos\") is one of the best-known birds of prey in the northern hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up prey. They eat hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels.\nOnce common across the Holarctic, it has gone from many areas heavily populated by humans. The species is still widespread. It lives in Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa.\nLike all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. It is one of the largest birds of prey in North America; only the California condor gets larger. Golden eagles also live in the Scottish Highlands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Birds_of_prey","surface_form":"birds of prey","offset":64},{"uri":"Northern_hemisphere","surface_form":"northern hemisphere","offset":85},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":151},{"uri":"Talons","surface_form":"talons","offset":247},{"uri":"Hare","surface_form":"hare","offset":282},{"uri":"Rabbits","surface_form":"rabbits","offset":289},{"uri":"Marmots","surface_form":"marmots","offset":298},{"uri":"Ground_squirrel","surface_form":"ground squirrel","offset":316},{"uri":"Holarctic","surface_form":"Holarctic","offset":357},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":470},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":479},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":507},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":530},{"uri":"Accipitridae","surface_form":"Accipitridae","offset":563},{"uri":"California_condor","surface_form":"California condor","offset":643},{"uri":"Scottish_Highlands","surface_form":"Scottish Highlands","offset":705}]}
