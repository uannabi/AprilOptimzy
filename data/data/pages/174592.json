{"id":174592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set","text":"In Euclidean space, a region is a convex set if the following is true. For any two points inside the region, a straight line segment can be drawn. If every point on that segment is inside the region, then the region is convex.\nThe point is that a convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set. So, any shape which is concave, or has a hollow, cannot be a convex set.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Euclidean_geometry","surface_form":"Euclidean space","offset":3},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":22},{"uri":"Segment","surface_form":"segment","offset":125},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":254},{"uri":"Concave","surface_form":"concave","offset":319}]}
