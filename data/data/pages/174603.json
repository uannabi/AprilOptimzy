{"id":174603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-cell","text":"In four dimensional geometry, a 16-cell, is a regular convex polychoron, or polytope existing in four dimensions. It is also known as the hexadecachoron. It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schl\u00E4fli in the mid-19th century.\nConway calls it an orthoplex for \"orthant complex\", as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes.\nGeometry.\nThe hexadecachoron is a member of the family of polytopes called the cross-polytopes, which exist in all dimensions. As such, its dual polychoron is the tesseract (the 4-dimensional hypercube).\nIt is bounded by 16 cells, all of which are regular tetrahedra. It has 32 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices. The 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes.\nThe eight vertices of the hexadecachoron are (\u00B11, 0, 0, 0), (0, \u00B11, 0, 0), (0, 0, \u00B11, 0), (0, 0, 0, \u00B11). All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs.\nThe Schl\u00E4fli symbol of the hexadecachoron is. Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron. There are 8 tetrahedra, 12 triangles, and 6 edges meeting at every vertex. Its edge figure is a square. There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge.\nThere is a lower symmetry form of the \"16-cell\", called a demitesseract or 4-demicube, a member of the demihypercube family, and represented by h, and can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells.\nTessellations.\nOne can tessellate 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16-cells. This is called the hexadecachoric honeycomb and has Schl\u00E4fli symbol. The dual tessellation, icositetrachoric honeycomb, is made of by regular 24-cells. Together with the tesseractic honeycomb, these are the only three regular tessellations of R4. Each 16-cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares an octahedron, 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge, and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point. Twenty-four 16-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation.\nProjections.\nThe cell-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a cubical envelope. The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube, corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube. Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other (non-regular) tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells, filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube. The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube. In this projection of the 16-cell, all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope.\nThe cell-first perspective projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope. The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell-first parallel projection.\nThe vertex-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has an octahedral envelope. This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes, by cutting along the coordinate planes. Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16-cell. The closest vertex of the 16-cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron.\nFinally the edge-first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope, and the face-first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":20},{"uri":"Regular_convex_polychora","surface_form":"regular convex polychoron","offset":46},{"uri":"Polytope","surface_form":"polytope","offset":76},{"uri":"Regular_convex_polychora","surface_form":"regular convex polychora","offset":175},{"uri":"Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli","surface_form":"Ludwig Schl\u00E4fli","offset":243},{"uri":"John_Horton_Conway","surface_form":"Conway","offset":284},{"uri":"Cross-polytope","surface_form":"cross-polytope","offset":367},{"uri":"Cross-polytope","surface_form":"cross-polytope","offset":463},{"uri":"Tesseract","surface_form":"tesseract","offset":547},{"uri":"Cell_(mathematics)","surface_form":"cells","offset":608},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedra","offset":640},{"uri":"Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol","surface_form":"Schl\u00E4fli symbol","offset":937},{"uri":"Vertex_figure","surface_form":"vertex figure","offset":983},{"uri":"Edge_figure","surface_form":"edge figure","offset":1101},{"uri":"Demihypercube","surface_form":"demihypercube","offset":1291},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedral","offset":1379},{"uri":"Tessellation","surface_form":"tessellate","offset":1421},{"uri":"Euclidean_space","surface_form":"Euclidean space","offset":1446},{"uri":"Hexadecachoric_honeycomb","surface_form":"hexadecachoric honeycomb","offset":1502},{"uri":"Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol","surface_form":"Schl\u00E4fli symbol","offset":1535},{"uri":"Icositetrachoric_honeycomb","surface_form":"icositetrachoric honeycomb","offset":1575},{"uri":"24-cell","surface_form":"24-cell","offset":1625},{"uri":"Tesseractic_honeycomb","surface_form":"tesseractic honeycomb","offset":1653},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cubical","offset":2053},{"uri":"Triakis_tetrahedron","surface_form":"triakis tetrahedral","offset":2689},{"uri":"Graphical_projection","surface_form":"projection","offset":2851},{"uri":"Octahedron","surface_form":"octahedral","offset":2897},{"uri":"Projection_envelope","surface_form":"envelope","offset":2908},{"uri":"Hexagonal_bipyramid","surface_form":"hexagonal bipyramid","offset":3304}]}
