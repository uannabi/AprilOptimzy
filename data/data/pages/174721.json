{"id":174721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex","text":"In geometry, a simplex (plural: \"simplices\" or \"simplexes\"), sometimes called \"n-simplex\" is the \"n\"-dimensional analogue figure of the triangle. A triangle is a 2-simplex. The 0-simplex is the point, the 1-simplex is the line segment (line connecting two points). The 3-simplex is the tetrahedron, and the 4-simplex is the pentachoron.\nA regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope. A regular \"n\"-simplex may be made from a regular (\"n\" - 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all the other vertices. All the vertices have the same length.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Figure","surface_form":"figure","offset":122},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":136},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"point","offset":194},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":236},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedron","offset":286},{"uri":"Pentachoron","surface_form":"pentachoron","offset":324},{"uri":"Regular_polytope","surface_form":"regular polytope","offset":383},{"uri":"Vertex","surface_form":"vertex","offset":488}]}
