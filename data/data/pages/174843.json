{"id":174843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitch%21_The_Movie","text":"\"Stitch! The Movie\" is a direct-to-video animated spin-off of \"Lilo & Stitch\", released on August 26, 2003. Although it follows the original movie, it is often considered more of a pilot for the spinoff series '. The movie introduces Jumba's 625 experiments. Without the credits, the movie is only 57 minutes long.\nThe story.\nStitch, Jumba, and Pleakley are all living with Lilo and Nani. But no one knows that Jumba had secretly deactivated all 625 of his other experiments and brought them with him. The ex-captain Gantu, hired by Jumba's former partner, Dr. Jacques von H\u00E4msterviel, goes to find them and captures Jumba to force him into telling where they are. Now, Lilo and Stitch have to save Stitch's ohana from being used for chaos. Two experiments are activated in this movie: 221, \"Sparky\", with the ability to cause big electric surges, and 625 who has all the abilities of Stitch but is lazier. At least he makes good sandwiches!\nProduction.\nThe movie's original title was going to be \"Lilo & Stitch: A New Ohana\". At some time, there was a decision to only have Stitch's name in the names of both the movie and the following series, which was planned to be called \"Stitch! The Series\". Eventually, this was changed, making this movie and the series have different names. The \"Stitch!\" name, with the exclamation point, was later used as the name of an anime series five years after this movie's release.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Direct-to-video","surface_form":"direct-to-video","offset":25},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":41},{"uri":"Lilo_%26amp%3B_Stitch","surface_form":"Lilo & Stitch","offset":63},{"uri":"Television_pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":181},{"uri":"Chaos","surface_form":"chaos","offset":734},{"uri":"Exclamation_mark","surface_form":"exclamation point","offset":1313}]}
