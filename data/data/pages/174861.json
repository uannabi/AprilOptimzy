{"id":174861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Falls","text":"Angel Falls is the tallest waterfall in the world. It falls off a mountain called \"Auyantepui\". It is found in Venezuela, which is a country in South America. The falls drop so far, the water turns into mist when it reaches the bottom.\nThe falls are named for Jimmy Angel. Jimmy Angel was an airplane pilot that crashed at the top of the falls in 1937.\nAngel Falls is also called Salto \u00C1ngel or indigenously Kerepakupai-mer\u00FA. The indigenous name derived from the Pem\u00F3n natives means \"falls from the deepest place\". Ironically, the more famous name of the falls had nothing to do with the connotation that its water fell from the heavens.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":66},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":111},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":144},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":292}]}
