{"id":17495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfinch","text":"The greenfinch (\"Chloris chloris\"), also known as the European greenfinch, is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae.\nThis bird is widespread throughout Europe, north Africa and southwest Asia. It is mainly resident, but some northernmost populations migrate further south. The Greenfinch has also been introduced into both Australia and New Zealand.\nWoodland edges, farmland hedges and gardens with relatively thick vegetation are favoured for breeding. It nests in trees or bushes, laying 38 eggs. This species can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixing with other finches and buntings. They feed largely on seeds, but also take berries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"passerine","offset":86},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":96},{"uri":"Finch","surface_form":"finch","offset":108},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":114},{"uri":"Fringillidae","surface_form":"Fringillidae","offset":121},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":170},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":184},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":205},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migrate","offset":268},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":341},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":355},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":511},{"uri":"Seeds","surface_form":"seeds","offset":652},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":673}]}
