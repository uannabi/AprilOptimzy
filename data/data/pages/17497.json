{"id":17497,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest","text":"A nest is place animals build to hold their eggs or provide a place to raise their babies. They are most typical of birds, but many other vertebrates do make nests.\nNests may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves. They may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building. Nests can be found in all types of habitat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":16},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":44},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":116},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":138},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":303},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":309},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":363}]}
