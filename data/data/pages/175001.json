The Falls are located in an area of the park called Yosemite Valley, a huge valley that is famous for its beauty and its unusual box shape. The falls is the 7th tallest in the world. Though some books and websites list Colonial Creek Falls as being higher, this waterfall has not been accurately measured and it does not have a plunge like Yosemite Falls does. It is probably the second most famous waterfall in America, after Niagara Falls in New York.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":108},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"fall","offset":119},{"uri":"Niagara_Falls","surface_form":"Niagara Falls","offset":598}]}
