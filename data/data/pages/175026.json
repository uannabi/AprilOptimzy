Their on sparkles and shimmers with tiny lights and that have big eyes. Their eyebrows are rows of lights. They do not speak; instead, they make noises such as squeaks, squeals, \"poofs\", and clicks. The Boohbahs can retract their heads into their furry necks. Each Boohbah is a different colour.\nA list of the Boohbahs is available below.\nThe Storypeople.\nThey do not speak. (When Little Dog Fido appears, he gives an \"arf!\") Though they sometimes show frustration or confusion, the Storypeople rarely, if ever,look upset or sad. The Storyland segments are narrated by actor Chris Langham. In each episode the Storypeople magically receive an object sent to them by a child or group of children.\nThe Boohball.\nOne of the common things in \"Boohbah\" is the Boohball. The Boohball, a glowing white ball, is where the Boohbahs live, and it appears out of nowhere in various parts of the show. It travels from country to country when it is called by children. Inside the Boohball is a set of pods on a round, spinning base, where the Boohbahs recharge energy. It looks like five fuzzy ladle-like charger pods with the handles linked; and, alternate, pods are the Boohbahs' beds or they look like five fig halves. The energy is created by the laughter of the children when playing with the Boohbahs, the Boohball, and the Storypeople.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":23},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television programme","offset":34},{"uri":"Ragdoll_Productions","surface_form":"Ragdoll Productions","offset":75},{"uri":"Anne_Wood","surface_form":"Anne Wood","offset":111},{"uri":"Teletubbies","surface_form":"Teletubbies","offset":186},{"uri":"Kindergarten","surface_form":"preschool","offset":227},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":310},{"uri":"Silliness","surface_form":"silly","offset":348},{"uri":"Thinking","surface_form":"thinking","offset":375},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":442},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":531},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":540},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":622},{"uri":"ITV","surface_form":"ITV","offset":680},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":786},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":844},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":981},{"uri":"Nick_Jr.","surface_form":"Nick Jr.","offset":996},{"uri":"Doll","surface_form":"doll","offset":1022},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":1031},{"uri":"Frustration","surface_form":"frustration","offset":3372},{"uri":"Confusion","surface_form":"confusion","offset":3387},{"uri":"Chris_Langham","surface_form":"Chris Langham","offset":3494}]}
