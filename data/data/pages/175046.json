{"id":175046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents","text":"One of the worst nuclear accidents to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. That accident killed 30 people directly, as well as damaging approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 estimates that there will eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Approximately 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas soon after the accident.\nSome of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. To-date, all of these were units of the former Soviet Union.\nNormal accidents.\nNormal Accidents is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist Charles Perrow, which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems from a social sciences perspective. It was the first to characterize complex technological systems such as nuclear power plants according to their riskiness. Perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled systems. Such accidents cannot be designed around.\nThe inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, where a nuclear accident resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. The event was an example of a normal accident because it was \"unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable\".\nPerrow's argument rests on three principles. Firstly, people make mistakes, even at nuclear plants. Secondly, big accidents almost always escalate from very small beginnings. Thirdly, many failures are those of organizations more than technology. Each of these principles is still relevant today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chernobyl_disaster","surface_form":"Chernobyl disaster","offset":51},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":96},{"uri":"Nuclear_submarine","surface_form":"nuclear submarine","offset":678},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":752},{"uri":"Normal_Accidents","surface_form":"Normal Accidents","offset":784},{"uri":"Charles_Perrow","surface_form":"Charles Perrow","offset":836},{"uri":"Nuclear_power_plant","surface_form":"nuclear power plant","offset":1013},{"uri":"Three_Mile_Island_accident","surface_form":"Three Mile Island accident","offset":1266},{"uri":"Nuclear_accident","surface_form":"nuclear accident","offset":1302}]}
