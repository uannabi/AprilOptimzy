{"id":17512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion","text":"An accordion is a musical instrument that has keys similar to a piano, but is small enough for a person to hold. It makes sounds using air pushed and pulled through reeds using a bellows. The accordion can also have buttons instead of keys. The 6-plus-6-system with three rows has the same fingering in all twelve scales.\nThe accordion was invented in 1822 in Germany by Friedrich Buschmann.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":18},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":64},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":122},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":135},{"uri":"Reed_(instrument)","surface_form":"reeds","offset":165},{"uri":"Bellows","surface_form":"bellows","offset":179},{"uri":"6-plus-6-instruments","surface_form":"6-plus-6-system","offset":245},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":360}]}
