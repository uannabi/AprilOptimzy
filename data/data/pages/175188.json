{"id":175188,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Muck","text":"Karl Muck, (his first name is sometimes spelt Carl, his surname rhymes with \u201Cbook\u201D) (born Darmstadt, 22 October 1859; died Stuttgart, 4 March 1940) was a German conductor. He was one of the greatest conductors of his day, especially famous for his conducting of operas by Richard Wagner.\nEarly life.\nKarl Muck\u2019s father was a Bavarian politician and amateur musician. After his school years he studied music at the Conservatory in W\u00FCrzburg. He also studied classical philology at the University of Heidelberg. In 1877 he continued his music studies in Leipzig, learning the piano with Carl Reinecke. His first public performance was in 1880, the year in which he graduated with a doctorate, playing the piano in the Piano Concerto by Xaver Scharwenka at the Leipzig Gewandhaus.\nCareer.\nSoon he spent all his time conducting operas. He conducted in Z\u00FCrich, Salzburg, Brno and Graz, and got a conductor\u2019s job in Prague and later in Berlin. He conducted the operas of Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle with great success as well as many performances of \"Parsifal\". In 1912 he became the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and from 1922 until he retired in 1933 he conducted the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\nMuck was one of the first conductors to be internationally famous for travelling about conducting orchestras in many parts of the world. He was a strict conductor who thought it was very important that the players should do exactly what the composer asks for in the score.\nHe was imprisoned in the United States during World War I, because of his support for Germany and because he refused to conduct the \"Star Spangled Banner\". After the war he was sent away and not allowed to return to America. After his death a square in Hamburg was named after him, although in 1997 it was renamed \u201CJohannes Brahms Square\u201D because Muck had praised Adolf Hitler.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":90},{"uri":"Stuttgart","surface_form":"Stuttgart","offset":123},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":154},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":161},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":262},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":272},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":325},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":334},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":349},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrzburg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrzburg","offset":430},{"uri":"Philology","surface_form":"philology","offset":466},{"uri":"Heidelberg","surface_form":"Heidelberg","offset":497},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":551},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":573},{"uri":"Carl_Reinecke","surface_form":"Carl Reinecke","offset":584},{"uri":"Graduate","surface_form":"graduate","offset":662},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctorate","offset":679},{"uri":"Xaver_Scharwenka","surface_form":"Xaver Scharwenka","offset":733},{"uri":"Leipzig_Gewandhaus","surface_form":"Leipzig Gewandhaus","offset":757},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":847},{"uri":"Salzburg","surface_form":"Salzburg","offset":855},{"uri":"Brno","surface_form":"Brno","offset":865},{"uri":"Graz","surface_form":"Graz","offset":874},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":909},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":929},{"uri":"Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen","surface_form":"Ring Cycle","offset":973},{"uri":"Parsifal","surface_form":"Parsifal","offset":1036},{"uri":"Boston_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Boston Symphony Orchestra","offset":1086},{"uri":"Hamburg_Philharmonic_Orchestra","surface_form":"Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra","offset":1169},{"uri":"Sheet_music","surface_form":"score","offset":1467},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1499},{"uri":"Star_Spangled_Banner","surface_form":"Star Spangled Banner","offset":1607},{"uri":"Town_square","surface_form":"square","offset":1717},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":1727},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":1838}]}
