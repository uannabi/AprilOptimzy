Some of the most well known cases of torture involving the U.S. are the Abu Ghraib scandal and Guantanamo Bay.\nAbu Ghraib Prison.\nStarting in 2004 there were reports of abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The New Yorker newspaper had an article in May 2004 about the abuse and the article had pictures that were taken by soldiers involved. According to an investigation by the Department of Defense called the Taguba Report, the military had been looking into the abuse since 2003. In the end nine soldiers were discharged from the military and sent to prison.\nGuantanamo Bay.\nHuman rights organisations like Amnesty International have said CIA agents used waterboarding and other ways to get information out of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Because of the abuse President Barack Obama ordered the base to be closed down.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":71},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":113},{"uri":"War_on_Terror","surface_form":"War on Terror","offset":218},{"uri":"Torture","surface_form":"torture","offset":242},{"uri":"Terrorists","surface_form":"terrorists","offset":284},{"uri":"Guantanamo_Bay","surface_form":"Guantanamo Bay","offset":391},{"uri":"The_New_Yorker","surface_form":"The New Yorker","offset":518},{"uri":"Investigate","surface_form":"investigation","offset":669},{"uri":"Department_of_Defense","surface_form":"Department of Defense","offset":690},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"Human rights","offset":890},{"uri":"Amnesty_International","surface_form":"Amnesty International","offset":922},{"uri":"CIA","surface_form":"CIA","offset":954},{"uri":"Waterboarding","surface_form":"waterboarding","offset":970},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":1075},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":1085}]}
