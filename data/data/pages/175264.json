There one can see the most famous Islamic Architecture of the country. Within the Alhambra, the Palace of Charles V was erected by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1527.\nThe Muslim rulers lost Granada and Alhambra in 1492 without the fortress itself being attacked when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile took the surrounding region with an overwhelming force of numbers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moors","surface_form":"Moorish","offset":170},{"uri":"Emirate_of_Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":188},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":208},{"uri":"Al-Andalus","surface_form":"Al-Andalus","offset":225},{"uri":"Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":369},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":394},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":444},{"uri":"Islamic_Architecture","surface_form":"Islamic Architecture","offset":572},{"uri":"Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor","offset":669},{"uri":"Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Ferdinand II of Aragon","offset":813},{"uri":"Isabella_of_Castile","surface_form":"Isabella of Castile","offset":846}]}
