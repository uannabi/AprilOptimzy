{"id":175310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo","text":"\"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\" is a sentence that uses correct grammar. It is often used as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create confusing, hard-to-understand sentences.\nIt has been talked about since 1967, when the sentence was used by Dmitri Borgmann in his book \"Beyond Language\". Later, in 1972, the sentence was used by William J. Rapaport. Rapaport is a professor at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.\nIt can be broken down to \"Buffaloa buffalon Buffaloa buffalon buffalov buffalov Buffaloa buffalon\", where \"a\" is adjective, \"n\" is noun, and \"v\" is verb. It means, \"Bison from Buffalo, which other bison from Buffalo confuse, confuse the bison from Buffalo.\"\nOther words can be used to make sentences like this one. These include \"police\", \"fish\", and \"people\". For example, \"Fish fish fish fish fish\". Other times, similar words that are spelled differently can be used: \"Foul fowl foul fowl foul foul foul fowl\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":71},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":98},{"uri":"Homonym","surface_form":"homonym","offset":145},{"uri":"Homophone","surface_form":"homophone","offset":158},{"uri":"Dmitri_Borgmann","surface_form":"Dmitri Borgmann","offset":299},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":422},{"uri":"University_at_Buffalo","surface_form":"University at Buffalo","offset":439},{"uri":"Buffalo%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Buffalo, New York","offset":464},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":813},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":823},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":835},{"uri":"Foul","surface_form":"Foul","offset":955},{"uri":"Fowl","surface_form":"fowl","offset":960}]}
