{"id":175981,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC) is what happens to a dilute gas when it is made very cold, near absolute zero (0 K which equals \u2212273.15 \u00B0C or \u2212459.67\u00A0\u00B0F). It forms when the particles that make it up have very low energy. Only bosons can make a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. The gas has extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air.\nA Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is a change of state. When matter is in the BEC state it has zero viscosity. Superfluidity and superconductivity are both closely connected with the BEC state of matter.\nTheory.\nParticles have energy. They can have a lot of energy and bounce wildly like in gases; have less energy and flow like a liquid; or have even less energy like a solid. If you take enough of the particle's energy away you get to the tiniest or the smallest amount of energy possible. This is a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. This makes all of the particles exactly the same and instead of bouncing around randomly in all different directions, they all bounce up and down in exactly the same way, forming something called a 'giant matter wave'.\nHistory.\nThe Bose-Einstein Condensate was first suggested by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924\u201325. Seventy years later, its existence was proved. Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman made the first Bose\u2013Einstein condensate in 1995 at the University of Colorado. Cornell, Wieman,and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT were then given the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nExperiments.\nUsually to get anything cold enough to make a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate you have to first trap the boson using magnets and then, by bouncing lasers off them, take all of their energy away (Laser cooling). This still does not get things quite cold enough. Some of the particles will still be bouncing around a lot, and only some will be lying down nicely. The magnetic field is then slowly lowered bit by bit to let the faster bouncing particles out. This just leaves us with the coldest and slowest atoms inside.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dilute","surface_form":"dilute","offset":65},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":72},{"uri":"Absolute_zero","surface_form":"absolute zero","offset":108},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"K","offset":125},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"C","offset":149},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"F","offset":163},{"uri":"Particles","surface_form":"particles","offset":185},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":225},{"uri":"Boson","surface_form":"boson","offset":238},{"uri":"States_of_matter","surface_form":"state","offset":415},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":461},{"uri":"Viscosity","surface_form":"viscosity","offset":466},{"uri":"Superfluidity","surface_form":"Superfluidity","offset":477},{"uri":"Superconductivity","surface_form":"superconductivity","offset":495},{"uri":"State_of_matter","surface_form":"state of matter","offset":553},{"uri":"Particles","surface_form":"Particles","offset":578},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":593},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":697},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":737},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":842},{"uri":"Particles","surface_form":"particles","offset":917},{"uri":"Satyendra_Nath_Bose","surface_form":"Satyendra Nath Bose","offset":1175},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":1199},{"uri":"Eric_Cornell","surface_form":"Eric Cornell","offset":1274},{"uri":"University_of_Colorado_Boulder","surface_form":"University of Colorado","offset":1358},{"uri":"MIT","surface_form":"MIT","offset":1423},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":1452}]}
