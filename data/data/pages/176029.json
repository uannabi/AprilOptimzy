{"id":176029,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region_of_Brazil","text":"The South Region of Brazil () is one of the five geographical regions of Brazil defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in 1969. It includes the states of Paran\u00E1, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.\nGeography.\nThe South Region has an area of, the smallest region of the country.\nIt is the only region of Brazil located outside the tropical zone, with clear variations about the seasons. In winter there are frosts and rarely snow. The relief is just a bit hilly, with a predominance of a large plateau, in general low.\nIt borders to the north with the Mato Grosso do Sul and S\u00E3o Paulo states; to the east with the Atlantic Ocean; to the south with Uruguay states; and to west with Argentina and Paraguay.\nHydrography.\nThe hydrography of Southern Brazil can be classified in three great regions of Watersheds: the Paran\u00E1 River, the Uruguay River and the Southeast Brazil Rivers.\nThe rivers of the southern region are availed for navigation, irrigation agriculture, urban water supply and power generation. The most important rivers are voluminous and have great hydroelectric potential. The Itaipu Dam, on the Parana River, is exploring the potential for power generation in the region. This operation allows the South and the Southeast an increasing use of electricity for domestic and industrial use.\nRelief.\nThe relief of the region is characterized by many plateaus that rises at altitudes up to more than 1,000 meters above sea level, decreasing to the west. Covering about 3/4 parts of the regional relief, this set is called \"Southern Plateau of Brazil\" and breaks down into plateaus that go from east to west.\nClimate.\nOnly Brazilian region located almost entirely in a subtropical climate, the South is the coldest area of Brazil, with frost and even, in some places, the snowfall. The seasons are well defined and the rains are evenly distributed over the year.\nSouthern Brazil has subtropical or temperate climate. The annual average temperatures vary between 12\u00A0\u00B0C (53.6\u00A0\u00B0F) and 22\u00A0\u00B0C (71.6\u00A0\u00B0F). Frost is very common and can snow in some mountain ranges.\nStates.\nThis region is formed by three states: Paran\u00E1, Paran\u00E1 and Rio Grande do Sul.\nPanorama.\nWhat most characterizes the South is the way it was colonized and kind of colonizers received. Received short black slaves, but many Caucasian immigrants. The Europeans gave the population the predominance of white skin color, gave to the landscape marks of their original countries and introduced the system of medium and small farms.\nThe southern region has good social indicators: it has the highest HDI in Brazil (0.831), and the third highest GDP per capita of the country. The region is also, 94.8% of the population.\nThe region is highly urbanized (82%) and many cities are famous for their urban planning, like Curitiba and Maring\u00E1. It has a relatively high standard of living in many aspects, with the highest Human Development Index of Brazil, 0.859 (2007), and the second highest per capita income of the country, $13.396. The region is also the most literate, 94% literacy rate.\nSome places in the region must be emphasized, such as the Igua\u00E7u Falls, (Natural Heritage and one of the New7Wonders of Nature) and the Ruins of St. Michael of the Missions (Cultural Heritage); the Itaipu Dam, elected the as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World); the winter cities on mountains of the SC and RS; and the Botanical Garden of Curitiba, Southern Brazil greatest icon.\nHistory.\nThe first inhabitants of southern Brazil are the indigenous people. Then came the Spanish Jesuit priests to evangelize the Indians and dominate the land. The pioneers of S\u00E3o Paulo attacked the missions to arrest the Indians. So, the Jesuits and the Indians abandoned the place and the cattle got loose in the fields. The S\u00E3o Paulo pioneers became interested in the trade of cattle. On the way through which the troops passed villages have emerged. For many years, the Portuguese and Spaniards fought over land in the region.\nThe population of the South has grown with the arrival of the first European immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: Germans, Italians, Poles, Ukrainians immigrated to the region, which also received Japanese, Arabs and Jews.\nDemographics.\n, the South Region had a population of 29,439,773, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nThe capital of Paran\u00E1 state, Curitiba, has the largest population and also the largest economy, and the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, has the largest metropolitan area.\nRacial groups.\nThe region received large numbers of European immigrants during the 19th century, who have had a large influence on its demography and culture. The main ethnic origins of Southern Brazil are Portuguese, Italian, and German.\nPortuguese, the official language of Brazil, is spoken by the entire population. But in some places dialects of German or Italian origins are also spoken; some villages even use the language of immigrants. In Porto Alegre and Curitiba there are some Yiddish speakers.\nTourism.\nThe region has as main tourist attractions their natural beauty, beaches, historical cities and their European colonies, and the well-defined seasons, characterized by the severe winter.\nIn Paran\u00E1, the Iguassu Falls receive thousands of tourists every year, being the main destination for foreigners in the region. The state also has a geological site of approximately 340 million years, with huge rock formations. The capital, Curitiba, was considered the best southern city for tourism\nIn Santa Catarina the beaches receive many visitors, and the winter colonies in the state.\nThe Rio Grande do Sul state - like Santa Catarina - attracts tourists in winter to the cities in mountain, where the cold is intense.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":20},{"uri":"Political_subdivisions_of_Brazil","surface_form":"geographical
