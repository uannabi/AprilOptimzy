{"id":176064,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Stoiber","text":"Edmund R\u00FCdiger Stoiber, German pronunciation: \u02C8\u025Btm\u028Ant \u02C8\u0283t\u0254\u028Fb\u0250, (born 28 September 1941) is a German politician. He used to be the Minister-President of the state of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union party (CSU). On 18 January 2007, he said he no longer wanted to be minister-president and party leader by 30 September, after having been by his own party for weeks.\nEarly life.\nEdmund Stoiber was born in Oberaudorf in the district of Rosenheim, Bavaria. Before he became a member of the Bavarian parliament in 1974, he was a lawyer and worked at the University of Regensburg.\nStoiber is married to Karin Stoiber. They have three children: Konstanze (1971), Veronika (1977), Dominik (1980) and three grandchildren: Johannes (1999), Benedikt (2001) and Theresa Marie (2005).\nEducation and profession.\nStoiber was a student at Ignaz-G\u00FCnther-Gymnasium in Rosenheim, where he received his Abitur (high school diploma) in 1961. He served the military with the mountain infantry division but had to leave because he hurt his knee. After his military service, Stoiber studied political science and later law in Munich. In 1967 he passed the state law exam and then worked at the University of Regensburg in criminal law and Eastern European law. He became a doctor of jurisprudence, and then in 1971 passed the second state examination.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1978 Stoiber was elected secretary general of the CSU, which he stayed until 1982/83. From 1982 to 1986 he was a representative to the Bavarian secretary of the state and then a minister of state from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1993 he was the Bavarian Minister of the Interior and in May 1993, the Bavarian \"Landtag\" (parliament) elected him as minister-president. As such he served as President of the \"Bundesrat\" in 1995/96. In 1998, he was made leader of the CSU.\nRunning for Chancellor.\nIn 2002, Stoiber removed the leader of the CDU, Angela Merkel, and was made the joint CDU/CSU's candidate for the office of chancellor, with Gerhard Schr\u00F6der (SPD) as opponent.\nBefore the 2002 election, the CSU/CDU was on top of the opinion polls and Stoiber said that \"...this election is like a football match where it's the second half and my team is ahead by 2-0\", a quote that has become famous. However, on election day things had changed. The SPD had a huge comeback and the CDU/CSU got less votes. Both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, but the SPD was ahead by 6,000 votes. Gerhard Schr\u00F6der was elected again as chancellor by the parliament. He joined together with the Green party. Many people think it was Stoiber's reaction to the floods in eastern Germany, shortly before the election, that made his party lose the vote. Also, Schr\u00F6der made clear that he was against the Iraq war led by the United States. He made the war the main topic in his campaign, which was seen by many people as the changing factor in the weeks before the election.\nOutside politics.\nStoiber is a great football fan and he supports the FC Bayern Munich. Before the 2002 election FC Bayern's manager Uli Hoene\u00DF said he supported Stoiber and the CSU. Football legend, FC Bayern President and Vice-President of the German Football Association, Franz Beckenbauer, on the other hand, showed his support for Stoiber by letting him join the German national football team on their flight home from Japan after the 2002 FIFA World Cup.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":24},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"\u02C8\u025Btm\u028Ant \u02C8\u0283t\u0254\u028Fb\u0250","offset":46},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":93},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politician","offset":100},{"uri":"Minister-President","surface_form":"Minister-President","offset":130},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"state","offset":156},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":165},{"uri":"Christian_Social_Union_of_Bavaria","surface_form":"Christian Social Union party (CSU)","offset":195},{"uri":"Rosenheim_Rural_District","surface_form":"Rosenheim","offset":453},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":515},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":544},{"uri":"Regensburg","surface_form":"Regensburg","offset":583},{"uri":"Grandchild","surface_form":"grandchild","offset":718},{"uri":"Rosenheim","surface_form":"Rosenheim","offset":870},{"uri":"Abitur","surface_form":"Abitur","offset":903},{"uri":"Infantry","surface_form":"infantry","offset":982},{"uri":"Political_science","surface_form":"political science","offset":1087},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1115},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":1122},{"uri":"Regensburg","surface_form":"Regensburg","offset":1204},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":1235},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctor","offset":1269},{"uri":"Bundesrat_of_Germany","surface_form":"\"Bundesrat\"","offset":1773},{"uri":"Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany","surface_form":"CDU","offset":1904},{"uri":"Angela_Merkel","surface_form":"Angela Merkel","offset":1909},{"uri":"Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der","surface_form":"Gerhard Schr\u00F6der","offset":2002},{"uri":"Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"SPD","offset":2020},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":2158},{"uri":"Quote","surface_form":"quote","offset":2232},{"uri":"Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"SPD","offset":2311},{"uri":"Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der","surface_form":"Gerhard Schr\u00F6der","offset":2453},{"uri":"Alliance_%2790/The_Greens","surface_form":"Green party","offset":2549},{"uri":"Iraq_war","surface_form":"Iraq war","offset":2754},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2774},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":2961},{"uri":"FC_Bayern_Munich","surface_form":"FC Bayern Munich","offset":2994},{"uri":"Uli_Hoene%C3%9F","surface_form":"Uli Hoene\u00DF","offset":3057},{"uri":"Christian_Social_Union_of_Bavaria","surface_form":"CSU","offset":3102},{"uri":"Franz_Beckenbauer","surface_form":"Franz Beckenbauer","offset":3199},{"uri":"German_national_football_team","surface_form":"German national football team","offset":3292},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":3348},{"uri":"2002_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2002 FIFA World Cup","offset":3364}]}
