{"id":176405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin","text":"An endorheic basin, also called an internal drainage system, is a drainage basin, or watershed, that does not flow to one of the Earth's major oceans. This is unlike normal basins that collect in rivers and flow to the ocean. Endorheic basins usually end in a saline lake or a salt flat. They can be found in all parts of the world, but usually in desert locations.\nAntarctica.\nEndorheic lakes in Antarctica are located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land, Antarctica, the largest ice-free area in Antarctica.\nNorth and Central America.\nMany small lakes and ponds in North Dakota and Manitoba are endorheic; some of them have salt encrustations along their shores.\nEurope.\nAll these lakes are drained, however, either through manmade canals or via karstic phenomena.\nMinor additional endorheic lakes exist throughout the Mediterranean countries Spain (e.g. Laguna de Gallocanta), Italy, Cyprus (Larnaca and Akrotiri salt lakes) and Greece.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Basin_(geology)","surface_form":"basin","offset":75},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":85},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":143},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":196},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":267},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":348},{"uri":"McMurdo_Dry_Valleys","surface_form":"McMurdo Dry Valleys","offset":427},{"uri":"Victoria_Land","surface_form":"Victoria Land","offset":448},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":463},{"uri":"North_Dakota","surface_form":"North Dakota","offset":573},{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":590},{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canal","offset":740},{"uri":"Karstic","surface_form":"karstic","offset":754},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":851},{"uri":"Laguna_de_Gallocanta","surface_form":"Laguna de Gallocanta","offset":863},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":886},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":893},{"uri":"Larnaca_Salt_Lake","surface_form":"Larnaca","offset":901},{"uri":"Limassol_Salt_Lake","surface_form":"Akrotiri","offset":913},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":938}]}
