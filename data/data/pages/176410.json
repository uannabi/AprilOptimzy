{"id":176410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake","text":"The Great Salt Lake is a very large saltwater lake in the United States. It is in the state of Utah. It is an endorheic lake, meaning that the water in it does not flow to the ocean. It is one of the biggest endorheic lakes in the world. The lake is in the Great Basin, a large area of desert terrain covering parts of the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, California, and Arizona. It is many times saltier than the average of the world's oceans.\nThe lake is about long and wide. Its surface area averages, but because of its desert location, its size changes very often. The three major rivers that flow into it are the Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers. Because of its similarity to the Dead Sea in Asia, it has been called \"America's Dead Sea\". However, the lake is a rich habitat for many species of birds, shrimp, and other animals.\nThe lakeshore borders Davis, Tooele, Box Elder, Salt Lake, and Weber counties, all in the state of Utah.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saltwater","surface_form":"saltwater","offset":36},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":46},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":58},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":95},{"uri":"Endorheic_basin","surface_form":"endorheic","offset":110},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":176},{"uri":"Great_Basin","surface_form":"Great Basin","offset":257},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":286},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":333},{"uri":"Idaho","surface_form":"Idaho","offset":347},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":354},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":370},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":523},{"uri":"Jordan_River_(Utah)","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":618},{"uri":"Weber_River","surface_form":"Weber","offset":626},{"uri":"Bear_River_(Utah)","surface_form":"Bear","offset":637},{"uri":"Dead_Sea","surface_form":"Dead Sea","offset":683},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":770},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":798},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":805},{"uri":"Davis_County","surface_form":"Davis","offset":854},{"uri":"Tooele_County","surface_form":"Tooele","offset":861},{"uri":"Box_Elder_County","surface_form":"Box Elder","offset":869},{"uri":"Salt_Lake_County","surface_form":"Salt Lake","offset":880},{"uri":"Weber_County","surface_form":"Weber","offset":895}]}
