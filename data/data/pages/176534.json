{"id":176534,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave","text":"Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime which are created whenever objects with mass move. They were predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. They were first directly detected on 14 September 2015.\nTo make gravity waves strong enough to be detected, something very massive must accelerate very fast. Sources of detectable gravitational waves include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.\nGravity and relativity.\nIn physics, gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that travel outward from the source. Albert Einstein predicted them in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. In theory, gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation.\nIn general relativity, gravitational waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light. They do not exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, in which physical interactions propagate at infinite speed. However, the detection of gravitational waves proves the last prediction of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\nIn 1993, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary star system that suggests gravitational waves are more than mathematical anomalies.\nCollision of neutron stars.\nGravitational waves have been detected from the collision and merging of two neutron stars. The first detection was on 17 August 2017 by a team in Pasadena, California.\nThe project is run by the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech. The detector is in the huge Livingston woodland in Louisiana. The detector is two two and a half mile (~4 km) long completely straight pipelines at right angles. Inside each pipe is a laser which measures any change in length. Once the gravity wave event was detected, telescopes searched for visual images of the cause. The VISTA telescope in Chile got the image.\nThe merging happened in a galaxy called NGC 4993. This is about 40 mega parsecs or 130 mega light years away in the direction of the Constellation Hydra. By comparison, the nearby Andromeda Galaxy is only 2.5 million light years from Earth.\nSuch events, as well as supernova<nowiki/>s, are the sources of heavier elements such as gold and platinum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":85},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":119},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":173},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":401},{"uri":"White_dwarf","surface_form":"white dwarf","offset":433},{"uri":"Neutron_star","surface_form":"neutron star","offset":447},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":465},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":505},{"uri":"Curvature","surface_form":"curvature","offset":553},{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":566},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":613},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":682},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":851},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":1115},{"uri":"Hulse-Taylor","surface_form":"Hulse-Taylor","offset":1174},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":1187},{"uri":"Neutron_star","surface_form":"neutron star","offset":1383},{"uri":"Pasadena%2C_California","surface_form":"Pasadena, California","offset":1453},{"uri":"LIGO","surface_form":"LIGO","offset":1501},{"uri":"Caltech","surface_form":"Caltech","offset":1520},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":1580},{"uri":"Pipeline","surface_form":"pipeline","offset":1664},{"uri":"Right_angles","surface_form":"right angles","offset":1677},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":1920},{"uri":"NGC_4993","surface_form":"NGC 4993","offset":1934},{"uri":"Parsecs","surface_form":"parsecs","offset":1966},{"uri":"Light_years","surface_form":"light years","offset":1986},{"uri":"Hydra_(constellation)","surface_form":"Constellation Hydra","offset":2027},{"uri":"Andromeda_Galaxy","surface_form":"Andromeda Galaxy","offset":2074},{"uri":"Supernova","surface_form":"supernova","offset":2159},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"elements","offset":2207},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":2224},{"uri":"Platinum","surface_form":"platinum","offset":2233}]}
