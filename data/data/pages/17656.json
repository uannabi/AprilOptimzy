It is named after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, but it was used in China 3 centuries before his time.\nPascal's triangle can be made as follows. On the first row, write only the number 1. Then, to get the numbers of following rows, add the number that can be seen above and to the left (if any) and the number above and to the right (if any) to find the new value. For example, the numbers 1 and 3 in the fourth row are added to make 4 in the fifth row.\nUses of Pascal triangle.\nThe triangle has many uses in probability. It can also be used in binomial expansions. For example,\nNotice the coefficients are the third row of Pascal's triangle: 1,\u00A02,\u00A01.\nwhere the coefficients \"a'i\" in this expansion are precisely the numbers on row \"n\"\u00A0+\u00A01 of Pascal's triangle; in other words,\nPascal's rule.\nFormally speaking, the way of making the Pascal's Triangle uses Pascal's rule, which states that\nfor non-negative integers \"n\" and \"k\" where \"n\" \u2265 \"k\" and with the initial condition\nComplicated structures based on Pascal's triangle.\nPascal's triangle generalizes readily into higher dimensions. The three-dimensional version is called Pascal's pyramid or \"Pascal's tetrahedron\". A higher-dimensional analogue is generically called a \"Pascal's simplex\"*. See also pyramid, tetrahedron, and simplex.\nProperties of Pascal's Triangle.\nThe first and last number in each row is always 1.\nThe second number in each row is the row number. In a binomial expansion, this second number is equal to the power. (This makes the 'first' row, 1, actually the zero row).\nThe rows always read the same forward and backward.\nThe sum of the numbers in each row is double the sum of the numbers in the row before. The sum of each row is 2\"n\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangular","offset":90},{"uri":"Array","surface_form":"array","offset":101},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":126},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":133},{"uri":"Blaise_Pascal","surface_form":"Blaise Pascal","offset":147},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":181},{"uri":"Row","surface_form":"row","offset":271},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":291},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":622},{"uri":"Binomial_expansion","surface_form":"binomial expansion","offset":658},{"uri":"Formally","surface_form":"Formally","offset":906},{"uri":"Pascal%27s_rule","surface_form":"Pascal's rule","offset":970},{"uri":"General","surface_form":"generalizes","offset":1157},{"uri":"Dimension","surface_form":"dimension","offset":1189},{"uri":"Pascal%27s_pyramid","surface_form":"Pascal's pyramid","offset":1241},{"uri":"Pascal%27s_simplex","surface_form":"Pascal's simplex","offset":1340},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":1369},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedron","offset":1378},{"uri":"Simplex","surface_form":"simplex","offset":1395}]}
