{"id":176843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_the_Young_King","text":"Henry the Young King (28 February 1155 \u2013 near Limoges, France, 11 June 1183) was the junior king to his father Henry II of England. He was crowned king in 1170, but never actually used the power. The meaning of this is that Henry II's territory covered much of northern France as well as England and Ireland. The idea may have been to have an official deputy for legal actions when Henry was in France, and to indicate the succession to the throne. In practice, Young Henry was not interested in government. According to his tutor, William Marshal, he spent his time in France going from one knights' tournament to another.\nThe boy was married as a child to Marguerite of France (1158\u20131197), daughter of the French King Louis VII. The intention was political, but it did not work. War came between Henry II and Louis. Henry joined in rebellions directed at his father. A civil war (1173/74) occurred in which Young Henry and his mother, with Scots and French support, fought against Henry II. The king won, just. Young Henry died ten years later, of dysentery. As he died before his father he never achieved power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Limoges","surface_form":"Limoges","offset":46},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":55},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":92},{"uri":"Henry_II_of_England","surface_form":"Henry II of England","offset":111},{"uri":"Throne","surface_form":"throne","offset":441},{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":601},{"uri":"Marguerite_of_France","surface_form":"Marguerite of France","offset":658},{"uri":"Louis_VII_of_France","surface_form":"Louis VII","offset":720},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"civil war","offset":871},{"uri":"Dysentery","surface_form":"dysentery","offset":1050}]}
