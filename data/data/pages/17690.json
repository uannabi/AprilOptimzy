{"id":17690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations","text":"Maxwell's equations describe how electric charges and electric currents create electric and magnetic fields. They describe how an electric field can generate a magnetic field, and vice versa.\nIn the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell published equations that describe how charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic force per unit charge. The force per unit charge is called a field. The particles could be stationary or moving. These, and the Lorentz force equation, give everything one needs to calculate the motion of classical particles in electric and magnetic fields.\nThe first equation allows one to calculate the electric field created by a charge. The second allows one to calculate the magnetic field. The other two describe how fields 'circulate' around their sources. Magnetic fields 'circulate' around electric currents and time varying electric fields: Amp\u00E8re's law with Maxwell's extension, while electric fields 'circulate' around time varying magnetic fields: Faraday's law.\nCharge density and the electric field.\nwhere formula_1 is the \"free\" electric charge density (in units of C/m3), not counting the dipole charges bound in a material, and formula_1 is the electric displacement field (in units of C/m2). This equation is like Coulomb's law for non-moving charges in vacuum.\nformula_1 is the area of a differential square on the closed surface A. The surface normal pointing out is the direction, and formula_1 is the free charge that is inside the surface.\nYou can pretend a material is linear, if the electric field is not very strong.\nHere formula_1 is the electric field again (in units of V/m), formula_1 is the total charge density (including the bound charges), and formula_1 (approximately 8.854 pF/m) is the permittivity of free space. One can also write formula_1 as formula_1. Here, formula_1 is the permittivity of the material when compared to the permittivity of free space. This is called the relative permittivity or \"dielectric constant\".\nSee also Poisson's equation.\nThe structure of the magnetic field.\nformula_1 is the magnetic flux density (in units of tesla, T), also called the magnetic induction.\nThe area of formula_1 is the area of a differential square on the surface formula_1. The direction of formula_1 is the surface normal pointing outwards on the surface of formula_1.\nThis equation only works if the integral is done over a closed surface.\nThis equation says, that in every volume the sum of the magnetic field lines that go in equals the sum of the magnetical field lines that go out. This means that the magnetic field lines must be closed loops. Another way of saying this is that the field lines cannot start from somewhere.\nThis is the mathematical way of saying: \"There are no magnetic monopoles\".\nA changing magnetic flux and the electric field.\nHere formula_1\n\u03A6B is the magnetic flux that goes through the area A that the second equation describes,\nE is the electric field that the magnetic flux causes,\ns is a closed path in which current is induced, for example a wire,\nv is the instantaneous velocity of the line element (for moving circuits).\nThe electromotive force is equal to the value of this integral. Sometimes this symbol is used for the electromotive force: formula_1, do not confuse it with the symbol for permittivity that was used before.\nThis law is like Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\nSome textbooks show the right hand sign of the integral form with an \"N\" (N is the number of coils of wire that are around the edge of \"A\") in front of the flux derivative. The \"N\" can be taken care of in calculating \"A\" (multiple wire coils means multiple surfaces for the flux to go through), and it is an engineering detail so it's left out here.\nThe negative sign is needed for conservation of energy. It is so important that it even has its own name, Lenz's law.\nThis equation shows how the electric and magnetic fields have to do with each other. For example, this equation explains how electric motors and electric generators work. In a motor or generator, the field circuit has a fixed electric field that causes a magnetic field. This is called fixed excitation. The varying voltage is measured across the armature circuit.\nMaxwell's equations are used in a right-handed coordinate system. To use them in a left-handed system, without having to change the equations, the polarity of magnetic fields has to be made opposite (this is not wrong, but it is confusing because it is not usually done like this).\nThe source of the magnetic field.\nv is a vector field called the drift velocity. It describes the speeds of the charge carriers that have a density described by the scalar function \u03C1q.\n\"s\" is the edge of the open surface \"A\" (any surface with the curve \"s\" as its edge is okay here), and \"I\"encircled is the current encircled by the curve \"s\" (the current through any surface is defined by the equation: \"I\"through \"A\" = \u222B\"AJ\u00B7dA'\").\"\nIf the electric flux density does not change very fast, the second term on the right hand side (the displacement flux) is very small and can be left out, and then the equation is the same as Ampere's law.\nCovariant Formulation.\nThere are only two covariant Maxwell Equations, because the covariant field vector includes the electrical and the magnetical field.\n\"Mathematical note: In this section the abstract index notation will be used.\"\nHere formula_1 is the 4-current, formula_1 is the field strength tensor (written as a 4 \u00D7 4 matrix), formula_1 is the Levi-Civita symbol, and formula_1 is the 4-gradient (so that formula_1 is the d'Alembertian operator). (The formula_1 in the first equation is implicitly summed over, according to Einstein notation.) The first tensor equation says the same thing as the two inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations: Gauss' law and Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction. The second equation say the same thing as the other two equations, the homogeneous equations: Faraday's law of induction and the absence of magnetic monopoles.\nformula_1\nThe fact that both electric and magnetic fields are combined into a single tensor shows the fact that, according to relativity, both of these are different parts of the same thing\u2014by changing frames of reference, what looks like an electric field in one frame can look like a magnetic field in another frame, and the other way around.\nUsing the tensor form of Maxwell's equations, the first equation implies\nformula_1\n(See Electromagnetic four-potential for the relationship between the d'Alembertian of the four-potential and the four-current, expressed in terms of the older vector operator notation).\nDifferent authors sometimes use different sign conventions for these tensors and 4-vectors (but this does not change what they mean).\nformula_1 and formula_1 are \"not\" the same: they are related by the Minkowski metric tensor formula_1: formula_1. This changes the sign of some of \"Fs components; more complex metric dualities can be seen in general relativity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"electric charge","offset":33},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":54},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":160},{"uri":"James_Clerk_Maxwell","surface_form":"James Clerk Maxwell","offset":205},{"uri":"Electric","surface_form":"electric","offset":294},{"uri":"Magnetic_force","surface_form":"magnetic force","offset":307},{"uri":"Field_(physics)","surface_form":"field","offset":377},{"uri":"Lorentz_force","surface_form":"Lorentz force equation","offset":444},{"uri":"Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law","surface_form":"Amp\u00E8re's law with Maxwell's extension","offset":867},{"uri":"Faraday%27s_law_of_induction","surface_form":"Faraday's law","offset":977},{"uri":"Electric_displacement_field","surface_form":"electric displacement field","offset":1179},{"uri":"Coulomb%27s_law","surface_form":"Coulomb's law","offset":1249},{"uri":"Dielectric_constant","surface_form":"dielectric constant","offset":1956},{"uri":"Poisson%27s_equation","surface_form":"Poisson's equation","offset":1987},{"uri":"Magnetic_monopole","surface_form":"magnetic monopole","offset":2739},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"electromotive force","offset":3115},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"electromotive force","offset":3213},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_induction","surface_form":"electromagnetic induction","offset":3352},{"uri":"Lenz%27s_law","surface_form":"Lenz's law","offset":3835},{"uri":"Electric_motor","surface_form":"electric motor","offset":3972},{"uri":"Electric_generator","surface_form":"electric generator","offset":3992},{"uri":"Field_(physics)","surface_form":"field","offset":4047},{"uri":"Armature_(electrical_engineering)","surface_form":"armature","offset":4194},{"uri":"Electric_flux_density","surface_form":"electric flux density","offset":4935},{"uri":"Amp%C3%A8re%27s_law","surface_form":"Ampere's law","offset":5119},{"uri":"Abstract_index_notation","surface_form":"abstract index notation","offset":5329},{"uri":"4-current","surface_form":"4-current","offset":5390},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_tensor","surface_form":"field strength tensor","offset":5418},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrix","offset":5460},{"uri":"Levi-Civita_symbol","surface_form":"Levi-Civita symbol","offset":5486},{"uri":"D%27Alembertian","surface_form":"d'Alembertian","offset":5564},{"uri":"Einstein_notation","surface_form":"Einstein notation","offset":5666},{"uri":"Magnetic_monopole","surface_form":"magnetic monopole","offset":5973},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_four-potential","surface_form":"Electromagnetic four-potential","offset":6426},{"uri":"Minkowski_metric","surface_form":"Minkowski metric","offset":6809},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":6949}]}
