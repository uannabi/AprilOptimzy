It is located 9 miles (14 km) east of the Welsh border and serves as the commercial centre for Shropshire and mid-Wales.\nThe town is very old. It was started around 700 AD. The town centre has almost the exact same medieval street plan and over 660 listed buildings. Many of these buildings have timber framing from the 15th and 16th centuries. There is also Shrewsbury Castle, which was built in 1074, and Shrewsbury Abbey, which was built in 1083. The town centre is almost completely surrounded by the River Severn.\nCharles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury and lived there for 27 years.\nThe population of Shrewsbury is just over 71,000, making it the second largest town in Shropshire, the biggest being Telford.\nThe town has a railway station and a professional football club, Shrewsbury Town, who compete in League One.\nIn fiction.\nShrewsbury Abbey is the setting of the Brother Cadfael Chronicles by Ellis Peters (Edith Pargeter). The books were later made into a television show. The story is about a 12th-century monk who solves mysteries. In 2013, the Abbey honoured Pargeter on the 100th anniversary of her birth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":33},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":47},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":57},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":108},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":161},{"uri":"Mid-Wales","surface_form":"mid-Wales","offset":176},{"uri":"700","surface_form":"700 AD","offset":231},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":281},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_Castle","surface_form":"Shrewsbury Castle","offset":425},{"uri":"1074","surface_form":"1074","offset":463},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_Abbey","surface_form":"Shrewsbury Abbey","offset":473},{"uri":"1083","surface_form":"1083","offset":510},{"uri":"Town_centre","surface_form":"town centre","offset":520},{"uri":"River_Severn","surface_form":"River Severn","offset":571},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":585},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":657},{"uri":"Telford","surface_form":"Telford","offset":770},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":794},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":829},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_Town_F.C.","surface_form":"Shrewsbury Town","offset":844},{"uri":"Football_League_One","surface_form":"League One","offset":876}]}
