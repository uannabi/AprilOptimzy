{"id":177267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tujunga_Wash","text":"e=\"preserve\">Tujunga Wash is a stream in Los Angeles County, California. Its watershed covers 225 square miles (580 square kilometers) from the San Gabriel Mountains to the flat floor of the Los Angeles Basin. Tujunga Wash is a major tributary to the Los Angeles River, providing about a fifth of its flow.\nThe wash begins in two forks, Big Tujunga Creek and Little Tujunga Creek. Big Tujunga Creek begins in the San Gabriel Mountains. It flows west to a reservoir called Big Tujunga Reservoir, formed by a dam at its west shore. After exiting the dam, the creek is known as \"Big Tujunga Wash\". Little Tujunga Creek flows south from a portion of the San Gabriel Mountains north of the Hansen Reservoir. The combined waters then head into the Hansen Reservoir. Downstream, the Tujunga Wash flows south and halfway to the Los Angeles River, is met by the Pacoima Wash. Tujunga Wash meets the Los Angeles River near Studio City, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Los_Angeles_County","surface_form":"Los Angeles County","offset":41},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":61},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":77},{"uri":"San_Gabriel","surface_form":"San Gabriel","offset":144},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Basin","surface_form":"Los Angeles Basin","offset":191},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":234},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_River","surface_form":"Los Angeles River","offset":251},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":455},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":507},{"uri":"Hansen_Reservoir","surface_form":"Hansen Reservoir","offset":685},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_River","surface_form":"Los Angeles River","offset":890},{"uri":"Studio_City%2C_California","surface_form":"Studio City, California","offset":913}]}
