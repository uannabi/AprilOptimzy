{"id":177313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning","text":"Classical conditioning (also Pavlovian conditioning) is a form of associative learning.\nIvan Pavlov was the first to show in what way it works. He did this in 1927, using dogs. There is one stimulus which is called \"neutral\", and there is another, which has some meaning. If the two stimuli are often presented together, the organism \"learns\" that they belong together. As a result, it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get what Pavlov referred this learned relationships to as a \"conditional reflex\", or to what is today called a conditioned reflex or response....\nPavlov did the experiment with dogs. Each time before he fed the dogs, he rang a bell. The dogs then learned that when the bell rang they would be fed. So they started to salivate, when they heard the bell ring, even before they saw or smelled the food.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Associative_learning","surface_form":"associative learning","offset":66},{"uri":"Ivan_Pavlov","surface_form":"Ivan Pavlov","offset":88},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":171},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimulus","offset":190},{"uri":"Bell","surface_form":"bell","offset":655},{"uri":"Saliva","surface_form":"saliva","offset":745}]}
