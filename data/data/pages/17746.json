{"id":17746,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club","text":"\"Fight Club\" is a 1999 American drama movie. It stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter. The movie was directed by David Fincher. It is based on a novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk.\nThe story is about an unnamed character's path during a dark form of personal enlightenment (or eternal happiness) which is achieved primarily through fighting. The story is dark and, in both the book and the movie, contains strong depictions of violence. There are a large number of metaphors which are revealed in its complex and twisted storyline. Some would think that the morals and life guidelines taught in the story would be an extreme form of Buddhism, such as the idea of detachment from material possessions (things). The central character has dissociative identity disorder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama movie","offset":32},{"uri":"Edward_Norton","surface_form":"Edward Norton","offset":54},{"uri":"Brad_Pitt","surface_form":"Brad Pitt","offset":69},{"uri":"Helena_Bonham_Carter","surface_form":"Helena Bonham Carter","offset":84},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":120},{"uri":"David_Fincher","surface_form":"David Fincher","offset":132},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":164},{"uri":"Fight_Club_(book)","surface_form":"same name","offset":177},{"uri":"Chuck_Palahniuk","surface_form":"Chuck Palahniuk","offset":190},{"uri":"The_Narrator_(Fight_Club)","surface_form":"character","offset":237},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":491},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":659},{"uri":"Protagonist","surface_form":"central character","offset":740},{"uri":"Dissociative_identity_disorder","surface_form":"dissociative identity disorder","offset":762}]}
