{"id":17747,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops","text":"\"Top of the Pops\" is a British music show, which featured popular artists performing their songs. It started in 1964 and ended in 2006 because not enough people were watching it any more. It was hosted by many presenters over the years, most notably by Sir Jimmy Savile, who opened the very first show on New Year's Day 1964 on BBC1.\nTOTP2 (Top of the Pops 2) is a variant of the show. However, it featured a collection of archive performances by artists spanning the past four decades.\nThe show was regularly hosted by Steve Wright, up until 2009, when Mark Radcliffe replaced him. A new episode of the programme is shown on 25 December each year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":23},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":31},{"uri":"Popular","surface_form":"popular","offset":58},{"uri":"Musical_artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":66},{"uri":"Performing","surface_form":"performing","offset":74},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":91},{"uri":"Jimmy_Savile","surface_form":"Jimmy Savile","offset":257},{"uri":"Archive","surface_form":"archive","offset":423},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decade","offset":478},{"uri":"Steve_Wright","surface_form":"Steve Wright","offset":520},{"uri":"Mark_Radcliffe","surface_form":"Mark Radcliffe","offset":554},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":589}]}
