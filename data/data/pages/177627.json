Students between senior kindergarten and grade twelve study under the International Baccalaureate program.\nFounded in 1829, UCC is the oldest independent school in the province of Ontario, and the third oldest in the country. It is described as a prestigious preparatory school in Canada, having many of Canada's prominent graduates. Modelled on the British public school system, throughout the first part of its history the college both influenced and was influenced by government. It has maintained a good reputation from its founding.\nToday, UCC is fully independent and the students and faculty are more diverse in terms of cultural and economic backgrounds. A link to the Royal Family is maintained through Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who is the college's Official Visitor, and a member of the Board of Governors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":57},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":81},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"Student","offset":98},{"uri":"Kindergarten","surface_form":"kindergarten","offset":122},{"uri":"International_Baccalaureate","surface_form":"International Baccalaureate","offset":168},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":240},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":266},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":278},{"uri":"Preparatory_school","surface_form":"preparatory school","offset":357},{"uri":"Graduate","surface_form":"graduate","offset":421},{"uri":"Public_school","surface_form":"public school","offset":456},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":569},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":606},{"uri":"Faculty","surface_form":"faculty","offset":689},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":726},{"uri":"British_Royal_Family","surface_form":"Royal Family","offset":775},{"uri":"Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","offset":810}]}
