{"id":177632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Forces","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Canadian Forces (CF) (French: Forces canadiennes; FC), is the army, air force, and navy of Canada, commanded by a single structure, unlike the United States.\nUnder the National Defence Act, \"The Canadian Forces are the armed forces of Her Majesty raised by Canada and consist of one Service called the Canadian Armed Forces.\" The Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces is the Head of State of Canada, Queen Elizabeth II, represented by the Governor General of Canada, David Lloyd Johnston. The Chief of the Defence Staff (or CDS), the senior professional member of the service, is General Thomas J. Lawson. The CDS answers to a politician, the Minister of National Defence, who is currently Robert Nicholson of the Conservative Party.\nStructure.\nThe Canadian Forces is composed of 67,000 personnel (soldiers, sailors, and airmen/airwomen). Every unit accepts male and female soldiers, if they qualify for the position. The CF is divided in seven main branches, which are called \"commands\".\nMain Branches.\nThe Environmental branches (called Commands) are mainly administrative structures. They manage the personnel, the equipment and the facilities, but not the operations. There are three commands in the Canadian Forces, because there are no Marines. All the commands work very closely with each other, for example, the Air Force provides helicopters to both the Navy and the Army. These commands also each have a reserve element, made of part-time employees.\nLand Force Command (LFCOM).\nThis is the army of Canada and the largest branch of the CF. It uses tanks and other armoured vehicles, such as the LAV III, as well as artillery, engineering vehicles, and a variety of weapons, such as the Colt Canada C7 rifle.\nMaritime Command (MARCOM).\nThis is the navy of Canada. It has 33 active warships including submarines, frigates and destroyers.\nAir Command (AIRCOM).\nAIRCOM is the air force of Canada. It operates a variety of helicopters and airplanes to support the army and the navy, and also has CF-18 fighters.\nOperational Branches.\nThe Operational commands are responsible for specific types of operations or for conducting exercises or deployments. There are four operational commands.\nSpecial Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM).\nThe CANSOFCOM is responsible for providing special forces and asymmetric warfare capabilities to Canada. It is the smallest command of the Canadian Forces, and is composed of four joint units that do not answer to either the Army, Navy or Air Force. These units are the Joint Task Force 2, the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, the 427th Special Aviation Squadron and the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit (CBRN).\nExpeditionary Force Command (CEFCOM).\nThis is the command responsible for managing foreign operations and deployments outside of Canada, such as Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan.\nCanada Command (CANCOM).\nCanada Command works with the United States Northern Command to ensure national security and the defence of the North American continent. CANCOM also is responsible for emergency management, such as when the Army is needed to respond to disasters in Canada.\nOperational Support Command (CANOSCOM).\nThis command is responsible for supporting all the other commands with things such as logistics, engineering, health services, and the military police.\nDefence Policy.\nDuring the Cold War, a major focus of the Canadian Forces was helping with the defence of Europe against the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Some Canadian soldiers lived in Europe during that time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":39},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":79},{"uri":"Air_force","surface_form":"air force","offset":85},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"navy","offset":100},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":108},{"uri":"National_Defence_Act","surface_form":"National Defence Act","offset":185},{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":236},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Her Majesty","offset":252},{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":421},{"uri":"Governor_General_of_Canada","surface_form":"Governor General of Canada","offset":460},{"uri":"David_Lloyd_Johnston","surface_form":"David Lloyd Johnston","offset":488},{"uri":"Thomas_J._Lawson","surface_form":"Thomas J.
