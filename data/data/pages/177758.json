{"id":177758,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acryl","text":"Acryl is a name for a number of chemical compounds that have an acrylic group, or of polymers of these compounds. Especially esters of acrylic acid are used to help make certain dyes and paints or as adhesives.\nIn organic chemistry, the acryloyl group is the functional group with structure H2C=CH\u2013C(=O)\u2013; it is the acyl group derived from acrylic acid. The preferred IUPAC name for the group is prop-2-enoyl. It is also (less correctly) known as acrylyl or simply acryl. Compounds containing an acryloyl group can be referred to as \"acrylic compounds\".\nIn addition, since both double bonds are separated by a single C\u2013C bond, the double bonds are conjugated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":32},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":85},{"uri":"Ester","surface_form":"ester","offset":125},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":178},{"uri":"Paint","surface_form":"paint","offset":187},{"uri":"Adhesive","surface_form":"adhesive","offset":200},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":214},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"functional group","offset":259},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"H","offset":291},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"C","offset":293},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"O","offset":301},{"uri":"Acyl","surface_form":"acyl","offset":316},{"uri":"IUPAC","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":368},{"uri":"Conjugated_system","surface_form":"conjugated","offset":648}]}
