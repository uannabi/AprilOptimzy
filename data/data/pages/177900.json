{"id":177900,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology","text":"Vexillology is the study of flags. The word comes from both the Latin word \"vexilla\" \"little sail\" for flag plus the Greek suffix\"-ology\" that means \"study of\". The \"vexillum\" was a particular kind of flag used by the Roman legions. Vexillology is a kind of study of symbols related to heraldry. A person who studies flags is a \"vexillologist\", and a person who designs flags is a \"vexillographer\".\nBecause they are flown outside, where they move with the wind, flags are usually designed with bold images and bright, basic colors. Flag design also follows a historical process, where later flag designs are based on earlier flag designs. This means that many flags in an area may look similar because they are all based on one historical flag. Examples include the Pan-African colors, Pan-Arab colors, and the Nordic Cross.\nFlag Identification System (FIS).\nThe \"Flag Identification System\" was created by Whitney Smith and adopted by F\u00E9d\u00E9ration internationale des associations vexillologiques (FIAV).\nThe first row is for use on land and the second row is for use on water, each divided into private (civil), government (state), and military (war) use.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":28},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":64},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":117},{"uri":"Roman_legion","surface_form":"Roman legion","offset":218},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":267},{"uri":"Heraldry","surface_form":"heraldry","offset":286},{"uri":"Pan-African_colors","surface_form":"Pan-African colors","offset":766},{"uri":"Pan-Arab_colors","surface_form":"Pan-Arab colors","offset":786},{"uri":"Nordic_Cross","surface_form":"Nordic Cross","offset":811},{"uri":"Whitney_Smith","surface_form":"Whitney Smith","offset":907}]}
