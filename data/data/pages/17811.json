{"id":17811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Friction is a force that acts to stop the movement of two touching things. The energy lost to friction is turned into sound and heat. Two kinds of friction are static and kinetic. Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects. Kinetic friction is used when the frictional force is not strong enough to stop all motion. An effect of kinetic friction is heat production.\nMany everyday mechanisms that utilize friction include car brakes, suitcases, and shoes. Even a person sliding across the floor uses a form of friction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":27}]}
