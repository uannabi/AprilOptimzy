They were carried out by British Muslim extremists.\nAt 08:50, three bombs exploded within fifty seconds of each other on three London Underground trains. A fourth exploded an hour later at 09:47 on a bus in Tavistock Square. The explosions were caused by home-made bombs. The bombs were packed into rucksacks and set off by the bombers themselves.\nA memorial was made in Hyde Park, London on the 7 July 2009. This had 52 stainless steel pillars, one for each murder victim. They were arranged in four clusters for the four bomb sites.\n52 died and over 700 were injured in the attack.\nAfter this attack there was a police reform in the UK. Many police in London are authorised to carry firearms. London is always on high alert for terrorism.
