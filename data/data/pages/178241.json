{"id":178241,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minbar","text":"A minbar (also called mimbar sometimes,) is a special place in a mosque. It is used by the Imam to speak to the congregation, to deliver sermons. Usually, minbars are raised (to be higher than the crowd, much like pulpits); These sermons are usually called \"khutbah\" (\u062E\u0637\u0628\u0647). In a minbar, the speaker is standing while he is giving the lecture. An alternative to this is to have a Hussainia where the speaker can sit down while giving the lecture.\nVery often, the minbar is shaped like a small tower. The minbar is located to the right of the mihrab, the niche that indicates the direction of prayer (i.e. towards Mecca).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":65},{"uri":"Imam","surface_form":"Imam","offset":91},{"uri":"Sermon","surface_form":"sermon","offset":137},{"uri":"Pulpit","surface_form":"pulpit","offset":214},{"uri":"Khutbah","surface_form":"khutbah","offset":258},{"uri":"Hussainia","surface_form":"Hussainia","offset":380},{"uri":"Mihrab","surface_form":"mihrab","offset":542},{"uri":"Mecca","surface_form":"Mecca","offset":613}]}
