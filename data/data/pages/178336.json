{"id":178336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_Norse_group_of_satellites","text":"The Norse group is a collection of moons of the planet Saturn that go around the planet in a different direction to the spin of Saturn. They also go in an odd ellipsis direction instead of a circle.\nThe names of this group come from gods from Norway. However, Phoebe is a Greek god, because it was discovered first.\nSaturn has at least 61 moons, which can be put into ten groups. The Norse group is one of these groups, as is the Inuit group, and the Gallic group.\nList of satellites.\nHere are all the moons in the Norse group. The moons at the top of the list are closer to Saturn than those at the bottom of the list.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_satellite","surface_form":"moons","offset":35},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":55},{"uri":"Ellipsis","surface_form":"ellipsis","offset":159},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"gods from Norway","offset":233},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek god","offset":272},{"uri":"Saturn%27s_Inuit_group_of_satellites","surface_form":"Inuit group","offset":430},{"uri":"Saturn%27s_Gallic_group_of_satellites","surface_form":"Gallic group","offset":451}]}
