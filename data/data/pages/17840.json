After the 16th century, Mongolia were influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. By the end of the 17th century, most of Mongolia was part of an area ruled by the Qing Dynasty. When the Qing Dynasty collapsed in 1911, Mongolia declared independence. But they had to fight against the Chinese. They were helped by the Soviet Union. In 1921, the world accepted its independence. Shortly after the death of Bogd Khaan, the last monarch of Mongolia the monarchy was replaced by a communist government in 1924, and the country was renamed the Mongolian People's Republic.

The Mongolian Red Cross has said that about 4,500,000 livestock died as a result of the bad weather this year [2010]. Tume, who lives in Ulan Bator, said that he had noticed that there were several really harsh winters in a row too.

Most of Mongolia consists of\u00A0steppes, with forested areas comprising 11.2% of the total land area. \u00A0The highest point in Mongolia is the\u00A0Kh\u00FCiten Peak\u00A0in the\u00A0Tavan bogd\u00A0massif, at a height of 4,374\u00A0m (14,350\u00A0ft).\nProvinces.\nMongolia is divided into 21 provinces called \"aimags\".
