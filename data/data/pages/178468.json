They have a long tail and powerful jaws. Their back feet are webbed for swimming. They can grow up to in length and can weigh up to. The males are usually bigger than the females.\nNile crocodiles are also found in Madagascar, sub-Saharan Africa and the Nile Delta. They were also found in Jordan and Israel before. They live in different habitats including lakes, rivers, estuaries, freshwater marshes, and mangrove swamps.\nThe Nile Crocodile is carnivorous, or eats meat. The Nile crocodile eats bigger animals as it gets bigger. Young crocodiles will eat insects and small fish, while adult crocodiles can catch and eat zebras, antelopes, wildebeests and buffalo. The Nile Crocodile will attack anything, even other crocodiles.\nThe crocodiles mate in the water, and then the female lays her eggs in a hole dug in the ground. They can lay 60 eggs which take about 90 days to hatch. One unique thing about the Nile crocodile is that the female will guard the eggs until they hatch. Young crocodiles are able to reproduce when they get to about 12 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":71},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":98},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":320},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":395},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":406},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":444},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuaries","offset":478},{"uri":"Zebra","surface_form":"zebra","offset":728},{"uri":"Antelope","surface_form":"antelope","offset":736},{"uri":"Wildebeest","surface_form":"wildebeest","offset":747},{"uri":"Buffalo","surface_form":"buffalo","offset":763}]}
