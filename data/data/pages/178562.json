{"id":178562,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate","text":"Methylphenidate is a drug which is similar to amphetamine. Its name is often shortened to MPH but is better known by the brand name of Ritalin. MPH stimulates the central nervous system. It does this by increasing dopamine transmission in the brain.\nThe drug is commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. It is sometimes used together with other drugs to treat depression. In most countries, its use needs to be prescribed by a doctor.\nThe most common side-effects of taking the drug are nervousness and sleeping problems. About one in ten patients see these problems. Other side-effects include changes of blood pressure, headache, and weight loss. Some cases of Tourette syndrome and psychosis have been reported, amongst others.\nSometimes, the drug has been prescribed to children without proper ADHD diagnosis to increase their academic performance. This use has been criticised by the media. Using methylphenidate in children may be problematic, because it has been linked with slower growth. The media often use the name Ritalin for all drugs containing methylphenidate, and even for other stimulants used to treat ADHD. Ritalin is one drug containing methylphenidate, which is often used in such cases.\nThis drug can also cause euphoria when it is abused for recreational purposes. Abusing Methylphenidate may lead to psychological addiction and to severe side effects- including, but not limited to: psychosis, cardiac arrest, and death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":21},{"uri":"Amphetamine","surface_form":"amphetamine","offset":46},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":163},{"uri":"Dopamine","surface_form":"dopamine","offset":214},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":243},{"uri":"Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","surface_form":"attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","offset":285},{"uri":"Narcolepsy","surface_form":"narcolepsy","offset":330},{"uri":"Major_depressive_disorder","surface_form":"depression","offset":398},{"uri":"Prescription","surface_form":"prescribed","offset":449},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":465},{"uri":"Side-effect","surface_form":"side-effect","offset":489},{"uri":"Nervousness","surface_form":"nervousness","offset":525},{"uri":"Insomnia","surface_form":"sleeping problems","offset":541},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":644},{"uri":"Headache","surface_form":"headache","offset":660},{"uri":"Weight_loss","surface_form":"weight loss","offset":674},{"uri":"Tourette_syndrome","surface_form":"Tourette syndrome","offset":701},{"uri":"Psychosis","surface_form":"psychosis","offset":723},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":927}]}
