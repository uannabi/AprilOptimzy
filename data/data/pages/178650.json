{"id":178650,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India-Taiwan_relations","text":"The bilateral relations between the Republic of India and Taiwan have improved since the 1990s, India has expanded economic and strategic cooperation with Taiwan.\nOwing to the strategic rivalry, suspicion and tenuous relations between the People's Republic of China and India since the 1962 war, India has slowly sought to develop better commercial and strategic cooperation with Taiwan even while ruling out the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations. Taiwan has also viewed India's rising geopolitical standing as a potential counter-balance to China's dominance in the region. As a part of its \"Look East\" foreign policy, India has sought to cultivate extensive ties with Taiwan in trade as well as working together over weapons of mass destruction issues, environment and fighting terrorism. Both sides have aimed to develop ties to counteract Chinese rivalry with both nations. The India-Taipei Association (ITA) Office has been established in Taipei since 1995 to promote non-governmental interactions between India and Taiwan, and to facilitate business, tourism, cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The India-Taipei Association has also been authorised to provide all consular and passport services. In 2002, India became the 28th nation to sign the Investment Protection Agreement with Taiwan and in 2006, both nations established the Taiwan-India Cooperation Council. Furthermore, Taiwan promotes trade with India as a means to reduce the extent of their economic dependence with China. In 2007, Ma Ying-jeou, the leader of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's largest political party supportive of reunification, and a major candidate in the 2008 presidential elections made an unofficial visit to India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":36},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":58},{"uri":"India_as_an_emerging_superpower","surface_form":"geopolitical standing","offset":501},{"uri":"India%27s_%26quot%3BLook_East%26quot%3B_Policy","surface_form":"Look East","offset":608},{"uri":"Weapons_of_mass_destruction","surface_form":"weapons of mass destruction","offset":734},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":795},{"uri":"Ma_Ying-jeou","surface_form":"Ma Ying-jeou","offset":1521},{"uri":"Kuomintang","surface_form":"Kuomintang","offset":1553}]}
