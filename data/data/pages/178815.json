Blood test show that up to a third of the world population has been or is infected with \"T. gondii\". Infection rates differ greatly from country to country.\nAlthough mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks, infection with \"T. gondii\" generally produces no symptoms in healthy human adults. But in infants, AIDS patients, and others with weakened immunity, infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness (toxoplasmosis).p77\nInfection in humans and other warm-blooded animals can occur\nThe parasite can only sexually reproduce in the intestines of members of the cat family (felids). Felids are therefore the definitive hosts of \"T. gondii\", with all other hosts defined as 'intermediate hosts'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protozoa","surface_form":"protozoa","offset":25},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":35},{"uri":"Warm-blooded","surface_form":"warm-blooded","offset":71},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":84},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":103},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":498},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"weakened immunity","offset":529},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"sexually reproduce","offset":710},{"uri":"Intestine","surface_form":"intestine","offset":736},{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"cat family (felids)","offset":765},{"uri":"Host_(biology)","surface_form":"definitive hosts","offset":811}]}
