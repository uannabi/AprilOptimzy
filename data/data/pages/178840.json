{"id":178840,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolagnia","text":"Urolagnia (also urophilia, undinism) is a paraphilia where people gain sexual pleasure from urine and/or urination. The term has origins in the Greek Language (from \"ouron\", urine, and \"lagneia\", lust).\nThose who enjoy urolagnia may enjoy urinating on other people, or being urinated on. The practice of drinking the urine is called urophagia, although this word also applies to non-sexual situations. People who practice urolagnia may participate in urolagnia as part of a domination and submission scene, though not all sexual activity involving urine is so.\nThese activities are often described with the slang terms \"golden showers\", \"water sports\", or \"piss play\". Urolagnia is sometimes associated with omorashi, but omorashi is usually described in Western culture using terms such as \"bladder desperation\" or \"panty wetting\".\nIn New Zealand, publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia, whether in print or online, is an offence punishable by up to ten years in prison.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paraphilia","surface_form":"paraphilia","offset":42},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":92},{"uri":"Urination","surface_form":"urination","offset":105},{"uri":"Greek_Language","surface_form":"Greek Language","offset":144},{"uri":"Urophagia","surface_form":"urophagia","offset":333},{"uri":"Domination_%26amp%3B_submission_(BDSM)","surface_form":"domination and submission","offset":474},{"uri":"Omorashi","surface_form":"omorashi","offset":708},{"uri":"Western_culture","surface_form":"Western culture","offset":755},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":836}]}
