{"id":178919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_(GUI)","text":"e=\"preserve\">On computers using graphics for an interface, a tab is a way to switch between different controls (such as in a configuration screen), or documents (such as in a web browser or word processor). Only one tab can be active at a time.\nUse in browsers.\nMore recently tabs have become a popular feature of most web browsers.
