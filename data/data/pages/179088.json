The purpose is to find the original, and see what changes were made to the later versions.\nTextual criticism started with the study of the Bible, but now these techniques are used to study many texts.\nBasic notions and objectives.\nThe lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman. In such a situation, a key objective becomes the identification of the first \"exemplar\" before any split in the tradition. That exemplar is known as the \"archetype\". \"If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the reconstruction of the original is considerably advanced\".pp22\u201323","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":67},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":76},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":228},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":283}]}
