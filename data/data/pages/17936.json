{"id":17936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy","text":"A pharmacy is a shop where therapeutic drugs are sold. Sometimes a pharmacy is also called a \"drug store or chemist and druggist store\". The people working in a pharmacy are called pharmacists, druggist or chemists (British English). These people can recognise simple diseases and formulate or dispense drugs for some of them.\nCertain drugs are special, because they can be addictive, or they change the way other drugs act, or they need to be taken in a special way. These drugs cannot simply be bought at a pharmacy. A prescription is necessary to get them. Medical doctors give out prescriptions, which can then be used to get the drug.\nMany pharmacies do not sell drugs only. They also sell beauty products and hygiene-related products, like tampons for women and contraceptives.\nPharmacy is also a branch of chemistry that studies the molecular structure of drugs to find better drugs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":16},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"therapeutic drugs","offset":27},{"uri":"Pharmacist","surface_form":"pharmacist","offset":181},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":206},{"uri":"Diseases","surface_form":"diseases","offset":268},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":303},{"uri":"Addiction","surface_form":"addictive","offset":374},{"uri":"Prescription","surface_form":"prescription","offset":521},{"uri":"Beauty_products","surface_form":"beauty products","offset":695},{"uri":"Hygiene","surface_form":"hygiene","offset":715},{"uri":"Tampon","surface_form":"tampon","offset":746},{"uri":"Contraception","surface_form":"contraceptives","offset":768},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":813}]}
