{"id":17938,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothel","text":"A brothel is a bar, nightclub or hotel where sex workers are found. People go there to buy sex for money. Different countries have different regulations as to sex work.\nLegality.\nSome countries where prostitution is legal allow it to happen in a brothel, others allow it to happen \"on the street\", still others allow both forms. Generally, sex work in a brothel is seen as safer for the worker than sex work on the street.\nIn some countries operating brothels is legal, in other countries it is illegal. Examples of countries where brothels are illegal are Canada and most of the United States. Brothels are legal in some countries from Europe, for example. A country which has permissive laws regarding sex work is the Netherlands. Laws can be unclear on whether brothels with sexbots are legal or not.\nHistory.\nBrothels have been known for most of recorded history. At first there was temple prostitution in many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries.\nIn Ancient Greece and Roman civilizations, brothels were established. Sometimes they were licensed institutions. This was first recorded in Athens in 594 BC. Public sources of the time said it was good that Solon installed the brothel. People said this would reduce the problems caused by sexually unfulfilled sailors and workers. It would also fill money into the public purse. This first official brothel was soon followed by many others, and also influenced the creation of special schools in which various classes of prostitutes (from slavegirls to future courtesans) were trained for their profession. In 2017, a brothel was opened with sexbots instead of human workers.\nBusiness models.\nThe third option (the brothel owner renting space and facilities to sex workers) gives some way for the brothel owner to say they did not know what is going on. This is especially the case where sex work is forbidden or restricted. Brothel owners often disguise their actions as running a massage parlor, a bar or a similar venue.\nAllowing such places (while forbidding se work) can also give politicians a way to save face when they do not want to put laws against sex work into practice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"bar","offset":15},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":20},{"uri":"Prostitution","surface_form":"sex workers","offset":45},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":91},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":99},{"uri":"Street_prostitution","surface_form":"on the street","offset":282},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":557},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":580},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":720},{"uri":"Temple_prostitution","surface_form":"temple prostitution","offset":887},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":915},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":933},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":962},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":981},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":1099},{"uri":"Solon","surface_form":"Solon","offset":1166},{"uri":"Sailor","surface_form":"sailor","offset":1269},{"uri":"Worker","surface_form":"worker","offset":1281},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavegirls","offset":1498},{"uri":"Courtesan","surface_form":"courtesan","offset":1519},{"uri":"Sexbot","surface_form":"sexbot","offset":1601},{"uri":"Massage_parlor","surface_form":"massage parlor","offset":1941},{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"bar","offset":1959}]}
