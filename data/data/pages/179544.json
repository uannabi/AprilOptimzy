{"id":179544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubicle","text":"A cubicle is a small room. It can be a small work space often seen in offices. It can also be a place used for changing clothes in, often found at swimming pools and gymnasiums.\nHistory.\nRobert Propst designed the first cubicle in 1964. He wanted to \"empower\" people, and make them work better. Propst worked for a home furnishings company called Herman Miller at the time. In 1968, when the company started selling the cubicle, it did not sell well. Herman Miller later designed a new type of cubicle that was cheaper. The cubicle is now very popular in offices around the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":70},{"uri":"Clothes","surface_form":"clothes","offset":120},{"uri":"Swimming_pool","surface_form":"swimming pool","offset":147},{"uri":"Gymnasium","surface_form":"gymnasium","offset":166},{"uri":"Robert_Propst","surface_form":"Robert Propst","offset":187},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":332},{"uri":"Herman_Miller","surface_form":"Herman Miller","offset":347}]}
