{"id":17956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_tiger","text":"The South China tiger (\"Panthera tigris amoyensis\") is an almost extinct subspecies of the tiger. There are now 20-30 of them left in the wild and 60 left in captivity. It is one of the world's ten most endangered animals and the most endangered of the six surviving tiger subspecies. The South Chinae tiger is also known as the \"Chinese\", \"Amoy\", or \"Xiamen\" tiger.\nDescription.\nIt can be distinguished from other tiger subspecies by its narrow face, it's longer nose, more intense orange colour, short fur, longer legs, and shorter stripes which are spaced far apart from each other compared to other tiger subspecies. The South China tiger has the least amount of stripes out of all the tiger subspecies, and is the second smallest tiger.\nA male South China tiger is around 2.3 to 2.65 m (91 to 104 in) long, and weighs 130 to 175\u00A0kg (290 to 390\u00A0lb). Females are smaller and are around 2.2 to 2.4 m (87 to 94 in) long, and weigh 110 to 115\u00A0kg (240 to 250\u00A0lb). The smallest length of the skull in males is 318 to 343\u00A0mm (12.5 to 13.5 in), and in females 273 to 301\u00A0mm (10.7 to 11.9 in).\nBehaviour.\nThe South China tiger is a carnivorous predator, hunting its prey by stalking it until the South China tiger has the opportunity to catch it off guard. South China tigers usually hunt large mammals like deer, wild boar, cattle and goats.\nThe South China tiger is found on mountains, and in temperate, upland forests of southern-China.\nReproduction.\nFemales are pregnant for around 3 to 4 months before giving birth to around 5 cubs. Newborn South China tiger cubs weigh about 1\u00A0kg (2\u00A0lb) and are blind and helpless. The mother feeds them milk for about 2 months and then the South China tiger cubs are introduced to meat. South China tiger cubs depend on their mother for the first 18 months and then they start hunting on their own.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":73},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":91},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":273},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":415},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":421},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":990},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":1127},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":1290},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":1303},{"uri":"Boar","surface_form":"boar","offset":1314},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":1320},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":1331},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1372},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":1390},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1408},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1428}]}
