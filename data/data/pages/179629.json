{"id":179629,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascomycota","text":"Ascomycota is a phylum of fungi (kingdom Fungi). Members are commonly known as the sac fungi. They have a sac, the ascus, which contains four to eight ascospores in the sexual stage.\nThe structure defines the group and distinguishes it from other fungi. The ascus is a tube-shaped sac, which contains the sexual spores produced by meiosis and which are called \"ascospores\".\nIt was used in genetics because it contains the results of crossing-over between chromosomes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":16},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":26},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":33},{"uri":"Meiosis","surface_form":"meiosis","offset":331},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":389},{"uri":"Crossing-over","surface_form":"crossing-over","offset":433},{"uri":"Chromosomes","surface_form":"chromosomes","offset":455}]}
