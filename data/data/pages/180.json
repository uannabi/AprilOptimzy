{"id":180,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube","text":"A cube is a block with all right angles and whose height, width and depth are all the same.\nA cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space. Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as \"cubic\".\nRelative 2-dimensional shape.\nThe basic difference between a cube and a square is, a cube is a 3D figure (having 3 dimensions) i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth.\nThe 2-dimensional (2D) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is squares. The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight lines. The corners (vertices) are at right angles. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 faces, as in the most usual kind of dice. A tesseract carries this idea into the fourth dimension (4D) and is made of 8 cubes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":27},{"uri":"Height","surface_form":"height","offset":50},{"uri":"Width","surface_form":"width","offset":58},{"uri":"Depth","surface_form":"depth","offset":68},{"uri":"Platonic_solid","surface_form":"mathematical shape","offset":122},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":298},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":321},{"uri":"Dimension","surface_form":"dimension","offset":341},{"uri":"2D","surface_form":"2D","offset":466},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"squares","offset":542},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":615},{"uri":"Dice","surface_form":"dice","offset":739},{"uri":"Tesseract","surface_form":"tesseract","offset":747},{"uri":"4D","surface_form":"4D","offset":802}]}
