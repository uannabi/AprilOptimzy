[b\u01D2\u0292e pr\u00E2\u02D0\u028Bde] \"boh-zheh PRAHV-deh\"; lit. 'God of Justice') is the national anthem of Serbia, enshrined in Article 7 of the Constitution. It has been around since the 19th century; the music was composed by Slovene musician Davorin Jenko (Davorin Yenko) and the lyrics were written by Jovan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 (Yovan Gyorgyevich) in 1872. Ten years later, it was first adopted when the Kingdom of Serbia was formed, which then lasted until 1919, a year after the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (then known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) was formed. It was fully relinquished in 1945 and was replaced by \"Hej, Slaveni!\".\nShortly after Serbia and Montenegro split, \"Bo\u017Ee pravde\" was readopted in November 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"sr-cyrl.","offset":15},{"uri":"Constitution_of_Serbia","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":167},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Serbia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Serbia","offset":419},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Yugoslavia","offset":496},{"uri":"Hej%2C_Slaveni%21","surface_form":"Hej, Slaveni!","offset":643},{"uri":"Serbia_and_Montenegro","surface_form":"Serbia and Montenegro","offset":673}]}
