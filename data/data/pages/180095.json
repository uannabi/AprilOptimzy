{"id":180095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHK_Symphony_Orchestra","text":"The NHK Symphony Orchestra is a Japanese orchestra based in Tokyo, Japan. In Japanese it is written: NHK\u4EA4\u97FF\u697D\u56E3, pronounced: Enueichikei K\u014Dky\u014D Gakudan. When the orchestra was started in 1926 it was called \"New Symphony Orchestra\". It was the first large professional orchestra in Japan. Later, it changed its name to \"Japan Symphony Orchestra\". In 1951 it started to get money from the Japanese radio station NHK (Nippon H\u014Ds\u014D Ky\u014Dkai), so it changed its name again to the name it has now. It is thought of as the best orchestra in Japan. They have played in many parts of the world, including at the BBC Proms in London.\nVladimir Ashkenazy is the orchestra's main conductor (music director) and Charles Dutoit is music director emeritus. Wolfgang Sawallisch is honorary conductor laureate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":32},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":41},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":60},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":67},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":77},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":183},{"uri":"1951","surface_form":"1951","offset":345},{"uri":"BBC_Proms","surface_form":"BBC Proms","offset":596},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":609},{"uri":"Vladimir_Ashkenazy","surface_form":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","offset":617},{"uri":"Charles_Dutoit","surface_form":"Charles Dutoit","offset":691},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Sawallisch","surface_form":"Wolfgang Sawallisch","offset":734}]}
