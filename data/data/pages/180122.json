{"id":180122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel","text":"=\"preserve\">A gel is a semi-solid substance material which usually wobbles.\nBy weight, gels are mostly liquid. But gels also behave like solids. They have a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks in the fluid that give a gel its structure.\nAs colloids, gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid. In a gel, the solid is the continuous phase; the liquid is the discontinuous phase.\nExamples: Jellies, agar, contact lenses, organic slime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wobble","surface_form":"wobbles","offset":67},{"uri":"Cross-link","surface_form":"cross-link","offset":175},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":188},{"uri":"Colloid","surface_form":"colloid","offset":283},{"uri":"Dispersion","surface_form":"dispersion","offset":304},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":318},{"uri":"Continuous","surface_form":"continuous","offset":383},{"uri":"States_of_matter","surface_form":"phase","offset":394},{"uri":"Jelly","surface_form":"Jellies","offset":450},{"uri":"Agar","surface_form":"agar","offset":459},{"uri":"Contact_lens","surface_form":"contact lens","offset":465},{"uri":"Organic_matter","surface_form":"organic","offset":481},{"uri":"Slime","surface_form":"slime","offset":489}]}
