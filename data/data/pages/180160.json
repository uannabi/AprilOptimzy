Many specialists merge this genus, \"Coscoroba\", with ducks, like whistling ducks. The coscoroba swan is found in South America from southern Chile and central Argentina south to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands.\nRecent genetic studies have found a relationship between this species and Cape Barren goose (\"Cereopsis novaehollandiae\"). They are sister groups.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ducks","surface_form":"ducks","offset":136},{"uri":"Whistling_ducks","surface_form":"whistling ducks","offset":148},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":196},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":224},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":242},{"uri":"Tierra_del_Fuego","surface_form":"Tierra del Fuego","offset":261},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":286},{"uri":"Cereopsis_novaehollandiae","surface_form":"Cereopsis novaehollandiae","offset":398},{"uri":"Sister_group","surface_form":"sister group","offset":436}]}
