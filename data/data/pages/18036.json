It is from South America, the Andes Mountains of Peru and Ecuador.\nSometimes the name \"llama\" is used for all four South American camelids.\nLlama and humans.\nThe llama was domesticated about 5000 years ago. It was and is used for carrying things, and for wool. The llama was very important for the Incan people. Even today, llamas are used for similar reasons, but will more commonly be used as domesticated pets.\nRelated animals.\nThe llama's close relative is the alpaca, who is a more demure, petite animal in comparison to the llama. Llamas have three related cousins - the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicu\u00F1a. The llama is the national symbol of Bolivia.\nLlamas spit, and travel together. Llamas also have a high content of hemoglobin which causes their blood cells to be oval and not circular.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":28},{"uri":"Camelid","surface_form":"Camelid","offset":43},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":73},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes Mountains","offset":92},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":111},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":120},{"uri":"Camelid","surface_form":"camelid","offset":192},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":234},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":317},{"uri":"Inca","surface_form":"Inca","offset":360},{"uri":"Alpaca","surface_form":"alpaca","offset":527},{"uri":"Alpaca","surface_form":"alpaca","offset":639},{"uri":"Guanaco","surface_form":"guanaco","offset":651},{"uri":"Vicu%C3%B1a","surface_form":"vicu\u00F1a","offset":668}]}
