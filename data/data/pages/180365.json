{"id":180365,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvet_Island","text":"Bouvet Island (, also historically known as Liverpool Island or Lindsay Island) is an island in the southern part of the Atlantic Ocean. It is in the sub-antarctic areas, 2500\u00A0km (1500 miles) south-southwest of the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa).\nIt belongs to Norway and is not subject to the Antarctic Treaty (which says that land south of 60\u00B0S, including Antarctica, do not belong to any country). It is the most remote island in the world, which means that is farther from other land than any other island on Earth. The closest piece of land to the island is Queen Maud Land in Antarctica, which is more than 1600\u00A0km (994 miles) away. Nobody lives there, and there are rarely any visitors.\nGeography.\nThe island is volcanic and has high cliffs on all sides (created by high waves over thousands of years). 90% of its area is covered by glaciers (ice).\nHistory.\nIn January 2015 a new research station was put into place, for use by research expeditions.\nClimate, plants and animal life.\nThe climate is cold and does not change much, with an average of +1\u00A0\u00B0C in the warmest month, and \u22123\u00A0\u00B0C in the coldest.\nThere are penguins, sea birds and seals on the island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":86},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":121},{"uri":"Sub-antarctic","surface_form":"sub-antarctic","offset":150},{"uri":"Cape_of_Good_Hope","surface_form":"Cape of Good Hope","offset":215},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":234},{"uri":"Dependent_territory","surface_form":"belongs to","offset":252},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":263},{"uri":"Antarctic_Treaty","surface_form":"Antarctic Treaty","offset":296},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":360},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":515},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":584},{"uri":"Volcanic","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":721},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":842},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":946},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":996},{"uri":"Penguins","surface_form":"penguins","offset":1121}]}
