{"id":18047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee","text":"Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 \u2013 October 12, 1870) was a colonel in the United States Army. He became the General-in-chief of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He led the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. He started out as an engineer but then moved up the ranks. Before the Civil War, Lee was an officer in the Mexican-American War. He was also head of West Point. As a colonel in the United States Army he led a battalion of marines to put down the rebellion at Harpers Ferry Armory and captured their leader, John Brown.\nEarly years.\nLee was born at Stratford Hall in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on January 19, 1807. His parents were American Revolutionary War General and Governor of Virginia, Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, and his wife, Anne Carter Lee. In 1818, Lee's father died in the West Indies without ever seeing his son again. Robert was raised by his mother in Alexandria, Virginia.\nWashington ancestry.\nLee and George Washington were both descendants of Augustine Warner, Sr. and his wife, Mary Towneley Warner. Lee was descended through their daughter, Sarah. Washington was descended through their son, Augustine, Jr. Lee and Washington were third cousins, twice removed.\nEducation.\nLee attended Eastern View, a school in Fauquier County, Virginia. He may have attended schools in Shirley, Virginia, and in Alexandria, Virginia. His mother instructed him in the Episcopalian faith. Lee attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated second in the class of 1829.\nMarriage.\nOn June 30, 1831, Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington House. She was the granddaughter of George Washington's stepson, John Parke Custis. They made their home at Arlington House. They had seven children.\nMiddle years.\nLee fought in the Mexican\u2013American War under General Winfield Scott as a captain. Later, Scott wrote about Lee calling him \"the very best soldier I ever saw in the field.\" After the war, Lee helped the army build forts. In 1855, Lee became a lieutenant colonel, and joined a cavalry regiment. As a Colonel, Lee was called on to stop the \"slave rebellion\", otherwise known as John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. Brown's raid was ended in less than an hour by Lee.\nCivil War.\nLee inherited a number of slaves with Arlington House. He proved not to be a very good slave master. He tried kindness and refused to use torture. But the slaves knew their freedom had been granted them in the will and refused to work. Lee wanted to grant them their freedom but needed them to help him see out the work at Arlington House. Personally, Lee hated slavery calling it an \"evil\" to both blacks and whites. But he thought it had to be ended gradually or the economy of the South would. But Lee did agree with other Southerners thinking that blacks were inferior. He believed God would work out the problem in his own time. Lee, like Thomas Jefferson had mixed feelings about slavery.\nThe election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 caused several states to secede in protest. This put Lee in a difficult position. The newly formed Confederate States of America offered Lee the rank of brigadier general. Lee did not respond to the offer. Winfield Scott offered him command of the army of U.S. volunteers. He didn't answer this offer, either. Between April 12\u201314, 1861, U.S. troops were bombarded at Fort Sumter at Charleston, South Carolina. The same day Virginia seceded from the Union. Lee did not support secession but he could not fight his own state of Virginia. Lee resigned his U.S. Army commission on April 22, 1861, at Arlington House. He told his friends that he would not be a part of an invasion of the South. Several days later he accepted command of all Virginia forces.\nAt first, Lee did not command any soldiers in battle. Instead, he helped Confederate president Jefferson Davis make military decisions. In 1862, he became the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. He would lead the army for the rest of the war. He would win many battles, even though the Union army in the battles had more men and weapons. At the Battle of Gettysburg, he tried to invade the Union in order to end the war. But his army was defeated and he had to retreat back into Virginia.\nDuring 1864 and 1865, Lee fought Union general Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia. During the end of 1864 and the beginning of 1865, Lee and Grant fought near Richmond, Virginia in a series of battles called the Siege of Petersburg. In April 1865, Grant forced Lee to retreat from Richmond. After a series of battles, Grant surrounded Lee near Appomattox Courthouse and forced Lee to surrender. Before he surrendered, he said \"I would rather die a thousand deaths than surrender\".\nAfter the war.\nOn October 2, 1865, Lee became president of Washington College in Virginia. That same day Lee signed his Amnesty Oath as required by President Johnson. But Lee was not pardoned and his citizenship was not restored.\nHis amnesty oath was found over a hundred years later in the National Archives. It appears United States Secretary of State William H. Seward had given the application to a friend to keep as a souvenir. The State Department had simply ignored Lee's application and it was never granted. In a 1975 Joint resolution by the United States Congress, Lee's rights as a citizen were restored with the effective date of June 13, 1865. The act was signed into law by President Gerald R. Ford on August 5, 1975.\nLee had a stroke on September 28, 1870 and died on October 12, 1870. Washington College changed its name to Washington and Lee University in Lee's honor. Lee's birthday is celebrated in several southern states as a holiday.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colonel","surface_form":"colonel","offset":62},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":77},{"uri":"Confederate_States_Army","surface_form":"Confederate States Army","offset":135},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":170},{"uri":"Army_of_Northern_Virginia","surface_form":"Army of Northern Virginia","offset":201},{"uri":"Eastern_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Eastern Theater of the American Civil War","offset":234},{"uri":"Mexican-American_War","surface_form":"Mexican-American War","offset":384},{"uri":"United_States_Military_Academy","surface_form":"West Point","offset":426},{"uri":"Colonel","surface_form":"colonel","offset":443},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":458},{"uri":"Battalion","surface_form":"battalion","offset":486},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"marines","offset":499},{"uri":"Rebellion","surface_form":"rebellion","offset":523},{"uri":"Harpers_Ferry_Armory","surface_form":"Harpers Ferry Armory","offset":536},{"uri":"John_Brown_(abolitionist)","surface_form":"John Brown","offset":584},{"uri":"Westmoreland_County%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Westmoreland County, Virginia","offset":643},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":712},{"uri":"Henry_%26quot%3BLight_Horse_Harry%26quot%3B_Lee","surface_form":"Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee","offset":773},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":869},{"uri":"Alexandria%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Alexandria, Virginia","offset":951},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":1002},{"uri":"Descendant","surface_form":"descendant","offset":1030},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":1305},{"uri":"Alexandria%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Alexandria, Virginia","offset":1400},{"uri":"United_States_Military_Academy_at_West_Point","surface_form":"United States Military Academy at West Point","offset":1492},{"uri":"Granddaughter","surface_form":"granddaughter","offset":1665},{"uri":"Mexican%E2%80%93American_War","surface_form":"Mexican\u2013American War","offset":1828},{"uri":"Winfield_Scott","surface_form":"Winfield Scott","offset":1863},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":1883},{"uri":"Lieutenant_colonel","surface_form":"lieutenant colonel","offset":2052},{"uri":"Colonel","surface_form":"Colonel","offset":2108},{"uri":"John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry","surface_form":"John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry","offset":2185},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"blacks","offset":2683},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"whites","offset":2694},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"South","offset":2768},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":2870},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":2928},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":2983},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":2995},{"uri":"States_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"states","offset":3034},{"uri":"Secede","surface_form":"secede","offset":3044},{"uri":"Rank","surface_form":"rank","offset":3164},{"uri":"Brigadier_general","surface_form":"brigadier general","offset":3172},{"uri":"Winfield_Scott","surface_form":"Winfield Scott","offset":3225},{"uri":"Volunteers","surface_form":"volunteers","offset":3280},{"uri":"Fort_Sumter","surface_form":"Fort Sumter","offset":3386},{"uri":"Charleston%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Charleston, South Carolina","offset":3401},{"uri":"Union_(American_Civil_War)","surface_form":"Union","offset":3468},{"uri":"Resignation","surface_form":"resigned","offset":3559},{"uri":"Commission","surface_form":"commission","offset":3582},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":3686},{"uri":"Jefferson_Davis","surface_form":"Jefferson Davis","offset":3867},{"uri":"Army_of_Northern_Virginia","surface_form":"Army of Northern Virginia","offset":3948},{"uri":"Battle_of_Gettysburg","surface_form":"Battle of Gettysburg","offset":4125},{"uri":"Ulysses_S._Grant","surface_form":"Ulysses S.
