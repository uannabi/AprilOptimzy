{"id":18052,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah","text":"Isaiah was a prophet of God in Judaism, Islam, Christianity and Bah\u00E1'\u00ED. He lived from about 740 to 681 BC. The name \"Isaiah\" means \"the Lord is salvation\" in the Hebrew language.\nIsaiah is also the name of a book in the Old Testament of the Bible, which tells the story of the Israelites in Isaiah's time. According to Christianity, Isaiah predicted in this book, the birth and then death of Jesus, hundreds of years before it actually happened. Judaism does not agree with that interpretation.\nIsaiah was known to be the Shakespeare of the Bible due to his good education and the quality of the passages he wrote. He was cut in half by King Manasseh which led to his gruesome death. Most of Isaiah's Bible passages begin with 'God's message to'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":13},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":24},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":31},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":40},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":47},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED","offset":64},{"uri":"Salvation","surface_form":"salvation","offset":144},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew language","offset":162},{"uri":"Book_of_Isaiah","surface_form":"book","offset":208},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":220},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":241},{"uri":"Israelites","surface_form":"Israelites","offset":277},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":319},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":392},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":446},{"uri":"Interpretation","surface_form":"interpretation","offset":479}]}
