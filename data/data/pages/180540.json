{"id":180540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent","text":"e=\"preserve\">A supercontinent is a large area of land which has more than one continental core, or craton. They are formed by continental plates coming together. Continental plates have periodically collided and assembled in periods of orogeny (mountain-building) to form supercontinents. The cycle of supercontinents forming, breaking up, separating, and re-forming through plate tectonics happens about every 450 million years.\nEurasia is certainly a supercontinent, but the Americas are usually thought of as separate continents. Even more clearly, Gondwana and Laurasia were supercontinents formed by the breakup of the global supercontinent Pangaea.\nThe land bridge between North and South America is geologically a rather temporary connection. Because of this, the Americas are usually not described as one supercontinent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":78},{"uri":"Craton","surface_form":"craton","offset":99},{"uri":"Continental_plate","surface_form":"continental plate","offset":126},{"uri":"Orogeny","surface_form":"orogeny","offset":236},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":245},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":375},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":415},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":430},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":477},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":521},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":552},{"uri":"Laurasia","surface_form":"Laurasia","offset":565},{"uri":"Pangaea","surface_form":"Pangaea","offset":646},{"uri":"Land_bridge","surface_form":"land bridge","offset":659},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North","offset":679},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":689},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geologically","offset":706},{"uri":"Temporary","surface_form":"temporary","offset":728}]}
