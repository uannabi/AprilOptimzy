{"id":180548,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatula","text":"A spatula, also called a turner, or a fish slice, is a kitchen tool with a long handle and a flat top, used for lifting food.\nDesign.\nSpatulas have a handle that is long enough to keep the user's hand away from what they want to lift, flip, or scrap.\nThe blade is usually somewhat flexible, and shiny. Spatula blades are often longer on the right side than the left. Most have long slots on the blades to allow liquids to go through, though some have simple holes or no holes at all.\nSpatulas are usually made of plastic or metal, with a wooden or plastic handle to keep it away from heat. Spatulas made for outdoor grilling have very long handles.\nSpatulas can be colorful or have designs on them. They can be used as art in the home.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":513},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":524},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":584},{"uri":"Grilling","surface_form":"grilling","offset":616}]}
