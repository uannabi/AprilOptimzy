{"id":180673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock","text":"A wood block is a small percussion instrument. It is made of wood and hit like a drum. The woodblock is hollow inside so that it makes a big, resonating sound. It can come in different forms, but many modern woodblocks are shaped like a brick.\nIt is sometimes called a Chinese block because it has Chinese origins.\nThe sticks used to hit the woodblock can be snare drum sticks or xylophone beaters. It makes a hard, high sound. It can often be heard in large orchestras, e.g. in Bernstein's \"West Side Story\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":24},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":61},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":81},{"uri":"Brick","surface_form":"brick","offset":237},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":298},{"uri":"Xylophone","surface_form":"xylophone","offset":380},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":459},{"uri":"Bernstein","surface_form":"Bernstein","offset":479},{"uri":"West_Side_Story","surface_form":"West Side Story","offset":492}]}
