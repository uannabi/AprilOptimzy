For the rhythm used in music of Cuban origin see clave\"\nClaves (Spanish word: second e is sounded) are percussion instruments. They are small wooden sticks made of tropical hardwood. They are used in pairs. They are traditionally heard in Cuban music, e.g. salsa.\nIn Cuban music they often repeat a special rhythm called \"clave\" (pronounce: \"CLAH-ve\").\nThe usual way of playing claves is to hold one clave lightly between the thumb and the fingertips with the palm of the hand facing upwards, or to cradle the clave in the hand. The other, held with the other hand, hits it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":40},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":71},{"uri":"Clave","surface_form":"clave","offset":112},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":127},{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":166},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":227},{"uri":"Hardwood","surface_form":"hardwood","offset":236},{"uri":"Cuban","surface_form":"Cuban","offset":302},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":308},{"uri":"Salsa","surface_form":"salsa","offset":320},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":370},{"uri":"Clave","surface_form":"clave","offset":385}]}
