The station is served by Abellio Greater Anglia and London Overground, on the West Anglia route, and it is in Travelcard Zone 2.\nThe station is a short walk from Hackney Central, on the North London Line. Until Hackney Central's closure in 1944, a passenger connection linked the two stations. However, when Hackney Central reopened in 1985, the footway did not reopen, and passengers transferring between the two stations are obliged to leave the station and transfer at street level. The station was originally opened as Downs Junction Station.\n2 operated by Abellio Greater Anglia","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Hackney","surface_form":"London Borough of Hackney","offset":40},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":74},{"uri":"Abellio_Greater_Anglia","surface_form":"Abellio Greater Anglia","offset":107},{"uri":"London_Overground","surface_form":"London Overground","offset":134},{"uri":"Travelcard_Zone_2","surface_form":"Travelcard Zone 2","offset":192},{"uri":"Hackney_Central_railway_station","surface_form":"Hackney Central","offset":244},{"uri":"North_London_Line","surface_form":"North London Line","offset":268}]}
