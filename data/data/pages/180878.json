{"id":180878,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae","text":"The \"Orthomyxoviridae\" (\"orthos\", Greek for \"straight\"; \"myxa\", Greek for \"mucus\") are a family of RNA viruses. They include five genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and Isavirus. The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates, including birds (see also avian influenza), humans, and other mammals. Isaviruses infect salmon; thogotoviruses infect vertebrates and invertebrates, such as mosquitoes and sea lice.\nTypes.\nThere are three genera of influenza virus: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B and Influenzavirus C. Each genus includes only one species, or type: Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, and Influenza C virus, respectively. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans.\nInfluenza A.\nInfluenza A viruses are further classified, based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Eighteen H subtypes (or serotypes) and eleven N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified.\nFurther variation exists; thus, specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type, geographical location where first isolated, sequential number of isolation, year of isolation, and HA and NA subtype.\nInfluenza B.\nInfluenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species antigenic shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.\nInfluenza C.\nThe influenza C virus infects humans and pigs, and can cause severe illness and local epidemics. However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":34},{"uri":"Mucus","surface_form":"mucus","offset":75},{"uri":"RNA_virus","surface_form":"RNA virus","offset":99},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":130},{"uri":"Influenzavirus_A","surface_form":"Influenzavirus A","offset":138},{"uri":"Influenzavirus_B","surface_form":"Influenzavirus B","offset":156},{"uri":"Influenzavirus_C","surface_form":"Influenzavirus C","offset":174},{"uri":"Thogotovirus","surface_form":"Thogotovirus","offset":192},{"uri":"Isavirus","surface_form":"Isavirus","offset":209},{"uri":"Influenza","surface_form":"influenza","offset":269},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":305},{"uri":"Avian_influenza","surface_form":"avian influenza","offset":321},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":339},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":357},{"uri":"Salmon","surface_form":"salmon","offset":384},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":414},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":430},{"uri":"Mosquito","surface_form":"mosquito","offset":453},{"uri":"Sea_lice","surface_form":"sea lice","offset":468},{"uri":"Influenzavirus_A","surface_form":"Influenzavirus A","offset":528},{"uri":"Influenzavirus_B","surface_form":"Influenzavirus B","offset":546},{"uri":"Influenzavirus_C","surface_form":"Influenzavirus C","offset":567},{"uri":"Hemagglutinin","surface_form":"hemagglutinin","offset":896},{"uri":"Neuraminidase","surface_form":"neuraminidase","offset":924},{"uri":"Antigen","surface_form":"antigen","offset":1670},{"uri":"Antigenic_shift","surface_form":"antigenic shift","offset":1941},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":2054},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":2065},{"uri":"Epidemic","surface_form":"epidemic","offset":2110}]}
