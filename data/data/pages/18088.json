{"id":18088,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","text":"The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the time from June 1 to November 30, 2005 when hurricanes officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. Tropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30 and dissipated on January 6, which is after the November 30 end of the season. It was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history.\n2005 broke many records set. There were 28 storms that were tropical storms which was broken by 2020 and 15 that became hurricanes. For the first time ever storms were named by the Greek alphabet as the normal name list had been used up. The storm which caused the most damage was Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans, USA, and killed over 1000 people. The strongest storm of the season was not Katrina, it was Hurricane Wilma. Wilma was the strongest hurricane ever in the Atlantic Ocean, reaching a record low pressure of 882 mbar.\nStorms.\nSTORM CLASSIFICATIONS: Numbers 1 - 5 indicate Hurricanes, from 1 (weakest) to 5 (strongest)TS Tropical Storm | TD Tropical Depression | SS Subtropical Storm | SD Subtropical Depression\nTropical Storm Arlene.\nArlene, the first storm of the season, formed near Honduras on June 8 and moved north. It came close to western Cuba on June 10 before entering the Gulf of Mexico. Arlene strengthened just below hurricane strength before making landfall on western Florida. The storm quickly weakened while moving inland, and later became an extratropical remnant on June 13.\nTropical Storm Bret.\nTropical Storm Bret was a weak tropical storm that formed as Tropical Depression Two in the western Gulf of Mexico, then quickly became Tropical Storm Bret. The storm made landfall in Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico the next morning. It dissipated on June 30.

Hurricane Emily caused about 17 deaths and $1.014 billion in damage.\nTropical Storm Franklin.\nTropical Storm Franklin formed north of the Bahamas on July 21 and moved steadily across the western Atlantic while coming close to Bermuda on July 26.

Franklin caused no damages and killed no people while it stayed in the ocean during most of its life.\nTropical Storm Gert.\nTropical Storm Gert was a weak and short lived storm. Tropical Storm Gert formed in the Bay of Campeche on July 23.

Tropical Storm Harvey only affected Bermuda.\nHurricane Irene.\nHurricane Irene was a rather long lived storm (about 2 weeks). It took it a while to become a hurricane. The only effects from Irene were large waves. Irene caused no damage or deaths.\nTropical Storm Jose.\nTropical Storm Jose was a strong but very short lived storm. It quickly formed in the Bay of Campeche and made landfall in Mexico. Tropical Storm Jose dissipated the next day. Tropical Storm Jose caused 8 deaths and $45 million in damages.\nHurricane Katrina.\nHurricane Katrina was a powerful category 5 hurricane. Katrina was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history.

The storm caused $1 billion in Mexico and the Central American region. The exact number of people killed is unknown, but the guess is around 1,660, though it could be up to 2,000.\nTropical Storm Tammy.\nTammy was a tropical storm that only existed for a total of two days and brought minor damages to the southeastern United States. It peaked with 50\u00A0mph (85\u00A0km/h) just before making landfall on the northern Florida coast. Tammy formed from a strong non-tropical low on October 5 just off the Floridan coast. It moved north, peaking with 50\u00A0mph (85\u00A0km/h) winds just before making landfall on Atlantic Beach, Florida on October 6. Tammy died shortly later.

Beta caused about 4 deaths and $3 million in damage.\nTropical Storm Gamma.\nGamma was a tropical storm that started in the middle of November.

The tropical storm killed about 41 people in Honduras.\nTropical Storm Delta.\nTropical Storm Delta was a strong tropical storm. It killed at least 7 people in the Canary Islands and caused about $360 million in damage. The remains were last seen over Morocco.\nHurricane Epsilon.\nEpsilon was a rare December hurricane, the first since Hurricane Lili in 1984. Forecasters incorrectly guessed on how much time it would take for Epsilon to dissipate. Epsilon did not come anywhere near land.\nTropical Storm Zeta.\nTropical Storm Zeta was the last storm of 2005. The storm formed on December 30 over cold waters in the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Zeta dissipated on January 6, 2006. It was only one of two storms to live in two different years (the other was Hurricane Alice, which was in 1954 and 1955). The storm did not affect land or cause any deaths or damage.\nOther storms.\nThere were also four storms in and around the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season that were not given any names: Tropical Depression Ten(10), Tropical Depression Nineteen(19), Subtropical Depression Twenty-two(22), and a subtropical storm that was not found until after it had happened. A subtropical cyclone is a storm that is not quite a tropical cyclone, but is more tropical than an extratropical cyclone.\nRetirement.\nIn the spring of 2006, Hurricane Dennis, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Stan, and Hurricane Wilma were retired for the damages they caused, and were replaced by Don, Katia, Rina, Sean and Whitney for 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane
