The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by London Overground, on the West Anglia route, and it is in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was formerly called \"Bethnal Green Junction\" and was also served by trains on the Great Eastern Main Line.\nServices.\nOyster card (pay as you go) on National Rail is accepted at the station from 2 January 2008.\nHistory.\nIn 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a new branch to Hackney Downs to serve this branch a new junction was built to the west of Cambridge Heath Road.\nIt also replaced a station called Mile End which was located on the eastern side of Cambridge Heath Road with a station immediately to the west of the new junction called Bethnal Green Junction.\nIt served both of the Great Eastern Railway routes and had four platforms. In 1946 this station stopped serving the Great Eastern main line to Shenfield and two platforms were closed, though the remains of the Shenfield down platform are still visible.\nThe Shenfield up (London-bound) platform was demolished and the tracks rearranged, coinciding with the swapping of services from the former fast tracks onto the former slow (resulting in the arrangement we see today). It is not known for certain when the station's name was changed, possibly when it ceased serving the Shenfield line.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["London station"],"annotations":[{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets","surface_form":"London Borough of Tower Hamlets","offset":40},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":80},{"uri":"London_Overground","surface_form":"London Overground","offset":144},{"uri":"Travelcard_Zone_2","surface_form":"Travelcard Zone 2","offset":202},{"uri":"Great_Eastern_Main_Line","surface_form":"Great Eastern Main Line","offset":315},{"uri":"2_January","surface_form":"2 January","offset":427},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":437},{"uri":"Hackney_Downs_railway_station","surface_form":"Hackney Downs","offset":509},{"uri":"Mile_End_(London)_railway_station","surface_form":"Mile End","offset":640}]}
