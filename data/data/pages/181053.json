{"id":181053,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics (particularly in abstract algebra), two mathematical structures are isomorphic when they are the same in some sense. More specifically, an isomorphism is a function between two structures that preserves the relationships between the parts (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism#Examples). To indicate isomorphism between two structures formula_1 and formula_1, one often writes formula_1.\nUsing the language of category theory, this means that morphisms map to morphisms without breaking composition. An isomorphism is also a homomorphism that is one-to-one.\nAs an example, one can consider the operation of adding integers Z. The doubling function \u03C6(x) = 2x maps elements of Z to elements of the even integers 2Z. Since \u03C6(a+b) = 2(a+b) = 2a+2b = \u03C6(a)+\u03C6(b), adding in Z is structurally identical as adding in 2Z (which makes this an example of isomorphism).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Abstract_algebra","surface_form":"abstract algebra","offset":45},{"uri":"Structure_(mathematics)","surface_form":"mathematical structures","offset":68},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":184},{"uri":"Category_theory","surface_form":"category theory","offset":447},{"uri":"Morphism","surface_form":"morphisms","offset":480},{"uri":"Homomorphism","surface_form":"homomorphism","offset":562},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":651}]}
