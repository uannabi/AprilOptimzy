{"id":181059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_center","text":"In abstract algebra the center of a group G denoted by Z(G) is the set of elements which commute with every element of G, meaning that for any element x of a group G, and an element y of Z(G), xy = yx. The center is equal to the intersection of the centralizers of the group elements.\nThe notation Z(G) comes from the fact that in German the word for center is \"zentrum\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abstract_algebra","surface_form":"abstract algebra","offset":3},{"uri":"Group_(mathematics)","surface_form":"group","offset":36},{"uri":"Intersection","surface_form":"intersection","offset":229},{"uri":"Centralizer","surface_form":"centralizer","offset":249},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":331}]}
