He came out best in all three aircraft carrier battles in which he fought -- there were only five such fights in of all history. Admiral Fletcher was outnumbered at all times and when the other side was at its highest point in the early years of the Pacific War. He did not let the other side take Australia, Midway, and Guadalcanal. He put down six of the ten Japanese carriers with four of the six great carriers that had attacked Pearl Harbor. His acts were completely his own, because there was no such thing as carrier fighting experience before him to learn to fight ships from the air. He kept the Pacific safe which let much support to go to Europe and started the Allied victory in World War II.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"29_April","surface_form":"29 April","offset":21},{"uri":"1885","surface_form":"1885","offset":30},{"uri":"25_April","surface_form":"25 April","offset":37},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":46},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":123},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"Navy","offset":245},{"uri":"Annapolis%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Annapolis, Maryland","offset":284},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warship","offset":325},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":424},{"uri":"Pearl_Harbor","surface_form":"Pearl Harbor","offset":763},{"uri":"Surrender","surface_form":"surrender","offset":1020},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1981}]}
