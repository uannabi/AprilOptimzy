{"id":181099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBT_movement)","text":"The Rainbow flag has been the symbol of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community since its creation in 1978. It is also called the 'Pride Flag.' The flag was created by Gilbert Baker of San Francisco, California in 1978.\nHistory.\nThe flag was first used at a LGBT pride parade in San Francisco in 1978, at that time it had eight colors. The next year it was changed to six colors, so it could be easier to make.\nThe flag was first made by Gilbert Baker, to be used instead of the pink triangle symbol used before. The pink triangle was used by Nazis to show who was homosexual. Homosexual people were sent to concentration camps in Nazi Germany, where they made homosexual men wear a pink triangle. This was like the yellow Star of David that Jews had to wear to show who was Jewish. LGBT people were not ashamed of the pink triangle, but they wanted a more positive, happier symbol.\nMeaning.\nIt used to have a pink stripe, which meant \"sexuality\", but was removed because the pink cloth was unable to be mass produced.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":30},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":44},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":50},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":59},{"uri":"Bisexual","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":64},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"transgender","offset":78},{"uri":"Gilbert_Baker_(artist)","surface_form":"Gilbert Baker","offset":189},{"uri":"San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"San Francisco, California","offset":206},{"uri":"LGBT_pride","surface_form":"LGBT pride","offset":279},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":300},{"uri":"Gilbert_Baker_(artist)","surface_form":"Gilbert Baker","offset":459},{"uri":"Pink_triangle","surface_form":"pink triangle","offset":500},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":564},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":586},{"uri":"Concentration_camp","surface_form":"concentration camps","offset":629},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":652},{"uri":"Star_of_David","surface_form":"Star of David","offset":744},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jews","offset":763},{"uri":"Pink","surface_form":"pink","offset":997},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":1002}]}
