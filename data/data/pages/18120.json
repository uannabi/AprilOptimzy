{"id":18120,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochinese_tiger","text":"The Indochinese tiger (\"Panthera tigris corbetti\") is one of the six living tiger subspecies, and is found in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and southwestern China. The Indochinese tiger is also known as the \"Corbett's tiger\", named after Jim Corbett. It has been listed as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. In Myanmar it is the National animal of the country.\nDescription.\nMales are around 8\u20139\u00A0ft (2.4-2.7 meters) long, and weigh around 330 to 430 pounds. Females are around 7\u20138\u00A0ft (2.1-2.4 meters) long, and weigh around 221 to 287 pounds. Indochinese tigers are darker in colour than the Bengal tiger, and have narrow stripes which usually break up into a row of spots. Their belly, chin and cheeks are white in colour.\nWhere they live.\nThe Indochinese tiger is found throughout Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Burma and Vietnam. It also lived in China, but no Indochinese tiger has been seen in China since 2007.\nIt is found mostly in lowland and highland tropical deciduous, semi-evergreen and evergreen forests. The Indochinese tiger is also found in hilly and mountainous areas.\nFeeding.\nIndochinese tigers feed mainly on medium-sized and large-sized wild ungulates. Sambar deer, wild pig, serow, and large bovids such as banteng and young gaur make up most of the Indochinese tiger's diet. Some of its prey, like the kouprey and Schomburgk's deer, are extinct, but some, like the Eld's deer, hog deer and wild water buffalo, are still living but rare. Indochinese tigers also feed on muntjac deer, porcupines, macaques and hog badgers.\nThey have been known to supplement their diet with birds, fish, monkeys and reptiles.\nReproduction.\nFemale Indochinese tigers are pregnant for around 3\u20134 months, before giving birth to about 5 cubs. Newborn Indochinese tigers weigh around 1\u00A0kg (2\u00A0lb), and are blind and helpless. The mother feeds them milk for about 2 months and then the Indochinese tiger cubs are introduced to meat. Indochinese tiger cubs depend on their mother for the first 18 months and then they start hunting on their own.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":76},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":110},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":119},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":129},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":135},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":145},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":171},{"uri":"Jim_Corbett","surface_form":"Jim Corbett","offset":252},{"uri":"Endangered","surface_form":"Endangered","offset":287},{"uri":"International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature","surface_form":"International Union for the Conservation of Nature","offset":305},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":360},{"uri":"List_of_national_animals","surface_form":"National animal","offset":378},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":831},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":841},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":847},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":857},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":867},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":893},{"uri":"Lowland","surface_form":"lowland","offset":982},{"uri":"Highland","surface_form":"highland","offset":994},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":1003},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":1052},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":1100},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1110},{"uri":"Ungulate","surface_form":"ungulate","offset":1206},{"uri":"Sambar_deer","surface_form":"Sambar deer","offset":1217},{"uri":"Wild_pig","surface_form":"wild pig","offset":1230},{"uri":"Serow","surface_form":"serow","offset":1240},{"uri":"Bovid","surface_form":"bovid","offset":1257},{"uri":"Banteng","surface_form":"banteng","offset":1272},{"uri":"Gaur","surface_form":"gaur","offset":1290},{"uri":"Kouprey","surface_form":"kouprey","offset":1368},{"uri":"Schomburgk%27s_deer","surface_form":"Schomburgk's deer","offset":1380},{"uri":"Eld%27s_deer","surface_form":"Eld's deer","offset":1431},{"uri":"Hog_deer","surface_form":"hog deer","offset":1443},{"uri":"Wild_water_buffalo","surface_form":"wild water buffalo","offset":1456},{"uri":"Muntjac_deer","surface_form":"muntjac deer","offset":1535},{"uri":"Porcupine","surface_form":"porcupine","offset":1549},{"uri":"Macaque","surface_form":"macaque","offset":1561},{"uri":"Hog_badger","surface_form":"hog badger","offset":1574},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1638},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":1645},{"uri":"Monkey","surface_form":"monkey","offset":1651},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":1663},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":1717}]}
