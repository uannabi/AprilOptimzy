{"id":181248,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajab%C3%B3n_River","text":"The River Dajab\u00F3n is a river in the northern side of the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. It is 55 km long and flows to the north into the Manzanillo Bay, Atlantic Ocean.\nName.\nThe Ta\u00EDno name of the river was \"Guatapan\u00E1\" but the Spanish people that came to live in the Hispaniola island called it Dajab\u00F3n after the Ta\u00EDno name of the region (\"Dahaboon\"). Because this river was the border between the two colonies of the island, there were many fights during the 16th and 17th centuries and many people died here; then the French people began to name the river Massacre, written sometimes Masacre in Spanish; massacre means the killing of many people.\nCourse.\nThe source of the Dajab\u00F3n is at the \"Pico de Gallo\" mountain, on the northern side of the Cordillera Central mountain range. It flows through the Dajab\u00F3n province and then form part of the limits between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its mouth is in the Manzanillo Bay, on the Atlantic Ocean.\nIts discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 2.84 cubic metres per second at Don Miguel, a place a few kilometres south of the city of Dajab\u00F3n.\nThe city of Dajab\u00F3n is the most important Dominican city close to the river. It flows also through the city of Loma de Cabrera. The Haitian city of Ouanaminthe is also close to the river.\nThe most important tributary is the river \"Capotillo\" (in Haiti, river \"Bernard\"). There is not any important tributary in the lower part.\nThe river Capotillo is part of the northern border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic until it joins the river Dajab\u00F3n between the cities of Loma de Cabrera and Dajab\u00F3n. Then the border follows the course of the river Dajab\u00F3n.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":23},{"uri":"Cordillera_Central_(Hispaniola)","surface_form":"Cordillera Central","offset":57},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":77},{"uri":"Manzanillo_Bay","surface_form":"Manzanillo Bay","offset":146},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":162},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":188},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":236},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":276},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":411},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":529},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":606},{"uri":"Massacre","surface_form":"massacre","offset":615},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":670},{"uri":"Cordillera_Central_(Hispaniola)","surface_form":"Cordillera Central","offset":756},{"uri":"Dajab%C3%B3n_Province","surface_form":"Dajab\u00F3n","offset":812},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":870},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":884},{"uri":"Manzanillo_Bay","surface_form":"Manzanillo Bay","offset":924},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":978},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":988},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":1042},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":1050},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":1064},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":1081},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":1117},{"uri":"Dajab%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Dajab\u00F3n","offset":1170},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican","offset":1200},{"uri":"Loma_de_Cabrera","surface_form":"Loma de Cabrera","offset":1269},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haitian","offset":1290},{"uri":"Ouanaminthe","surface_form":"Ouanaminthe","offset":1306},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1365},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1456}]}
