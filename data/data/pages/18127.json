{"id":18127,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Sheepdog","text":"A Shetland Sheepdog is a kind of small dog whose ancestors came from the Shetland Islands. Many people call them \"Shelties\". They are popular pets in many countries. Shelties have the same origins with Rough Collie and Border Collie. Shelties are a working dog and are sometimes used for herding.\nA Sheltie can have a mix of several colors in its coat. Most shelties are sable and white (brown and white) or tri-color (black, white and tan). Their fur is long and they shed twice a year. Shelties range in size from 13 to 16 inches. They usually weigh about 25-30 pounds.\nShelties are very energetic dogs that run and bark a lot. They are great with children.\nIt was said that Shelties were sheep dogs so they try to please their master and have a strong sense of responsibility. They do not need very much discipline. Shelties rank in the top ten smartest dogs. They learn new things very quickly and remember them well. Shelties make great family pets as long as you do not mind a dog that barks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":39},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":49},{"uri":"Shetlands","surface_form":"Shetland Islands","offset":73},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":142},{"uri":"Rough_Collie","surface_form":"Rough Collie","offset":202},{"uri":"Border_Collie","surface_form":"Border Collie","offset":219},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coat","offset":347},{"uri":"Sable","surface_form":"sable","offset":371},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":448},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":525},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"pounds","offset":564}]}
