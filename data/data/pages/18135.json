{"id":18135,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief","text":"=\"preserve\">A belief is a firm thought that something is true, often based on revelation. Belief is usually a part of belonging to a religion. It is different to scientific knowledge that can be tested, but belief is not able to be tested. For example, a person may believe in God or gods.\nThe word is also used to describe what a person expects will happen based on limited information. For example, \"I believe Amy will come around today\". Belief is also something you believe in but you cannot prove exactly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thought","surface_form":"thought","offset":31},{"uri":"True","surface_form":"true","offset":57},{"uri":"Revelation","surface_form":"revelation","offset":78},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":133},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"knowledge","offset":173},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":277},{"uri":"Gods","surface_form":"gods","offset":284}]}
