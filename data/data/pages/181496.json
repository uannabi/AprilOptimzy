He wrote a lot of piano music. Many of these pieces are short pieces for children who are learning the piano. He also wrote larger works such as concertos for the piano and violin. In 1918, his family moved to Moscow, where he had formal lessons in music at the Scriabin Musical Institute. He was known for attempting to get children involved in music. In 1925 he began his training at the Moscow Conservatory, studying composition with Catoire and later with Miaskovsky, also continuing piano studies with Goldenveyzer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg","offset":36},{"uri":"30_December","surface_form":"30 December","offset":54},{"uri":"1904","surface_form":"1904","offset":66},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":77},{"uri":"18_February","surface_form":"18 February","offset":85},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":97},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russian","offset":109},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":117},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":124},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":225},{"uri":"Concerto","surface_form":"concerto","offset":352},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":370},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":380}]}
