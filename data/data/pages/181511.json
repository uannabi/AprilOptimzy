{"id":181511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turandot","text":"=\"preserve\">\"Turandot\" is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini, set to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. When Puccini died he had not finished the opera. It was later finished by Franco Alfano. It was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was conducted by Ettore Panizza.\nThe most famous song from the opera is the aria \"Nessun dorma\". This aria was sung by the three tenors Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jos\u00E9 Carreras, and used as the theme tune for the 1990 Soccer World Cup. This made Nessun dorma probably the best known of all opera arias.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":29},{"uri":"Giacomo_Puccini","surface_form":"Giacomo Puccini","offset":52},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":78},{"uri":"La_Scala","surface_form":"Teatro alla Scala","offset":254},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":275},{"uri":"25_April","surface_form":"25 April","offset":284},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":293},{"uri":"Arturo_Toscanini","surface_form":"Arturo Toscanini","offset":312},{"uri":"Aria","surface_form":"aria","offset":539},{"uri":"Luciano_Pavarotti","surface_form":"Luciano Pavarotti","offset":599},{"uri":"Placido_Domingo","surface_form":"Placido Domingo","offset":618},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Carreras","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Carreras","offset":638},{"uri":"1990_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"1990 Soccer World Cup","offset":688}]}
