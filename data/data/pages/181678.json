{"id":181678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady","text":"e=\"preserve\">First Lady is an unofficial title used for the wife of a non-monarchical head of state or chief executive.\nSome countries have a title, official or unofficial, that is or can be translated as \"first lady\". The title is not normally used for the wife of a head of government who is not also head of state.\nFirst Gentleman is used where the head of state's spouse has been a man, such as the Philippines or Malta. While there has never been a male spouse of a U.S. President, \"First Gentleman\" is used in the United States for the husband of a governor.\nFirst Spouse, a rare version of the title, can be used in either case where the spouse of a head of state is male or female. This term is used to promote gender equality and gender neutrality.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wife","surface_form":"wife","offset":60},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"monarchical","offset":74},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":86},{"uri":"Chief_executive","surface_form":"chief executive","offset":103},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":403},{"uri":"Malta","surface_form":"Malta","offset":418},{"uri":"List_of_first_gentlemen_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"First Gentleman","offset":488},{"uri":"Governor_(United_States)","surface_form":"governor","offset":555},{"uri":"Gender_equality","surface_form":"gender equality","offset":719},{"uri":"Gender_neutrality","surface_form":"gender neutrality","offset":739}]}
