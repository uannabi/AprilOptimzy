Sirotta made this word in 1937, for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros.\nThe company Google was named after the number \"googol.\" Its creators originally called it BackRub because it used backlinks to tell how important each page was. Someone suggested \"googolplex.\" They shortened it to \"googol\" and then spelled the word wrong when looking for a domain name that was not taken yet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Milton_Sirotta","surface_form":"Milton Sirotta","offset":206},{"uri":"Edward_Kasner","surface_form":"Edward Kasner","offset":251},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":334},{"uri":"Numeral","surface_form":"numeral","offset":360},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":405},{"uri":"Domain_name","surface_form":"domain name","offset":667}]}
