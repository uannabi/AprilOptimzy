The league is one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada. The players are one of the highest paid athlete in the world. A league is a competition between a number of teams. The teams play other teams, and the results are used to list the teams in order of who is The team at the top of the list (called a league table) is the best team and the team at the bottom is the worst team.\nIt is now the most popular professional league in the United States by number of television viewers. The NFL also has the highest per-game attendance of any professional league in the world; in the most recently completed 2014 season, the average crowd at an NFL game was more than 67,000. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, is an unofficial national holiday in the U.S., and is seen by more people than any other American television program.\nIn terms of number of players and people involved, the NFL is the largest professional sports league in the world. It is widely considered the top level of competition in the world for American football.\nHistory of the NFL.\nIn 1920, an American football league was formed. It was called the American Professional Football Association. In 1921 it changed its name to the National Football League. In 1960 another league was formed, called the American Football League. In 1970 the National Football League and the American Football League joined together so that the teams from each league could play each other. The league called the National Football League changed its name to the National Football Conference (usually called the NFC) and the league called the American Football League changed its name to the American Football Conference (usually called the AFC). The two conferences together are now called the National Football League. People can also call it by the acronym NFL for short.\nFlexible scheduling.\nSince the 2006 season, the NFL has used a \"flexible scheduling\" system for the last seven weeks of the regular season where there is a Sunday night game. The system is designed so that the league has the flexibility in selecting games to air on Sunday night that will feature the current hottest, streaking teams.\nUnder the system, all Sunday games in the affected weeks will tentatively have the \"early\" start time of 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT, except those played in the Pacific or Mountain time zones, which will have the tentative start time of 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT. On the Tuesday 12 days before the games, the league will move one game to the prime-time slot, and possibly move one or more 1 p.m. slotted games to the 4 p.m. slot. During the last week of the season, the league could re-schedule games as late as six days before the contests so that as many of the television networks as possible will be able to broadcast a game that has playoff implications.\nPlayoffs.\nAt the end of every NFL season, the eight teams that finish the season at the top of their leagues and two teams from each conference that were the best teams apart from the eight league winners (these four teams are called Wild Cards) enter a competition to see who is the best team in the whole league. This is called the Playoffs. There are a total of 12 teams in the Playoffs, six from the NFC and six from the AFC. The six teams in each conference are listed in order of how well they played in the season. This is called seeding and it is done to make it easier for the better teams to win. The teams that did not win their leagues (the Wild Cards) are always the fifth and sixth seeds in the list, even if they were better than a team that won a different league.\nWild Card games.\nIn the first part of the playoffs (called Wild Card Weekend) there are four games.\nThe teams that lose these games are not in the playoffs competition any more. Now there are only 8 teams left.\nDivision playoffs.\nIn the second part of the playoffs (called the Divisional Playoffs) there are four games.\nThe teams that lose these games are not in the playoffs competition any more. Now there are only 4 teams left.\nConference championships.\nIn the third part of the playoffs (called the Conference Championship Games) there are two games.\nSuper Bowl.\nThe last part of the playoffs is called the Super Bowl. The AFC Champion and the NFC Champion teams play each other to decide who is the best team in the NFL.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":41},{"uri":"Major_professional_sports_leagues_of_the_United_States_and_Canada","surface_form":"major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada","offset":126},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":571},{"uri":"Super_Bowl","surface_form":"Super Bowl","offset":834},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":1936},{"uri":"Super_Bowl","surface_form":"Super Bowl","offset":4333}]}
