{"id":181872,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshunt_railway_station","text":"Cheshunt railway station serves the town of Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, England. It is on the West Anglia Main Line, and train services are provided by Abellio Greater Anglia and London Overground.\nFormer operator National Express East Anglia has fulfilled a franchise commitment to extend the bay platform at Cheshunt to accommodate 8-coach trains (previously it could only accommodate up to 6 coaches). The works also involved replacing all existing station buildings, and replacing the station footbridge. Construction started in December 2005 and was largely complete by August 2006.\nIn the 2012 Summer Olympics, Cheshunt station (along with Waltham Cross, the next southbound station) will serve as the main access point for the Broxbourne whitewater canoe and kayak slalom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cheshunt","surface_form":"Cheshunt","offset":44},{"uri":"Hertfordshire","surface_form":"Hertfordshire","offset":56},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":71},{"uri":"West_Anglia_Main_Line","surface_form":"West Anglia Main Line","offset":93},{"uri":"Abellio_Greater_Anglia","surface_form":"Abellio Greater Anglia","offset":151},{"uri":"London_Overground","surface_form":"London Overground","offset":178},{"uri":"Bay_platform","surface_form":"bay platform","offset":293},{"uri":"Footbridge","surface_form":"footbridge","offset":496},{"uri":"2012_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2012 Summer Olympics","offset":594},{"uri":"Waltham_Cross_railway_station","surface_form":"Waltham Cross","offset":645},{"uri":"Broxbourne_(canoeing_venue)","surface_form":"Broxbourne whitewater canoe and kayak slalom","offset":733}]}
