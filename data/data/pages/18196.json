{"id":18196,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">A real number is a rational or irrational number, and is a number which can be expressed using decimal expansion. Usually when people say \"number\", they usually mean \"real number\". The official symbol for real numbers is a bold R, or a blackboard bold formula_1.\nSome real numbers are called positive. A positive number is \"bigger than zero\". Real numbers can be thought of as an infinitely long ruler. There is a mark for zero and every other number, in order of size. Unlike a physical ruler, there are numbers below zero. These are called negative real numbers. Negative numbers are \"smaller than zero\". They are like a mirror image of the positive numbers, except that they are given minus signs (\u2013) so that they are labeled differently from the positive numbers.\nThere are infinitely many real numbers, because there is no smallest or biggest real number. No matter how many real numbers are counted, there are always more which need to be counted. There are no empty spaces between real numbers, which means that if two different real numbers are taken, there will always be a third real number between them. This is always true no matter how close together the first two numbers are.\nIf a positive number is added to another positive number, then that number gets bigger. If zero, which is also a real number, is added to a number, then that number does not change. If a negative number is added to another number, that number gets smaller.\nThe real numbers are uncountable, which means that there is no way to put all the real numbers into a sequence. Any sequence of real numbers will miss out a real number, even if the sequence is infinite. This makes the real numbers special, because even though there are infinitely many real numbers and infinitely many integers, there are \"more\" real numbers than integers. This is often expressed by saying that the integers are \"countable\" and that the real numbers are \"uncountable\".\nSome simpler number systems are inside the real numbers. For example, the rational numbers and integers are all in the real numbers. There are also more complicated number systems than the real numbers, such as the complex numbers. Every real number is a complex number, but not every complex number is a real number. Similarly, 3/7 is a rational number but not an integer.\nDifferent types of real numbers.\nThe number 0 (\"zero\") is special. Sometimes it is taken as part of the subset to be considered, and at other times it is not. It is the Identity element for addition, which means that adding zero does not change the original number. For multiplication, the identity element is 1.\nOne real number that is not rational is formula_1. This number is irrational. If a square is drawn with sides that are one unit long, then the length of the line between its opposite corners will be formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rational_number","surface_form":"rational","offset":32},{"uri":"Irrational_number","surface_form":"irrational","offset":44},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":55},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive number","offset":317},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":349},{"uri":"Ruler","surface_form":"ruler","offset":409},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":436},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative real numbers","offset":555},{"uri":"Countable_set","surface_form":"uncountable","offset":1482},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":1563},{"uri":"Countable_set","surface_form":"countable","offset":1893},{"uri":"Uncountable_set","surface_form":"uncountable","offset":1935},{"uri":"Rational_number","surface_form":"rational number","offset":2023},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":2164},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":2371},{"uri":"Identity_element","surface_form":"Identity element","offset":2492},{"uri":"One","surface_form":"1","offset":2633},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":2719}]}
