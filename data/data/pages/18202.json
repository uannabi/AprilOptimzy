Studio albums are recorded at a recording studio. Live albums are normally recorded while the musicians are performing for an audience. Live albums are usually recorded at concerts.\nTracks== .\nAlbums are normally separated into \"Tracks\". Each track is a part of the album which has one song in it. The term is often used to mean a specific song on the album by number.
