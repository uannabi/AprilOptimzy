{"id":18205,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Island","text":"Baker Island is a small coral island, or atoll, in the North Pacific Ocean. It is just above the equator. It belongs to the United States. The United States Department of the Interior is in charge of the island. It is called the \"Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge\".\nThe island has no trees. The island is surrounded by a coral reef. This makes the atoll hard to approach in a boat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":24},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":30},{"uri":"Atoll","surface_form":"atoll","offset":41},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":61},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":97},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":124},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_the_Interior","surface_form":"United States Department of the Interior","offset":143},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":325},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":380}]}
