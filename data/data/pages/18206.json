{"id":18206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hermaphrodite is a term which comes from Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. It is used as a scientific term in biology.\nIn zoology, an animal which can produce both sperm and ova is a hermaphrodite. As an example, most earthworms are hermaphrodites. A simultaneous hermaphrodite has both sets of sex organs throughout life. A sequential hermaphrodite has ovaries at first, replaced by a testis later, or the other way round.\nIn botany, hermaphrodite is used for 'complete' flowers with both male and female parts, and for plants which have bisexual reproductive units. See flowering plant sexuality for details.\nPeople who are intersex may have a very small penis and no testicles, or a very small and short vagina and a large clitoris that looks like a penis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hermaphroditus","surface_form":"Hermaphroditus","offset":54},{"uri":"Hermes","surface_form":"Hermes","offset":81},{"uri":"Aphrodite","surface_form":"Aphrodite","offset":92},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":138},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoology","offset":150},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":162},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":192},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"ova","offset":202},{"uri":"Earthworm","surface_form":"earthworm","offset":246},{"uri":"Ovaries","surface_form":"ovaries","offset":382},{"uri":"Testis","surface_form":"testis","offset":414},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":455},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":500},{"uri":"Flowering_plant_sexuality","surface_form":"flowering plant sexuality","offset":600},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":685},{"uri":"Testicles","surface_form":"testicles","offset":698},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":735},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoris","offset":754}]}
