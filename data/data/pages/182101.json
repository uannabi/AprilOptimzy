{"id":182101,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Knappertsbusch","text":"Hans Knappertsbusch (born Elberfeld (Wuppertal), 12 March 1888; died Munich, 25 October 1965) was a German conductor. He conducted some of Europes best orchestras. He was especially known for conducting the music of Richard Wagner, Anton Bruckner and Richard Strauss.\nLife.\nKnappertsbusch was born in Elberfeld, today's Wuppertal. His parents did not want him to be a musician and sent him to study philosophy at Bonn University. However, he soon started to go to the Cologne Conservatory to study conducting with Fritz Steinbach. For a few summers, he was assistant to Siegfried Wagner and Hans Richter at Bayreuth. When Bruno Walter left Munich to go to New York, Knappertsbusch succeeded him as conductor of the Bavarian State Orchestra. He stayed in Munich until 1936 when the Nazis made it impossible for him to continue. He then went to Vienna. There he conducted the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic.\nWhen World War II ended, Knappertsbusch went back to Munich where he settled again. He often visited Vienna to conduct there. He appeared regularly at the Bayreuth Festival.\nKnappertsbusch was a large man who was very popular with his audiences. He did not often travel abroad, and was never very interested in music that was being composed at the time. He did not like long rehearsals. He often thought that his orchestras were musical enough to play well without rehearsal. His recordings of \"Parsifal\" are very good indeed.\nKnappertsbusch died in Munich in 1965.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wuppertal","surface_form":"Wuppertal","offset":37},{"uri":"12_March","surface_form":"12 March","offset":49},{"uri":"1888","surface_form":"1888","offset":58},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":69},{"uri":"25_October","surface_form":"25 October","offset":77},{"uri":"1965","surface_form":"1965","offset":88},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":100},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":107},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":216},{"uri":"Anton_Bruckner","surface_form":"Anton Bruckner","offset":232},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":251},{"uri":"Wuppertal","surface_form":"Wuppertal","offset":320},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":399},{"uri":"Bonn_University","surface_form":"Bonn University","offset":413},{"uri":"Cologne","surface_form":"Cologne","offset":468},{"uri":"Conservatory","surface_form":"Conservatory","offset":476},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conducting","offset":498},{"uri":"Siegfried_Wagner","surface_form":"Siegfried Wagner","offset":570},{"uri":"Hans_Richter","surface_form":"Hans Richter","offset":591},{"uri":"Bayreuth","surface_form":"Bayreuth","offset":607},{"uri":"Bruno_Walter","surface_form":"Bruno Walter","offset":622},{"uri":"Bavarian_State_Orchestra","surface_form":"Bavarian State Orchestra","offset":715},{"uri":"1936","surface_form":"1936","offset":767},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":781},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":843},{"uri":"Vienna_State_Opera","surface_form":"Vienna State Opera","offset":874},{"uri":"Vienna_Philharmonic","surface_form":"Vienna Philharmonic","offset":901},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":927},{"uri":"Bayreuth_Festival","surface_form":"Bayreuth Festival","offset":1077},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":1157},{"uri":"Rehearsal","surface_form":"rehearsal","offset":1297},{"uri":"Parsifal","surface_form":"Parsifal","offset":1417}]}
