It was also the symbol of the Kingdom of Le\u00F3n before the kingdom of Spain existed. It was used for the first time in the coins minted by King Alfonso VII (1126\u20131157). Before that, the symbol mainly used by the Leonese kings in documents and on their coins was the cross. Since Alfonso VII's reign, the cross became more and more often replaced by the lion.\nThe first written reference of the lion as a symbol of the King and, therefore, of the kingdom, is in the \"Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris\". This was written during the reign of Alfonso VII. The lion is one of the oldest symbols used in heraldry in Europe that still exist. It is earlier than the castle, which was used by the neigbouring Kingdom of Castile.\nThe flag of Le\u00F3n is red, with the coat of arms of in the middle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lion","surface_form":"lion","offset":4},{"uri":"Heraldry","surface_form":"heraldic","offset":16},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":25},{"uri":"Le%C3%B3n%2C_Spain","surface_form":"Le\u00F3n","offset":55},{"uri":"Le%C3%B3n_(province)","surface_form":"its province","offset":64},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Kingdom of Le\u00F3n","offset":108},{"uri":"Alfonso_VII_of_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Alfonso VII","offset":220},{"uri":"Cross","surface_form":"cross","offset":342},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":730},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Castile","surface_form":"Kingdom of Castile","offset":772},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":812}]}
