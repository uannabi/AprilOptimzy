For example, the eight binary digits in a byte has been called an octet. The term \"octet\" is used to avoid ambiguity, because some old computers had different numbers of bits per byte. It is mainly used with describing IP addresses. An IPv4 address consists of four octets (which can be written as their decimal values 255.255.255.255).\nIn France, French Canada and Romania, \"octet\" is used in common language instead of \"byte\" to talk about 8 bits, for example, a megabyte (MB) is called a megaoctet (Mo).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ensemble","surface_form":"ensemble","offset":96},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrument","offset":125},{"uri":"Voice","surface_form":"voice","offset":140},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":301},{"uri":"Ambiguity","surface_form":"ambiguity","offset":366},{"uri":"Internet_protocol","surface_form":"IP addresses","offset":478},{"uri":"IPv4","surface_form":"IPv4","offset":495},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":599},{"uri":"French_Canadian","surface_form":"French Canada","offset":607},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":625}]}
