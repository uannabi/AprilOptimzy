{"id":18276,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Basil%27s_Cathedral","text":"St. Basil's Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of Intercession, is a very famous cathedral in Moscow, Russia. It was commissioned by Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible), for Saint Basil the Blessed. It is in the area called Red Square. It was built in 1555-1561.\nThe cathedral is very magnificent. It has 8 distinctive onion-shaped towers. The building itself is made up of separate chapels. There is a ninth spire in the middle, forming an eight-point star. The Cathedral should not be mistaken for the Moscow Kremlin.\nThe cathedral has escaped destruction many times. Napoleon Bonaparte decided to take it to Paris, but such an undertaking would have been impossible. Instead, he ordered it to be demolished. Explosives were lit, but torrential rain suddenly started, extinguishing the fuses.\nJoseph Stalin also ordered it to be destroyed, since it interfered with parades. Pyotr Baranovsky, who was the architect in charge, objected and was sent to the GULAG but the demolition was cancelled. The city of Moscow also caught fire numerous times, and the cathedral wasn't spared. Even so, it still stands to this very day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":85},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":98},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":106},{"uri":"Red_Square","surface_form":"Red Square","offset":220},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":315},{"uri":"Spire","surface_form":"spire","offset":405},{"uri":"Moscow_Kremlin","surface_form":"Moscow Kremlin","offset":500},{"uri":"Napoleon_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Napoleon Bonaparte","offset":566},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":791},{"uri":"GULAG","surface_form":"GULAG","offset":952}]}
