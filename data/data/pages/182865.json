Puppy Linux is sometimes called a mini distribution because of its size (approximately 100MB) when compared to other GNU/Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu.\nPuppy Linux, which was started by Barry Kauler in June 2003, runs well on low-end personal computers (some of which have less than 32MB RAM.) Currently (May 2009) the latest version of this Linux distribution is Puppy Linux 4.2 \"Deep Thought.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":18},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":39},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":65},{"uri":"MB","surface_form":"MB","offset":420}]}
