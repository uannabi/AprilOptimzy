{"id":18299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_grunt","text":"=\"preserve\">A death grunt is when a singer uses a scream which is very low and deep. It is used in many types of music, but usually death metal. In many people's opinions, it is hard to understand the death grunt. However, some people who listen to them a lot think they are not so hard to understand. Some people believe that death grunts in music sound \"scary\", so they do not like them.\nBands that use death growls include Necrophagist, Morbid Angel, Opeth, and many more.\nBands that use higher screams that come from the throat include Escape the Fate, Alesana and Greeley Estates.\nOther terms for death grunts are death growls, harsh vocals, and unclean vocals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":36},{"uri":"Screaming","surface_form":"scream","offset":50},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":113},{"uri":"Death_metal","surface_form":"death metal","offset":132},{"uri":"Necrophagist","surface_form":"Necrophagist","offset":426},{"uri":"Morbid_Angel","surface_form":"Morbid Angel","offset":440},{"uri":"Opeth","surface_form":"Opeth","offset":454},{"uri":"Escape_the_Fate","surface_form":"Escape the Fate","offset":540},{"uri":"Alesana","surface_form":"Alesana","offset":557},{"uri":"Greeley_Estates","surface_form":"Greeley Estates","offset":569}]}
