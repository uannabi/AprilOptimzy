{"id":183006,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-independent_reaction","text":"In photosynthesis, a light-independent reaction takes place in plant chloroplasts. In this process, sugars are made from carbon dioxide.\nThe process, known as the Calvin cycle, uses products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various enzymes. Therefore, the light-independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction.\nSugars made in the light-independent reactions are moved around the plant (translocation). This takes place in the grana region of the chloroplast. It is anaerobic (does not use oxygen).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":3},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplast","offset":69},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":100},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":121},{"uri":"Calvin_cycle","surface_form":"Calvin cycle","offset":163},{"uri":"ATP","surface_form":"ATP","offset":225},{"uri":"NADPH","surface_form":"NADPH","offset":233},{"uri":"Enzymes","surface_form":"enzymes","offset":252},{"uri":"Translocation_(botany)","surface_form":"translocation","offset":430},{"uri":"Anaerobic","surface_form":"anaerobic","offset":509}]}
