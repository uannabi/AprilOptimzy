Goths often wear black and unusual jewelry. Both goth men and goth women often wear make-up.\nThe \"goth subculture\" originated in the early 1980s among fans of the first gothic rock group, Bauhaus.\nThe word goth comes from the word \"Gothic\" which actually means \"gloomy\" or \"dark\". This meaning of the word comes from \"gothic fiction\", a type of literature popular during the late 18th and early 19th century.\nPeople who call themselves a goth are those who live up the meaning of the name through wearing clothes or putting on makeup that is in colours that represent death, decay, or gloominess, such as the colour black, deathly white face makeup, dark bloody red colours, or the tones of the colour puce.\nGoth people may also make and listen to \"Goth music\".\nGoths wear normal black clothes and mix them with other colours to make a new look.\nGoth people are often mistaken to be emo or punk because of the everyday stereotypes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Goths","surface_form":"Germanic tribe","offset":48},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":108},{"uri":"Gothic_rock","surface_form":"gothic music","offset":130},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothes","offset":174},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":200},{"uri":"Jewelry","surface_form":"jewelry","offset":218},{"uri":"Men","surface_form":"men","offset":237},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":250},{"uri":"Make-up","surface_form":"make-up","offset":267},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":322},{"uri":"Bauhaus_(band)","surface_form":"Bauhaus","offset":371},{"uri":"Gothic_fiction","surface_form":"gothic fiction","offset":501},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":751},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":814},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"bloody","offset":838},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":845},{"uri":"Puce","surface_form":"puce","offset":885},{"uri":"Emo","surface_form":"emo","offset":1066},{"uri":"Punk","surface_form":"punk","offset":1073},{"uri":"Stereotype","surface_form":"stereotypes","offset":1102}]}
