They are common in the Eastern Mediterranean. Drinks include anise-flavored liqueurs, such as \"arak\", \"ouzo\", \"raki\" or different wines. These dishes are similar to the \"tapas\" of Spain or finger food.\nIn Levantine cuisines and in the Caucasus region (especially in Azerbaijan and Georgia), these dishes are served as a part of any large-scale meal. When not accompanied by alcohol, meze is known in the Arab world as \"muqabbilat\" (Arabic for \"starters\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":15},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":29},{"uri":"Bulgarian_language","surface_form":"Bulgarian","offset":50},{"uri":"Macedonian_language","surface_form":"Macedonian","offset":73},{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":102},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":127},{"uri":"Eastern_Mediterranean","surface_form":"Eastern Mediterranean","offset":307},{"uri":"Arak_(distilled_beverage)","surface_form":"\"arak\"","offset":378},{"uri":"Ouzo","surface_form":"ouzo","offset":387},{"uri":"Raki_(alcoholic_beverage)","surface_form":"raki","offset":395},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":414},{"uri":"Tapas","surface_form":"tapas","offset":454},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":464},{"uri":"Finger_food","surface_form":"finger food","offset":473},{"uri":"Levantine_cuisine","surface_form":"Levantine cuisine","offset":489},{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucasus","offset":519},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":550},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":565},{"uri":"Arab_world","surface_form":"Arab world","offset":688},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":716}]}
