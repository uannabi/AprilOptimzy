{"id":183061,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_food","text":"Finger food is the name for a number of foods that are usually eaten with the hands, as opposed to using utensils, like forks, knives or chopsticks. In some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; for example, Ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in \"injera\" bread.\nExamples of finger food are small beef pies, sausage rolls, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, chicken drumsticks or wings, spring rolls, small quiches, samosas, onion bhajis, potato wedges, vol au vents, and risotto balls. Other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include pizza, hot dogs, fruit and bread.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":40},{"uri":"Fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":120},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knives","offset":127},{"uri":"Chopstick","surface_form":"chopstick","offset":137},{"uri":"Ethiopian_cuisine","surface_form":"Ethiopian cuisine","offset":224},{"uri":"Injera","surface_form":"injera","offset":284},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":292},{"uri":"Pie","surface_form":"pie","offset":338},{"uri":"Spring_roll","surface_form":"spring roll","offset":437},{"uri":"Quiche","surface_form":"quiche","offset":457},{"uri":"Samosa","surface_form":"samosa","offset":466},{"uri":"Bhujia","surface_form":"onion bhajis","offset":475},{"uri":"Potato_wedges","surface_form":"potato wedges","offset":489},{"uri":"Vol_au_vent","surface_form":"vol au vent","offset":504},{"uri":"Risotto","surface_form":"risotto","offset":522},{"uri":"Pizza","surface_form":"pizza","offset":608},{"uri":"Hot_dogs","surface_form":"hot dogs","offset":615},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":625},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":635}]}
