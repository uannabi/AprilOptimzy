{"id":18309,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat","text":"Montserrat is a Caribbean island. It is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. The governor of Montserrat is Deborah Barnes-Jones. The capital is officially Plymouth, but the government has moved to Brades after a volcano, Chances Peak, destroyed Plymouth in 1995.\nBefore the island was called Montserrat, Kalinago and Ta\u00EDno people had lived in the region for a long time. They knew it as Alliouagana. When Europeans began to colonize the Caribbean in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, they committed genocide against the indigenous peoples in the islands and replaced the indigenous names with European ones. Monsterrat was a name chosen by Christopher Columbus.\nThe British Empire claimed Alliouagana as their property and used Columbus's name for the island. They still claim to own the island today.\nMontserrat was colonized mostly by Irish Catholics. They brought many black slaves to the island and forced them to work on sugar plantations. The work the slaves made many plantations grow wealthy. When slavery was made illegal in the 1830s, the British Empire paid all the slave owners.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":16},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":26},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":69},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":89},{"uri":"Deborah_Barnes-Jones","surface_form":"Deborah Barnes-Jones","offset":115},{"uri":"Plymouth%2C_Montserrat","surface_form":"Plymouth","offset":163},{"uri":"Brades","surface_form":"Brades","offset":205},{"uri":"Chances_Peak","surface_form":"Chances Peak","offset":229},{"uri":"Kalinago_people","surface_form":"Kalinago","offset":312},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":325},{"uri":"European","surface_form":"Europeans","offset":413},{"uri":"Colonize","surface_form":"colonize","offset":432},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th","offset":462},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th","offset":468},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th","offset":478},{"uri":"Genocide","surface_form":"genocide","offset":509},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous peoples","offset":530},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":650},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":676},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":847},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholics","offset":853},{"uri":"Slave_trade","surface_form":"brought","offset":869},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black","offset":882},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slaves","offset":888},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":936},{"uri":"Plantations","surface_form":"plantations","offset":942}]}
