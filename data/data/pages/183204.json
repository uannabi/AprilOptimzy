It has interior angles of 162 and exterior angles of 198.\nRegular icosagon.\nThe \"regular icosagon\" has Schl\u00E4fli symbol, and can also be constructed as a truncated decagon, t, or a twice-truncated pentagon, tt.\nArea.\nThe amount of space a regular icosagon takes up is\n\"a\" is the length of one of its sides.\nUses.\nThe Big Wheel on the popular US game show \"The Price Is Right\" has an icosagonal cross-section.\nThe Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare's acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989.\nAs a golygonal path, the swastika is considered to be an irregular icosagon.\nA regular square, pentagon, and icosagon can completely fill a plane vertex.\nDissection.\nCoxeter states that every parallel-sided 2\"m\"-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the icosagon, \"m\"=10, and it can be divided into 45: 5 squares and 4 sets of 10 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 10-cube, with 45 of 11520 faces.
