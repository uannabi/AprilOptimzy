He also wrote the words for an anthem for Kashmir, as well as patriotic songs during the war against India in 1965.\nHe studied in a mosque and then in a local school to 7th grade. He then did a lot of things to further educate himself. The great Persian poet, Maulana Ghulam Qadir Bilgrami, gave him advice on writing poetry. Hafeez worked hard to earn a reputation as a poet. One of Hafeez's most famous poems is \"Shahnam-e-Islam\", which tells the history of Islam in verse. His poems, written in a blend of Hindi and Urdu, are about romance, religion, patriotism and life. It is known for its gentle rhythm.\nLong before Hafeez Jullundhri's lyrics were adopted as the national anthem in 1950s, Pakistan had an anthem written by Jagannath Azad, son of Lahore-based poet Tilok Chand Mahroom. Azad was asked to write the anthem three days before the creation of Pakistan in 1947.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punjab_(India)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":79},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":87},{"uri":"Partition_of_India","surface_form":"partition of India","offset":104},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":143},{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":178},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":197},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":249},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":339},{"uri":"Persian_people","surface_form":"Persian","offset":453},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":667},{"uri":"Hindi","surface_form":"Hindi","offset":716},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":726},{"uri":"Romance_(love)","surface_form":"romance","offset":742},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":751},{"uri":"Patriotism","surface_form":"patriotism","offset":761},{"uri":"Jagannath_Azad","surface_form":"Jagannath Azad","offset":936},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":959}]}
