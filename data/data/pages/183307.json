{"id":183307,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","text":"Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB radiation) is radiation in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which comes from all directions in outer space. It is known to come from our earliest infant universe. Since the universe is very large, and the speed of light is constant, we know that when the CMB light arrives from the infant universe, it arrives as the oldest signal that we can detect.\nDuring the Big Bang, a lot of high-energy radiation was created. Then, the universe became bigger and colder. Therefore, the high-energy photons lost most of their original energy. Now, as a result, that radiation is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum (the microwave part has quite low energy). The cosmic microwave background is the radiation that has been traveling without hitting anything ever since the time the universe became transparent, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\nArno Penzias and Robert Wilson first detected the CMB radiation. Scientists think that the existence of CMB radiation is important evidence, with red shift, that the Big Bang theory is true.\nNo explanation for this is known.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":57},{"uri":"Microwave","surface_form":"microwave","offset":74},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_spectrum","surface_form":"electromagnetic spectrum","offset":96},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":157},{"uri":"Big_Bang","surface_form":"Big Bang","offset":424},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":488},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"photon","offset":550},{"uri":"Arno_Penzias","surface_form":"Arno Penzias","offset":918},{"uri":"Robert_Wilson","surface_form":"Robert Wilson","offset":935},{"uri":"Red_shift","surface_form":"red shift","offset":1064}]}
