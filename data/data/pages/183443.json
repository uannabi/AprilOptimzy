{"id":183443,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin","text":"Sakhalin (,; Japanese: or; or \u85A9\u54C8\u6797/\u8428\u54C8\u6797 \"S\u00E0h\u0101l\u00EDn\"), also known as Saghalien, is a large, long Russian island in the North Pacific, placed between 45\u00B050' and 54\u00B024'\u00A0N. It is part of Russia territory and is its largest island, administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast. The indigenous peoples of the island are the Sakhalin Ainu, Oroks, and Nivkhs. Most Ainu relocated to Hokkaid\u014D when Japanese were gone from the island in 1949.\nSakhalin is the subject of a whole book by Anton Chekhov (1895), reprinted in many Russian editions of his collected works. It has been translated into English. Of other old books, there is an interesting one by an Englishman, Charles H. Hawes, To the Uttermost East. (N.Y.: Scribner;s, 1904). Now, however, the island is experiencing an oil boom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":13},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":179},{"uri":"Sakhalin_Oblast","surface_form":"Sakhalin Oblast","offset":247},{"uri":"Ainu_people","surface_form":"Ainu","offset":318},{"uri":"Oroks","surface_form":"Oroks","offset":324},{"uri":"Nivkhs","surface_form":"Nivkhs","offset":335},{"uri":"Hokkaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Hokkaid\u014D","offset":366}]}
