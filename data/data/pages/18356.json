Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act.\nGeorge Stevens, Jr. was the first CEO. Since 1980, Jean Picker Firstenberg has been CEO.\nOlder figures in AFI's Conservatory train newer people.\nThe institute also wants to keep old film, which could soon be destroyed.\nEven though its name only mentions film, AFI also works on television and video.\nIn 1973, the AFI began handing out Life Achievement Awards.\nIn 1998, when American cinema had existed for 100 years, AFI began its 100 Years Series, which helped people become interested in the history of movies.\nRecently, it built and started the AFI Silver theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland near Washington, D.C.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":53},{"uri":"National_Endowment_for_the_Arts","surface_form":"National Endowment for the Arts","offset":116},{"uri":"Lyndon_B._Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon B.
