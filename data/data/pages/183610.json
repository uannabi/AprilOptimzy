{"id":183610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal","text":"Liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid, but that show certain properties of a solid crystal. A liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid crystal phases. Different phases are different because their optical properties are different. Using a microscope and a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will have different textures. This is also shown in the image.\nThe contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in an LC phase (just as water is not always in the liquid phase: it may also be found in the solid and gaseous phase).\nLiquid crystal display<nowiki/>s use the optical properties of liquid crystals to control light.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":28},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":56},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"solid crystal","offset":102},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":171},{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"optical","offset":321},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscope","offset":363},{"uri":"Polarization","surface_form":"polarized","offset":380},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":390},{"uri":"Texture","surface_form":"texture","offset":456},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":738},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gaseous phase","offset":817},{"uri":"Liquid_crystal_display","surface_form":"Liquid crystal display","offset":833}]}
