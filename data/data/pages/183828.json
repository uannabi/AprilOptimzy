During this time the League of Nations was created, which was made to bring peace to the World, however this league did a bad job in preventing problems with Nazi Germany, which broke its treaty it signed in 1918. Also with the growing threat of Japan, and the invasion of China. Soon the Soviet Union and Italy were beginning to rise as international powers.
