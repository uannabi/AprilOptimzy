He attempted to reform the Soviet government. In order to do this, he had to change the way the public thought of Stalin, who was the leader of the old ways that Khrushchev wanted to change. He did this in many ways, but most importantly he took Stalin's body out of the mausoleum in Red Square and he changed the name of Stalingrad (which was named after Stalin) to Volgograd.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":50},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin's","offset":77},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":93},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":151},{"uri":"Nikita_Khrushchev","surface_form":"Nikita Khrushchev","offset":182},{"uri":"Reform","surface_form":"reform","offset":259},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":277},{"uri":"Mausoleum","surface_form":"mausoleum","offset":514},{"uri":"Red_Square","surface_form":"Red Square","offset":527},{"uri":"Stalingrad","surface_form":"Stalingrad","offset":565},{"uri":"Volgograd","surface_form":"Volgograd","offset":610}]}
