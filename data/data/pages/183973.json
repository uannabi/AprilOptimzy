{"id":183973,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory","text":"=\"preserve\">A Pyrrhic victory is battle won at too great a cost.\nIt is one in which the side that won the victory suffers very badly. A Pyrrhic victory may take place when the victorious army has lost a huge number of men or when the enemy army has reinforcements about to arrive which greatly outnumber the winning army and mean that the chances of a second victory are very low. A Pyrrhic victory is named after King Pyrrhus of Epirus. He won a battle against the Romans in 280 BC but many of his men and most of his friends and top commanders died in the battle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":33},{"uri":"Victory","surface_form":"victory","offset":106},{"uri":"Pyrrhus","surface_form":"Pyrrhus","offset":419},{"uri":"Epirus","surface_form":"Epirus","offset":430},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":466}]}
