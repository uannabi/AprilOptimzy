His house was the first in the world to be lit by electric light bulbs.\nIn 1904, Swan was knighted, awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. He had already received the highest award in France, the L\u00E9gion d'honneur, when he visited an international exhibition in Paris in 1881. The exhibition included exhibits of his inventions, and the city was lit with electric light, thanks to Swan's invention.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":60},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":68},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":82},{"uri":"Incandescent_light_bulb","surface_form":"incandescent light bulb","offset":132},{"uri":"Thomas_Edison","surface_form":"Thomas Edison","offset":177},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":304},{"uri":"L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur","surface_form":"L\u00E9gion d'honneur","offset":454}]}
