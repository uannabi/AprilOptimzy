{"id":18419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_tiger","text":"The Caspian tiger (\"Panthera tigris virgata\") is an extinct sub species of the tiger. It was the most western sub species of the tiger, very close to Europe. They became extinct in the 1970s. They were found in Turkey, Armenia, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Iran, Mongolia, and Georgia.\nRecent research by scientists looking at the tiger's DNA, have found that it is almost identical to the Siberian tiger. They now believe that the two species of tiger may not have become separate until the 1900s.\nDescription.\nThe Caspian tiger was the second largest of the tiger species. It had a bigger, muscular body, with longer strong legs. It had large paws and more claws. It had small, short ears. The color was different from other tiger subspecies, with yellow to gold fur with light to dark brown stripes. The chest and stomach area are white with yellow stripes. In winter it grew longer fur. It was the furriest of all the tiger subspecies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":52},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":64},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":79},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":150},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":185},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":211},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":219},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":228},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":234},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":246},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":252},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":266},{"uri":"Siberian_tiger","surface_form":"Siberian tiger","offset":379}]}
