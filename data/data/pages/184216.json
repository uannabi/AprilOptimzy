The lowest temperatures sometimes reach \u221235\u00A0\u00B0C and more low in northern areas. Feature of a climate is significant duration of solar light which constitutes 2180\u20132250 hours (182\u2013186 days) per a year. Duration of the warm period constitutes 240\u2013275 days. Average temperatures of July constitute +23,5\u00A0\u00B0C \u2026 +25,5\u00A0\u00B0C.
