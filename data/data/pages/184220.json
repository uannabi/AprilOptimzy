She came to power by a Coup d'\u00E9tat that deposed her husband, who was killed.\nCatherine greatly increased the power of the crown. In wars against the Ottoman Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth she conquered much land in the west and south. During Catherine's rule, Russia became a strong power in Europe.\nEarly life.\nCatherine was born in Stettin, which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the time.
