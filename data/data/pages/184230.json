{"id":184230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia","text":"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the Yugoslav state that existed from the second half of World War II (1945) until it was formally dissolved in 1992 (\"de facto\" dissolved in 1991 with no leaders representing it) amid the Yugoslav wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1992, the two remaining states still committed to a union, Serbia and Montenegro, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which had not been recognized as the successor of the SFRY by international leaders.\nA provisional parliament met in August 1945, comprising delegates from all parts of the country plus 68 representatives of prewar political parties and 13 independents. Elections for a bicameral parliament, which was to comprise a federal council and a council of nationalities and was to have the powers of a constituent assembly, were held on 11 November 1945: no political opposition to the People's Front was allowed. This situation caused the three royalist representatives, Grol-Subasic-Juraj Sutej, to secede from the provisional government indeed voting was on a single list of People's Front candidates with provision for opposition votes to be cast in separate voting boxes but this procedure made electors identifiable by OZNA agents. A powerful election campaign was mounted to ensure a large majority for Josip Broz Tito's People's Front, the general organization behind which the communist party operated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Former Country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslav state","offset":53},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":105},{"uri":"Yugoslav_wars","surface_form":"Yugoslav wars","offset":237},{"uri":"Socialist_state","surface_form":"socialist state","offset":261},{"uri":"Federation","surface_form":"federation","offset":283},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":305},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":329},{"uri":"Republic_of_Macedonia","surface_form":"Macedonia","offset":338},{"uri":"Montenegro","surface_form":"Montenegro","offset":349},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":361},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":373},{"uri":"Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia","offset":479},{"uri":"OZNA","surface_form":"OZNA","offset":1329},{"uri":"Josip_Broz_Tito","surface_form":"Josip Broz Tito","offset":1414}]}
