{"id":184238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achlorhydria","text":"=\"preserve\">Achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria is when there is very little, or no gastric acid in the stomach. It can come with other medical problems.\nSigns.\nThe lowering acid level itself can make symptoms similar to gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hinders protein digestion by holding back the enzyme pepsin. Pepsin needs a low gastric PH to become active. Low acid levels in the stomach are also linked with bacteria growing too much, which can stop the body taking in nutrients or vitamins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hypochlorhydria","surface_form":"hypochlorhydria","offset":29},{"uri":"Gastric_acid","surface_form":"gastric acid","offset":81},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":101},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":198},{"uri":"Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease","surface_form":"gastroesophageal reflux disease","offset":218},{"uri":"Hinder","surface_form":"hinders","offset":255},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":263},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":301},{"uri":"Pepsin","surface_form":"pepsin","offset":308},{"uri":"Small_bowel_bacterial_overgrowth_syndrome","surface_form":"bacteria growing too much","offset":416},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":477},{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":490}]}
