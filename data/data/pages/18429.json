{"id":18429,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier","text":"=\"preserve\">A soldier is a person who is a part of an army.\nIf people fight in \"irregular (not normal forces\") armies not wearing a uniform, and not part of the official military (fighting group of a nation), they are called partisans if they fight against another nation's army, or terrorists, if they fight civilians.\nPartisans and terrorists are less protected by the laws of war than soldiers.\nSoldiers can be volunteers or conscripts. A conscript is a person who had been forced to become a soldier and fight.\nSoldiers have existed for many years, dating back to ancient times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":27},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":54},{"uri":"Normal","surface_form":"normal","offset":95},{"uri":"Uniform","surface_form":"uniform","offset":132},{"uri":"Partisan","surface_form":"partisan","offset":225},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":283},{"uri":"Laws_of_war","surface_form":"laws of war","offset":371},{"uri":"Volunteer","surface_form":"volunteer","offset":414},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"conscripts","offset":428}]}
