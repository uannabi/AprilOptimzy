{"id":184417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Region_(Canada)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The National Capital Region is an official Federal name for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, and neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec, and the area near them. The National Capital Region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The National Capital Region covers an area of 6,287.03 square kilometres (2,427.44 square miles). It has a population of 1,235,324. The Ottawa part of the region is part of the eastern subregion of Ontario. The Ottawa-Gatineau CMA is the only CMA in Canada to include parts of two provinces.\nThe National Capital Region is not a separate political jurisdiction, although the National Capital Commission is deeply involved in political, cultural, and land use planning matters in the National Capital Region. Proposals have sometimes been made to separate the National Capital Region from its two respective provinces, and transform it into a separate capital district, like the District of Columbia in the United States or the Australian Capital Territory. Such proposals have never come close to passage, and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option.\nOther towns within National Capital Region.\nWhile not officially in the CMA, the following municipalities (most of which are adjacent to the CMA) are included in the National Capital Region, due to their close economic and social ties with Ottawa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":97},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":105},{"uri":"Gatineau","surface_form":"Gatineau","offset":131},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":141},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":293},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":305},{"uri":"Eastern_Ontario","surface_form":"eastern subregion of Ontario","offset":490},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":661},{"uri":"National_Capital_Commission","surface_form":"National Capital Commission","offset":688},{"uri":"Capital_districts_and_territories","surface_form":"capital district","offset":964},{"uri":"District_of_Columbia","surface_form":"District of Columbia","offset":991},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1019},{"uri":"Australian_Capital_Territory","surface_form":"Australian Capital Territory","offset":1040}]}
