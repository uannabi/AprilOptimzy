{"id":184430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Real analysis is an area of mathematics that deals with sets and sequences of real numbers, as well as functions of one or more real variables. It provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, the study of continuous change.\nAs one of the main branches of mathematical analysis, it can be seen as the real-number counterpart of complex analysis, which deals with complex numbers. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":41},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":69},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":78},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":91},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":116},{"uri":"Real_variable","surface_form":"real variable","offset":141},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":202},{"uri":"Mathematical_analysis","surface_form":"mathematical analysis","offset":275},{"uri":"Complex_analysis","surface_form":"complex analysis","offset":347},{"uri":"Special_case","surface_form":"special case","offset":433}]}
