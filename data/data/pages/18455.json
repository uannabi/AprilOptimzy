There it referred to a feast (or a banquet) of a rich citizen. When the Romans ate they were almost lying down, and the food was brought to them by slaves. These slaves would also provide the entertainment which usually consisted of music and dancing slaves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orgy_(band)","surface_form":"Orgy (band)","offset":55},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":126},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":339},{"uri":"Meal","surface_form":"feast","offset":369},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":418},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":494},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":579},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dancing","offset":589}]}
