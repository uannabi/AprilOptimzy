It crosses the River Thames in a north-west south-east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank.\nHistory.\nVauzhall Bridge in 1906. It replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry.\nThe building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane.\nThe present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.\nIn June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":21},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":31},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":57},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":80},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":120},{"uri":"Vauxhall","surface_form":"Vauxhall","offset":138},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":169},{"uri":"Redevelopment","surface_form":"redeveloping","offset":289},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":393},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"redesigns","offset":500},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":524},{"uri":"Toll","surface_form":"toll","offset":644},{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"public","offset":680},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"tram","offset":791},{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":854},{"uri":"Route","surface_form":"route","offset":987},{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":996},{"uri":"Diamond_Jubilee","surface_form":"Diamond Jubilee","offset":1017}]}
