{"id":184646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_tube_station","text":"Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom.\nThe station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault by way of Chigwell.\nHistory.\nThe station was opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton. It was changed by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, to include services to Ilford by way of the Fairlop Loop that was opened in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London & North Eastern Railway until it was given to the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central Line services of the London Underground. The station was a terminus for the Central Line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle towards Epping, until electric services began as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":14},{"uri":"Woodford","surface_form":"Woodford","offset":44},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Redbridge","surface_form":"London Borough of Redbridge","offset":60},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":89},{"uri":"Central_Line","surface_form":"Central Line","offset":127},{"uri":"South_Woodford_tube_station","surface_form":"South Woodford","offset":148},{"uri":"Buckhurst_Hill_tube_station","surface_form":"Buckhurst Hill","offset":167},{"uri":"Terminus","surface_form":"terminus","offset":205},{"uri":"Hainault_tube_station","surface_form":"Hainault","offset":250},{"uri":"Chigwell_tube_station","surface_form":"Chigwell","offset":269},{"uri":"Eastern_Counties_Railway","surface_form":"Eastern Counties Railway","offset":344},{"uri":"Loughton","surface_form":"Loughton","offset":379},{"uri":"Great_Eastern_Railway","surface_form":"Great Eastern Railway","offset":434},{"uri":"Ilford","surface_form":"Ilford","offset":480},{"uri":"Fairlop_Loop","surface_form":"Fairlop Loop","offset":501},{"uri":"London_%26amp%3B_North_Eastern_Railway","surface_form":"London & North Eastern Railway","offset":592},{"uri":"London_Passenger_Transport_Board","surface_form":"London Passenger Transport Board","offset":649},{"uri":"Extension","surface_form":"extension","offset":722},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":842},{"uri":"Transfer","surface_form":"transferring","offset":853},{"uri":"Steam","surface_form":"steam","offset":871},{"uri":"Shuttle","surface_form":"shuttle","offset":877},{"uri":"Epping","surface_form":"Epping","offset":893},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electric","offset":907},{"uri":"Loughton","surface_form":"Loughton","offset":941},{"uri":"Raliwaay_loop","surface_form":"loop","offset":967},{"uri":"Hainault","surface_form":"Hainault","offset":976}]}
