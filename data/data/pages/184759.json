{"id":184759,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy","text":"=\"preserve\">A deputy is a person who helps someone do their job when they are not there. \"Deputy\" is a rank or title. It usually refers to someone who is \"second-in-command\". For example: a \"Deputy Master\" is someone who will take over the responsibilities of the Master when the Master is not there. A \"deputy conductor\" will conduct an orchestra when the main (principal) conductor is not there. It is similar to an \"assistant\". Someone who is working as a deputy will deputize (stand in for someone else).\nSometimes other terms are used such as \"vice\". A vice-president will take over the responsibilities of the president when he (or she) is not there or is ill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conduct","offset":327},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":338},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":616}]}
