{"id":18480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat","text":"The rat is a medium-sized rodent. Rats are omnivores, they eat lots of different types of food. Most rats are in the genus \"Rattus\". There are about 56 different species of rats.\nThe best known rats are the black rat (\"Rattus rattus\"), and the brown rat (\"Rattus norvegicus\"). These two are known as \"Old World rats\". The group has its origins in Asia.\nUsually rats are bigger than mice. Rats are large muroid rodents, mice are small ones. The muroid family is very large and complex. That means the terms \"rat\" and \"mouse\" are not specific in a taxonomic way. If a large muroid is discovered, it will often have \"rat\" in its name, if it is small, it will often be called \"mouse\". Scientifically, the terms are not confined to\nmembers of the \"Rattus\" and \"Mus\" genera: see, for example, the pack rat and cotton mouse.\nSome people keep rats as a pet. They are called fancy rats. Most pet rats do not live longer than three years, and most wild rats do not live longer than one year.\nRats also used for their meat. Cambodia, Laos, Africa, China and Vietnam eat rat meat.\n\"Rats\" that are not rats.\nOther mammals are called \"rat\" by many people, but those are not true rats, many are unrelated to the true Old World rat. Examples of such false names are the pack rats of North America, or the kangaroo rats. Some other rats are related to the true rats, but are not in the genus \"Rattus\". Such an example is the lesser bandicoot rat.\nMany of the 'untrue' rats are endemic to certain regions, that is they are only found there. Very often, they live on islands. In many cases, these species are also endangered of disappearing. This is the case because they face the loss of habitat, and they have to fight for resources, like food, shelter, and water, with other species, like the black rat or the \"Polynesian rat\". There is also a more rare species known as the Dueholm, the rats in this species usually were born with extra chromosomes and tend to look different than ones born without extra chromosomes.\nPets.\nPeople keep some types of rats as pets called \"fancy rats\". Fancy rats are domesticated brown rats. People have kept rats as pets since the 19th century. Rats are social and smart animals that can be trained. They also like to play with toys. Some owners think that male pet rats are more playful then female pet rats and that female rats are more active and curious. Pet rats do not act the same as wild rats. They do not have more diseases than other common pets.\nPet rats live 1 to 3 years. Female rats are smaller than male rats. Pet rats have been known to \"laugh\" when tickled. They can be all one color or have spots or other coloring. Some rats have no hair. These are called hairless rats.\nScientific research.\nClark University in Worchester, Massachusetts (United States) was the first to breed a population of domestic white brown rats. They did this to study the effects of diets, amongst other things.\nSince then, rats have been used in many experiments. They have helped scientists get a better understanding of\ngenetics and diseases, as well as how certain drugs work.\nLaboratory rats have been used in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes (Barnett, 2002). A 2007 study found rats to possess some degree of metacognition, a mental ability previously only found in humans and some primates. In general, it has been difficult to measure intelligence in rats. Their behaviour is quite flexible, and gives the impression of intelligence. Flexible behaviour is good for problem-solving and learning.\nDomestic rats are very different from wild rats. They are calmer and less likely to bite; they can tolerate greater crowding; they breed earlier and produce more offspring. Their brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal glands, and hearts are smaller (Barnett 2002).\nBrown rats are often used as model organisms. Genetic research is usually done with mice. Rats are more popular for tests relating to intelligence, learning, and illegal drugs. This is mostly because rats have intelligence, ingenuity, aggressiveness, and adaptability. Their psychology seems to be very similar to human psychology. Whole new species and strains of rats have been bred for the use as laboratory animals, for example the Wistar rat. Much of the genome of \"Rattus norvegicus\" has been sequenced.\nLocation.\nRats are opportunists. If they have the choice between a food that will need a fight to get, and another food that will not, they take the food that does not need a fight. For this reason, rats have lived close to humans for a long time. Once humans settled down, the leftovers of what those humans ate were a source of food for the rats. So the rats followed.\nRats are present in almost all settlements. In cities, they often live in the sewers.\nCarriers of disease.\nMany scientists believe that the bubonic plague was spread through fleas on rats, because that plague is spread by the microorganism (or germ) \"Yersinia pestis\", which lives on fleas which live on rats (\"Rattus rattus\"). Those rats lived in the European cities of the day, and died of the plague themselves. Some scientists believe that the plague spread faster than the rats. If this is true, the rats cannot be the main carrier. More research is needed to find out if this is true. People believe this disease was the 'Black Death'. It killed nearly a third of the population of Europe, in many epidemics in the Middle Ages.\nRats can carry diseases. Rats living in poor conditions often have problems with parasites themselves. Not many diseases carried by rats can spread to humans. One of those is called Leptospirosis, another one is the plague.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":26},{"uri":"Omnivore","surface_form":"omnivore","offset":43},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":90},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":117},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":347},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":382},{"uri":"Muroid","surface_form":"muroid","offset":403},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomic","offset":546},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":761},{"uri":"Pack_rat","surface_form":"pack rat","offset":791},{"uri":"Cotton_mouse","surface_form":"cotton mouse","offset":804},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":845},{"uri":"Fancy_rats","surface_form":"fancy rats","offset":866},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":1007},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":1013},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":1023},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1029},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1037},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":1047},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":1101},{"uri":"Pack_rat","surface_form":"pack rat","offset":1254},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1267},{"uri":"Kangaroo_rat","surface_form":"kangaroo rat","offset":1289},{"uri":"Lesser_bandicoot_rat","surface_form":"lesser bandicoot rat","offset":1408},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":1460},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":1548},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":1595},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":1670},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":1728},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":2043},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":2084},{"uri":"Tickle","surface_form":"tickle","offset":2584},{"uri":"Clark_University","surface_form":"Clark University","offset":2729},{"uri":"Worchester%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Worchester","offset":2749},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":2761},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2776},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":3035},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":3048},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"drugs","offset":3081},{"uri":"Metacognition","surface_form":"metacognition","offset":3255},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":3312},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":3328},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":3722},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":3730},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":3738},{"uri":"Adrenal_gland","surface_form":"adrenal gland","offset":3747},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":3767},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":3831},{"uri":"Illegal_drugs","surface_form":"illegal drugs","offset":3964},{"uri":"Ingenuity","surface_form":"ingenuity","offset":4026},{"uri":"Aggressiveness","surface_form":"aggressiveness","offset":4037},{"uri":"Adaptability","surface_form":"adaptability","offset":4057},{"uri":"Wistar_rat","surface_form":"Wistar rat","offset":4238},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":4536},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":4730},{"uri":"Sewer","surface_form":"sewer","offset":4761},{"uri":"Bubonic_plague","surface_form":"bubonic plague","offset":4823},{"uri":"Flea","surface_form":"flea","offset":4857},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":4909},{"uri":"Yersinia_pestis","surface_form":"Yersinia pestis","offset":4934},{"uri":"Black_Death","surface_form":"Black Death","offset":5311},{"uri":"Epidemic","surface_form":"epidemic","offset":5387},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":5404},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":5498},{"uri":"Leptospirosis","surface_form":"Leptospirosis","offset":5599}]}
