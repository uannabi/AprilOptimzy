{"id":184901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia","text":"\"Rafflesia\" is a genus of flowering plants. They are found in southeastern Asia, on the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Thailand and the Philippines. They are the biggest single flowers in the world. In one species the flowers can be over a meter (three feet) across.\nThe flowers smell like a dead animal, which attracts flies. The flies, which normally lay their eggs on rotten flesh, pollinate the \"Rafflesia\" when they get inside.\n\"Rafflesia\" is a parasite, and does not use chlorophyll. The plant has no stem, leaves or true roots. It lives inside vines of the genus \"Tetrastigma\" (Vitaceae). It spreads its absorptive organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine. The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the flower.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":17},{"uri":"Flowering_plants","surface_form":"flowering plants","offset":26},{"uri":"Malay_Peninsula","surface_form":"Malay Peninsula","offset":88},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":105},{"uri":"Sumatra","surface_form":"Sumatra","offset":113},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":122},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":139},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":209},{"uri":"Pollinate","surface_form":"pollinate","offset":388},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":453},{"uri":"Chlorophyll","surface_form":"chlorophyll","offset":480},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":510},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":516},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":531},{"uri":"Vines","surface_form":"vines","offset":554},{"uri":"Vitaceae","surface_form":"Vitaceae","offset":588},{"uri":"Absorb","surface_form":"absorptive","offset":614}]}
