{"id":185211,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce_and_Hart","text":"e=\"preserve\">Boyce and Hart were a musical and songwriting duo, who worked together in the 1960s and 1970s. Tommy Boyce (born Sidney Thomas Boyce in 1939 and died in 1994) and Bobby Hart (born Robert Luke Harshman in 1939) wrote and produced hit records for The Monkees (\"Last Train to Clarksville\", \"Valleri\"), Jay and the Americans (\"Come a Little Bit Closer\"), Chubby Checker (\"Lazy Elsie Molly\"), and for themselves, with \"I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight\" and other songs.\nTheir biggest success was with the Monkees, as writers, producers and performers. Many of the early Monkees recordings featured Boyce and Hart's band, the Candy Store Prophets, before the Monkees were even selected from auditions. When the Monkees themselves took charge of their recordings, they still recorded Boyce and Hart's songs, and praised the duo to the public.\nTen years after the Monkees's heyday, two former members, Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, teamed up with Boyce and Hart, touring and performing the band's hits. They also issued a new album on Capitol Records.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":35},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriting","offset":47},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":91},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":101},{"uri":"Music_producer","surface_form":"produced","offset":233},{"uri":"Hit_record","surface_form":"hit record","offset":242},{"uri":"The_Monkees","surface_form":"The Monkees","offset":258},{"uri":"Jay_and_the_Americans","surface_form":"Jay and the Americans","offset":312},{"uri":"Chubby_Checker","surface_form":"Chubby Checker","offset":364},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":472},{"uri":"Micky_Dolenz","surface_form":"Micky Dolenz","offset":908},{"uri":"Davy_Jones_(actor)","surface_form":"Davy Jones","offset":925},{"uri":"Album_(music)","surface_form":"album","offset":1031},{"uri":"Capitol_Records","surface_form":"Capitol Records","offset":1040}]}
