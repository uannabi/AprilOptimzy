{"id":185250,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdaloideae","text":"\"Amygdaloideae\" (often incorrectly called Prunoideae) is a subfamily of flowering plants. This subfamily is placed within the family Rosaceae.\nSince 2011 there has been a big change in how the name of this subfamily is used. Before 2011, the only plants in this subfamily were the stone fruits such as plums, peaches, and almonds. Now the subfamily includes all of the family Rosaceae except the subfamilies Rosoideae and Dryadoideae. Commercially important members of the Amygdaloideae include plum, apple, spiraea, cherries, medlars, and many others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":72},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":126},{"uri":"Rosaceae","surface_form":"Rosaceae","offset":133},{"uri":"Stone_fruit","surface_form":"stone fruit","offset":281},{"uri":"Plum","surface_form":"plum","offset":302},{"uri":"Peach","surface_form":"peach","offset":309},{"uri":"Almond","surface_form":"almond","offset":322},{"uri":"Rosaceae","surface_form":"Rosaceae","offset":376},{"uri":"Rosoideae","surface_form":"Rosoideae","offset":408},{"uri":"Dryadoideae","surface_form":"Dryadoideae","offset":422},{"uri":"Plum","surface_form":"plum","offset":495},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":501},{"uri":"Spiraea","surface_form":"spiraea","offset":508},{"uri":"Cherries","surface_form":"cherries","offset":517},{"uri":"Medlars","surface_form":"medlars","offset":527}]}
