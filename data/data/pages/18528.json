{"id":18528,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number","text":"The counting numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on) are all positive numbers. The positive numbers, negative numbers, and the number zero, taken together, are called \"signed numbers\" or integers.\nThe number zero is neither positive nor negative. Zero is its own opposite; so +0 = \u22120. That is, zero steps to the right is the same as zero steps to the left.\nA negative number is always less than zero.\nA negative number is written by putting a minus sign, \"\u2212\", in front of a positive number. For example, 3 is a positive number, but \u22123 is a negative number. It is read \"negative three\" or \"minus three\"; it means the opposite of 3.\nSometimes, for emphasis, we write the pair of opposite numbers as \u22123 and +3.\nA number and its opposite always add to zero. So the sum of \u22123 and +3 is 0. We can write this either as \u22123 + 3 = 0 or as 3 + (\u2212 3) = 0. In addition, a number and its opposite are said to \"cancel each other out\".\nThe set of negative real numbers is sometimes written as formula_1.\nArithmetic with negative numbers.\n9 + (\u22121) = 9 \u2212 1 = 8\n6 \u2212 (\u22128) = 6 + 8 = 14\n(\u22123) \u00D7 (\u22122) = 3 \u00D7 2 = 6\n(\u22124) \u00D7 5 = \u2212(4 \u00D7 5) = \u221220\nUses of negative numbers.\nWhen a person is poor, people sometimes say that they have a negative amount of money. Negative numbers are used in accounting and science.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":123},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":176},{"uri":"Accounting","surface_form":"accounting","offset":1246},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":1261}]}
