The awards ceremony takes place each year in late February or early March in Los Angeles, California.\nHistory.\nAt the end of 1920s, the American film industry was in a crisis. When radio was invented, the people didn't go to the cinema as often as they used to. The owners of the studios had problems. They had to pay the workers for a good salary, but that was impossible at that time. Many people fought for a good salary and a good working time.\nThe director of the successful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-Studios, Louis B. Mayer met two good friends because he wanted to speak about the problem.\nNaming.\nIn the first years of the award, the trophy was called Academy Award of Merit. The godfather of the name Oscar is not clear. It is certain, that the name was used in 1931. There may be four people, who could be the godparents. The former board secretary of the academy Margaret Herrick said: \"He looks like my uncle Oscar!\". Bette Davis said that he looks like my first husband Harmon \"Oscar\" Nelson. The film columnist Sidney Skolsky said, that he is the name giver, and the fourth person was Walt Disney.\nIt is said that Oscar is not the official name of the statue. But the nickname is trademark-protected.\nTrophy.\nThe statue is around 13 \u00BD inches tall and weighs about 8\u00BD pounds.\nThe most successful films.\n\"Gone with the Wind f\"rom the year 1939 was the most successful film for a long time with ten Oscars.\" \"Then, in 1960,\" \"Ben-Hur\" \"won eleven Oscars.
