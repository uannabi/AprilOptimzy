{"id":185486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear","text":"\"Top Gear\" is a television show on the BBC. The show is all about cars and other vehicles. They test new cars to see how fast they go. They also test really old cars and do crazy stuff with them. They usually rate cars that the normal person wouldn't be able to afford. The show started as a regular car show but has changed over time to what it is now. It uses comedy to attract viewers which are now estimated to be 350 million.\nRaces.\nThe show often has long distance races. They usually race a fast car against a different form of transportation like trains and boats. They are called 'epic' races.\nThey also have smaller races where they match up cars of different times to see which one outperforms the other.\nChallenge.\nThe challenge part of the show is about different stunts of the most ridiculous things the show can come up with. One time they jumped a bus over a row of motorcycles (instead of the motorcycle jumping over buses).\nRecently, the show has started using the phrase \"How hard can it be?\" for the challenge segment. They put themselves in different situations that a normal person probably wouldn't get a chance to experience.\nStar in a Reasonably-Priced Car.\nOnce during every episode (except some specials) they bring a celebrity on stage. They show footage of the celebrity driving an average car around a racetrack. They put the time it took for them to complete a lap of the track on a board with the names of all of the other celebrities who drove the same course.\nPower Laps.\nPower laps are one lap around the Top Gear Test Track. They will take any car that can drive and will see how fast it can make it around the track. The vehicles must be cars and they must be road legal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":39}]}
