Because soju created at that time were made from pure grains, it was very tasty and clean. It was also not so strong. However, it was very expensive simply because it was distilled.\nNowadays, soju is very popular in South Korea. Koreans enjoy drinking soju as a means of promoting friendship and getting closer to each other. Usually, people drink it with \"anju\", a side dish, so as to moderate its bitterness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":20},{"uri":"Beverage","surface_form":"beverage","offset":88},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":116},{"uri":"Alcoholic","surface_form":"alcoholic","offset":168},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":424},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":463},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":601},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":763}]}
