{"id":18563,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave","text":"e=\"preserve\">A wave is a kind of oscillation (disturbance) that travels through space and matter. Wave motions transfer energy from one place to another.\nWaves play an important role in our daily life. This is because waves are a carrier of energy and information over large distances. Waves require some oscillating or vibrating source. Ocean surface waves were the first known waves. Later, other kinds were discovered.\nTypes of waves.\nThere are two categories of waves.\nMechanical waves.\nWaves which require any medium for their propagation are called mechanical waves.\nWater waves, sound waves, and waves produced on the string and spring.\nElectromagnetic waves.\nWaves which do not require any medium for their propagation are called electromagnetic waves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean_surface_wave","surface_form":"Ocean surface wave","offset":338}]}
