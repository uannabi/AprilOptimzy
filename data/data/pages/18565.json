{"id":18565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gluons are what hold quarks together to make bigger particles. Gluons carry the strong force between other quarks, so it is considered a force carrying particle. Photons do the same thing, but for the electromagnetic force. Also, like photons, gluons are spin-1 particles, and when a particle has spin-1 it is considered a boson.\nGluons are hard to study because although they exist in nature all the time, they are so small and require so much energy to break them away from quarks (about 2 trillion degrees) that scientists have only been able to find more about them from particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quark","surface_form":"quark","offset":34},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":65},{"uri":"Strong_nuclear_force","surface_form":"strong force","offset":93},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"Photon","offset":175},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_force","surface_form":"electromagnetic force","offset":214},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":268},{"uri":"Boson","surface_form":"boson","offset":336},{"uri":"Large_Hadron_Collider","surface_form":"Large Hadron Collider","offset":619},{"uri":"CERN","surface_form":"CERN","offset":644}]}
