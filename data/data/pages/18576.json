{"id":18576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","text":"The Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith is an Abrahamic religion started in the 1800s by an Iranian person called Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h who was born in Tehran, Iran. Followers of this religion call themselves Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs. The name Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h is Arabic for \"The Glory of God\". \"Glory\" is a word that means \"importance\", \"power\", and \"beauty\". Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs believe Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h is a representation of God, or speaks for God, and he shows people God's importance, beauty, and brightness.\nBah\u00E1'\u00EDs are monotheists, which means that they believe in one God. They believe Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h carried a message from God. Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h said he was not the only person to carry a message from God, and he was not the last to carry a message from God. He taught that the people who started the other major religions also represented and carried messages from God, such as Jesus, Moses, Abraham, Muhammad, the Buddha and others. He called these people \"Manifestations of God.\" They believe the messages from the Manifestations of God get more and more difficult to understand. They say the ones that came earlier on had a more simple message than the ones that came later. Because God is greater than the whole universe, Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h said that human beings cannot completely know God. He said that God wants people to know as much about him as they can. Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h wrote God sends special people to manifest (show) himself to ordinary humans. Without the Manifestations of God we could not know God. Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs believe the God they pray to is the same God Abraham spoke to, Jesus talked about, and Krishna said in Gita. Since Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h was born in a Muslim family, Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs are sometimes mistaken as Muslims. Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h is considered the prophet/manifestation of the present day. Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs say that he is not the last prophet/manifestation of God. They think there will not be another prophet for 1,000 years after Baha'u'llah's death.\nEarly days.\nThe Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith began on 1844 when a man called the B\u00E1b said he had a message from God. He said that it was his job to make sure that people were ready for the most important message from God who would be sent soon. This started a religion, followers of this religion were called B\u00E1b\u00EDs. Many people became B\u00E1b\u00EDs in the country of Iran, which was called Persia at the time, and this made the government of Persia and the Muslim priests angry. They arrested and killed the Bab and his followers. Even though this happened, people still followed this religion.\nBefore Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h said he had a message from God, he was a member of the religion that was started by the B\u00E1b. He became very famous among the B\u00E1b\u00EDs. When the B\u00E1b was killed, some B\u00E1b\u00EDs got very angry and tried to kill the king of Persia, even though Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h told them not to kill him. When the Babis were caught, the government put many B\u00E1b\u00EDs in jail, including Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h. While in jail at Tehran, Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h said he saw an angel that he called the \"maid of heaven\". The angel told him that he had to teach a message from God to the people of the world. The angel said that God would rescue and protect him so that he could teach this message. Eventually, he was released from jail and the government of Persia made him move to Baghdad, which was then controlled by the king of the Ottoman Empire.\nBah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h's announcement.\nWhile Baha'u'llah was in Baghdad, he had many problems, but he also made many friends. The government of Persia was unhappy that he seemed to be doing well in Baghdad, and so they asked the Ottoman Empire to move him further away from Persia. When he was about to leave, in 1863, he held a festival for 12 days on a small island in the Tigris river, which he called Ridvan, which means paradise. There he told some of his closest friends and family that he was the promised one of all of the major religions, and that eventually the whole world would know his message.\nEventually the Ottoman Empire sent him to many different cities, including Constantinople, Adrianople, Alexandria, and eventually Akka. He was in different jails this whole time, and the city of Akka had a big wall around it, and it was one big jail. While he was in Baghdad, and after, he wrote many books and letters to answer questions that his friends and followers asked him. At one point he was poisoned, so that he could not write anymore because his hands shook so badly. After that, he had someone write down what he said. When he was even older, his oldest son, `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 arranged to have him move into a house near Mount Carmel, and he stayed there until he finally died in 1892.\nAfter Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h.\nAfter he died, people followed `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1. Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h had written that `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 had special powers, and that God would make sure that if `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 explained anything that Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h said, then the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs should believe that explanation. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 also wrote a lot of letters and gave talks, and eventually visited Paris, London, Montreal, New York City, San Francisco and other cities in the west. This helped the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith to spread in Europe and North America. He died in 1921. He left a will, where he told the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs to follow his grandson, Shoghi Effendi.\nShoghi Effendi was born in 1900 and was only a young man when his grandfather died and he became the leader of the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs. He helped make the different agencies and councils that run the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith today, and organized the religion in many ways. He also wrote many books and letters to explain the teachings of his grandfather and great-grandfather. He lived until 1957 and died in England.\nAfter Shoghi Effendi died, the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs did not have leaders for six years, because Shoghi Effendi had not left a will. Shoghi Effendi did have helpers, who did not think they were allowed to lead the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs, so they helped the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Community follow the last plan that Shoghi Effendi left them, and at the end of that plan, in 1963, they organized an election to form the Universal House of Justice, which Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h wrote about. The Universal House of Justice has led the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs ever since.\nHoly books.\nBah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h wrote many books and letters, and `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 (whose name means \"Servant of Glory\") also wrote many books and letters which Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs see as special. Finally, Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h's great-grandson Shoghi Effendi wrote lots of books and letters which Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs use to better understand the writings of Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h and `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1. The most important of these books is the Aqdas.\nBah\u00E1'\u00EDs also believe that the Bible, the Qur'an, the Gita and other books from other religions are special.\nPeople.\nThere are eight or nine million Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs in the world, of all peoples and languages. The Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith looks different in different countries, because there are few rituals, so Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs can include their own culture in the way they celebrate Bah\u00E1'\u00ED events, say prayers, etc.\nBah\u00E1'\u00EDs meet every nineteen (19) days in a meeting called a \"Feast\". There does not have to be food, but there usually is. These meetings start with prayers and usually someone reads aloud some holy writings. Sometimes there is music and song, sometimes plays, sometimes just quiet time or meditation. After this time, which Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs call the \"devotional\" time in a feast, they have a community discussion. All sorts of topics can be discussed here that are important to the members. Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs say that this is a \"consultative\" time, where Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs can consult with each other. After this, there is a social time, where people can share food, drink (not alcohol), and sometimes here there is also music, or plays, or presentations, or other entertainment. This time is just so that the Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs in that city can get to know each other and become better friends.\nTemples and Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Centers.\nBah\u00E1'\u00EDs often do not have one place they get together, except in large cities. In smaller places they usually get together in each other's houses. Some larger cities have \"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Centers\" which can be used for community meetings, classes, or for meetings of committees and other councils. (see Institutions below)\nIn a very few cities in the world, there are Bah\u00E1'\u00ED temples. These temples are on each continent.\nInstitutions.\nBah\u00E1'\u00EDs are organized in a worldwide community. They do not have priests. Everyone is responsible for their own prayers. Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs are also responsible for reading their holy books for themselves and for learning about their religion. Baha'is elect leaders for their community, to help organize their activities, and to deal with problems between members, and to decide things that are not obvious from the scriptures. These are called Spiritual Assemblies, but will one day be called Houses of Justice.\nThere is one House of Justice, which Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs call the Universal House of Justice, which leads the whole worldwide Bah\u00E1'\u00ED community. Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs elect this House of Justice every five years, but only once each year for National and Local Spiritual Assemblies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religion","offset":23},{"uri":"1800s","surface_form":"1800s","offset":57},{"uri":"Iranian","surface_form":"Iranian","offset":69},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h","offset":91},{"uri":"Tehran","surface_form":"Tehran","offset":119},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":127},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":209},{"uri":"Monotheism","surface_form":"monotheists","offset":455},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":505},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":809},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":816},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":823},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":832},{"uri":"Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":846},{"uri":"Manifest","surface_form":"manifest","offset":1335},{"uri":"1844","surface_form":"1844","offset":1907},{"uri":"B%C3%A1b","surface_form":"B\u00E1b","offset":1934},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":2235},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":2273},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":2329},{"uri":"Tehran","surface_form":"Tehran","offset":2838},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":3177},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":3231},{"uri":"1863","surface_form":"1863","offset":3549},{"uri":"Tigris","surface_form":"Tigris","offset":3611},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":3919},{"uri":"Adrianople","surface_form":"Adrianople","offset":3935},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":3947},{"uri":"Acre","surface_form":"Akka","offset":3974},{"uri":"%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1","surface_form":"`Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1","offset":4416},{"uri":"Mount_Carmel","surface_form":"Mount Carmel","offset":4473},{"uri":"1892","surface_form":"1892","offset":4532},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":4886},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":4893},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":4901},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":4911},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":4926},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":5012},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":5023},{"uri":"Shoghi_Effendi","surface_form":"Shoghi Effendi","offset":5121},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":5164},{"uri":"1963","surface_form":"1963","offset":5860},{"uri":"Universal_House_of_Justice","surface_form":"Universal House of Justice","offset":5905},{"uri":"Shoghi_Effendi","surface_form":"Shoghi Effendi","offset":6238},{"uri":"Aqdas","surface_form":"Aqdas","offset":6411},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":6448},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":6459},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":6697},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":6739},{"uri":"Consultation_(Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_practice)","surface_form":"consult","offset":7355},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":7403},{"uri":"Committee","surface_form":"committees","offset":7949},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":8057},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":8092},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":8154}]}
