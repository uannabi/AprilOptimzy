{"id":18589,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile","text":"The Nile (\"an-n\u012Bl\") is a river in Africa. It is the longest river on Earth (about 6,650\u00A0km or 4,132 miles), though other rivers carry more water. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria. It gets its name from the Greek word \u039D\u03B5\u1FD6\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2 \"Neil's\".\nThe White Nile flows from Lake Victoria in Uganda, and through Sudan to Khartoum, where it is joined by the Blue Nile to form the Nile, then through Egypt. The Blue Nile flows through Ethiopia near the Red Sea. About 300 million cubic metres of water flow down the Nile each day.\nThe Nile is very important to the countries where it flows. On the Nile there are lots of boats because it is one of the easiest ways to get around. Because of this, many cities in Egypt were built next to the river. Also, the pyramids are close to the Nile. The Nile has always provided most of the water used to grow crops in Egypt and for anything else, since much of the rest of the country is in a desert. The Nile was very important to Ancient Egyptians. In ancient times the Nile flooded every year and the people would starve if there was not enough water for the crops. The Ancient Egyptians got papyrus from the Nile to make hieroglyphs.\nMany different types of animals live in or near the waters of the Nile, including crocodiles, birds, fish and many others. Not only do animals depend on the Nile for survival, but also people who live there need it for everyday use like washing, as a water supply, keeping crops watered and other jobs.\nPyramids were built close to the Nile because they needed the granite stones from Aswan to be transported by barges down the Nile.\nHistory of the word Nile.\nThe word \"Nile\" comes from Greek \"Neilos\" (). Neilos came from the word \"river valley\". In the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called \"\u1E24'p\u012B\" or \"iteru\", meaning \"great river\", represented by the hieroglyphs shown above (literally \"itrw\", and 'waters' determinative). In Coptic, the words \"piaro\" (Sahidic) or \"phiaro\" (Bohairic) meaning \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the.canal-great\") come from the same ancient name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":25},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":34},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":69},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":164},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":187},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":225},{"uri":"Lake_Victoria","surface_form":"Lake Victoria","offset":279},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":296},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":316},{"uri":"Khartoum","surface_form":"Khartoum","offset":325},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":402},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":437},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":455},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"flow down","offset":504},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":567},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":623},{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"get around","offset":670},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":704},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":760},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":852},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":936},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":1116},{"uri":"Papyrus","surface_form":"papyrus","offset":1138},{"uri":"Hieroglyph","surface_form":"hieroglyph","offset":1168},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":1205},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":1263},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1275},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":1282},{"uri":"Washing","surface_form":"washing","offset":1418},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"Pyramid","offset":1484},{"uri":"Aswan","surface_form":"Aswan","offset":1566},{"uri":"Egyptian_language","surface_form":"Egyptian language","offset":1744},{"uri":"Egyptian_hieroglyphs","surface_form":"hieroglyphs","offset":1843},{"uri":"N-water_ripple_(n_hieroglyph)","surface_form":"waters","offset":1891},{"uri":"Determinative","surface_form":"determinative","offset":1899},{"uri":"Coptic_language","surface_form":"Coptic","offset":1918}]}
