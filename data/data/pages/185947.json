It is on the King George V branch. Trains run westbound to Bank in the City of London and eastbound to Woolwich Arsenal.\nUntil the extension to Woolwich Arsenal this station was the main reason for this branch. It continues to be an important station on the DLR. It has an excellent direct covered connection with adjacent airport terminal building. Although the station maintains the DLR philosophy of basic good design it makes various concessions to cater for airport passengers including a fully enclosed waiting room on the central island platform.\nThe station is in the London Borough of Newham and is in Travelcard Zone 3.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Docklands_Light_Railway","surface_form":"Docklands Light Railway","offset":52},{"uri":"London_City_Airport","surface_form":"London City Airport","offset":93},{"uri":"King_George_V_DLR_station","surface_form":"King George V","offset":164},{"uri":"Bank_and_Monument_stations","surface_form":"Bank","offset":210},{"uri":"Woolwich_Arsenal_DLR_station","surface_form":"Woolwich Arsenal","offset":254},{"uri":"Airport_terminal","surface_form":"airport terminal","offset":474},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Newham","surface_form":"London Borough of Newham","offset":727},{"uri":"Travelcard_Zone_3","surface_form":"Travelcard Zone 3","offset":762}]}
