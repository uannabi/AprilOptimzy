His father, who was yoga ascetic, taught him how to think scientifically. His mother taught him what a faith is.\nThere are a lot of accomplishments he made. The most famous thing is \"Budan\", which is an idea of sharing lands with the poor. He argued that land is not something that can be occupied. He insisted that land owners should donate their one sixth of their land to people who do not have land. He campaigned to give rice to hungry people. And he also did a campaign of self-supporting and self-sufficient. These worked successfully and he became a great man of India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1895","surface_form":"1895","offset":27},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":32},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":45},{"uri":"Mahatma_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mahatma Gandhi","offset":103},{"uri":"Bharat_Ratna","surface_form":"Bharat Ratna","offset":400},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"yoga","offset":469},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1020}]}
