In 1251 Henry III said there could be a weekly market here and two annual fairs. In 1291 there were \"two water-mills with fish ponds\" in Ripley.\nIndustry.\nThe Ripley area has been industrialized since the late 18th century.\nOne of the earliest companies to take advantage of mineral resources around Ripley was the Butterley Company in 1790. One of the early, and most well known, examples of the work of the company includes the graceful arched roof of St. Pancras Station in London, recently restored as an international rail terminal. A recent Butterley achievement was the design and construction of the Falkirk Wheel which lifts large canal boats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":24},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":42},{"uri":"St._Pancras_Station","surface_form":"St. Pancras Station","offset":591},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":614},{"uri":"Falkirk","surface_form":"Falkirk Wheel","offset":745}]}
