{"id":186107,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver","text":"=\"preserve\">A wide receiver (or WR, wideout) is an American football player whose main duty is to catch the football when it is thrown by the quarterback.\nWide receivers may also block, run with the football and sometimes throw the football besides just catching it. They can wear jersey numbers 10-19 and 80-89 in the National Football League, but there are no limits in college football.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":51},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":108},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":142},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":319},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":372}]}
