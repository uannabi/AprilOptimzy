Jacka was the first Australian to win the VC during the First World War, receiving the medal for his actions during the Gallipoli Campaign. After Gallipoli he was sent to the Western Front where he again was given medals for his bravery.\nAfter the war, Jacka went back to Australia and started a business, \"Roxburgh, Jacka & Co. Pty Ltd\", importing and exporting electrical goods. He was later elected to the local council, and became the mayor of St Kilda, Victoria. Jacka never fully recovered from the many wounds he got in the war and died at the age of 39.\nEarly life.\nAlbert Jacka was born on a dairy farm at Layard, near Winchelsea, Victoria on 10 January 1893. His parents were Nathaniel Jacka and his English wife, Elizabeth Kettle. The family moved to Wedderburn, Victoria when he was five years old, where he went the local school. He began working with his father transporting goods. He was working for the Victorian State Forests Department when the First World War broke out.\nGallipoli and the VC.\nHe joined the AIF, the Australian Imperial Force, on 18 September 1914. His battalion was sent to Cairo Egypt for training. They landed at Gallipoli on 26 April, 1915, the second day of the Gallipoli campaign. On 19 May the Turkish army started a large attack to push the ANZACs back into the sea. The Turks were able to capture a small section of a trench at Courtney's Post. Jacka jumped into the trench by himself and killed most of the Turkish soldiers in it. For this he was awarded the Victoria Cross.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victoria_Cross","surface_form":"VC","offset":13},{"uri":"Military_Cross","surface_form":"MC","offset":17},{"uri":"Medal_bar","surface_form":"& Bar","offset":20},{"uri":"Victoria_Cross","surface_form":"Victoria Cross","offset":76},{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"medal","offset":104},{"uri":"Valour","surface_form":"valour","offset":114},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":184},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":196},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":243},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":279},{"uri":"Gallipoli_Campaign","surface_form":"Gallipoli Campaign","offset":343},{"uri":"Western_Front_(World_War_I)","surface_form":"Western Front","offset":398},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":662},{"uri":"St_Kilda%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"St Kilda, Victoria","offset":671},{"uri":"Dairy","surface_form":"dairy","offset":824},{"uri":"Winchelsea%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Winchelsea, Victoria","offset":851},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":933},{"uri":"Wedderburn%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Wedderburn, Victoria","offset":985},{"uri":"Battalion","surface_form":"battalion","offset":1311},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":1333},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":1339},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":1459},{"uri":"ANZAC","surface_form":"ANZAC","offset":1507}]}
