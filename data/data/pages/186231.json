It was owned by the Steinman family, owners of WGAL radio (1490 AM) and Lancaster's two major newspapers. At the time, Lancaster was the smallest city in the country with its own television station. On 31 December 1952 WGAL moved to its current location on channel 8. On January 1, 1954 WGAL showed its first color television program, the Tournament of Roses Parade. WGAL has always been an NBC television station, but also carried some programs from CBS, DuMont, and ABC until 1963. The Steinmans sold WGAL-TV to Pulitzer in late 1978. Pulitzer sold WGAL-TV to Hearst-Argyle Television in 1999. The change took place on March 18, the station's 50th anniversary.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":18},{"uri":"Lancaster%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Lancaster","offset":48},{"uri":"Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Harrisburg","offset":58},{"uri":"York%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"York","offset":69},{"uri":"Susquehanna_River","surface_form":"Susquehanna Valley","offset":75},{"uri":"Tournament_of_Roses_Parade","surface_form":"Tournament of Roses Parade","offset":640},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":752},{"uri":"DuMont_Television_Network","surface_form":"DuMont","offset":757},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Corporation","surface_form":"ABC","offset":769},{"uri":"Hearst-Argyle_Television","surface_form":"Hearst-Argyle Television","offset":863}]}
