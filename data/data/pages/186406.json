{"id":186406,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_dance","text":"Modern dance is related to ballet, but aims at different types of performance, as compared to the classical ballets. Many of its dancers have been trained in ballet, and modern dance companies are rather similar to ballet companies. Here the word \"modern\" is not used to mean \"recent\". Modern dance is over a century old, having begun (in this sense) around 1900.\nThe phrase 'modern dance' is also applied to ballroom dance of the English (now 'International') style. However, this page uses \"Modern dance\" as a term to describe 20th century concert dance, on stage. The modern dance style does not have set rules. Modern dancers often create their own dance routines using their emotions and moods but, on the other hand, many performances are choreographed.\nAlso modern dancing does not require specific costumes. So modern dancers often dance barefoot and choose whatever they want to wear. Modern dancers try to show their innermost emotions through dancing, often trying to get closer to their inner-selves. Modern dance has evolved continually. Artistic content has changed and shifted from one choreographer to another, as have styles and techniques.\nHistory.\nModern dance was developed in the 20th century, mainly in the United States and Germany. In the early 1900s, several female dancers began rebelling against the strict rules of classical ballet.\nThe pioneers of modern dance in the United States were Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller, Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham. The pioneers of Germany were Rudolf Von Laban and Mary Wigman.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":27},{"uri":"Classical_ballet","surface_form":"classical ballet","offset":98},{"uri":"Ballroom_dance","surface_form":"ballroom dance","offset":409},{"uri":"Stage_(theatre)","surface_form":"stage","offset":560},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":578},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":608},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":622},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":680},{"uri":"Mood","surface_form":"mood","offset":693},{"uri":"Choreography","surface_form":"choreographed","offset":745},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":806},{"uri":"Choreographer","surface_form":"choreographer","offset":1101},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1229},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1247},{"uri":"Isadora_Duncan","surface_form":"Isadora Duncan","offset":1416},{"uri":"Loie_Fuller","surface_form":"Loie Fuller","offset":1432},{"uri":"Ruth_St._Denis","surface_form":"Ruth St. Denis","offset":1445},{"uri":"Martha_Graham","surface_form":"Martha Graham","offset":1464},{"uri":"Rudolf_Von_Laban","surface_form":"Rudolf Von Laban","offset":1508},{"uri":"Mary_Wigman","surface_form":"Mary Wigman","offset":1529}]}
