Topeka is the county seat of Shawnee County, and it is in the northeast part of the state. In 2010, 127,473 people lived there.\nTopeka was established in 1854 when nine white men founded the Topeka Town Association. At an election in November 1861, the people of Kansas chose Topeka as the permanent capital of the state.\nNaming history.\nThe name \"Topeka\" is made up of three words from the Kaw, Omaha, and Iowa Native American tribes. The first, \"to\", means \"potato\". The second, \"pe\" (short for \"pekae\") is an adjective meaning \"good\". The third, \"okae\", means \"to dig\". Thus, the name \"Topeka\" means \"a good place to dig potatoes\". The name was chosen because \"[i]t was a novel name of Indian origin, euphonious [pleasing] of sound and simple\".\nHistory and culture.\nCharles Sheldon and Charles Fox Parham, both important people in the history of American Christianity, were preachers in Topeka. Many historians believe that the modern Pentecostalism movement started in Monroe's church in 1901. Sheldon was a preacher in Topeka around the same time, who is famous for coming up with the phrase \"What would Jesus do?\"\n\"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka\" was a lawsuit that went before the United States Supreme Court in 1954. Several families sued the public school board in Topeka for the right for black students to go to the same schools as white students.

Board of Education\" and civil rights for African-Americans.\nGeography.\nTopeka is at, in north east Kansas. It is at the intersection of I-70 and U.S. Highway 75.
