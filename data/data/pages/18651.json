{"id":18651,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_City%2C_Missouri","text":"Jefferson City is the capital of the U.S. state of Missouri. It is also county seat of Cole County. (The Jefferson City metropolitan area includes all of Callaway and Cole counties.) As of the 2010 census, the population was 43,079. Jefferson City was named after Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.\nJefferson City is on the northern edge of the Ozark Plateau on the southern side of the Missouri River near the geographic center of the state, in a region known as Mid-Missouri. It is at the western edge of the Missouri Rhineland, one of the major wine-producing regions of the Midwest.\nHistory.\nIn pre-Columbian times, this region was home of an ancient people known only as the Mound Builders. By the time European settlers began arriving, the Mound Builders had vanished into history. The contemporary indigenous peoples were called the Osage Indians. When the Missouri Territory was organized in 1812, St. Louis was the seat of government. St. Charles next served as the capital.\nThe new state legislature decided to build a new capital city in the middle of the state in 1821. They named it after Thomas Jefferson, who was still alive. A village was already there called Lohman's Landing. For years the village was little more than a trading post located in the wilderness about midway between St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1826 the Missouri legislature first met here and in 1839 the settlement was incorporated as a city.\nJefferson City was selected as the site for a state prison and, in 1836, the Missouri State Penitentiary was opened. The prison was home to a number of infamous Americans, including: former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, assassin James Earl Ray, and bank robber Charles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd.\nDuring the American Civil War, Jefferson City was occupied by Union troops. Many of the people in the state supported the Union, although Missouri's Little Dixie section along the river in western counties was strongly Confederate.\nGerman immigrants created vineyards in small towns on either side of the Missouri River, especially on the north from Jefferson City east to Marthasville outside St. Louis. Known as the Missouri Rhineland for its vineyards, first established by German immigrants in the mid-19th century, this area has become a part of the agricultural and tourist economy.\nGeography.\nJefferson City is located at (38.572954, -92.189283). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of, of which, is land and (3.61%) is water.\nEducation.\nJefferson City is served by the Jefferson City Public School District, which operates Jefferson City High School, Simonsen 9th Grade Center, Lewis and Clark Middle School and Thomas Jefferson Middle School, and eleven elementary schools. The district is currently considering building a second high school. There are 4 private elementary schools: St. Joseph's Cathedral, [http://www.stpeterjc.com/STPeter.nsf St. Peter], [http://www.icangels.com/icschoolweb/index.htm Immaculate Conception], and [http://www.trinityjc.org/school/ Trinity Lutheran.][http://www.calvarylhs.org/ Calvary Lutheran], [http://www.heliashighschool.com Helias Catholic], and [http://www.lpajc.com/ Lighthouse Preparatory Academy] are Jefferson City's private high schools.\nLincoln University is a public historically black university with open enrollment and certificate, associate, bachelor, and graduate programs. Columbia College, Linn State Technical College, William Woods University, Metro Business College, and Merrell University also have locations in Jefferson City with varying degree levels and options.\nTransportation.\nJefftran operates a public bus system year-round. Jefferson City is one of four state capitols in United States that are not served by an interstate highway. Only four other state capitols nationwide share in this oddity. Interstate 70 passes by the city to the north, in Columbia. U.S. Highways in the city include U.S. Route 50, U.S. Route 54, and U.S. Route 63. Also Route 179 and Route 94 run through the city, giving it four highways that intersect with I-70. Jefferson City is also home to an Amtrak station.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(political)","surface_form":"capital","offset":22},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":37},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":42},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":51},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":72},{"uri":"Cole_County%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Cole County","offset":87},{"uri":"Jefferson_City_metropolitan_area","surface_form":"Jefferson City metropolitan area","offset":105},{"uri":"Callaway_County%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Callaway","offset":154},{"uri":"Cole_County%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Cole","offset":167},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":193},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":264},{"uri":"Ozark_Plateau","surface_form":"Ozark Plateau","offset":370},{"uri":"Missouri_River","surface_form":"Missouri River","offset":412},{"uri":"Mid-Missouri","surface_form":"Mid-Missouri","offset":489},{"uri":"Missouri_Rhineland","surface_form":"Missouri Rhineland","offset":536},{"uri":"Midwest","surface_form":"Midwest","offset":603},{"uri":"Mound_builder_(people)","surface_form":"Mound Builders","offset":705},{"uri":"Osage_Nation","surface_form":"Osage Indians","offset":865},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":931},{"uri":"St._Charles%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Charles","offset":969},{"uri":"St._Louis","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":1324},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City","offset":1338},{"uri":"Missouri_State_Penitentiary","surface_form":"Missouri State Penitentiary","offset":1531},{"uri":"Sonny_Liston","surface_form":"Sonny Liston","offset":1665},{"uri":"James_Earl_Ray","surface_form":"James Earl Ray","offset":1688},{"uri":"Charles_%26quot%3BPretty_Boy%26quot%3B_Floyd","surface_form":"Charles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd","offset":1720},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":1759},{"uri":"Union_(American_Civil_War)","surface_form":"Union","offset":1810},{"uri":"Little_Dixie_(Missouri)","surface_form":"Little Dixie","offset":1897},{"uri":"Confederate_States_of_America","surface_form":"Confederate","offset":1967},{"uri":"Marthasville%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Marthasville","offset":2121},{"uri":"Missouri_Rhineland","surface_form":"Missouri Rhineland","offset":2166},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"United States Census Bureau","offset":2419},{"uri":"Jefferson_City_Public_School_District","surface_form":"Jefferson City Public School District","offset":2561},{"uri":"Jefferson_City_High_School","surface_form":"Jefferson City High School","offset":2615},{"uri":"Lincoln_University_(Missouri)","surface_form":"Lincoln University","offset":3277},{"uri":"Historically_black_colleges_and_universities","surface_form":"historically black university","offset":3308},{"uri":"Columbia_College_(Missouri)","surface_form":"Columbia College","offset":3420},{"uri":"Linn_State_Technical_College","surface_form":"Linn State Technical College","offset":3438},{"uri":"William_Woods_University","surface_form":"William Woods University","offset":3468},{"uri":"Metro_Business_College","surface_form":"Metro Business College","offset":3494},{"uri":"Merrell_University","surface_form":"Merrell University","offset":3522},{"uri":"Interstate_70","surface_form":"Interstate 70","offset":3857},{"uri":"Columbia%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Columbia","offset":3907},{"uri":"U.S._Route_50","surface_form":"U.S. Route 50","offset":3951},{"uri":"U.S._Route_54","surface_form":"U.S. Route 54","offset":3966},{"uri":"U.S._Route_63","surface_form":"U.S. Route 63","offset":3985},{"uri":"Missouri_Highway_179","surface_form":"Route 179","offset":4005},{"uri":"Missouri_Highway_94","surface_form":"Route 94","offset":4019},{"uri":"Interstate_70_(Missouri)","surface_form":"I-70","offset":4094},{"uri":"Jefferson_City_(Amtrak_station)","surface_form":"Amtrak station","offset":4134}]}
