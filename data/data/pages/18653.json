{"id":18653,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_City%2C_Nevada","text":"Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada. At the 2010 United States Census, Carson City had a population of 55,274.\nHistory.\nSettlers who lived present-day Carson City named the area \"Washoe\", after the Washoe Native Americans who lived there. John C. Fr\u00E9mont and his party of explorers were the first European Americans to visit the Carson City area in 1843. Fr\u00E9mont named a river flowing through the valley Carson River for Christopher \"Kit\" Carson, who was a scout on Fr\u00E9mont's expedition.\nWhen Nevada became a state in 1864 during the Civil War, Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital. Abraham Curry, the founder of Carson City, reserved an area equivalent to four city blocks (10 acres or 4.04 ha) at the center of the town for the future state capitol building. When the Capitol building was built ten years later, it was located there. The fourth session of the state legislature met in the still-incomplete building at the beginning of 1871. Construction was completed by May 1, 1871.\nTransportation.\nThere are three major highways in the city US Route 395, US Route 50 and Interstate 580.\nCarson City's first bus system, called Jump Around Carson, opened in October 2005. There is almost no ground public transportation to other cities. Passenger train service stopped in 1948. Greyhound Lines stopped bus service there in 2006. Amtrak stopped their bus to Sacramento in 2008. Greyhound and Amtrak have busses to Reno, Monday to Friday.\nCarson Airport is in the northern part of the city. Reno-Tahoe International Airport, away, has domestic commercial flights.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":19},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":27},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":39},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":48},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":57},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 United States Census","offset":72},{"uri":"Settler","surface_form":"Settler","offset":148},{"uri":"Washoe_people","surface_form":"Washoe","offset":226},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":233},{"uri":"John_C._Fr%C3%A9mont","surface_form":"John C.
