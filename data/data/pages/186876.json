{"id":186876,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelin%27_So_Good_(DVD)","text":"\"Feelin' So Good\" is the first video album by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was first released in the United States on DVD and VHS on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony's music and entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. Executively produced by Lopez alongside Cory Rooney and Benny Medina, \"Feelin' So Good\" provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. With a run time of one hour, it contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview segments of \"Feelin' So Good\" were conducted by Lopez's sister Lynda, who interviews not only Lopez, but also her mother, Medina and her future husband Marc Anthony.\n\"Feelin' So Good\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, although it was noted that it would be of no interest to those who were not fans of Lopez. It was additionally praised for showing Lopez's transition from her acting career to a music career. In the United States, \"Feelin' So Good\" was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the RIAA for shipments of 50,000 units.\nBackground.\nFrom a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in \"My Little Girl\" (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show \"Synchronicity\" in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program \"In Living Color\". She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue an acting career.\nAfter a series of co-starring film roles, Lopez received her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in \"Selena\", a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice is used for the musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip synching. When asked by an interview if \"Selena\" inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: \"I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled \"Vivir Sin Ti\", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Records, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album \"On the 6\".\nTransition from film to music.\nDuring production of the \"On the 6\", Lopez was aware of the fact that she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\" Lopez's debut single \"If You Had My Love\" was serviced to radio in the United States on May 4, 1999. The song debuted at 72 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the week of May 15, 1999, and entered the top ten two weeks later. A month after the single's release, it moved to number six, earning the \"Greatest Gainer\" title of the week, and reached the top spot on June 12, 1999. The song dethroned Ricky Martin's \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" as the number-one song in the country; this was the first time a Latin artist followed another Latin artist to the top of the chart since Gloria Estefan's \"Coming Out Of The Dark\" replaced Timmy T's \"One More Try\" in March 1991. Lopez also became the first artist to top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with their debut single since Britney Spears did with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior. \"If You Had My Love\" stayed atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for a period of a month, and remained in the top ten until September of 1999. \"If You Had My Love\" was also a success internationally; topping the charts in countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The song also peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten of seven other countries.\n\"No Me Ames\", a duet with American recording artist Marc Anthony was released as a B-side to \"If You Had My Love\" and as the album's second single. The song was promoted by Sony Discos, who released a salsa and a ballad version of the song on their respective radio formats. The surprising success of both \"If You Had My Love\" and the album made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\". Following the release of \"If You Had My Love\" and \"No Me Ames\", three additional singles were released. By the end of 1999, Lopez had successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.\nVideo contents.\n\"Rather than the usual collection\", \"Feelin' So Good\" provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. It contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as \"very slick and promotional\". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez \"comes through energetically\" and without \"much star-ego\". The video album provides very basic information about the singer's career, rather than going too much into detail. The release has been compared to the DVD releases of Mariah Carey. Cory Rooney and Lopez acted as album executive producers of the DVD, while Lopez acted as a video executive producer, alongside Benny Medina. Jeffrey Norskog acted as a video associate producer.\nChapters overview.\n\"Feelin' So Good\" opens with a intertitle that features a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for \"On the 6\", artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles.

Lopez then confers, in the chapter \"Press Tours / Promotions\", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more \"personal\" as it is something that is \"closer to your heart\" and something she \"really believes in\".

Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: \"It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in \"The Cell\". I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although much has been made of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress \u2013 I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner\". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the \"Waiting for Tonight\" music video. He concluded by stating that: \"Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"video album","offset":31},{"uri":"Jennifer_Lopez","surface_form":"Jennifer
