{"id":18747,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladino_language","text":"Ladino (also called Judeo-Spanish) is a Jewish Romance language that is very close to the Spanish language from which it originates. It has many old Spanish words and Hebrew words.\nDuring the Middle Ages, many Jews lived in Spain. These Jews were called Sephardic Jews or \"Sephardim\" (in Hebrew). They were forced to leave Spain after the country was taken over by Christians, and they brought this old Spanish with them to the countries they ran away to. Today some Sephardic Jews still speak Ladino in Israel, Turkey, Bulgaria, the United States, and other countries.\nLike many other Jewish languages, Ladino, which as an endangered language, is in danger of language death and thus could become an extinct language. Most native speakers are old, because many of them who emigrated to Israel, did not pass on the language to their children or grandchildren. In some Sephardic Jewish communities in Latin America and elsewhere, there is a threat of dialect levelling, meaning extinction by assimilation into modern Spanish.\nLadino is written using the Latin alphabet and in Israel using the Hebrew alphabet.\nLadino should not be confused with the Ladin language, which is related to the Swiss Romansh and Friulian languages and is mostly spoken in the S\u00FCdtirol region of Northern Italy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":40},{"uri":"Romance_language","surface_form":"Romance language","offset":47},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish language","offset":90},{"uri":"Origin","surface_form":"originates","offset":121},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":167},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":192},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":224},{"uri":"Sephardi_Jews","surface_form":"Sephardic","offset":254},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christians","offset":365},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":504},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":512},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":520},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":534},{"uri":"Endangered_language","surface_form":"endangered language","offset":624},{"uri":"Language_death","surface_form":"language death","offset":661},{"uri":"Extinct_language","surface_form":"extinct language","offset":701},{"uri":"Native_speaker","surface_form":"native speaker","offset":724},{"uri":"Emigration","surface_form":"emigrated","offset":774},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":900},{"uri":"Dialect_levelling","surface_form":"dialect levelling","offset":950},{"uri":"Assimilation","surface_form":"assimilation","offset":991},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":1053},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":1092},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":1099},{"uri":"Ladin_language","surface_form":"Ladin language","offset":1148},{"uri":"Romansh_language","surface_form":"Swiss Romansh","offset":1188},{"uri":"Friulan_language","surface_form":"Friulian","offset":1206},{"uri":"S%C3%BCdtirol","surface_form":"S\u00FCdtirol","offset":1253},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1281}]}
