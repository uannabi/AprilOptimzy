{"id":187773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy","text":"Cyclone Tracy was a tropical cyclone that destroyed the city of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, 1974. It is the most compact tropical cyclone on record in Australia, with the gale force winds reaching out only from the centre. It is the second most compact cyclone in the world. Tropical Storm Marco of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season had gale-force winds reaching only from the centre. After forming over the Arafura Sea, the Tracy moved south and hit the city with Category\u00A04 winds on the Australian cyclone scale. It is possible that it had reached Category\u00A03 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale when it made landfall.\nTracy killed 71 people, caused $837\u00A0million in damage (1974 AUD) and destroyed more than 70% of Darwin's buildings, including 80% of the houses. Of the 49,000 people who lived in Darwin, 20,000 people were left homeless. More than 30,000 people had to leave the city. Most of Darwin's population were moved to Adelaide, Whyalla, Alice Springs and Sydney. Many people never returned to Darwin. The city was rebuilt using modern materials and updated building methods. Bruce Stannard of \"The Age\" stated that Cyclone Tracy was a \"disaster... without parallel in Australia's history.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":20},{"uri":"Darwin%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Darwin","offset":64},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":72},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":92},{"uri":"Christmas_Eve","surface_form":"Christmas Eve","offset":108},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas Day","offset":125},{"uri":"Compact","surface_form":"compact","offset":161},{"uri":"Gale","surface_form":"gale","offset":219},{"uri":"Tropical_Storm_Marco_(2008)","surface_form":"Tropical Storm Marco","offset":323},{"uri":"2008_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2008 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":351},{"uri":"Arafura_Sea","surface_form":"Arafura Sea","offset":457},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone_scales","surface_form":"Australian cyclone scale","offset":538},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","offset":617},{"uri":"Landfall_(meteorology)","surface_form":"landfall","offset":661},{"uri":"Australian_dollar","surface_form":"AUD","offset":731},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":981},{"uri":"Whyalla%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Whyalla","offset":991},{"uri":"Alice_Springs%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Alice Springs","offset":1000},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":1018},{"uri":"The_Age","surface_form":"The Age","offset":1157},{"uri":"History_of_Australia","surface_form":"Australia's history","offset":1231}]}
