{"id":187804,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_museum","text":"An art museum or art gallery is a place where works of arts are shown for people to look at. These works of art are usually paintings, but they can also be sculptures, photographs or other visual art works. Most art museums are open for the public to visit, but there are also some which are private.\nWhat distinguishes an art museum from other galleries is that it owns the works of art. A museum has staff called \"curators\", who are expert on art. Art museums are often used to help teach students about the history of art. There are about 700 uiversity art museums and galleries in the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":124},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":156},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":168},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"owns","offset":366},{"uri":"Curator","surface_form":"curator","offset":416}]}
