{"id":187956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadbeater%27s_possum","text":"Leadbeater's possum (\"Gymnobelideus leadbeateri\") is an endangered species of Australian possum. They need food all year round, and trees with holes where they can hide during the day. They live in mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with plenty of \"Acacia\".\nThe possum was once thought to be extinct. It now lives only in small areas of old and mixed age mountain ash forest in the central highlands of Victoria, north-east of Melbourne.\nThese trees are a species of \"Eucalyptus\": they give off vapour which catches fire easily. About half this area was burnt in the disastrous Black Saturday bushfire in 2009. Large areas of the forest around Marysville, Narbethong and Healesville were destroyed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered species","offset":56},{"uri":"Australian","surface_form":"Australian","offset":78},{"uri":"Possum","surface_form":"possum","offset":89},{"uri":"Sclerophyll","surface_form":"sclerophyll","offset":212},{"uri":"Acacia","surface_form":"Acacia","offset":247},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":290},{"uri":"Eucalyptus_regnans","surface_form":"mountain ash","offset":353},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":366},{"uri":"Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":401},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":425},{"uri":"Eucalyptus","surface_form":"Eucalyptus","offset":466},{"uri":"Black_Saturday","surface_form":"Black Saturday","offset":576},{"uri":"Bushfire","surface_form":"bushfire","offset":591},{"uri":"Marysville%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Marysville","offset":642},{"uri":"Narbethong%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Narbethong","offset":654},{"uri":"Healesville%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Healesville","offset":669}]}
