It is made by putting chemical glazes on the tile, let it dry, and putting it into a kiln (an oven that heats up to high temperatures). The kiln heats to about 2000 degrees turning the chemical glaze to colors. It is often framed and sold. This is a popular form of art.\nGlazed tiles were used to make the roof on buildings in China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tile","surface_form":"tile","offset":19},{"uri":"Glaze","surface_form":"glaze","offset":29},{"uri":"Kiln","surface_form":"kiln","offset":121},{"uri":"Oven","surface_form":"oven","offset":130},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":157},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":302},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":363}]}
