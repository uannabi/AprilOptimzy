{"id":188,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_monasteries","text":"The dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.\nThis was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the Church of England (which is a type of Christianity). Parliament made the Act of Supremacy to give him the right to do both these things. It was part of the Protestant Reformation in England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":86},{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":99},{"uri":"Roman_Catholicism","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":170},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Church of England","offset":333},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":371},{"uri":"Act_of_Supremacy","surface_form":"Act of Supremacy","offset":406},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Protestant Reformation","offset":489}]}
