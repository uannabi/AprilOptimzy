{"id":18812,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales","text":"New South Wales is one of the states of Australia. It the oldest state in Australia and is sometimes called the \"Premier State\". Of all Australian states, New South Wales has the most people. An inhabitant of New South Wales is referred to as a New South Welshman. The capital city of New South Wales is Sydney. Sydney is the biggest city in Australia.\nThe name New South Wales came from the journal of Lieutenant James Cook (later Captain Cook), who sailed up the east coast of Australia in 1770. He thought that the land looked like the south coast of Wales. He named it \"New Wales\" but then changed the name in his journal to \"New South Wales\".\nNew South Wales was founded (begun) in 1788, by the British who set up a small colony which became known as Sydney Town, and grew into the city of Sydney. The British colony of New South Wales originally included more than half of the Australian mainland, as well as New Zealand, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. During the 19th century large areas were separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New Zealand.\nGeography.\nThe state is bordered on the north by Queensland, on the west by South Australia, and on the south by Victoria. Its coast faces the Tasman Sea. New South Wales contains two Federal Territories: the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and the Jervis Bay Territory.\nNew South Wales' three big cities are Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong which all lie along the coast. Other settlements include Albury, a large town which borders with Victoria; Broken Hill, the most westerly large town; Dubbo; Orange, Bowral, Bathurst, home of the Bathurst 1000; Port Macquarie, Tamworth, home to the country music festival; Armidale, Inverell, Lismore, Nowra, Gosford, Griffith, Queanbeyan, Leeton, Wagga Wagga, Goulburn, where a lot of Australia's fruit is grown and Coffs Harbour, a popular tourist destination.\nDemographics.\nThe population of New South Wales at the end of June 2007 was 6.89 million people. Population grew by 1.1% over the preceding year, lower than the national rate of 1.5%.\n62.9% of NSW's population is based in Sydney.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"states","offset":30},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":40},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":304},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":554},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":727},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":756},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":1162},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":1189},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":1226},{"uri":"Tasman_Sea","surface_form":"Tasman Sea","offset":1256},{"uri":"Australian_Capital_Territory","surface_form":"Australian Capital Territory","offset":1322},{"uri":"Jervis_Bay_Territory","surface_form":"Jervis Bay Territory","offset":1366},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":1426},{"uri":"Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Newcastle","offset":1434},{"uri":"Wollongong%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wollongong","offset":1448},{"uri":"Albury%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Albury","offset":1516},{"uri":"Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":1556},{"uri":"Broken_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Broken Hill","offset":1566},{"uri":"Dubbo%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Dubbo","offset":1609},{"uri":"Orange%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Orange","offset":1616},{"uri":"Bowral","surface_form":"Bowral","offset":1624},{"uri":"Bathurst%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Bathurst","offset":1632},{"uri":"Bathurst_1000","surface_form":"Bathurst 1000","offset":1654},{"uri":"Port_Macquarie%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Port Macquarie","offset":1669},{"uri":"Tamworth%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Tamworth","offset":1685},{"uri":"Armidale%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Armidale","offset":1731},{"uri":"Inverell%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Inverell","offset":1741},{"uri":"Lismore%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lismore","offset":1751},{"uri":"Nowra%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Nowra","offset":1760},{"uri":"Gosford%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gosford","offset":1767},{"uri":"Griffith%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Griffith","offset":1776},{"uri":"Queanbeyan%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Queanbeyan","offset":1786},{"uri":"Leeton%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Leeton","offset":1798},{"uri":"Wagga_Wagga%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wagga Wagga","offset":1806},{"uri":"Goulburn%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Goulburn","offset":1819},{"uri":"Coffs_Harbour%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Coffs Harbour","offset":1875},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":2143}]}
