For the drug, see Cannabis (drug). For other uses of the word \"hemp\", see Hemp (disambiguation).\"\nHemp (\"Cannabis sativa\" subsp. \"sativa\") is a plant and the fibers made from it. It is a subspecies of the \"Cannabis sativa\" plant. It is usually used to make cloth and other textiles, and ropes.\nHistory.\nHemp is one of the oldest plants humans have grown and used. Hemp was domesticated in Asia over 10,000 years ago. It was already used to make clothes, ropes, and an early form of paper. The seeds were eaten, and the plant had medicinal uses. From there the use of hemp spread. In Europe, hemp was at least used 5,500 years ago. It is one of the earliest domesticated plants recorded. It is quite strong and does not need many pesticides (to keep away bugs) and no herbicides. Linen and hemp were the most important fiber plants in Europe for a long time.\nHemp is similar to marijuana, but contains very little THC, the chemical that makes people feel good while using marijuana. Hemp is completely legal in the United States, France, Spain, Indonesia, England, and Ireland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cannabis","surface_form":"Cannabis","offset":105},{"uri":"Cannabis_(drug)","surface_form":"Cannabis (drug)","offset":133},{"uri":"Hemp_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"Hemp (disambiguation)","offset":189},{"uri":"Fiber","surface_form":"fiber","offset":273},{"uri":"Cannabis_sativa","surface_form":"Cannabis sativa","offset":321},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":372},{"uri":"Textiles","surface_form":"textiles","offset":388},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":402},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"grown","offset":463},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":488},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":504},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicinal","offset":644},{"uri":"Domesticate","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":772},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":844},{"uri":"Linen","surface_form":"Linen","offset":894},{"uri":"Marijuana","surface_form":"marijuana","offset":992},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":1037}]}
