{"id":188212,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_zone_model","text":"The Concentric zone model, or Burgess model is a model to explain how a settlement, such as a city, will grow. It was developed by Ernest W. Burgess between 1925 and 1929. Burgess looked at the growth of Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th century. Many people moved to Chicago at that time.\nBurgess saw that richer people tended to live farther away from the city center. When the city grew, the city center would grow; the rings would also shift outwards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Model","surface_form":"model","offset":49},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":72},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":94},{"uri":"Ernest_W._Burgess","surface_form":"Ernest W.
