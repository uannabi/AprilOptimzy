{"id":188301,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_cultural_bloc","text":"=\"preserve\">The Western Desert cultural bloc or just Western Desert is a cultural region in Australia covering about 600 000 square kilometres, including the Gibson Desert, the Great Victoria Desert, the Great Sandy Desert and Little Sandy Deserts in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. The Western Desert can be said to stretch from the Nullarbor in the south to the Kimberley region of Western Australia in the north, and from the Percival Lakes in the west through to the Pintupi lands in the Northern Territory.\nThis term is often used by anthropologists and linguists when discussing the 40 or so Aboriginal groups that live there, who speak dialects of one language, often called the Western Desert language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":92},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":255},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":275},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":295},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":523}]}
