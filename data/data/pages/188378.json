{"id":188378,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_map","text":"=\"preserve\">The Tube Map, is a map that navigates passengers around London using the London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, and Emirates Air-line. To make the map easier to read, the lines of the tunnels are made straight instead of the shape they really follow.\nThe Tube Map was the first map to use these simplifying techniques that are now used in transport maps across the world. Transport for London (TfL) continue to expand the Tube map as more stations, lines and methods of transport are added.\nThe Tube Map helps navigate over a billion journeys a year in the biggest city in Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":31},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":68},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":85},{"uri":"London_Overground","surface_form":"London Overground","offset":105},{"uri":"Docklands_Light_Railway","surface_form":"Docklands Light Railway","offset":124},{"uri":"Emirates_Air-line","surface_form":"Emirates Air-line","offset":153},{"uri":"Transport_for_London","surface_form":"Transport for London","offset":409}]}
