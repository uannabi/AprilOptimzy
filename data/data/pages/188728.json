It is the hub for Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, Hong Kong Express and Air Hong Kong. It is the third busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic in the world, and the busiest in the world in terms of cargo traffic.\nThe airport has an advanced highway and railway system linking it to the city centre of Hong Kong.
