{"id":189071,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Party","text":"e=\"preserve\">The British National Party (or BNP for short) is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. The party's policies promote an end to Third World immigration, right-wing populism and Third position economics. They are British nationalists. They want to \"keep Britain British\" by not letting people from other countries move to the UK. The party was led by Nick Griffin from 1999 until 2014 and the current leader of the BNP is Adam Walker.\nIn 2009, the party had 2 MEPs (Members of European Parliament) out of 73 British seats in the European Parliament. Those two seats were held by Griffin and Andrew Brons. It has no seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom or the devolved assemblies.\nThe BNP was started in 1982 by John Tyndall (politician).\nIn November 2012 the British Democratic Party was started by Brons. Brons started the party after leaving the BNP in October 2012. Brons wants the BDP to end the BNP. He does not like the BNP because he thinks its ideology is not extreme enough. Griffin lost his seat in the European Parliament in 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Far-right","surface_form":"far-right","offset":64},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":74},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":97},{"uri":"Third_World","surface_form":"Third World","offset":152},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":164},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":177},{"uri":"Populism","surface_form":"populism","offset":188},{"uri":"Third_position","surface_form":"Third position","offset":201},{"uri":"Nick_Griffin","surface_form":"Nick Griffin","offset":374},{"uri":"Adam_Walker","surface_form":"Adam Walker","offset":445},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":552},{"uri":"Andrew_Brons","surface_form":"Andrew Brons","offset":614},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons of the United Kingdom","offset":651},{"uri":"John_Tyndall_(politician)","surface_form":"John Tyndall (politician)","offset":749},{"uri":"British_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"British Democratic Party","offset":797},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideology","offset":990}]}
