Sholokhov's detractors claimed that it was written by Fyodor Kryukov, a Cossack and anti-Bolshevik, who died in 1920. In 1987, several thousand pages of notes and drafts of the work were discovered and authenticated, including chapters excluded from the final draft. An analysis of the novel has unambiguously proved Sholokhov's authorship. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov's own hand, and 285 are transcribed by his wife Maria and sisters.\nLegacy.\nAn asteroid in main-belt is named after him, 2448 Sholokhov.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["writer"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":70},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":77},{"uri":"Novelist","surface_form":"novelist","offset":85},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":117},{"uri":"Cossack","surface_form":"Cossack","offset":349},{"uri":"Bolshevik","surface_form":"Bolshevik","offset":366},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":766},{"uri":"Main-belt","surface_form":"main-belt","offset":778},{"uri":"2448_Sholokhov","surface_form":"2448 Sholokhov","offset":808}]}
