It lives in the rainforests of South America and Central America, and spends most of its time on trees. It can eat both meat and plants and has a gripping tail that can be used like an arm. It is an endangered species because it is being hunted for its fur, meat and to be illegally sold as pets.\nAppearance.\nAlthough kinkajous may look like monkeys, lemurs, koalas, opossums, bears or ferrets, they are not related to those animals.
