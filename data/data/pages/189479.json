{"id":189479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","text":"=\"preserve\">The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is a small nucleus in the hypothalamus in middle of the brain. It is right on top of the optic chiasma.\nIt is our \"body clock\", and controls our daily rhythms by hormones and nerve impulses. With its various cell types, it puts out peptides such as vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and neurotransmitters.\nThe SCN controls when we get sleepy and when we wake up, when we are active and when we get hungry. The SCN gets information about light and dark from the retina in the eye so it can adjust itself to the true 24 hours. To do this it uses only about 20,000 cells.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nucleus_(brain)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":58},{"uri":"Hypothalamus","surface_form":"hypothalamus","offset":73},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":103},{"uri":"Optic_chiasma","surface_form":"optic chiasma","offset":136},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":209},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cell","offset":255},{"uri":"Peptide","surface_form":"peptide","offset":279},{"uri":"Vasopressin","surface_form":"vasopressin","offset":296},{"uri":"Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","surface_form":"vasoactive intestinal peptide","offset":312},{"uri":"Neurotransmitters","surface_form":"neurotransmitters","offset":347},{"uri":"Retina","surface_form":"retina","offset":521},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":535}]}
