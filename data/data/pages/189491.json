There were 93,650 people in Brantford the last time the Government of Canada did a census count, in 2011.\nBrantford is near Hamilton.\nBrantford is sometimes called \"The Telephone City\", because the inventor of the telephone lived in Brantford. Hockey player Wayne Gretzky was born in Brantford.\nHistory.\nBrantford was settled by United Empire Loyalists led by Joseph Brant of the Iroquois in 1784. It became a city in 1877.\nBusiness.\nFrom 1900 until 1950, Brantford had many companies that made equipment and machinery. Those items were sold in Canada and many other countries. Having the river and a railroad for transportation made it easier to ship the items made in Brantford. That helped Brantford change from a farming town to an industrial city.\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, business in Brantford was dropping and some companies like White Farm Equipment, Massey-Ferguson, Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and others stopped making products. Many people lost their factory jobs.\nA new piece of highway (Highway 403) was built in 1997. The new highway made it easier to drive Hamilton and Toronto, and also to Detroit and Buffalo. So, in 2004, Procter & Gamble and Ferrero SpA moved to Brantford. Now other companies set up in Brantford because it is a good location for shipping products to eastern North America.\nEducation.\n40% of people in Brantford did not finish high-school. In the rest of the province of Ontario, this number is 33%.\nPeople in Brantford earn 9% less than people in the rest of Canada.\nPolitics.\nThe city council was elected on October 27, 2014, and is led by Mayor Chris Friel.

The next election will be in October 2018.\nNewspapers, radio and television (TV).\nThe \"Brantford Expositor\", which began in 1852, is printed six times a week (everyday except Sunday). The Brant News is published weekly in Brantford.\nBrantford has its own television service: Rogers TV (cable 20), a local community channel on Rogers Cable. Other television stations come fromToronto, Hamilton and Kitchener.\nFilming in Brantford.\nBrantford has been used to film parts of the Murdoch Mysteries television series because it has lots of old architecture that fits with the years that the stories take place.\nMovies like \"Welcome to Mooseport\" and \"Where the Truth Lies\" were partly made in Brantford. Part of \"Due South\", \"Dr. Long Ball\", was made at Arnold Anderson Stadium in a park in Brantford. Also, \"Weirdsville\", was made in Brantford in 2006. \"Silent Hill\" was made in the downtown in 2005.\nAirports.\nBrantford Municipal Airport is in the west end of the city. It has an air show and sometimes the Snowbirds perform. The John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton is about 35\u00A0km east of Brantford. Toronto Pearson International Airport is in Mississauga, about 100\u00A0km north and east of Brantford.\nTrains.\nThe train station is located just north of downtown Brantford.
