{"id":19002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_missile","text":"=\"preserve\">Nuclear missiles are missiles (rockets that land on the earth or hit something in the air, the water, or whatever) with atomic bombs inside.\nIn the time of Cold War the USA and the Soviet Union were enemies and thought the other side was going to attack them. To dissuade the other side from attacking, both sides built many nuclear missiles to ensure Mutual assured destruction. This meant a country that attacked would be destroyed. Treaties were made to reduce the numbers of missiles to make everyone safer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Missile","surface_form":"missile","offset":33},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"atomic bomb","offset":132},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":168},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":181},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":193},{"uri":"Mutual_assured_destruction","surface_form":"Mutual assured destruction","offset":364},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"Treaties","offset":447}]}
