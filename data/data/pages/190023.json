He was born in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India. He died of a heart attack in New Delhi.\nNehru was the first post British independence prime minister.\nUnder British rule, Nehru was jailed many times. During these periods, he used to write long letters to his daughter, Indira, on Indian and World history. These letters were remarkably well written and became very successful books when published later as \"Glimpses of World History\" and \"The discovery of India\".\nHis father Motilal Nehru, was also an important figure in the Indian freedom struggle, and his daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi went on to become prime ministers of India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":105},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":124},{"uri":"Prayagraj","surface_form":"Prayagraj","offset":213},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":259},{"uri":"New_Delhi","surface_form":"New Delhi","offset":275},{"uri":"Indira_Gandhi","surface_form":"Indira Gandhi","offset":765},{"uri":"Rajiv_Gandhi","surface_form":"Rajiv Gandhi","offset":792}]}
