{"id":19007,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland","text":"The pituitary gland (or \"hypophysis\") is an important part of the endocrine system. It is at the base of the brain between the eyes. The pituitary is attached to the hypothalamus, which is also a gland. The pituitary controls a whole range of vital functions by secreting hormones.\nThe pituitary gland consists of two parts: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. It is functionally linked to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (also called the \"infundibulum\").\nThe hypothalamus releases factors down the pituitary stalk to the pituitary gland where they cause the release of pituitary hormones. Although the pituitary gland is known as the 'master' endocrine gland, both of the lobes are under the control of the hypothalamus.\nEndocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are controlled by regulatory hormones released by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus.\nHormones released.\nThe gland releases several kinds of hormones.\nPosterior pituitary.\nOxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a positive feedback loop. For example, uterine contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary, which, in turn, increases uterine contractions. This positive feedback loop continues throughout birth labour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Endocrine_system","surface_form":"endocrine system","offset":66},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":109},{"uri":"Hypothalamus","surface_form":"hypothalamus","offset":166},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":196},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":272},{"uri":"Hypothalamus","surface_form":"hypothalamus","offset":732},{"uri":"Neurosecretion","surface_form":"neurosecretory cells","offset":838},{"uri":"Feedback","surface_form":"feedback","offset":1023},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterine","offset":1051}]}
