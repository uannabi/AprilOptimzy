{"id":190073,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Poland","text":"Young Poland (in Polish: \"M\u0142oda Polska\") is a period modernist of Polish art, literature and music. This period covered about the years since 1890 until 1918. It was one of the effects of the strong opposition to the ideas of the positivism and developed the nature of decadence, of neoromanticism, of symbolism, of impressionism, and of the Art Nouveau.\nHistory.\nThe expression was known after one of the manifestos written by Artur G\u00F3rski. The manifesto was published in the daily (newspaper) \"\u017Bycie\" (\"Life\"), seated in Cracow, in the year 1898, and was immediately accepted in all the parts of the divided Poland, by analogy with other similar expressions as Young Germany, Young Belgium, Young Scandinavia and so on.\nMusic.\nIn music, the expression \"Young Poland\" is put into use to an informal group of composers which include Karol Szymanowski, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Ludomir R\u00F3\u017Cycki and probably also Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz. This group worked under the strong influence of the neoromanticism of the music, and especially of composers from another countries as Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner. The composers would be also strong links with the The Five, a group of composers Russian which included Modest Musorgski, Alexander Borodin and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\nArt.\nIn the period of the Young Poland there were not any great artistic currents in Polish art. The painters and the sculptors attempted to continue in the romantic tradition, in bringing new ways of expression already popular in another countries. The more influential current was the Art Nouveau, even if the Polish artists started attempting also new forms of national style. The sculptura just like the painture of the period were strongly influenced by all the forms of the symbolism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":17},{"uri":"Modernism","surface_form":"modernist","offset":53},{"uri":"1890","surface_form":"1890","offset":142},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":153},{"uri":"Positivism","surface_form":"positivism","offset":230},{"uri":"Decadence","surface_form":"decadence","offset":269},{"uri":"Neoromanticism","surface_form":"neoromanticism","offset":283},{"uri":"Symbolism","surface_form":"symbolism","offset":302},{"uri":"Impressionism","surface_form":"impressionism","offset":316},{"uri":"Art_Nouveau","surface_form":"Art Nouveau","offset":342},{"uri":"Manifesto","surface_form":"manifesto","offset":406},{"uri":"Artur_G%C3%B3rski","surface_form":"Artur G\u00F3rski","offset":428},{"uri":"Cracow","surface_form":"Cracow","offset":523},{"uri":"1898","surface_form":"1898","offset":543},{"uri":"Partitions_of_Poland","surface_form":"divided Poland","offset":602},{"uri":"Analogy","surface_form":"analogy","offset":621},{"uri":"Young_Germany","surface_form":"Young Germany","offset":663},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":684},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":699},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":732},{"uri":"Karol_Szymanowski","surface_form":"Karol Szymanowski","offset":833},{"uri":"Grzegorz_Fitelberg","surface_form":"Grzegorz Fitelberg","offset":852},{"uri":"Ludomir_R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki","surface_form":"Ludomir R\u00F3\u017Cycki","offset":872},{"uri":"Mieczys%C5%82aw_Kar%C5%82owicz","surface_form":"Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz","offset":906},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":1063},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":1083},{"uri":"The_Five","surface_form":"The Five","offset":1149},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1180},{"uri":"Modest_Musorgski","surface_form":"Modest Musorgski","offset":1203},{"uri":"Alexander_Borodin","surface_form":"Alexander Borodin","offset":1221},{"uri":"Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov","surface_form":"Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov","offset":1243},{"uri":"Sculptura","surface_form":"sculptura","offset":1652},{"uri":"Painture","surface_form":"painture","offset":1676}]}
