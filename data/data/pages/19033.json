{"id":19033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit","text":"Sanskrit is an ancient Indian language. It is a sacred language of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism and the origin of most Indian languages. Today, about 14,000 people in India use it as their daily language. It is one of the 22 official languages of India and an official language of the state of Uttarakhand.\nSanskrit is a standardized dialect of Old Indo-Aryan. Its linguistic ancestry can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European. The Indo-Aryan migration theory proposes that the Indo-Aryans migrated from the Central Asian steppes into South Asia during the early part of the 2nd millennium BC, bringing with them the Indo-Aryan languages. The main script used to write Sanskrit is Devan\u0101gar\u012B, but it can be written in the scripts of various Indian languages and is sometimes written by the Latin alphabet.\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jones_(philologist)]William Jones, working as a judge in India in the 18th century, studied Sanskrit and recognized similarities of Sanskrit with Latin and Greek.\nSanskrit literature includes poetry and drama. There is also scientific, technical, philosophical and religious texts. Sanskrit continues to be widely used as a ceremonial language in Hindu religious rituals and Buddhist practice in the form of hymns and chants.\nThe language has a very complex grammar, with eight grammatical cases, the grammatical genders, and three grammatical numbers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indian_languages","surface_form":"Indian language","offset":23},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":67},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":77},{"uri":"Jainism","surface_form":"Jainism","offset":90},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":169},{"uri":"Uttarakhand","surface_form":"Uttarakhand","offset":296},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":336},{"uri":"Proto-Indo-European","surface_form":"Proto-Indo-European","offset":409},{"uri":"Devanagari","surface_form":"Devan\u0101gar\u012B","offset":683},{"uri":"Latin_script","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":792},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":993},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":1003},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":1019},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":1039},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":1050},{"uri":"Hindu_philosophy","surface_form":"philosophical","offset":1094},{"uri":"Dharma","surface_form":"religious","offset":1112},{"uri":"Hymn","surface_form":"hymn","offset":1255},{"uri":"Mantra","surface_form":"chant","offset":1265},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":1305},{"uri":"Case_(grammar)","surface_form":"grammatical cases","offset":1325},{"uri":"Grammatical_gender","surface_form":"grammatical genders","offset":1348},{"uri":"Grammatical_number","surface_form":"grammatical numbers","offset":1379}]}
