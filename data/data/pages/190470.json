When he was only a child he was married to Elizabeth de Burgh (d.1363), daughter of William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster (d.1332). The ceremony took place on August 15, 1342, at the Tower of London. He became properly married to her in 1352, when he was aged 14, and took over all her lands in Ireland. The famous English poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, was a page to Elizabeth.\nLionel found it difficult to get control over Ireland and went back to England in 1367.\nAfter the death of Elizabeth, Lionel married Violante, the daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, Lord of Pavia (d.1378), in Milan during June 1368. While travelling around Italy, Lionel became sick and died at Alba on October 7, 1368. He was buried at the Clare Priory, Suffolk, England.\nHis daughter, Philippa Plantagenet, married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March (1351-1381), in 1368. This made Lionel an ancestor of Edward IV.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"November_29","surface_form":"November 29","offset":38},{"uri":"1338","surface_form":"1338","offset":51},{"uri":"October_7","surface_form":"October 7","offset":58},{"uri":"1368","surface_form":"1368","offset":69},{"uri":"Antwerp","surface_form":"Antwerp","offset":84},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"Edward III","offset":114},{"uri":"William_de_Burgh%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Ulster","surface_form":"William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster","offset":210},{"uri":"Tower_of_London","surface_form":"Tower of London","offset":308},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":420},{"uri":"Geoffrey_Chaucer","surface_form":"Geoffrey Chaucer","offset":454},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":702},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":750},{"uri":"Alba","surface_form":"Alba","offset":788},{"uri":"Edmund_Mortimer%2C_3rd_Earl_of_March","surface_form":"Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March","offset":910},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":987},{"uri":"Edward_IV_of_England","surface_form":"Edward IV","offset":999}]}
