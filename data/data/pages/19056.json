{"id":19056,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)","text":"Something that is elastic can be stretched or deformed (changed) and returned to its original form, like a rubber band. It tries to come back to its first shape. The \"stress\" is the force applied; the \"strain\" is how much the shape is changed, and the elastic modulus is the ratio between those numbers.\nThis idea was first suggested by Robert Hooke in 1675.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":107},{"uri":"Elastic_modulus","surface_form":"elastic modulus","offset":252},{"uri":"Robert_Hooke","surface_form":"Robert Hooke","offset":337}]}
