{"id":19072,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea","text":"The Red Sea is a sea between the Arabian Peninsula of Asia in the northeast and Africa in the southwest. It is a part of the Indian Ocean. The Red Sea is about 2200\u00A0km long and less than 330\u00A0km wide.\nMany ships go through the Red Sea because the Suez Channel at the north end connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Bab-el-Mandeb in the south is a gate to the Indian Ocean. Ports include Suez, Port Sudan, Massawa, Yanbu al-Bahr, Jeddah, Aqaba and Eilat.\nThe Red Sea has that name because it sometimes looks red from the red algae. The water has more salt and is clearer than water of most other seas because almost no rivers run into it.\nThe climate is dry and warm. Many people, including those from Europe, like to vacation there. Some of them are divers and want to see the beautiful coral reefs and fish. Seaside resorts include Sharm el-Sheikh, Eilat or Hurghada.\nGeography.\nThe countries next to the Red Sea are Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel.\nIn the Bible.\nAccording to the book of Exodus, God parted it for Moses and the Israelites so they could escape from the Egyptian Army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":17},{"uri":"Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Arabian Peninsula","offset":33},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":54},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":80},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":125},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":205},{"uri":"Suez_Channel","surface_form":"Suez Channel","offset":246},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":304},{"uri":"Bab-el-Mandeb","surface_form":"Bab-el-Mandeb","offset":323},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"Port","offset":381},{"uri":"Suez","surface_form":"Suez","offset":395},{"uri":"Port_Sudan","surface_form":"Port Sudan","offset":401},{"uri":"Massawa","surface_form":"Massawa","offset":413},{"uri":"Yanbu_al-Bahr","surface_form":"Yanbu al-Bahr","offset":422},{"uri":"Jeddah","surface_form":"Jeddah","offset":437},{"uri":"Aqaba","surface_form":"Aqaba","offset":445},{"uri":"Eilat","surface_form":"Eilat","offset":455},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":532},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":543},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":558},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":626},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":650},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":709},{"uri":"Scuba_diving","surface_form":"divers","offset":758},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":795},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":811},{"uri":"Seaside_resort","surface_form":"Seaside resort","offset":817},{"uri":"Sharm_el-Sheikh","surface_form":"Sharm el-Sheikh","offset":841},{"uri":"Eilat","surface_form":"Eilat","offset":858},{"uri":"Hurghada","surface_form":"Hurghada","offset":867},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":892},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":926},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":933},{"uri":"Eritrea","surface_form":"Eritrea","offset":940},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":949},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":956},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":970},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":981},{"uri":"Exodus","surface_form":"Exodus","offset":1028},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1036},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":1054},{"uri":"Israelite","surface_form":"Israelite","offset":1068},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":1109},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"Army","offset":1118}]}
