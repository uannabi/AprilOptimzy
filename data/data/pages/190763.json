The building is tall making it the tallest building in the Americas. Since late 2013, it is the tallest building in the United States. It opened in late 2014. It is mostly used for offices. People can view the city from an observatory near the top.\nHeight controversy.\nOn November 8, 2013, architects in Chicago and New York City began debating about the height of the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower. They were saying that there was a possibility that the Willis Tower is taller than the One World Trade Center.\nOn November 12, a committee agreed that the antenna on top is part of the building, so One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower.\nEven after removing the antennas from the measurement, One World Trade Center is about 325\u00A0ft taller than the Willis Tower.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["building"],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_Trade_Center_(2001-present)","surface_form":"World Trade Center","offset":100},{"uri":"Lower_Manhattan","surface_form":"Lower Manhattan","offset":130},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":147},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":221},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":343},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":452},{"uri":"Willis_Tower","surface_form":"Willis Tower","offset":562}]}
