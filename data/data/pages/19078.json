Most government matters are controlled by the Faroese government, except for military defense.\nThe Faroes have similarities to Iceland, Shetland, the Orkney Islands, the Outer Hebrides and Greenland. The island group, or archipelago, left Norway in 1815. The Faroes have their own representatives in the Nordic Council.\nRegions and municipalities.\nAdministratively, the islands are divided into 34 municipalities within which there are 120 or so cities and villages. Traditionally, there are also the six \"s\u00FDslur\" (\"regions\"; Nor\u00F0oyar, Eysturoy, Streymoy, V\u00E1gar, Sandoy and Su\u00F0uroy).\nGeography.\nThe Faroe Islands are eighteen islands off the coast of Northern Europe, between the Norwegian Sea and the north Atlantic Ocean.

There are 1,117\u00A0kilometres (694\u00A0mi) of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country.

By June 2008 unemployment had declined to 1.1%, before rising to 3.4% in early 2009. However, since fishing is so important to the economy, if there are problems with fishing, the economy could be in trouble Since 2000, new business projects have been created in the Faroe Islands to attract new investment. The introduction of Burger King in T\u00F3rshavn was widely publicized but no one knows how things will go for this company. Trades on the islands are easy by the bridges or the tunnels that connect 80% of the population in the islands.\n\u00D3lavs\u00F8ka.\nThe national holiday \u00D3lavs\u00F8ka, is on 29 July.
