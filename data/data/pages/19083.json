The RAF began in 1918 when the Royal Flying Corps (spoken as 'core') and the Royal Naval Air Service joined together. It is the oldest air force in the world. The first man to lead the RAF was Hugh Trenchard. The RAF has many bases across the world, including the UK, Falkland Islands, Cyprus and Gibraltar. Some examples of the UK bases are RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, RAF Valley in Wales, RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland and RAF Linton-on Ouse in England. The RAF has very new planes including the Eurofighter Typhoon, Panavia Tornado and the BAe Systems Hawk. The Hawk is used to train fast-jet pilots.\nWorld War II.\nThe RAF were very busy during World War II. Many important planes were built for the RAF. The Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane helped defend Britain during the Battle of Britain. The Avro Lancaster bomber attacked Germany with strategic bombing. The RAF lost great numbers of pilots and aircraft, fighting around the world and especially against the \"Luftwaffe\", the German Air Force.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":60},{"uri":"Air_force","surface_form":"air force","offset":77},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":94},{"uri":"Hugh_Trenchard%2C_1st_Viscount_Trenchard","surface_form":"Hugh Trenchard","offset":303},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":374},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":378},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":396},{"uri":"Gibraltar","surface_form":"Gibraltar","offset":407},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":471},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":495},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":520},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":563},{"uri":"Airplanes","surface_form":"planes","offset":593},{"uri":"Eurofighter_Typhoon","surface_form":"Eurofighter Typhoon","offset":614},{"uri":"Panavia_Tornado","surface_form":"Panavia Tornado","offset":635},{"uri":"BAe_Systems_Hawk","surface_form":"BAe Systems Hawk","offset":659},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":712},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":764},{"uri":"Supermarine_Spitfire","surface_form":"Supermarine Spitfire","offset":828},{"uri":"Hawker_Hurricane","surface_form":"Hawker Hurricane","offset":853},{"uri":"Battle_of_Britain","surface_form":"Battle of Britain","offset":903},{"uri":"Avro_Lancaster","surface_form":"Avro Lancaster","offset":926},{"uri":"Strategic_bombing","surface_form":"strategic bombing","offset":970},{"uri":"Luftwaffe","surface_form":"Luftwaffe","offset":1094}]}
