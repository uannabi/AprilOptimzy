{"id":190831,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel","text":"The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel is a famous luxury hotel in mid-town Manhattan, New York City. It has had two landmark buildings. The first was on the Fifth Avenue site of the Empire State Building. The present building at 301 Park Avenue in Manhattan is a 47 floor, Art Deco landmark, designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and dating from 1931. The Waldorf Astoria New York is a member of Hilton's Luxury and Lifestyle Brands with Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts and Denizen Hotels. The Waldorf Astoria brand is made up of the Waldorf Astoria in New York and The Waldorf Astoria Orlando.\nThe modern hotel has three American and classic European restaurants, and a beauty parlor off the main lobby. Several shops surround the lobby, which has won awards for its original period character. An even more luxurious \"hotel within a hotel\" in its upper section is known as The Waldorf Towers operated by Conrad Hotels & Resorts.\nThe hotel has its own railway platform as part of Grand Central Terminal, used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. People could go to the platform by using an elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's car.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Luxury","surface_form":"luxury","offset":38},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":45},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":63},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":74},{"uri":"Landmark","surface_form":"landmark","offset":104},{"uri":"Fifth_Avenue","surface_form":"Fifth Avenue","offset":145},{"uri":"Empire_State_Building","surface_form":"Empire State Building","offset":170},{"uri":"Park_Avenue_(Manhattan)","surface_form":"Park Avenue","offset":221},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":236},{"uri":"Art_Deco","surface_form":"Art Deco","offset":261},{"uri":"Schultze_and_Weaver","surface_form":"Schultze and Weaver","offset":303},{"uri":"Hilton","surface_form":"Hilton","offset":389},{"uri":"Waldorf_Astoria_Hotels_%26amp%3B_Resorts","surface_form":"Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts","offset":431},{"uri":"Beauty_parlor","surface_form":"beauty parlor","offset":690},{"uri":"Lobby","surface_form":"lobby","offset":751},{"uri":"Conrad_Hotels","surface_form":"Conrad Hotels & Resorts","offset":924},{"uri":"Railway_platform","surface_form":"railway platform","offset":971},{"uri":"Grand_Central_Terminal","surface_form":"Grand Central Terminal","offset":999},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
