{"id":190876,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside%2C_California","text":"Riverside is a city in California. It is the county seat of Riverside County. The city, which got its name from being close to the Santa Ana River, is the first place in California in which people sold a lot of citrus fruit. In 2008, about 311,575 people lived in Riverside. The city is the 61st biggest city in the United States and the 12th biggest city in California.\nBecause houses cost less money in Riverside than most cities in Southern California, people have been slowly moving there. This makes traffic bad as people from Riverside drive to work in Orange County and Los Angeles.\nRiverside has a few schools, including La Sierra University, California Baptist College, and the University of California-Riverside. The city also has Riverside Municipal Museum, the California Museum of Photography, and the California Citrus State Historic Park. In 1873, the Parent Washington Navel Orange Tree was planted in Riverside, and it is one of two original orange trees in California. The historic Mission Inn is another popular place.\nRiverside is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":23},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":45},{"uri":"Riverside_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Riverside County","offset":60},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"River","offset":141},{"uri":"Citrus","surface_form":"citrus","offset":211},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":218},{"uri":"List_of_United_States_cities_by_population","surface_form":"61st biggest city","offset":291},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":316},{"uri":"Orange_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Orange County","offset":559},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":577},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"Museum","offset":761},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"Photography","offset":794},{"uri":"Mission","surface_form":"Mission","offset":1000},{"uri":"Inn","surface_form":"Inn","offset":1008},{"uri":"Greater_Los_Angeles_Area","surface_form":"Greater Los Angeles Area","offset":1063}]}
