{"id":190908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_V","text":"The Ares V was a plan to create a cargo rocket for the cancelled Constellation program. Ares V was planned to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for a plan to return to the Moon in 2019. The Ares V was supposed to complement the Ares I, which was being designed as a crew launch vehicle. The Ares designs were selected for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness.\nThe Ares V was planned to be able to carry about to Low Earth orbit (LEO), and to the Moon. Upon completion the Ares V was planned to be the most powerful rocket ever built, lifting more into orbit than even the Saturn V. Ares V, Ares IV, and Ares I are named after Ares, the Greek god, which is the equivalent to the Roman god Mars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["rocket/payload","rocket/stage"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":34},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":40},{"uri":"Constellation_program","surface_form":"Constellation program","offset":65},{"uri":"Earth_Departure_Stage","surface_form":"Earth Departure Stage","offset":121},{"uri":"Altair_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Altair lunar lander","offset":147},{"uri":"Ares_I","surface_form":"Ares I","offset":251},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"Low Earth orbit","offset":467},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":501},{"uri":"Saturn_V","surface_form":"Saturn V","offset":627},{"uri":"Ares_IV","surface_form":"Ares IV","offset":645},{"uri":"Ares","surface_form":"Ares","offset":681},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":743}]}
