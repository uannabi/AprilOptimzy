{"id":191363,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cascades_National_Park","text":"North Cascades National Park is a national park in the U.S. state of Washington. It was established on 2 October 1968. The park covers 634,000 acres of the Cascade Range (specifically the North Cascades).\nThe Park is split in half by the Skagit River, which flows south then southwest through the park. Another primary watercourse of the park is the Baker River which flows into the Skagit and the Stehekin River (which flows into Lake Chelan in the southeast).\nNorth Cascades National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the North Cascades Range. This is the most expansive glacial system in the mainland United States. The Park also has the headwaters of numerous waterways, and vast forests with the highest degree of flora biodiversity of any US national park.\nThe region was first settled by Paleo-Indian Native Americans. By the time white explorers arrived it was inhabited by Skagit tribes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":34},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":55},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":69},{"uri":"Acre","surface_form":"acre","offset":143},{"uri":"Cascade_Range","surface_form":"Cascade Range","offset":156},{"uri":"North_Cascades","surface_form":"North Cascades","offset":188},{"uri":"Skagit_River","surface_form":"Skagit River","offset":238},{"uri":"Baker_River","surface_form":"Baker River","offset":350},{"uri":"Stehekin_River","surface_form":"Stehekin River","offset":398},{"uri":"Lake_Chelan","surface_form":"Lake Chelan","offset":431},{"uri":"Glacial","surface_form":"glacial","offset":582},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":734},{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":817}]}
