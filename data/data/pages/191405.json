{"id":191405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesbourne_Valley_Railway","text":"The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Derbyshire. Its operations are based at Wirksworth station. It is currently planned to extend the railway along the former Midland Railway branch line which joined the main-line at Duffield.\nWhen complete it will be one of the few Heritage Railways that operates a whole branch line in its original form and entire length.\nThe line is operated by diesel locomotives, which haul former multiple unit trailer cars and also uses heritage diesel multiple units.\nOrigin.\nThe \"Wirksworth Branch\" was the product of early nineteenth century railway rivalry. Since 1835 Wirksworth's citizens had been promoting the idea for a branch line from the North Midland Railway (later the Midland Railway) at Duffield. The Midland was initially uninterested, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley. This was difficult, but the branch could avoid the section from Ambergate, on its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, which was shared with its rival the London and North Western Railway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heritage_railway","surface_form":"heritage railway","offset":37},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":57},{"uri":"Wirksworth","surface_form":"Wirksworth","offset":97},{"uri":"Midland_Railway","surface_form":"Midland Railway","offset":180},{"uri":"Duffield_railway_station","surface_form":"Duffield","offset":238},{"uri":"Diesel_multiple_unit","surface_form":"diesel multiple unit","offset":492},{"uri":"North_Midland_Railway","surface_form":"North Midland Railway","offset":696},{"uri":"Midland_Railway","surface_form":"Midland Railway","offset":729},{"uri":"Duffield_railway_station","surface_form":"Duffield","offset":749},{"uri":"Rowsley","surface_form":"Rowsley","offset":854},{"uri":"Ambergate_railway_station","surface_form":"Ambergate","offset":927},{"uri":"Manchester%2C_Buxton%2C_Matlock_and_Midlands_Junction_Railway","surface_form":"Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway","offset":945},{"uri":"London_and_North_Western_Railway","surface_form":"London and North Western Railway","offset":1040}]}
