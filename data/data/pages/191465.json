{"id":191465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration","text":"Collaboration is when people work with each other to complete a task. It involves co-operation and teamwork and the sharing of ideas, knowledge and skills to reach the same objective. The objective is usually creative in nature. Most collaboration needs leadership or some kind of co-ordination, although responsibilities can be shared within an egalitarian group.\nEach person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the process of collaboration. For instance, to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Co-operation","surface_form":"co-operation","offset":82},{"uri":"Teamwork","surface_form":"teamwork","offset":99},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":127},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"knowledge","offset":134},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":148},{"uri":"Objective","surface_form":"objective","offset":173},{"uri":"Creativity","surface_form":"creative","offset":209},{"uri":"Leadership","surface_form":"leadership","offset":254},{"uri":"Coordination","surface_form":"co-ordination","offset":281},{"uri":"Responsibility","surface_form":"responsibilities","offset":305},{"uri":"Egalitarianism","surface_form":"egalitarian","offset":346},{"uri":"Role","surface_form":"role","offset":412},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":474},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":482},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"director","offset":490},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":500},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":513},{"uri":"Costumer","surface_form":"costumer","offset":563},{"uri":"Cameraman","surface_form":"cameraman","offset":575},{"uri":"Audio_engineer","surface_form":"audio engineer","offset":624},{"uri":"Film_editor","surface_form":"film editor","offset":646}]}
