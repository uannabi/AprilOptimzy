{"id":191479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_14","text":"Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the Apollo program. It was the third mission to land on the Moon. The nine-day mission left the Earth on January 31, 1971, and landed on the Moon on February 5. The Lunar Module landed in the Fra Mauro formation; this had been the target of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. During the two walks on the Moon's surface, of moon rock was collected. Several experiments, including seismic studies, were carried out. Commander Alan Shepard famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought from Earth. Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were planted on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees. The pilot of the Lunar Module was Dr. Edgar Mitchell.\nLRO finds the site.\nIn June 2009, the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph the Apollo 14 landing site. The base of the lunar module and the astronauts footprints on the Moon's suface could be clearly seen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/Dock","spaceflight/Dock"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Apollo_program","surface_form":"Apollo program","offset":47},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":103},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":139},{"uri":"Apollo_Lunar_Module","surface_form":"Lunar Module","offset":208},{"uri":"Fra_Mauro_formation","surface_form":"Fra Mauro formation","offset":235},{"uri":"Apollo_13","surface_form":"Apollo 13","offset":298},{"uri":"Seismology","surface_form":"seismic","offset":420},{"uri":"Alan_Shepard","surface_form":"Alan Shepard","offset":465},{"uri":"Golf_ball","surface_form":"golf ball","offset":495},{"uri":"Stuart_Roosa","surface_form":"Stuart Roosa","offset":597},{"uri":"Moon_tree","surface_form":"Moon tree","offset":718},{"uri":"Edgar_Mitchell","surface_form":"Edgar Mitchell","offset":768}]}
