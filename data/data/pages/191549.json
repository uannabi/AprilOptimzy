There were ten teams signed up to compete in the championship. Jenson Button became the Drivers' World Champion and Brawn GP won the Constructors' title.\nThe season is scheduled to take place over 17 rounds, and started with the Australian Grand Prix on 29 March 2009. It will end on 1 November 2009 with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which is included on the race calendar for the first time and will be held at the new Yas Marina Circuit. The French and Canadian Grands Prix, which were both included in the 2008 championship, have been dropped.\nSeveral rule changes will be implemented by the FIA, in a bid to cut costs due to the global financial crisis and to improve the on-track spectacle. New rules governing tyres, aerodynamics and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS), among others, are some of the biggest changes in the Formula One regulations for several decades. FIA initially declared a change in deciding the World Driver's Championship, with the driver winning the most races to be declared as the champion. However, this decision was later reversed following protests from Formula One Teams Association.\nDrivers.\nDrivers did not finish the Grand Prix, but were classified as they completed over 90% of the race distance.\nHalf points were awarded at the Malaysian as less than 75% of the scheduled distance was completed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile","surface_form":"FIA","offset":41},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":45},{"uri":"Championship","surface_form":"Championship","offset":63},{"uri":"Jenson_Button","surface_form":"Jenson Button","offset":147},{"uri":"Brawn_GP","surface_form":"Brawn GP","offset":200},{"uri":"Australian_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Australian Grand Prix","offset":313},{"uri":"Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Abu Dhabi Grand Prix","offset":393},{"uri":"Yas_Marina_Circuit","surface_form":"Yas Marina Circuit","offset":501},{"uri":"French_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"French","offset":525},{"uri":"Canadian_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":536},{"uri":"2008_Formula_One_season","surface_form":"2008 championship","offset":590},{"uri":"Financial_crisis_of_2007-2009","surface_form":"global financial crisis","offset":714},{"uri":"Tyre","surface_form":"tyre","offset":797},{"uri":"Aerodynamics","surface_form":"aerodynamics","offset":804},{"uri":"Kinetic_Energy_Recovery_Systems","surface_form":"Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems","offset":821},{"uri":"Formula_One_Teams_Association","surface_form":"Formula One Teams Association","offset":1173},{"uri":"Malaysian_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Malaysian","offset":1353}]}
