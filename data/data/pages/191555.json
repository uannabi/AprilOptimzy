They are part of the Southern Carpathians group of the Carpathian Mountains of Europe.\nTo the east, the Bucegi Mountains have a very steep slope. This is towards the popular tourist destination Prahova Valley. At a higher elevation is the Bucegi Plateau, where wind and rain have turned the rocks into brilliant figures such as the Sphinx and \"Babele\".\nThe Bucegi is thought to be the Dacian holy mountain \"Kogainon\". Here, the mythical figure Zalmoxis resided in a cave.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":39},{"uri":"Bra%C5%9Fov","surface_form":"Bra\u015Fov","offset":72},{"uri":"Southern_Carpathians","surface_form":"Southern Carpathians","offset":101},{"uri":"Carpathian_Mountains","surface_form":"Carpathian Mountains","offset":135},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":159},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":254},{"uri":"Prahova_Valley","surface_form":"Prahova Valley","offset":274},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":371},{"uri":"Sphinx_(Romania)","surface_form":"Sphinx","offset":412},{"uri":"Babele","surface_form":"Babele","offset":424},{"uri":"Dacia","surface_form":"Dacia","offset":465},{"uri":"Zalmoxis","surface_form":"Zalmoxis","offset":524}]}
