{"id":19156,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquitaine","text":"Aquitaine (Occitan: \"Aquit\u00E0nia\";;) is a part of southwestern France. It was once an administrative region but is now part of the administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. With over 41,000 square kilometers, it is one of the largest regions of mainland France (the largest of all French regions is French Guiana, in South America).\nIts capital was Bordeaux, the largest city. The French name of the people living in the region is \"Aquitain\".\nThe five departments in the region were Dordogne, Gironde, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, and Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Atlantiques.\nGeography.\nThe Aquitaine region was the third largest region of Metropolitan France, after Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es and Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes. Its area was. It bordered with three French regions: Poitou-Charentes to the north, Limousin to the northeast and Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es to the east. To the south is Spain (Aragon and Navarre) and to the west the Atlantic Ocean. The coast along the Atlantic Ocean, part of the Bay of Biscay, is called the C\u00F4te d'Argent (\"Silver Coast\").\nThe Greenwich Meridian passes through Aquitaine.\nMost of Aquitaine is in the Aquitanian basin, a relatively flat and geologically young landscape. High mountains are found only in the south of Aquitaine, in the Pyrenees mountain range. The Pic Palas (), at, is the highest point of Aquitaine; it is on the border with Spain.\nThe main rivers of the region are the Garonne, that flows through the Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne departments; the Dordogne, that flows through the Dordogne and Gironde departments; the Lot, that flows through the Lot-et-Garonne department; the Dropt, that flows through the Dordogne, Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne departments; and the Adour, that flows through the Landes department.\nThe climate is mild - except in the high mountains - all year round. On the Atlantic coast, the annual average temperature is above 15\u00A0\u00B0C, in Bordeaux is about 14\u00A0\u00B0C and on the border of Limousin is still 11\u00A0\u00B0C. Rainfall is relatively high and is higher in the south of the region.\nHistory.\nIn the Middle Ages Aquitaine was at times a kingdom and a duchy. Various wars made it larger and smaller. Aquitane came into the control of England when Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry II of England in 1152. It remained in English control until 1453 at the end of the Hundred Years' War.\nDemographics.\nThe Aquitaine region had a population, in 2012, of 3,285,970, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Occitan_language","surface_form":"Occitan","offset":11},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":61},{"uri":"Nouvelle-Aquitaine","surface_form":"Nouvelle-Aquitaine","offset":154},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":282},{"uri":"French_Guiana","surface_form":"French Guiana","offset":300},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":318},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":338},{"uri":"Bordeaux","surface_form":"Bordeaux","offset":350},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":382},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":453},{"uri":"Dordogne","surface_form":"Dordogne","offset":484},{"uri":"Gironde","surface_form":"Gironde","offset":494},{"uri":"Landes","surface_form":"Landes","offset":503},{"uri":"Lot-et-Garonne","surface_form":"Lot-et-Garonne","offset":511},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Atlantiques","offset":531},{"uri":"Metropolitan_France","surface_form":"Metropolitan France","offset":617},{"uri":"Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":644},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes","surface_form":"Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes","offset":662},{"uri":"Poitou-Charentes","surface_form":"Poitou-Charentes","offset":728},{"uri":"Limousin","surface_form":"Limousin","offset":759},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":832},{"uri":"Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":839},{"uri":"Navarre","surface_form":"Navarre","offset":850},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":879},{"uri":"Bay_of_Biscay","surface_form":"Bay of Biscay","offset":943},{"uri":"Prime_Meridian","surface_form":"Greenwich Meridian","offset":1008},{"uri":"Aquitanian_basin","surface_form":"Aquitanian basin","offset":1081},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geologically","offset":1121},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":1140},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":1215},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":1224},{"uri":"Pic_Palas","surface_form":"Pic Palas","offset":1244},{"uri":"Garonne_river","surface_form":"Garonne","offset":1367},{"uri":"Gironde","surface_form":"Gironde","offset":1399},{"uri":"Lot-et-Garonne","surface_form":"Lot-et-Garonne","offset":1411},{"uri":"Dordogne_(river)","surface_form":"Dordogne","offset":1443},{"uri":"Dordogne","surface_form":"Dordogne","offset":1476},{"uri":"Gironde","surface_form":"Gironde","offset":1489},{"uri":"Lot_(river)","surface_form":"Lot","offset":1514},{"uri":"Lot-et-Garonne","surface_form":"Lot-et-Garonne","offset":1542},{"uri":"Dropt","surface_form":"Dropt","offset":1573},{"uri":"Dordogne","surface_form":"Dordogne","offset":1603},{"uri":"Gironde","surface_form":"Gironde","offset":1613},{"uri":"Lot-et-Garonne","surface_form":"Lot-et-Garonne","offset":1625},{"uri":"Adour","surface_form":"Adour","offset":1661},{"uri":"Landes","surface_form":"Landes","offset":1691},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":2008},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":2045},{"uri":"Duchy","surface_form":"duchy","offset":2059},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":2141},{"uri":"Eleanor_of_Aquitaine","surface_form":"Eleanor of Aquitaine","offset":2154},{"uri":"Henry_II_of_England","surface_form":"Henry II of England","offset":2183},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":2272}]}
