{"id":19171,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta","text":"Ceuta is a Spanish city in North Africa, at the Strait of Gibraltar. The City area is about 20 square kilometers, and there are over 82,000 people living in the city. The city is surrounded by a border fence, which has been built to keep the Moroccans (and other Africans) from moving there unlawfully. Ceuta is part of Spain (and therefore the European Union). Until it became a self-governing city in 1994, it belonged to the Cadiz Province.\nIt was built by the Phoenicians at a strategic position.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":19},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":33},{"uri":"Gibraltar","surface_form":"Strait of Gibraltar","offset":48},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Moroccans","offset":242},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":320},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":345},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":403},{"uri":"Cadiz_Province","surface_form":"Cadiz Province","offset":428}]}
