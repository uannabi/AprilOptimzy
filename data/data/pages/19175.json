The country was once ruled by France, but it has been independent since 1960. The capital is Ouagadougou.\nIn 2005, about 13,228,000 people lived in the country. It is next to Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana and C\u00F4te d'Ivoire. It does not have any coast with an ocean or sea. People from Burkina Faso are called Burkinab\u00E9 (pronounced burr-KEE-na-bay).\nHistory.\nPeople have lived in the area of Burkina Faso for thousands of years. At first, they were hunter-gatherers, hunting animals and collecting fruits and vegetables. Later they became farmers. People called the Mossi arrived between the 11th and 13th centuries. They ruled the area until the end of the 19th century. In 1896 France beat the Mossi kingdom and became the colonial rulers of Burkina Faso. After World War I, the country was called Upper Volta.\nIn 1960, Upper Volta became independent from France. The first president of the new country was Maurice Yam\u00E9ogo. After he became the president, Yam\u00E9ogo banned other political parties. For several years the people of Upper Volta were very unhappy with the government and in 1966 the military took over in a military coup. In 1983 the government was taken over again by military men called Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaor\u00E9. Sankara became president. In 1984, he changed the name of the country to Burkina Faso. It means \"land of honest people\".\nIn December 1985, Burkina Faso went to war for five days with near-by country Mali. In 1987, there was another military coup and Sankara was assassinated (murdered). Blaise Compaor\u00E9 became the president.\nOn 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou. Compaor\u00E9 was ready to change the constitution and extend<nowiki/>his 27-year rule. On 30 October 2014, some protesters set fire to the parliament. They also took over the national television headquarters. On 31 October 2014, President Compaor\u00E9, resigned after 27 years in office.\nIn 2015 the country held their first election. Roch Marc Christian Kabore, a former Prime Minister, was elected as President.\nCities.\nBelow is a list of the largest cities in Burkina Faso.
