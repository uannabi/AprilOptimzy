{"id":19176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo","text":"The Battle of Waterloo was a battle that was fought between the French army and the British and Prussian armies.\nNapoleon was crowned as Emperor of France in 1804, and then launched the successful Napoleonic Wars. France soon had an empire that stretched from Spain to the Russian border. Defeated at the Battle of Leipzig and elsewhere, he accepted exile on the island of Elba in 1814. In February 1815 he again took control of the French Army. He attacked his enemies in Belgium and was defeated at Waterloo. It was the last battle of the Napoleonic Wars.\nHistory.\nNapoleon seemed unstoppable until two separate campaigns failed. He gathered a huge army to invade and conquer Russia in 1812. His army was caught by the Russian winter and destroyed by the weather and lack of food. The countries of Eastern Europe, led by Austria and Prussia, began to ally against him, forcing his troops back towards France. Meanwhile, a small army in Portugal and Spain, led by Arthur Wellesley (later to become Duke of Wellington) began to push Napoleon\u2019s troops out of Spain.\nBy 1814, Napoleon faced total defeat, with invasions from all sides. A peace treaty was arranged. Napoleon would abdicate (give up the throne) and live on a small Mediterranean island called Elba, with a small army. He was replaced as ruler of France by Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI.\nThe 100 Days.\nOn the island of Elba, Napoleon was not content. He had been promised money by the new French government, but the money did not come. His wife (an Austrian princess) and his sons were forbidden to visit him.\nMessages from France showed that his enemies were quarreling. He seized his opportunity, going by ship in February 1815 and landing in France again. His welcome was very mixed. Many French were tired of war and the death and suffering that it made. However, others wanted a return to the power and glory of the old days and saw Napoleon as their best hope.\nHis first days were tense but, by personal leadership and persuasion, Napoleon managed to gain the support of the army. When the king panicked and fled the country, there was little to stop Napoleon returning to Paris and resuming his title of Emperor.\nThe Waterloo Campaign.\nWhat Napoleon needed now was a period of time to organize himself and the French army. The allies were caught completely by surprise and their only chance to stop him lay with two small armies in Belgium: a British and Dutch army commanded by the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian (German) army commanded by Marshall Bl\u00FCcher.\nNapoleon decided on a further gamble. He gathered an army and prepared a surprise attack on Wellington and Blucher, hoping to catch them unprepared. His plan was successful at first and he crossed the Belgian border before Wellington and Blucher could join forces.\nLigny and Quatre Bras.\nHis first battle was at Ligny and, after a fierce day\u2019s fighting, he defeated the Prussian army, forcing it to retreat. Thinking that Blucher would retreat back to Prussia, Napoleon turned his attention towards Wellington. There had already been a small battle at Quatre Bras, as Wellington tried to delay the French advance. This had given Wellington enough time to prepare a full defensive position across the road leading to Brussels, near the village of Waterloo.\nThe French army advanced towards them and set up their camp on a ridge facing the combined British and Dutch (Anglo-Dutch) army. Heavy rain caused delays and confusion and both armies settled down for the night in the mud to await the dawn and the forthcoming battle.\nNapoleon\u2019s army faced the Duke of Wellington\u2019s Anglo-Dutch army near Waterloo on 18th June 1815. Wellington\u2019s troops were deployed behind a low ridge, partially protecting them from the French massed artillery.\nPhase 1 \u2013 The Attack on Hougoumont.\nAt around 11.00 Napoleon ordered his guns to open fire. French infantry began an attack against the Ch\u00E2teau of Hougoumont, defended by the British Foot Guards. This was intended to draw Wellington\u2019s reserves away from the centre, where Napoleon\u2019s main attack would fall.\nAccording to records Hougomont was considered to be a vital key to winning the Battle Of Waterloo.\nPhase 2 \u2013 The French Infantry Attacks.\nAt 13:30 Napoleon launched an infantry attack against Wellington\u2019s centre. Men of the King\u2019s German Legion resolutely defended the farm of La Haye Sainte. This disrupted the French attack. British artillery and musketry succeeded in checking the French assault and the British Household and Union heavy cavalry brigades charged after the wavering Frenchmen. Elated by their success, the British cavalry pursued their enemy too far and in turn suffered terrible casualties at the hands of the French lancers and light cavalry.\nPhase 3 \u2013 The French Cavalry Attacks.\nAt 15.00 the Anglo-Dutch army appeared to be retreating after the heavy bombardment they had received all day, so Napoleon's general Marshal Ney led a massed French cavalry attack against Wellington\u2019s centre. However, the British infantry had only been moving back to regroup and tend the wounded, and they were able to form squares to defend themselves from cavalry attack. The French took terrible casualties as they circled these impregnable formations of infantrymen.\nThe situation further deteriorated for Napoleon as Blucher's Prussian troops launched an attack at Plancenoit to his rear at 16.30.\nPhase 4 \u2013 The Prussians begin to increase pressure.\nBy early evening the French attack at Hougoumont, intended as a diversion, was now having the opposite effect. The French committed more and more troops to the bitter fighting around the ch\u00E2teau, which was held by only a small force of British Guardsmen. More French reserves were being sent to meet the Prussian threat to the rear of Napoleon\u2019s army at Plancenoit. However, the French had at last succeeded in capturing the farm of La Haye Sainte, only a short distance from Wellington\u2019s centre.\nPhase 5 \u2013 The Attack by the Imperial Guard.\nAt approximately 19.30 Napoleon committed his last reserves in a final effort to obtain victory. As Prussians arrived to bolster Wellington\u2019s flank, veterans of the French Imperial Guard advanced to 'finish the job'. The British infantry, exhausted from the continuous cannonade they had received all day, rose to meet them. The musketry of the British Guards Brigade defeated Napoleon\u2019s finest troops. They fled, and the whole French army joined them in retreat. Wellington ordered his entire line to advance and the French were driven from the field.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":29},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":64},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":84},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":96},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":113},{"uri":"First_French_Empire","surface_form":"Emperor of France","offset":137},{"uri":"Napoleonic_Wars","surface_form":"Napoleonic Wars","offset":197},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":260},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian","offset":273},{"uri":"Battle_of_Leipzig","surface_form":"Battle of Leipzig","offset":305},{"uri":"Elba","surface_form":"Elba","offset":373},{"uri":"Napoleonic_Wars","surface_form":"Napoleonic Wars","offset":541},{"uri":"Invade","surface_form":"invade","offset":659},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":729},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":757},{"uri":"Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington","surface_form":"Duke of Wellington","offset":999},{"uri":"Elba","surface_form":"Elba","offset":1256},{"uri":"Elba","surface_form":"Elba","offset":1385},{"uri":"Prussian","surface_form":"Prussian","offset":2481},{"uri":"Marshall_Bl%C3%BCcher","surface_form":"Marshall Bl\u00FCcher","offset":2517},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":2987},{"uri":"Quatre_Bras","surface_form":"Quatre Bras","offset":3087},{"uri":"Cavalry","surface_form":"cavalry","offset":4610},{"uri":"Infantrymen","surface_form":"infantrymen","offset":5238},{"uri":"Plancenoit","surface_form":"Plancenoit","offset":5789},{"uri":"French_Imperial_Guard","surface_form":"French Imperial Guard","offset":6141},{"uri":"Infantry","surface_form":"infantry","offset":6205},{"uri":"Musketry","surface_form":"musketry","offset":6305}]}
