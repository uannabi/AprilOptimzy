Portuguese is the official language.\nHistory.\nThe Portuguese arrived in S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 Island on December 21, 1471, and Pr\u00EDncipe Island on January 17, 1492. As these were days dedicated to saints, both islands had saints\u2019 names. S. Ant\u00E3o Island, the former name of Pr\u00EDncipe Island, changed in 1500 to honor the Prince of Portugal.\nThe official historical version says that the country was uninhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese sailors.\nThe first successful Portuguese settlement in the archipelago was in 1493. The volcanic soil of the islands proved to be good for sugar crops. Hard work was needed to grow and harvest the sugar crops. Slaves were brought from Portugal to do the work. Because other countries began producing more sugar, the islands were not able to make money from it. Instead it became a stopping place for the slave trade.\nIn the 19th century, crops of coffee and cocoa were grown. These became successful. By 1908 the country was the largest producer of cocoa. It is the most important crop for the country.\nOn February 3, 1953, the Batep\u00E1 massacre occurred. In the massacre hundreds of local people were killed by Portuguese settlers. The Portuguese wanted workers for the crops. The locals said they were being used as slaves. The governor told the military to take any locals who did not want to work.\nIn the late 1950s a group wanted independence. They were called the MLSTP (Movement for the Liberation of S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe). In 1974 they succeeded in removing Marcelo Caetano as their leader. On 12 July 1975 S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe became an independent country. The first president was Manuel Pinto da Costa. He was the MLSTP`s General Secretary.\nUntil 1990 the MLSTP was the only political party. They changed the constitution to allow other political parties. The new Party of Democratic Convergence (PCD) won the most seats in the National Assembly. Miguel Trovoada was elected president.\nPolitics.\nThe president is elected for a five-year term and can be re-elected. The prime minister is elected for a four-year term. The thirteen members of the cabinet (the group of ministers) are chosen by them. All adult citizens can vote in the elections. They vote by secret ballot.\nProvinces.\nS\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe is divided into 2 provinces: Pr\u00EDncipe and S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9.\nThe provinces are further divided into seven districts, six on S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and one on Pr\u00EDncipe (with Pr\u00EDncipe having self-government since April 29, 1995).\nGeography and Climate.\nS\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe is formed by two volcanic islands - the biggest of which is S. Tom\u00E9 - and several islets. It is in the Gulf of Guinea, off the western equatorial coast of Africa. Both islands belong to the Cameroon volcanic mountain line.\nThe archipelago is 1,001km2 in size. The equator line passes through the Rolas\u2019s Islet which is in the south of S. Tom\u00E9 Island. The tallest peak is the Peak of S. Tom\u00E9 at 2,024m tall.\nThe climate is tropical, hot and humid, with an annual average temperature of 27 C. There are two main seasons. Gravana is the driest season. It has little or no rainfall and the temperatures are lower. Gravana lasts from June to August. The rainy season is from October to May.\nEconomy.\nSince the archipelago\u00B4s discovery, its economy has been based on agriculture and fishing. Cocoa is 95% of the country\u2019s exports. Other exports are copper, palm oil and coffee. Another economic activity is tourism.\nAfter independence, the country\u2019s economy was nationalized, it was then privatised in the early 1990s. Now the government budget is mainly based on foreign assistance from donors such as the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, and country donors.\nThe main importers of the archipelago's production are Portugal with 51%, France with 14%, Angola with 11%, and Japan with 10%.\nIn 2001, petroleum was found in the waters claimed by the archipelago and Nigeria.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2010 census, about 163,000 people lived in S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe. 52,000 lived in the capital and less than seven thousand lived on Pr\u00EDncipe Island.\nS\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 is the country\u2019s capital and main city.\nThe people of S. Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe are divided into the following ethnic groups: mixed-blood, descendents of Portuguese settlers and African slaves; Forros, the biggest ethnic group and descendents of freed slaves; Angolares, descendents of Angolan slaves; Tonga, mixed blood of Forros and hired workers from Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde; and Cape Verdean descendents.\nThe country\u2019s official language is Portuguese. Other languages spoken are Forro, a creole spoken by 80% of S. Tom\u00E9 Island`s people; Angolar, spoken mainly on the southeast of S. Tom\u00E9 Island; Lung`i\u00E9, spoken in Pr\u00EDncipe Island; and Creole from Cape Verde.\nAlmost everyone is Christian: Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant and Seventh-Day Adventist.\nCulture.\nThe country\u2019s culture is the product of Portuguese and African cultural influence. Typical dances on the islands are \u00DAssua, Socop\u00E9, D\u00EAxa, and Puita. Tchiloli, Dan\u00E7o Congo and Auto dos Floripes are public theatrical performances, examples of the Portuguese cultural legacy.\nAlda Neves da Gra\u00E7a do Esp\u00EDrito Santo was a famous poet from S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9.\nEducation.\nChildren are required to attend school for four years. The National Lyceum (S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe) and the University of S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe are the two colleges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gabon","surface_form":"Gabon","offset":243},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":302},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":331},{"uri":"Prince_of_Portugal","surface_form":"Prince of Portugal","offset":636},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":822},{"uri":"Slave_trade","surface_form":"slave trade","offset":1167},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":1210},{"uri":"Cocoa","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":1221},{"uri":"Batep%C3%A1_massacre","surface_form":"Batep\u00E1 massacre","offset":1391},{"uri":"Movement_for_the_Liberation_of_S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe/Social_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Movement for the Liberation of S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":1738},{"uri":"Marcelo_Caetano","surface_form":"Marcelo Caetano","offset":1828},{"uri":"Manuel_Pinto_da_Costa","surface_form":"Manuel Pinto da Costa","offset":1954},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":2049},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":2083},{"uri":"Democratic_Convergence_Party_%E2%80%93_Reflection_Group","surface_form":"Party of Democratic Convergence","offset":2138},{"uri":"National_Assembly_(S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe)","surface_form":"National Assembly","offset":2202},{"uri":"Miguel_Trovoada","surface_form":"Miguel Trovoada","offset":2221},{"uri":"Secret_ballot","surface_form":"secret ballot","offset":2531},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":2597},{"uri":"Pr%C3%ADncipe","surface_form":"Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":2608},{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_Island","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9","offset":2621},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":2676},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Guinea","surface_form":"Gulf of Guinea","offset":2932},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":3644},{"uri":"Import","surface_form":"import","offset":4000},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":4193},{"uri":"Creole","surface_form":"creole","offset":4888},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":5090},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":5118},{"uri":"Seventh-Day_Adventist","surface_form":"Seventh-Day Adventist","offset":5133},{"uri":"Alda_Neves_da_Gra%C3%A7a_do_Esp%C3%ADrito_Santo","surface_form":"Alda Neves da Gra\u00E7a do Esp\u00EDrito Santo","offset":5438},{"uri":"National_Lyceum_(S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe)","surface_form":"National Lyceum (S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe)","offset":5579},{"uri":"University_of_S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe","surface_form":"University of S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":5627}]}
