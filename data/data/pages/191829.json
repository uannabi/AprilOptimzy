Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto Plata in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.\nThe city was called first \"Puerto de Plata\" but later it was changed to just \"Puerto Plata\", the name that is still used\nHistory.\nColumbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.\nBecause there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Felipe II, the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe (in English, \"Saint Phillip Fort\").\nIn 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands.\nPopulation.\nThe municipality had, in, a total population of 128,240: 63,564 men and 64,676 women. The urban population was of the total population.\nGeography.\nSan Felipe de Puerto Plata has a total area of (without including its municipal districts), about of the total area of the province of Puerto Plata. The city is at an elevation of, and at to the north of Santo Domingo.\nThe \"Cordillera Septentrional\" (\"Northern mountain range\") runs along the southern half of the municipality. There are only two roads that go through this mountain range. It rains a lot in these mountains.\nThe mountain \"Loma Isabel de Torres\" (the \"Monte de Plata\" of Columbus) is at about to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata. It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional. On top of the mountain, there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there; it rains almost every day. That forest is now a national park. It is high and there are two ways for getting to the top: by road or by a cable car (a type of car that runs on cables above the car).\nThere are many rivers in the municipality but, because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, they are all very short. The two most important rivers are Cam\u00FA del Norte and Y\u00E1sica. Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Mu\u00F1oz.\nThere are some bays along the coast. Two of them are the \"Puerto Plata Bay\" and \"Maim\u00F3n Bay\".\nClimate.\nPuerto Plata has a tropical wet climate (K\u00F6ppen-Geiger classification: Af) with no dry or cold season as it is constantly moist (rainfalls during the whole year).\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is. The month with the most precipitation on average is December with of rainfall, followed by November with.\nThe driest season is summer. The month with the least rainfall on average is July with an average of and the second is June with.\nPuerto Plata is in a warm region; the average temperature for the year is.
