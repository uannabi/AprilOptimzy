{"id":191830,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cascades","text":"The North Cascades are a name used for the mountains at the north end of the Cascade Range, south of Canada. The North Cascades are entirely in the United States, in the state of Washington. At the Canadian border, the North Cascades are called the Canadian Cascades. The highest point in the North Cascades is Mount Baker (10,781\u00A0ft/3,286m). North Cascades National Park is located at the northernmost end of the North Cascades.\nSome of the primary rivers in the North Cascades are the Skagit, Nooksack, Stillaguamish, and Stehekin. Lake Chelan is the largest lake in the North Cascades. Although now termed a reservoir, it was originally a natural lake, but enlarged by a dam. The urban areas of Seattle, Tacoma and Everett are all west of the North Cascades. The Columbia River, Washington's largest river, forms the east and south boundary.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cascade_Range","surface_form":"Cascade Range","offset":77},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":101},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":148},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":179},{"uri":"Mount_Baker","surface_form":"Mount Baker","offset":311},{"uri":"North_Cascades_National_Park","surface_form":"North Cascades National Park","offset":343},{"uri":"Skagit_River","surface_form":"Skagit","offset":487},{"uri":"Nooksack_River","surface_form":"Nooksack","offset":495},{"uri":"Stillaguamish_River","surface_form":"Stillaguamish","offset":505},{"uri":"Stehekin_River","surface_form":"Stehekin","offset":524},{"uri":"Lake_Chelan","surface_form":"Lake Chelan","offset":534},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":611},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":674},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":698},{"uri":"Tacoma%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Tacoma","offset":707},{"uri":"Everett%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Everett","offset":718},{"uri":"Columbia_River","surface_form":"Columbia River","offset":766}]}
