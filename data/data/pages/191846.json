{"id":191846,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinius","text":"\"Darwinius\" is a genus of primates known from only one fossil. It was discovered in 1983 by an amateur at the Messel Pit. This is a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, near the village of Messel, about 35 km (22 miles) southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany.\nThe fosssil dates from the Eocene epoch, 47 million years ago. The genus \"Darwinius\" was named to celebrate Charles Darwin on his bicentenary and the species name \"masillae\" honors Messel, where the specimen was found. The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern lemur. It is the only known specimen of its species.\nThe fossil, nicknamed 'Ida', was divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the excavation. The two parts were sold separately, was not reassembled until 2007.\nDescription.\nThe specimen was privately collected and sold in two parts. Only the lesser part was known earlier. The second part shows that the skeleton is the complete primate fossil known. It includes the skeleton, soft body outline and contents of the digestive tract.\nSkull radiography shows teeth developing within the juvenile face. The individual was a weaned and independent-feeding female that died in her first year of life. She was \"an agile, nail-bearing, generalized arboreal quadruped living above the floor of the Messel rain forest\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":17},{"uri":"Primates","surface_form":"primates","offset":26},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":55},{"uri":"Messel_Pit","surface_form":"Messel Pit","offset":110},{"uri":"Shale","surface_form":"shale","offset":140},{"uri":"Quarry","surface_form":"quarry","offset":146},{"uri":"Frankfurt_am_Main","surface_form":"Frankfurt am Main","offset":264},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":321},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":402},{"uri":"Lemur","surface_form":"lemur","offset":569},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":613},{"uri":"Digestive_tract","surface_form":"digestive tract","offset":1044},{"uri":"Radiography","surface_form":"radiography","offset":1067},{"uri":"Nail_(anatomy)","surface_form":"nail","offset":1243},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":1269},{"uri":"Quadruped","surface_form":"quadruped","offset":1278},{"uri":"Rain_forest","surface_form":"rain forest","offset":1325}]}
