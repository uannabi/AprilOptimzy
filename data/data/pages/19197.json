{"id":19197,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Hart Trophy is given to the most valuable player of the National Hockey League every year. It was given to the NHL by Dr. David Hart, father of NHL coach and manager Cecil Hart. It was first awarded in 1924.\nWayne Gretzky has won the most Hart Trophies with nine, followed by Gordie Howe with six and Eddie Shore with four. Howie Morenz, Bobby Orr, Bobby Clarke, and Mario Lemieux have won the award three times each.\nThe closest vote for the trophy was in 2002, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied; Theodore won because he had more first-place votes. In 1999, Chris Pronger won by one point over Jaromir Jagr; and in 1990, Mark Messier won by two points over Ray Bourque.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Most_valuable_player","surface_form":"most valuable player","offset":46},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":74},{"uri":"Coach_(sport)","surface_form":"coach","offset":166},{"uri":"Wayne_Gretzky","surface_form":"Wayne Gretzky","offset":226},{"uri":"Gordie_Howe","surface_form":"Gordie Howe","offset":294},{"uri":"Bobby_Orr","surface_form":"Bobby Orr","offset":356},{"uri":"Mario_Lemieux","surface_form":"Mario Lemieux","offset":385}]}
