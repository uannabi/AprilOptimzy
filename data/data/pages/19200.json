{"id":19200,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt","text":"Frankfurt am Main, commonly referred to as \"Frankfurt\", is one of the biggest cities in Germany. The city of Frankfurt has a population of 700,000. The metropolitan area, called Rhine-Main after its two biggest rivers, has over four million people. Frankfurt is an important centre for traffic and for the financial business. The Frankfurt International Airport is the largest in Germany, and one of the largest in the world. Frankfurt's train station is one of the largest, and its highway crossing is the centre of Germany's street network. Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank, the German Federal Bank (Bundesbank) and of the biggest German banks, and it has an important stock exchange where shares of German companies are traded.\nFrankfurt is on the Main river. The city's name means \"ford of the Franks\" - a ford is a place in a river where it is so shallow that you can walk through it, and the Franks were a Germanic people which existed in the first millennium. So, this was a place where travellers could cross the river without a boat. The frankish kings built a palace and a church here. Over the centuries, this group of buildings grew to be a big city which was famous for international trade and fairs, like today. Frankfurt was one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire, and its emperors were crowned here. In the 19th century, Frankfurt was the capital of the German Confederation which was founded after the Holy Roman Empire fell apart. During the revolution of 1848, the first freely elected German parliament worked in Frankfurt.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, many factories and railway lines were built in Frankfurt and its suburbs. In the city centre, a lot of big buildings were built, like an opera house, theatres, stock exchange, railway stations, department stores or museums. Tram lines were constructed to make travelling inside the growing city easier. In World War II, the old city was totally destroyed by airplane bomber attacks. After the war, Germany was divided into two parts, and Frankfurt became the economic capital of West Germany while Bonn was chosen to be the political capital.\nFrankfurt is a very international city. Every third inhabitant is not German. Most immigrants come from southeastern Europe, Turkey and North Africa, but there are people from almost every country living in Frankfurt. There are also many international business companies here, and the big airport links Frankfurt with many countries in the world. Many banks are based in Frankfurt, which is why so many are offered there. Frankfurt has some of the tallest buildings in Europe, which is why the city is although called \"Mainhattan\".\nThe largest shopping street in Frankfurt is called the Zeil.\n\"Frankfurter\" is also a name for a hot dog, or sausage, because they are said to have originated in the city.\nFrankfurt has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification).\nWikimania.\nThe first Wikimania conference was hosted in this city in 2005.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["German location"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":88},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":125},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":152},{"uri":"Rhine-Main","surface_form":"Rhine-Main","offset":178},{"uri":"Frankfurt_International_Airport","surface_form":"Frankfurt International Airport","offset":330},{"uri":"European_Central_Bank","surface_form":"European Central Bank","offset":572},{"uri":"Stock_exchange","surface_form":"stock exchange","offset":689},{"uri":"Share_(finance)","surface_form":"shares","offset":710},{"uri":"Main","surface_form":"Main","offset":769},{"uri":"Ford","surface_form":"ford","offset":828},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Franks","offset":916},{"uri":"Germanic_people","surface_form":"Germanic people","offset":930},{"uri":"Millennium","surface_form":"millennium","offset":973},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1074},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":1088},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":1101},{"uri":"Century","surface_form":"centuries","offset":1123},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":1215},{"uri":"Fair","surface_form":"fair","offset":1225},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":1298},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":1325},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1360},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":1392},{"uri":"German_Confederation","surface_form":"German Confederation","offset":1407},{"uri":"European_Revolutions_of_1848","surface_form":"revolution of 1848","offset":1497},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":1534},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":1549},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"Industrial Revolution","offset":1592},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factories","offset":1620},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":1634},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":1680},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":1752},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":1765},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":1791},{"uri":"Department_store","surface_form":"department store","offset":1809},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":1830},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"Tram","offset":1839},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1921},{"uri":"West_Germany","surface_form":"West Germany","offset":2094},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":2113},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2275},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":2283},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":2294},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"bank","offset":2510},{"uri":"Hot_dog","surface_form":"hot dog","offset":2786},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":2798},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":2878},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":2908},{"uri":"Wikimania","surface_form":"Wikimania","offset":2961}]}
