Buxton is described as \"the gateway to the Peak District National Park\". Buxton is also close to Manchester.\n\"Poole's Cavern\", a limestone cavern, and St Ann's Well are in Buxton. Also in the town is an Opera House.\nHistory.\nThe Romans developed the town when it was called Aquae Arnemetiae (or the spa of the goddess of the grove). Roman coins have been found in Buxton. The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire, with a second revival a hundred years later as the people visited to use the healing properties of the waters.\nThe Dukes of Devonshire have been helping Buxton since 1780, when the Duke used his money from his copper mines to develop the town as a spa like Bath.\nBess of Hardwick had taken one of her four husbands, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to \"take the waters\" at Buxton shortly after he became the jailer of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1569.\nDr. Erasmus Darwin recommended the waters at Buxton to Josiah Wedgwood. The Wedgwood family often went to Buxton on holiday. Two of Charles Darwin's half-cousins, Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin also settled there.\nEconomy.\nBuxton is twinned with two other towns\u2014Oignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spa","surface_form":"spa","offset":12},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":24},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":36},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":78},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":105},{"uri":"Staffordshire","surface_form":"Staffordshire","offset":118},{"uri":"Peak_District","surface_form":"Peak District","offset":176},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":230},{"uri":"Develop","surface_form":"developed","offset":369},{"uri":"Dukes_of_Devonshire","surface_form":"Dukes of Devonshire","offset":595},{"uri":"Revival","surface_form":"revival","offset":630},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":826},{"uri":"Bath%2C_Somerset","surface_form":"Bath","offset":873},{"uri":"Bess_of_Hardwick","surface_form":"Bess of Hardwick","offset":879},{"uri":"Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots","surface_form":"Mary, Queen of Scots","offset":1025},{"uri":"Erasmus_Darwin","surface_form":"Erasmus Darwin","offset":1060},{"uri":"Josiah_Wedgwood","surface_form":"Josiah Wedgwood","offset":1111},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":1188},{"uri":"Town_twinning","surface_form":"twinned","offset":1299},{"uri":"Oignies","surface_form":"Oignies","offset":1328},{"uri":"Bad_Nauheim","surface_form":"Bad Nauheim","offset":1350}]}
