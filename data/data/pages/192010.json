Their recorded play goes back as far as the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) in 1889, although the Quebec Hockey Club is known to have played in tournaments prior to that date. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908, and eventually playing in the National Hockey League. The \"Bulldog\" name was given by the media and was so popular with the fans a Bulldog mascot was created but was never officially changed until the team moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 1920 and became the Tigers.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\"\nNote: 1 = first half of season, 2 = second half of season","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":46},{"uri":"Amateur_Hockey_Association_of_Canada","surface_form":"Amateur Hockey Association of Canada","offset":185},{"uri":"Hamilton%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Hamilton, Ontario","offset":649},{"uri":"1920%E2%80%9321_NHL_season","surface_form":"1920","offset":670},{"uri":"Hamilton_Tigers","surface_form":"Tigers","offset":690}]}
