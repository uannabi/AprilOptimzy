His grandfather was King Robert I. His grandmother was Beatrice of Vermandois. She was a Carolingian; a daughter of Herbert I of Vermandois. By this connection he was the fifth great-grandson of Charlemagne through Pepin of Italy.\nWhile still a young man Hugh got the nickname \"capet\" from the cape he wore. These were tokens of the lay abbacies he held.\nElected king of the Franks.\nWhen King Louis V died with no heir Adalbero of Reims made a plea for electing Hugh Capet.
