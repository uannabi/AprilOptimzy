According to the few words that can be understood, the text is probably a ritual calendar.\nThe fabric of the book was preserved when it was used to wrap a mummy from Ptolemaic Egypt. The mummy and the manuscript are now kept in a refrigerated room at the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, Croatia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":56},{"uri":"Agram","surface_form":"Agram","offset":98},{"uri":"Etruscan_language","surface_form":"Etruscan","offset":121},{"uri":"Linen","surface_form":"linen","offset":157},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":337},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":344},{"uri":"Mummy","surface_form":"mummy","offset":418},{"uri":"Ptolemaic_Egypt","surface_form":"Ptolemaic Egypt","offset":429},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":464},{"uri":"Zagreb","surface_form":"Zagreb","offset":543},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":551}]}
