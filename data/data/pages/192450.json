{"id":192450,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sidereal time is a time-keeping system. It is used by astronomers to find celestial objects. Using sidereal time it is possible to point a telescope to the proper coordinates in the night sky.\nSidereal time is a \"time scale based on Earth's rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars\".\nBecause the Earth moves in its orbit about the Sun, a mean solar day is about four minutes longer than a sidereal day. Thus, a star appears to rise four minutes earlier each night, compared to solar time. Different stars are visible at different times of the year.\nBy contrast, solar time is reckoned by the movement of the Earth from the perspective of the Sun. An average solar day (24 hours) is longer than a sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds) because of the amount the Earth moves each day in its orbit around the Sun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomers","surface_form":"astronomers","offset":67},{"uri":"Celestial","surface_form":"celestial","offset":87},{"uri":"Solar_day","surface_form":"solar day","offset":369},{"uri":"Contrast","surface_form":"contrast","offset":578},{"uri":"Solar_time","surface_form":"solar time","offset":588},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":668},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":823}]}
