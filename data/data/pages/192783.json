{"id":192783,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaskan_Klee_Kai","text":"The Alaskan Klee Kai is a northern breed of dog of the spitz type. The term \"Klee Kai\" was derived from Alaskan Athabaskan (Eskimo) words meaning \"small dog\". The breed was developed to create a pet sized version of the Alaskan Husky, but it more closely resembles the Siberian Husky. This result makes it an energetic, intelligent, apartment-sized dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage.\nThese dogs can come in a variety of different coat colors: black and white, gray and white, red and white and all white. They have a double coat, which means it is thicker.\nIn 1997, the United Kennel Club recognized the Alaskan Klee Kai. It is a rare breed with not very many dogs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":35},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":44},{"uri":"Spitz_(dog)","surface_form":"spitz","offset":55},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Eskimo","offset":124},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":195},{"uri":"Siberian_Husky","surface_form":"Siberian Husky","offset":269},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coat","offset":455}]}
