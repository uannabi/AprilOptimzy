{"id":192836,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome","text":"The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in mammals. They decide the sex (gender) of an individual. The other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome.\nFemales have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans, and in most other mammals. Although females have two X chromosomes, each cell can only have one X chromosome active. During early development, a process called X-inactivation occurs. In each cell one of the X chromosomes randomly deactivates. This causes different parts of the body to have different X-linked genes, and is responsible for the black and orange coloration of calico cats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sex_chromosome","surface_form":"sex chromosome","offset":35},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":54},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":84},{"uri":"Y_chromosome","surface_form":"Y chromosome","offset":142},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"egg","offset":219},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":256},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":348},{"uri":"X-inactivation","surface_form":"X-inactivation","offset":490},{"uri":"Calico_cat","surface_form":"calico cat","offset":705}]}
