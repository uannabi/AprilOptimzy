Known to the Arabs as early as the 10th century, but officially explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch in the 17th century. The Dutch were the ones who named the island in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU.\nMauritius was occupied successively by the Dutch (1598-1712) and later by the French (1715-1810). The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing the Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane.\nThe British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars through the Treaty of Paris. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later on, an air station playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. On 12 March 1968, Mauritius became Independent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":39},{"uri":"Mascarene_Islands","surface_form":"Mascarene Islands","offset":53},{"uri":"Rodrigues","surface_form":"Rodrigues","offset":84},{"uri":"Agal%C3%A9ga","surface_form":"Agal\u00E9ga","offset":95},{"uri":"St._Brandon","surface_form":"St. Brandon","offset":107},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":189},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":199},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":214},{"uri":"Port_Louis","surface_form":"Port Louis","offset":254},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":272},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":293},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":319},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":401},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":418},{"uri":"Dodo","surface_form":"dodo","offset":469},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":516},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":550},{"uri":"Cargados_Carajos","surface_form":"St. Brandon","offset":633},{"uri":"Rodrigues_(island)","surface_form":"Rodrigues","offset":646},{"uri":"Agalega_Islands","surface_form":"Agalega Islands","offset":664},{"uri":"Mascarene_Islands","surface_form":"Mascarene Islands","offset":706},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":739},{"uri":"R%C3%A9union","surface_form":"R\u00E9union","offset":756}]}
