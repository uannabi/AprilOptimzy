Many people who do not have cars, especially the third world countries, use buses to get around. Buses make it easy for them to get to where they want to go.\nA place where people wait for a local bus is called a \"bus stop\". A building where people wait for a long-distance bus or where many buses meet is called a \"bus station\".\nThere are many types of bus around the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":25},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passengers","offset":53},{"uri":"Driver","surface_form":"driver","offset":79},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":107},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":186},{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"public transport","offset":300},{"uri":"Third_world","surface_form":"third world","offset":396},{"uri":"Bus_stop","surface_form":"bus stop","offset":560},{"uri":"Bus_station","surface_form":"bus station","offset":662}]}
