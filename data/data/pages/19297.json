{"id":19297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti","text":"Djibouti (officially called the Republic of Djibouti) is a country on the eastern coast of Africa. The capital city is also called Djibouti.\nDjibouti gained its independence from France on June 27, 1977. The country was created out of the French Somaliland (later called the French Territory of the Afars and Issas), which was created in the 1800s as a result of French colonialism in Africa.\nIn 2020, about 920,000 people lived there. It is one of the least populous countries in Africa. Two ethnic groups, the Somali and the Afar people, account for most of the people living in the country.\nDjibouti joined the United Nations on September 20, 1977. It is also a member of the Arab League, as well as the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\nHistory.\nThe history of Djibouti goes back thousands of years when it was part of the Sabean Empire (Ethiopia) to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, Pakistan, and China. Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar tribes in this region became among the first on the African continent to accept Islam. Djibouti is a Muslim country which regularly takes part in Islamic as well as Arab meetings.\nThe country is close to a narrow part of the Red Sea so it is considered an important area from a military viewpoint.\nGeography.\nDjibouti is near to the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and Awdal of Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden at the east.\nIn the Great Rift Valley the rift between the African Plate and the Somali Plate meet the Arabian Plate. This makes a geologic tripoint that is the lowest place in Africa.\nDjibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over 1,000 m (3,281\u00A0ft). The Mousa Ali range is the country's highest mountain range.\nThe Grand Bara desert covers parts of southern Djibouti.\nMost species of wildlife are found in the northern part of the country, in the ecosystem of the Day Forest National Park. This forest area is the main habitat of the endangered and endemic Djibouti francolin (a bird).\nAdministrative divisions.\nDjibouti is divided into six administrative regions, with Djibouti city representing one of the official regions. It is further subdivided into twenty districts.\nReligion.\nThe people of Djibouti are mostly Muslim. Islam is observed by 94% of Djibouti's population (about 740,000) (2010 estimate). The remaining six percent follow Christianity.\nThe Republic of Djibouti names Islam as the only state religion. The Constitution of 1992 provides for the equality of citizens of all faiths as well as the freedom to practise any religion.\nSports.\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Djibouti. The country became a member of FIFA in 1994. They have only played in qualifying rounds for both the African Cup of Nations and FIFA World Cup.\nTransportation.\nThe country is linked to Ethiopia by way of the Addis Ababa\u2013Djibouti Railway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":59},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"eastern","offset":74},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":91},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":103},{"uri":"Djibouti_(city)","surface_form":"Djibouti","offset":131},{"uri":"French_Somaliland","surface_form":"French Somaliland","offset":239},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":275},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonialism","offset":370},{"uri":"Somalis","surface_form":"Somali","offset":512},{"uri":"Afar_people","surface_form":"Afar","offset":527},{"uri":"Arab_League","surface_form":"Arab League","offset":679},{"uri":"African_Union","surface_form":"African Union","offset":707},{"uri":"Intergovernmental_Authority_on_Development","surface_form":"Intergovernmental Authority on Development","offset":729},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":881},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":980},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":987},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1001},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1185},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":1330},{"uri":"Horn_of_Africa","surface_form":"Horn of Africa","offset":1438},{"uri":"Eritrea","surface_form":"Eritrea","offset":1472},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":1494},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":1539},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":1610},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Aden","surface_form":"Gulf of Aden","offset":1626},{"uri":"Great_Rift_Valley","surface_form":"Great Rift Valley","offset":1659},{"uri":"African_Plate","surface_form":"African Plate","offset":1698},{"uri":"Somali_Plate","surface_form":"Somali Plate","offset":1720},{"uri":"Arabian_Plate","surface_form":"Arabian Plate","offset":1742},{"uri":"Mousa_Ali","surface_form":"Mousa Ali","offset":1902},{"uri":"Grand_Bara","surface_form":"Grand Bara","offset":1963},{"uri":"Day_Forest_National_Park","surface_form":"Day Forest National Park","offset":2112},{"uri":"Endemic","surface_form":"endemic","offset":2197},{"uri":"Djibouti_francolin","surface_form":"Djibouti francolin","offset":2205},{"uri":"Djibouti_(city)","surface_form":"Djibouti city","offset":2318},{"uri":"Districts_of_Djibouti","surface_form":"districts","offset":2411},{"uri":"State_religion","surface_form":"state religion","offset":2653},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"Association football","offset":2803},{"uri":"FIFA","surface_form":"FIFA","offset":2894},{"uri":"African_Cup_of_Nations","surface_form":"African Cup of Nations","offset":2964},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":2991},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":3048},{"uri":"Addis_Ababa%E2%80%93Djibouti_Railway","surface_form":"Addis Ababa\u2013Djibouti Railway","offset":3071}]}
