{"id":19299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Huron","text":"Lake Huron is one of North America's five Great Lakes. It is the third one up from the mouth. Like Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Lake Superior, it is also part of the boundary between the USA and Canada. The Huronian glaciation, billions of years ago, is named for the lake.\nLake Huron is more than 200 miles (325 km) long and is as much as 750 feet (230 m) deep. Many boats and ships go back and forth on Lake Huron, carrying useful things such as iron ore.\nLake Huron borders the Canadian province of Ontario and the American state of Michigan. There are no large cities on Lake Huron, but there are some small cities such as Sarnia, Ontario and Bay City, Michigan.\nThe water that flows out of Lake Huron goes through a river that flows past Detroit, Michigan. The water then flows into Lake Erie on its way to the ocean.\nOn 1996 an hurricane-like storm appeared on Lake Huron, while the National Hurricane Center was not sure to call it a hurricane or not. Because the storm formed over Lake Huron and that it did not get a name from the NHC, many people nicknamed the storm, \"Hurricane Huron\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":42},{"uri":"Lake_Ontario","surface_form":"Lake Ontario","offset":99},{"uri":"Lake_Erie","surface_form":"Lake Erie","offset":113},{"uri":"Lake_Superior","surface_form":"Lake Superior","offset":128},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":187},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":195},{"uri":"Huronian_glaciation","surface_form":"Huronian glaciation","offset":207},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":302},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"km","offset":313},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"feet","offset":344},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":354},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":448},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":502},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":536},{"uri":"Sarnia","surface_form":"Sarnia","offset":627},{"uri":"Bay_City%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Bay City","offset":647},{"uri":"Detroit%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Detroit, Michigan","offset":743},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":826},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":889}]}
