{"id":19327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Puppets","text":"The Meat Puppets are an alternative/punk rock group from Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. They were formed in 1980 by Curt Kirkwood (vocals, guitars), his brother Cris (bass) and Derrick Bostrom (drums). The band is probably best known for their 1994 radio hit \"Backwater\".\nThe band went on indefinite hiatus in 2001 as Curt formed two band projects Eyes Adrift (with Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh) and Volcano (also with Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh). He also released a solo album. His brother Cris was in prison from August 2004 to 21 months.\nIn 2006, the Meat Puppets reformed and released a new album, \"Rise to Your Knees\" in 2007.\nAs of November 2009, Shandon Sahm is back as the drummer in the Meat Puppets. He replaces Ted Marcus, who was a member from 2006.\nThe band was chosen by Animal Collective to perform their album \"Up on the Sun\" live at the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in May 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist  &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scottsdale%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Scottsdale, Arizona","offset":57},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":103},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":239},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":305},{"uri":"Eyes_Adrift","surface_form":"Eyes Adrift","offset":343},{"uri":"Nirvana_(band)","surface_form":"Nirvana","offset":361},{"uri":"Krist_Novoselic","surface_form":"Krist Novoselic","offset":377},{"uri":"Sublime","surface_form":"Sublime","offset":397},{"uri":"Bud_Gaugh","surface_form":"Bud Gaugh","offset":413},{"uri":"Volcano_(band)","surface_form":"Volcano","offset":428},{"uri":"Sublime","surface_form":"Sublime","offset":447},{"uri":"Bud_Gaugh","surface_form":"Bud Gaugh","offset":463},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":542},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":549},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":571},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":653},{"uri":"Animal_Collective","surface_form":"Animal Collective","offset":812},{"uri":"Music_festival","surface_form":"music festival","offset":904}]}
