{"id":193305,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_for_Orchestra_(Bart%C3%B3k)","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Concerto for Orchestra\" is the title of a work for orchestra by the Hungarian composer B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k. It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid-20th century.\nSeveral composers have written works to which they gave the title \u201CConcerto for Orchestra\u201D. It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra. The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his (or her) talent. In a \u201CConcerto for Orchestra\u201D there is no soloist, but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece. This is what happens in B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k\u2019s concerto.\nThe work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. It was immediately a great success. Koussevitszky asked Bart\u00F3k to write this piece. Bart\u00F3k had just arrived in United States from Hungary. He had to flee because of World War II. Bart\u00F3k had no money and so he was glad to get some work.\nThe music.\nBart\u00F3k often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work. He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe, especially Hungarian music. Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key. He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes. Sometimes tunes sound like folk music. At other times there are drones in the horns and strings.\nThe orchestra needs 3 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tamtam, 2 harps and strings\nThe five movements.\nThe first movement, called \"Introduzione\" by Bart\u00F3k, is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night. This is something Bart\u00F3k did several times in his works. It is in sonata form.\nThe second movement is called \"Giuoco delle coppie\" which means \"Game of pairs\". Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune, each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval.\nThe third movement, called \"Elegia\" by Bart\u00F3k, is another slow movement, typical of Bart\u00F3k's night music.\nThe fourth movement, called \"Intermezzo interrotto\" by Bart\u00F3k, has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing. There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovich's \"\"Leningrad\" Symphony (No. 7)\". There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section.\nThe fifth movement, called \"Finale\" is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":65},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":82},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":92},{"uri":"B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k","surface_form":"B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k","offset":101},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":172},{"uri":"Concerto","surface_form":"concerto","offset":311},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrument","offset":352},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":370},{"uri":"Symphony","surface_form":"symphony","offset":554},{"uri":"1943","surface_form":"1943","offset":729},{"uri":"1_December","surface_form":"1 December","offset":764},{"uri":"1944","surface_form":"1944","offset":775},{"uri":"Boston_Symphony_Hall","surface_form":"Boston Symphony Hall","offset":787},{"uri":"Boston_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Boston Symphony Orchestra","offset":815},{"uri":"Serge_Koussevitzky","surface_form":"Serge Koussevitzky","offset":860},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":991},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1045},{"uri":"Classical_music_period","surface_form":"Classical music period","offset":1160},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":1221},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1245},{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major","offset":1315},{"uri":"Minor_scale","surface_form":"minor","offset":1324},{"uri":"Tonality","surface_form":"key","offset":1330},{"uri":"Mode_(music)","surface_form":"modes","offset":1399},{"uri":"Drone_(music)","surface_form":"drones","offset":1470},{"uri":"French_horn","surface_form":"horns","offset":1484},{"uri":"String_instruments","surface_form":"strings","offset":1494},{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":1525},{"uri":"Instrumental_doubling","surface_form":"doubling","offset":1537},{"uri":"Piccolo","surface_form":"piccolo","offset":1546},{"uri":"Oboe","surface_form":"oboe","offset":1558},{"uri":"Cor_anglais","surface_form":"cor anglais","offset":1578},{"uri":"Clarinet","surface_form":"clarinet","offset":1594},{"uri":"Bass_clarinet","surface_form":"bass clarinet","offset":1618},{"uri":"Bassoon","surface_form":"bassoon","offset":1636},{"uri":"Contrabassoon","surface_form":"contrabassoon","offset":1659},{"uri":"French_horn","surface_form":"French horn","offset":1677},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":1693},{"uri":"Trombone","surface_form":"trombone","offset":1705},{"uri":"Tuba","surface_form":"tuba","offset":1716},{"uri":"Timpani","surface_form":"timpani","offset":1722},{"uri":"Snare_drum","surface_form":"side drum","offset":1731},{"uri":"Bass_drum","surface_form":"bass drum","offset":1742},{"uri":"Cymbal","surface_form":"cymbal","offset":1753},{"uri":"Triangle_(instrument)","surface_form":"triangle","offset":1762},{"uri":"Gong","surface_form":"tamtam","offset":1772},{"uri":"Harp","surface_form":"harp","offset":1782},{"uri":"String_section","surface_form":"strings","offset":1792},{"uri":"Sonata_form","surface_form":"sonata form","offset":2008},{"uri":"Interval_(music)","surface_form":"interval","offset":2214},{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"time signature","offset":2421},{"uri":"Dmitri_Shostakovich","surface_form":"Dmitri Shostakovich","offset":2517},{"uri":"Symphony_No._7_(Shostakovich)","surface_form":"\"Leningrad\" Symphony (No. 7)","offset":2540},{"uri":"Pitch_(music)","surface_form":"pitches","offset":2664}]}
