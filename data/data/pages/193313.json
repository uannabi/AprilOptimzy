The mine is made of 9.5\u00A0kg (~21\u00A0lbs) of cast TNT. The mine is armed with a detonator that is set to explode when at least 100\u00A0kg (~220\u00A0lbs) of pressure is applied to it. The blast effect of the mine blows the track off of tanks and damages their driving wheel.\nThe mine is also known as the \"Kuntonappi\" (\"Fitness pill\") or the \"Tellu\" (female name, shortened form of Tellervo9).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Detonation","surface_form":"detonator","offset":47},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":72},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tank","offset":105},{"uri":"Land_mine","surface_form":"mine","offset":110},{"uri":"Trinitrotoluene","surface_form":"TNT","offset":161},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":259}]}
