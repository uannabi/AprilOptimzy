{"id":193408,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coblentz_(lunar_crater)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Coblentz is a small crater that can be found on the far side of the Moon, to the south of the much larger crater Bolyai. This crater has a circular edge, but it has been worn away by asteroid impacts. This is most noticeable at the southern end where a gap exists in the rim. The interior floor has very few features except for several tiny craterlets.\nA ridge arcs from the northwest rim of Coblentz to join the southern rim of Bolyai. There are several patches of dark (low albedo) material just to the south and southwest of Coblentz.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":33},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":81},{"uri":"Albedo","surface_form":"albedo","offset":489}]}
