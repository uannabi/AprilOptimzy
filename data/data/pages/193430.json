{"id":193430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligotroph","text":"=\"preserve\">An oligotroph is an organism that can survive with relatively few nutrients. Because there are few nutrients, such organisms grow slower. Their metabolism usually runs at a slower rate. The population density is generally low.\nEnvironments where oligotrophs can be found include the deep oceans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":32},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":78},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":156},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":300}]}
