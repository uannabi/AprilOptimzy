{"id":193438,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lyme disease or borreliosis, is an infectious disease. It is caused by bacteria of the genus \"Borrelia\". The disease is carried by ticks which are parasitic on mammals such as mice and deer. In other words, ticks are the vector which transmits the disease.\nIt is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States. Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme disease was a tick-borne disease, the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1982. It can cause joint swelling, rashes, and neurological disorders. It remains controversial whether if left untreated, Lyme disease can become a chronic condition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Infectious_disease","surface_form":"infectious disease","offset":48},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":84},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":100},{"uri":"Borrelia","surface_form":"Borrelia","offset":107},{"uri":"Tick","surface_form":"tick","offset":144},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":189},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":198},{"uri":"Vector_(biology)","surface_form":"vector","offset":234},{"uri":"Tick","surface_form":"tick","offset":292},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":320},{"uri":"Joint","surface_form":"joint","offset":487},{"uri":"Rash","surface_form":"rash","offset":503},{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurological","offset":515}]}
