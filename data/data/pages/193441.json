{"id":193441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonated_water","text":"Carbonated water, also known as sparkling water, fizzy water, seltzer, and water with gas, is plain water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved. Most soft drinks have carbonated water as a base. The process of dissolving carbon dioxide gas is called carbonation. It results in the formation of carbonic acid.\nThere are special machines that allow to make soda water at home.\nThe process of carbonation can also occur naturally to produce carbonated mineral water. Beer and wine are carbonated by fermentation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":100},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":117},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":161},{"uri":"Carbonation","surface_form":"carbonation","offset":261},{"uri":"Carbonic_acid","surface_form":"carbonic acid","offset":305},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":338},{"uri":"Soda_water","surface_form":"soda water","offset":366},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"Beer","offset":475},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":484}]}
