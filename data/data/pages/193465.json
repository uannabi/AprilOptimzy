He travelled to the Middle East, then to Africa and to islands of the Pacific Ocean. In all these places he had to get to know the people and get them to trust him so that they would let him record their music.\nHis \"African Sanctus\" was a result of his trip down the Nile. It combines recordings he made there with a choir and orchestra singing. It has been performed thousands of times all over the world.\nFanshawe died on 5 July 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"19_April","surface_form":"19 April","offset":34},{"uri":"1942","surface_form":"1942","offset":43},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":51},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":58},{"uri":"5_July","surface_form":"5 July","offset":72},{"uri":"2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":79},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":100},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":113},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":172},{"uri":"African_Sanctus","surface_form":"African Sanctus","offset":247},{"uri":"Documentary_film","surface_form":"documentary film","offset":404},{"uri":"Royal_College_of_Music","surface_form":"Royal College of Music","offset":453},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"films","offset":520},{"uri":"TV","surface_form":"TV","offset":530},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":537},{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_Hall","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth Hall","offset":572},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":594},{"uri":"Pearl","surface_form":"pearl","offset":642},{"uri":"Diving","surface_form":"divers","offset":648},{"uri":"Bahrain","surface_form":"Bahrain","offset":658},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":817},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":838},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":852},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":867},{"uri":"Trust_(social_sciences)","surface_form":"trust","offset":951},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":1064},{"uri":"Choir","surface_form":"choir","offset":1114},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":1124}]}
