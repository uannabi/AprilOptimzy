{"id":1935,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico","text":"Mexico (; official name: United Mexican States,) is a country in North America. Mexico is south of Texas, California and other American states. Guatemala and Belize are south of Mexico. Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.\nPeople living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak Spanish. There are also Mexicans who speak Native American languages, like Nahuatl, Mayan, and Zapotec. The capital of Mexico is Mexico City.\nHistory.\nBefore the Europeans came, many Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the Olmec culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucat\u00E1n peninsula lived the Mayans. The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to Costa Rica. A famous Toltec god is Quetzalcoatl. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the Aztecs. The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico. A famous Aztec king was Moctezuma II.\nIn 1519 the Spanish explorer Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called New Spain.\nIn 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence. In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide. He set up the First Mexican Empire and became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in 1823 the country became a republic.\nA man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio L\u00F3pez de Santa Anna. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a dictator, Texas declared independence (1836). The Battle of the Alamo was part of this Texas Revolution. Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States. In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the southwestern United States. After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela.\nBetween 1858 and 1861 there was war again, between liberals and conservatives. The liberal Benito Ju\u00E1rez won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After more war he was executed in 1867, and Juarez became president again.\nConservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In 1876 they ousted him, and made Porfirio D\u00EDaz, a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio D\u00EDaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the Mexican Revolution in 1910.\nThe next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Francisco I. Madero. When \u00C1lvaro Obreg\u00F3n became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down.\nIn 1929 President Plutarco El\u00EDas Calles founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president L\u00E1zaro C\u00E1rdenas. He was president between 1934 and 1940.\nAfter several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Another uprising was in 1994 when Zapatistas rebelled in the province Chiapas.\nMainly through ballot box fraud the PRI managed to stay into power until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years.\nPolitics.\nMexico is a constitutional federal democracy ruled by a president. The president is elected every 6 years. The current president is Andr\u00E9s Manuel L\u00F3pez Obrador. Parliament has a Senate and House of Deputies.\nGeography.\nMexico is in the southern part of North America. It is roughly shaped like a triangle. Mexico is more than 3000\u00A0km (1,850 miles) long from northwest to southeast. Mexico is between two large seas: the Pacific Ocean in the West and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the East. Mexico has two large peninsulas. Baja California in the northwest, and Yucat\u00E1n in the southeast. In central and western Mexico are the Sierra Madre mountains. In the Sierra Madre is the Pico de Orizaba, the highest mountain of Mexico. In central Mexico there are also a few volcanoes like the Popocat\u00E9petl and the Iztacc\u00EDhuatl. The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano. In the north of Mexico are deserts. In the south are tropical rainforests. Some rivers in Mexico are the R\u00EDo Bravo (known in the US as the Rio Grande), the R\u00EDo Balsas, the R\u00EDo P\u00E1nuco, and the R\u00EDo Yaqui. Many animals are found in Mexico such as birds, jaguars and monkeys.\nPeople.\nMexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. It is also the second most populous country in Latin America (after Brazil). 60% of Mexicans have Native American and European forefathers; these are called mestizos. Almost 30% of Mexicans are pure Native American and 10% are European. Most Mexicans (90%) speak Spanish. 10% of the Mexicans speak a Native American language, like Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Maya or Zapotec. Most people in Mexico are Roman Catholic (89%) and 6% are Protestant. Other ethnic groups in Mexico are Arabs, Gypsies, Africans, Jews and Asians.\nRelated page.\nNorth America","categories":[],"infobox_types":["country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":54},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":65},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":99},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":106},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":127},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":144},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":158},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":208},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":230},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":339},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":382},{"uri":"Nahuatl","surface_form":"Nahuatl","offset":414},{"uri":"Mayan_languages","surface_form":"Mayan","offset":423},{"uri":"Zapotec_language","surface_form":"Zapotec","offset":434},{"uri":"Mexico_City","surface_form":"Mexico City","offset":468},{"uri":"Olmec","surface_form":"Olmec","offset":587},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":689},{"uri":"Mayans","surface_form":"Mayans","offset":709},{"uri":"City_states","surface_form":"city states","offset":737},{"uri":"200","surface_form":"200","offset":803},{"uri":"900","surface_form":"900","offset":811},{"uri":"Teotihuacan","surface_form":"Teotihuacan","offset":856},{"uri":"Toltecs","surface_form":"Toltecs","offset":968},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":1087},{"uri":"Quetzalcoatl","surface_form":"Quetzalcoatl","offset":1122},{"uri":"Aztecs","surface_form":"Aztecs","offset":1197},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":1233},{"uri":"Moctezuma_II","surface_form":"Moctezuma II","offset":1272},{"uri":"1519","surface_form":"1519","offset":1289},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1298},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":1306},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":1315},{"uri":"1521","surface_form":"1521","offset":1498},{"uri":"Tenochtitlan","surface_form":"Tenochtitlan","offset":1536},{"uri":"New_Spain","surface_form":"New Spain","offset":1603},{"uri":"1810","surface_form":"1810","offset":1617},{"uri":"Miguel_Hidalgo","surface_form":"Miguel Hidalgo","offset":1641},{"uri":"Mexican_war_of_independence","surface_form":"Mexican war of independence","offset":1668},{"uri":"1821","surface_form":"1821","offset":1700},{"uri":"Agustin_de_Iturbide","surface_form":"Agustin de Iturbide","offset":1809},{"uri":"First_Mexican_Empire","surface_form":"First Mexican Empire","offset":1844},{"uri":"1823","surface_form":"1823","offset":1934},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":1960},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":2022},{"uri":"Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna","surface_form":"Antonio L\u00F3pez de Santa Anna","offset":2039},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":2126},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":2136},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Alamo","surface_form":"Battle of the Alamo","offset":2176},{"uri":"Texas_Revolution","surface_form":"Texas Revolution","offset":2213},{"uri":"Mexican-American_War","surface_form":"war between Mexico and the United States","offset":2263},{"uri":"Southwestern_United_States","surface_form":"southwestern United States","offset":2372},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"sent away","offset":2430},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":2443},{"uri":"1858","surface_form":"1858","offset":2462},{"uri":"1861","surface_form":"1861","offset":2471},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberals","offset":2505},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservatives","offset":2518},{"uri":"Benito_Ju%C3%A1rez","surface_form":"Benito Ju\u00E1rez","offset":2545},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":2634},{"uri":"Maximilian_of_Habsburg","surface_form":"Maximilian of Habsburg","offset":2665},{"uri":"Cinco_de_Mayo","surface_form":"more war","offset":2767},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"executed","offset":2783},{"uri":"1867","surface_form":"1867","offset":2795},{"uri":"1876","surface_form":"1876","offset":2888},{"uri":"Porfirio_D%C3%ADaz","surface_form":"Porfirio D\u00EDaz","offset":2919},{"uri":"Mexican_Revolution","surface_form":"Mexican Revolution","offset":3104},{"uri":"1910","surface_form":"1910","offset":3126},{"uri":"Emiliano_Zapata","surface_form":"Emiliano Zapata","offset":3316},{"uri":"Pancho_Villa","surface_form":"Pancho Villa","offset":3333},{"uri":"Francisco_I._Madero","surface_form":"Francisco I.
