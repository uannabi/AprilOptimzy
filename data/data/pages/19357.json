It is made from distilling cider in Normandy, one of the oldest Provinces of France (created in 911).

It is also made in the other places in Normandy including la Manche (Cotentin) and l'Orne (Domfront).\nHow Calvados is made.\nThe way to make Calvados is to distil cider twice. The first time it is done, the result is a liquid containing 28% to 30% alcohol. The second time it is done, the amount of alcohol is increased to about 40%.\nHow Calvados is served.\nCalvados can be served either dry or with ice, as a cocktail, an aperitif, or as a digestif.
