{"id":193579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation","text":"=\"preserve\">A confederation is a group of countries that, by treaty, have given some of their powers to a central government. They do this in order to coordinate their actions in a number of areas. This is like a federation, but without the association being a new country.\nA confederation is not the same as a federation, but they have a similarity. A confederation is a group of countries, a federation is a country.\nThe only example today is the European Union. Switzerland has the Latin name \"Conf\u0153deratio Helvetica\", although it is not a confederation in this sense, but a federation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":42},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":61},{"uri":"Federation","surface_form":"federation","offset":213},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":449},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":465},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":485}]}
