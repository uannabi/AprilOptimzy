{"id":193606,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet","text":"Freenet is a decentralized (hosted on many machines) network., It is censorship-resistant, which means it is not easy for anyone other than authors to remove content. The data is stored on many machines. Freenet was made by Ian Clarke. Freenet has a goal to provide freedom of speech and Freedom of information through a peer-to-peer network with protection of user's identity. Freenet works by putting together the volunteer bandwidth and storage space of member machines to allow users to anonymously publish (place or upload) or retrieve (get or download) different kinds of information. From a user's perspective, it can be thought of as simply a large storage device.\nFreenet has been under continuous development since 2000; a \"version 1.0\" has not yet been released but current builds are usable. The project has already seen a ground-up rewrite (redoing of programming) for \"version 0.7\". Freenet is free software.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":53},{"uri":"Censorship","surface_form":"censorship","offset":69},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":171},{"uri":"Distributed_data_store","surface_form":"many machines","offset":189},{"uri":"Ian_Clarke_(computer_scientist)","surface_form":"Ian Clarke","offset":224},{"uri":"Freedom_of_speech","surface_form":"freedom of speech","offset":266},{"uri":"Freedom_of_information","surface_form":"Freedom of information","offset":288},{"uri":"Peer-to-peer","surface_form":"peer-to-peer","offset":321},{"uri":"Anonymity","surface_form":"user's identity","offset":361},{"uri":"Pooling_(resource_management)","surface_form":"putting together","offset":395},{"uri":"Bandwidth_(computing)","surface_form":"bandwidth","offset":426},{"uri":"Rewrite_(programming)","surface_form":"ground-up rewrite","offset":835},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software","offset":908}]}
