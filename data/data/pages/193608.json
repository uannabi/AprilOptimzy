{"id":193608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort-Libert%C3%A9","text":"Fort-Libert\u00E9 (Kr\u00E9y\u00F2l: \"F\u00F2lib\u00E8te\"; English: \"Fort Liberty\") is a city in northeast Haiti, on the Atlantic coast. It is the capital city of the Nord-Est \"D\u00E9partement\".\nThe city is on the \"Baie de Fort-Libert\u00E9\" (\"Fort-Libert\u00E9 Bay\") about 56\u00A0km east of Cap-Ha\u00EFtien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has three \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): Fort-Libert\u00E9, Ferrier (Krey\u00F2l: \"Ferye\") and Perches (Krey\u00F2l: \"Op\u00E8ch\").\nHistory.\nBetween 1503 and 1505, Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of \"Puerto Real\" (English, \"Royal Port\") where is the present town of \"Caracol\", to the west of Fort-Libert\u00E9. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Ta\u00EDno name of the region: Bayaj\u00E1.\nIn 1606, those persons living in the old Spanish towns of Bayaj\u00E1 and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.\nLater, when French people founded a new town in this place, they called it Fort-Dauphin in 1731, named after the \"Dauphin\" (the \"Dolphin\", son of the French king Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to \"Fort-Libert\u00E9\" in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city Fort-Royal. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Libert\u00E9.\nForts around Fort-Libert\u00E9.\nThere are several forts built around the bay. An important one is \"Fort Dauphin\", sometimes called \"Fort Saint Joseph\" (Patron Saint of the city) or \"Fort Libert\u00E9\". Other forts in the area are \"Fort de la Bouque\", \"Batterie de l'Anse\", \"Fort Saint Charles\" and \"Fort Saint Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique\".\nEconomy.\nFort-Libert\u00E9 has a small port that also receives international products and serves as a fishing port. Local agricultural products include sugarcane and citrus fruits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Haitian_Creole","surface_form":"Kr\u00E9y\u00F2l","offset":14},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":34},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":64},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":82},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":96},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":105},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":122},{"uri":"Nord-Est_Department","surface_form":"Nord-Est","offset":142},{"uri":"Departments_of_Haiti","surface_form":"D\u00E9partement","offset":152},{"uri":"Cap-Ha%C3%AFtien","surface_form":"Cap-Ha\u00EFtien","offset":249},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":284},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":463},{"uri":"1503","surface_form":"1503","offset":566},{"uri":"1505","surface_form":"1505","offset":575},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Ovando","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando","offset":581},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":608},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":624},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":671},{"uri":"1578","surface_form":"1578","offset":842},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":867},{"uri":"1606","surface_form":"1606","offset":904},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":942},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1008},{"uri":"Bayaguana","surface_form":"Bayaguana","offset":1078},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":1130},{"uri":"1731","surface_form":"1731","offset":1209},{"uri":"Louis_XV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XV","offset":1280},{"uri":"1792","surface_form":"1792","offset":1371},{"uri":"1811","surface_form":"1811","offset":1432},{"uri":"1820","surface_form":"1820","offset":1473},{"uri":"Fort","surface_form":"fort","offset":1598},{"uri":"Saint_Joseph","surface_form":"Saint Joseph","offset":1685},{"uri":"Patron_saint","surface_form":"Patron Saint","offset":1700},{"uri":"Harbour","surface_form":"port","offset":1900},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":1963},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":1983},{"uri":"Sugarcane","surface_form":"sugarcane","offset":2013},{"uri":"Citrus","surface_form":"citrus","offset":2027}]}
