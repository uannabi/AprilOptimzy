{"id":19361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai","text":"\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" is a British 1957 movie from Columbia Pictures, based on Pierre Boulle's 1952 book \"The Bridge over the River Kwai\" (). The movie was mainly filmed in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and also in England.\nIn 1941 the Japanese Army invaded Thailand. They built a railway to link Bangkok to Rangoon. Thousands of Asian workers and POWs (prisoners of war) died while working on the project. Part of this project was building bridges over Thailand's Kwai Yai, at a place named Tamarkan, which is near a town named Kanchanaburi.\nThe deaths of the Asian workers and the prisoners were real events, but most of the book and the movie are not true. The British soldiers were slaves; they did not help the Japanese. Two bridges were built; one was made of wood, one was made of concrete and steel. Both bridges stood for two years and were destroyed by bombers in 1945.\nIn the movie the bridge is destroyed by commandos. A real train rode over the bridge as it blew up. (This can be compared to a scene in the 1927 movie, \"The General\", which starred Buster Keaton.)\nThe movie is best known for the \"Colonel Bogey March\", the song that is whistled by the POWs. It is also known as the \"River Kwai March\".\nThe movie won seven Academy Awards, one for Best Picture. It also won the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":36},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":49},{"uri":"Columbia_Pictures","surface_form":"Columbia Pictures","offset":60},{"uri":"Pierre_Boulle","surface_form":"Pierre Boulle","offset":88},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":104},{"uri":"Ceylon","surface_form":"Ceylon","offset":182},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":194},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":217},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":238},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":260},{"uri":"Bangkok","surface_form":"Bangkok","offset":299},{"uri":"Rangoon","surface_form":"Rangoon","offset":310},{"uri":"POW","surface_form":"POW","offset":350},{"uri":"Prisoner","surface_form":"prisoner","offset":356},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":443},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":456},{"uri":"River_Kwai","surface_form":"Kwai Yai","offset":467},{"uri":"Kanchanaburi","surface_form":"Kanchanaburi","offset":531},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":688},{"uri":"Bomber","surface_form":"bomber","offset":865},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":876},{"uri":"Commando","surface_form":"commando","offset":922},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"train","offset":940},{"uri":"1927","surface_form":"1927","offset":1022},{"uri":"The_General","surface_form":"The General","offset":1035},{"uri":"Buster_Keaton","surface_form":"Buster Keaton","offset":1063},{"uri":"Colonel_Bogey_March","surface_form":"Colonel Bogey March","offset":1112},{"uri":"Whistle","surface_form":"whistle","offset":1151},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":1237},{"uri":"BAFTA_Award_for_Best_British_Screenplay","surface_form":"BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay","offset":1291}]}
