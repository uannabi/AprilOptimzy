{"id":19384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury","text":"e=\"preserve\">Perjury is the word used for a person that tells a lie while they are under oath (in a courtroom). Committing perjury is against the law, and can be punished with a jail or prison sentence.\nPerjury is a serious crime because it might be used to take away the power of a court, which can lead to punishment for the wrong person. In the United States, perjury is a federal offense, and it can be punished by five years in prison. However, in California, a person who commits perjury can get the death penalty if\u00A0the perjury led to a wrongful execution.\nThe rules of perjury also apply when a person says or does something \"under penalty of perjury\", even if he or she never swore an oath. One example is the United States'\u00A0income tax\u00A0return, where people have to sign as true and correct under penalty of perjury. A person can be punished by three years in prison if he or she lies on the tax return.\nA statement that involves \"interpretation\" are not perjury because people can judge incorrectly without knowing it. Perjury only happens if a person wanted to do it and then actually did.\nCanada.\nThe offence of perjury is written in section 132 of the\u00A0Criminal Code. It is described by section 131, which says that perjury is when a person says something false when he or she knows that it is false. People who commit perjury can be imprisoned for fourteen years at most.\nEuropean Union.\nA person in the\u00A0Court of Justice of the European Communities\u00A0swears anything he knows is false is guilty of perjury.\u00A0Proceedings for perjury can happen in any place in the State and the offence can be treated as if it happened in that place.\nUnited States.\nPerjury in American law comes from the\u00A0common law\u00A0of England, which defined the it as giving a false testimony under oath that has to do with the issue.\nDefinitions.\nThe American legal system defines perjury as saying anything knowingly false under oath to a \"competent tribunal, officer, or person\".
