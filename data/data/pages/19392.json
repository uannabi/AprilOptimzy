{"id":19392,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine","text":"Fluorine (symbol F) is a chemical element that is very poisonous. Its atomic number (which is the number of protons in it) is 9, and its atomic mass is 19. It is part of the Group 7 (halogens) on the periodic table of elements.\nProperties.\nFluorine is a light yellow diatomic gas. It is very reactive gas, which exists as diatomic molecules. It is actually the most reactive element. Fluorine has a very high attraction for electrons, because it is missing one. This makes it the most powerful oxidizing agent. It can rip electrons from water (making oxygen) and ignite propane on contact. It does not need a spark. Metals can catch on fire when placed in a stream of fluorine. After it is reduced by reacting with other things, it forms the stable fluoride ion. Fluorine is very poisonous. Fluorine bonds very strongly with carbon. It can react with the unreactive noble gases. It explodes when mixed with hydrogen. The melting point of fluorine is -363.33\u00B0F (-219.62\u00B0C), the boiling point is -306.62\u00B0F (-188.12\u00B0C).\nChemical compounds.\nChemical compounds containing fluorine ions are called fluorides. Fluorine only exists in one oxidation state: -1.\nOccurrence.\nFluorine is not found as an element on the earth; it is much too reactive. Several fluorides are found in the earth, though. When calcium phosphate is reacted with sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid, some hydrofluoric acid is produced. Also, fluorite can be reacted with sulfuric acid to make hydrofluoric acid. Fluorite naturally occurs on the earths' crust in rocks, coal and clay.\nPreparation.\nFluorine is normally made by electrolysis. Hydrogen fluoride is dissolved in potassium fluoride. This mixture is melted and an electric current is passed through it. This is electrolysis. Hydrogen is produced at one side and fluorine at the other side. If the sides are not separated, the cell may explode.\nSomeone made fluorine in 1986 without using electrolysis. They produced manganese(IV) fluoride by using various chemical compounds, which released fluorine gas.\nUses.\nFluorine is used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. It is also used to make sulfur hexafluoride. Sulfur hexafluoride is used to propel stuff out of an aerosol can. It is also used to make integrated circuits. Fluorine compounds have many uses. Fluoride ions are in fluorine compounds. Fluoride ions can be in toothpaste. Some are used in nonstick coatings. Freons contain fluorine.\nSafety.\nFluorine as an element is extremely reactive and toxic. It can react with almost everything, even glass. Fluorine is also poisonous.\nFluoride ions are somewhat toxic. If too much toothpaste containing fluoride is eaten then fluoride poisoning may occur. Fluoride is not reactive, though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":25},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":70},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":108},{"uri":"Atomic_mass","surface_form":"atomic mass","offset":137},{"uri":"Halogen","surface_form":"halogen","offset":183},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":200},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":494},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":551},{"uri":"Propane","surface_form":"propane","offset":570},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduced","offset":690},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":749},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":825},{"uri":"Noble_gas","surface_form":"noble gas","offset":866},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":907},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"Chemical compound","offset":1037},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":1076},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":1092},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":1131},{"uri":"Calcium_phosphate","surface_form":"calcium phosphate","offset":1294},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":1328},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":1350},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":1372},{"uri":"Fluorite","surface_form":"fluorite","offset":1409},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":1593},{"uri":"Hydrogen_fluoride","surface_form":"Hydrogen fluoride","offset":1607},{"uri":"Potassium_fluoride","surface_form":"potassium fluoride","offset":1641},{"uri":"Manganese(IV)_fluoride","surface_form":"manganese(IV) fluoride","offset":1943},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"nuclear weapon","offset":2077},{"uri":"Sulfur_hexafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur hexafluoride","offset":2118},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":2230},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"Fluoride","offset":2286},{"uri":"Toothpaste","surface_form":"toothpaste","offset":2351},{"uri":"Nonstick","surface_form":"nonstick","offset":2380},{"uri":"Freon","surface_form":"Freon","offset":2399}]}
