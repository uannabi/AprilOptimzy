{"id":194111,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trix_(cereal)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Trix is a brand of breakfast cereal. It is made by General Mills for North America and Cereal Partners in other parts of the world. They are vanilla-flavored puffed cereal pieces. They were first round, brightly colored cereal pieces. In 1991, they were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces. In 2006, they were changed back to their round shape in the United States and some other places. In the present, the slogan says: \"Trix is not for rabbits!\".\nOverview.\nWhen the cereal was first made in 1955, it originally had three flavors: \"Orangey Orange\", \"Raspberry Red\", and \"Lemony Yellow\". Between 1984 and 1999, four more flavors were added: \"Grapity Purple\" (1984), \"Lime Green\" (1991), \"Wildberry Blue\" (1998-2006), and \"Watermelon\" (1999). Yoplait brand yogurt, made by General Mills, makes Trix Yogurt. It has flavors such as \"Watermelon Burst\". A different type of Trix cereal called \"Trix Swirls\" is made also. It is made of puffed pieces with different colored swirls.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breakfast_cereal","surface_form":"breakfast cereal","offset":32},{"uri":"General_Mills","surface_form":"General Mills","offset":64},{"uri":"Cereal_Partners","surface_form":"Cereal Partners","offset":100},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":366}]}
