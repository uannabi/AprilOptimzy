{"id":194154,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon","text":"The gameplay of the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" series of role-playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called \"Pok\u00E9mon\" and using them to battle other trainers. Every generation of games follows this concept by introducing new Pok\u00E9mon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pok\u00E9mon abilities are similar to the Pok\u00E9mon Powers introduced in the \"Pok\u00E9mon Trading Card Game\".\nBattles.\nBattling is a large part of the games. Pok\u00E9mon can be found in the wild, in dark grass, caves, forests, ponds, the ocean, and even underwater. Also, whenever the player walks where another trainer can see the player, the two must battle. Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series \"Pok\u00E9mon\" games.\nStatistics.\nPok\u00E9mon have six statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) which all affect how they perform in battles. Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pok\u00E9mon.\nBefore \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\" were released, the \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense\" stats were combined into one statistic, \"Special.\" This later became too complicated so it was divided into \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense.\"\nAbilities.\nStarting in \"Pok\u00E9mon Ruby and Sapphire\", Pok\u00E9mon have abilities which affect them in various ways. These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around. An example is the ability \"Overgrow\" which increases the power of Grass-type moves when a Pok\u00E9mon's health is below 1/3 of its full amount.\nPok\u00E9mon types.\nEach Pok\u00E9mon has either one or two types. Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pok\u00E9mon of other types. For example, a Fire-type Pok\u00E9mon is weak against Water-type, but is strong against a Grass-type. It could be compared to a more complex game of rock, paper, scissors.\nAnother type, \"Fairy\", was added in \"Pok\u00E9mon X and Y\".\nPok\u00E9mon Gyms.\nPok\u00E9mon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader, who focuses one of the 18 types of Pok\u00E9mon. There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle, and they also use mostly that type. Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills.\nEvolution.\nPok\u00E9mon evolve to turn into different Pok\u00E9mon from the same evolutionary line. Doing so, they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves, but learn moves at higher levels.\nEvolution by leveling up.\nThis is the most common way that Pok\u00E9mon evolve. Pok\u00E9mon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level.\nSome Pok\u00E9mon can only evolve by level in a certain place.\nSome Pok\u00E9mon evolve by level if it is holding a certain item.\nSome Pokemon only evolve by level if they are leveled in a route that is having a certain weather. This weather can only work to evolve the Pokemon if the weather is not caused by a move or Ability.\nEvolution by stones.\nThis is another way that Pok\u00E9mon evolve. Some Pok\u00E9mon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones.\nEvolution by trading.\nThis is another way that Pok\u00E9mon evolve. Some Pok\u00E9mon only evolve if they are traded to a friend.\nSome Pok\u00E9mon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item.\nSome Pokemon only evolve if they're traded with another, specific Pokemon.\nEvolution by happiness.\nExample: Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out; into Espeon if this happens during the day, or Umbreon if it happens during the night. However, such day-and-night distinction exists only in the second-generation games and the generations that follow (but not in \"Pok\u00E9mon FireRed and LeafGreen\").\nEvolution by moves.\nPok\u00E9mon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up.\nEvolution by gender.\nSome Pok\u00E9mon can evolve only if they are a certain gender.\nMega Evolution.\nSome Pok\u00E9mon can evolve into a Mega form during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. However, the evolution only lasts for the battle.\nItems.\nA large number of different items exist. They are used to help the player or their Pok\u00E9mon.\nA Pok\u00E9 Ball is a red-and-white sphere that is used to catch Pok\u00E9mon. Many different forms of it exist, such as the Great Ball, the Ultra Ball, the Heavy Ball, the Net Ball, the Dive Ball, the Friend Ball, and the Master Ball (which can catch any Pok\u00E9mon without fail). Each of these have different colors and can be used to catch different Pok\u00E9mon more effectively.\nPok\u00E9dex.\nThe Pok\u00E9dex is a tool used by Pok\u00E9mon trainers all around the Pok\u00E9mon world in different regions. These regions include the Unova region, the Sinnoh region, the Hoenn region, the Johto region and the Kanto region. The Pok\u00E9dex makes records of information about each of the different Pok\u00E9mon. There are 801 different species of Pok\u00E9mon recorded in the world today. Different Pok\u00E9mon are caught in different regions and some Pok\u00E9mon can only be caught in certain regions, such as Xerneas in the Kalos Region.\nLegendary Pok\u00E9mon.\nLegendary Pok\u00E9mon are Pok\u00E9mon that are very rare, and there is usually only one in each game. Examples of legendaries are Articuno, Zapdos, Mewtwo, Lugia, Groudon, and Dialga. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most Pok\u00E9mon. Some roam around, while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them. If you KO a legendary, it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted or the Elite Four is defeated again. Because of this, players usually save before engaging the Pok\u00E9mon.\nMythical Pok\u00E9mon.\nMythical Pok\u00E9mon are the rarest type of Pok\u00E9mon, only found by one-time events. Examples of Mythical Pok\u00E9mon are Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi.\nShiny Pok\u00E9mon.\nShiny Pok\u00E9mon are a different color than that Pok\u00E9mon normal for their species. Some examples would be a yellow Bulbasaur (they are usually greenish-blue) or a red Gyarados (they are usually blue). They are extremely rare; there is only a 1 in 4,096 chance of an encountered Pok\u00E9mon being shiny, but there are ways to improve your chances of obtaining one, which vary per game. Some Pokemon in the same evolution line have different shiny colors, even if their regular colors are the same. For example, Ponyta and Rapidash normally have reddish-orange flames. However, shiny Ponyta have blue flames while shiny Rapidash have silver flames.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":21},{"uri":"Role-playing_game","surface_form":"role-playing","offset":40},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":53},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)","surface_form":"anime","offset":420},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Trading Card Game","offset":537},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver","offset":1110},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Ruby and Sapphire","offset":1365},{"uri":"Rock%2C_paper%2C_scissors","surface_form":"rock, paper, scissors","offset":1972},{"uri":"Fairy","surface_form":"Fairy","offset":2010},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon X and Y","offset":2032},{"uri":"Eevee","surface_form":"Eevee","offset":3423},{"uri":"Espeon","surface_form":"Espeon","offset":3449},{"uri":"Umbreon","surface_form":"Umbreon","offset":3459},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon FireRed and LeafGreen","offset":3720},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":3910},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":4566},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":4955},{"uri":"Legendary_Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Legendary Pok\u00E9mon","offset":5075},{"uri":"Articuno","surface_form":"Articuno","offset":5197},{"uri":"Zapdos","surface_form":"Zapdos","offset":5207},{"uri":"Mewtwo","surface_form":"Mewtwo","offset":5215},{"uri":"Lugia","surface_form":"Lugia","offset":5223},{"uri":"Groudon","surface_form":"Groudon","offset":5230},{"uri":"Dialga","surface_form":"Dialga","offset":5243},{"uri":"Mew_(Pok%C3%A9mon)","surface_form":"Mew","offset":5736},{"uri":"Celebi","surface_form":"Celebi","offset":5741},{"uri":"Jirachi","surface_form":"Jirachi","offset":5753},{"uri":"Bulbasaur","surface_form":"Bulbasaur","offset":5889},{"uri":"Gyarados","surface_form":"Gyarados","offset":5941},{"uri":"Ponyta","surface_form":"Ponyta","offset":6280},{"uri":"Rapidash","surface_form":"Rapidash","offset":6291},{"uri":"Ponyta","surface_form":"Ponyta","offset":6352},{"uri":"Rapidash","surface_form":"Rapidash","offset":6388}]}
