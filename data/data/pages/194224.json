{"id":194224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.A._Hurac%C3%A1n","text":"Club Atl\u00E9tico Hurac\u00E1n is a sports club from the Parque Patricios neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The football team currently plays in the Primera A, the first level of the Argentine football league system. Hurac\u00E1n home stadium is the Estadio Tom\u00E1s Adolfo Duc\u00F3.\nHurac\u00E1n was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (\"Globo\", literally \"Balloon\") come from the \"Hurac\u00E1n\" balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called \"los Quemeros\" (\"the Burners\") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.\nDuring the professional era, Hurac\u00E1n won the Primera Divisi\u00F3n title just once (the 1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). Moreover, Hurac\u00E1n has finished as runner-up of the first division 5 times during professionalism (the last one in the 2009 Clausura).\nHurac\u00E1n's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.\nHistory.\nThough officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the amateur era of Argentine football (1891\u20131930), Hurac\u00E1n won four championships (1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.\nDuring the professional era (started in 1931), Hurac\u00E1n had their moment of glory in the \"Metropolitano\" championship of the 1973 season, when they won their only first division title. The team has also won twice the second division (1989\u201390 and 1999\u201300). The club has had 4 promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006\u201307 season, when Hurac\u00E1n defeated Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.\nHurac\u00E1n was runner-up of the Primera Divisi\u00F3n in the 2009 Clausura. The team, coached by \u00C1ngel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Mat\u00EDas Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play. They reached the final game of the season one point above V\u00E9lez Z\u00E1rsfield, but lost 1-0 away with that team in the final fixture (in a game with controversial referral decisions).\nStadium.\nThe Estadio Tom\u00E1s Adolfo Duc\u00F3 was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Hurac\u00E1n played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando \"la tota\" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said \"no veo la hora de volver al Duc\u00F3, qu\u00E9 sufrimiento muyayo!\" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).\nOn 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Hurac\u00E1n returned to the Duc\u00F3, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against V\u00E9lez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.\nRoller Hockey.\nThe Club Atl\u00E9tico Hurac\u00E1n plays in the main Roller Hockey league of Argentina, the Liga Nacional Argentina-Serie A1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sports_club","surface_form":"sports club","offset":27},{"uri":"Parque_Patricios","surface_form":"Parque Patricios","offset":48},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":82},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":96},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":111},{"uri":"Primera_A","surface_form":"Primera A","offset":148},{"uri":"Argentine_football_league_system","surface_form":"Argentine football league system","offset":182},{"uri":"Estadio_Tom%C3%A1s_Adolfo_Duc%C3%B3","surface_form":"Estadio Tom\u00E1s Adolfo Duc\u00F3","offset":244},{"uri":"Nueva_Pompeya","surface_form":"Nueva Pompeya","offset":319},{"uri":"Balloon_(aircraft)","surface_form":"balloon","offset":448},{"uri":"Jorge_Newbery","surface_form":"Jorge Newbery","offset":465},{"uri":"Argentine_Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Primera Divisi\u00F3n","offset":665},{"uri":"Amateur_era_in_Argentine_football","surface_form":"amateur era","offset":757},{"uri":"C.A._San_Lorenzo_de_Almagro","surface_form":"San Lorenzo de Almagro","offset":965},{"uri":"Amateur_era_in_Argentine_football","surface_form":"amateur era of Argentine football","offset":1119},{"uri":"1921_in_Argentine_football","surface_form":"1921","offset":1198},{"uri":"1922_in_Argentine_football","surface_form":"1922","offset":1204},{"uri":"1925_in_Argentine_football","surface_form":"1925","offset":1210},{"uri":"1928_in_Argentine_football","surface_form":"1928","offset":1219},{"uri":"Metropolitano_championship","surface_form":"\"Metropolitano\"","offset":1373},{"uri":"1973_Argentine_Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"1973 season","offset":1409},{"uri":"Argentine_Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"first division","offset":1447},{"uri":"Primera_B_Nacional","surface_form":"second division","offset":1501},{"uri":"Promotion_and_relegation","surface_form":"promotions and relegations","offset":1559},{"uri":"Godoy_Cruz_Antonio_Tomba","surface_form":"Godoy Cruz","offset":1681},{"uri":"%C3%81ngel_Cappa","surface_form":"\u00C1ngel Cappa","offset":1808},{"uri":"Mario_Bolatti","surface_form":"Mario Bolatti","offset":1829},{"uri":"Mat%C3%ADas_Defederico","surface_form":"Mat\u00EDas Defederico","offset":1844},{"uri":"Javier_Pastore","surface_form":"Javier Pastore","offset":1866},{"uri":"Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_V%C3%A9lez_S%C3%A1rsfield","surface_form":"V\u00E9lez Z\u00E1rsfield","offset":2013},{"uri":"Referee_(association_football)","surface_form":"referral","offset":2114},{"uri":"Estadio_Tom%C3%A1s_Adolfo_Duc%C3%B3","surface_form":"Estadio Tom\u00E1s Adolfo Duc\u00F3","offset":2148},{"uri":"Argentinos_Juniors","surface_form":"Argentinos Juniors","offset":2337},{"uri":"Roller_hockey_(quad)","surface_form":"Roller Hockey","offset":2892},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":2916},{"uri":"Liga_Nacional_Argentina_A-1","surface_form":"Liga Nacional Argentina-Serie A1","offset":2931}]}
