It marks the site of the Eleanor Cross, Edward I's memorial to his wife Eleanor of Castile.\nToday, it marks the central point for measuring distances from London. The replacement cross stands in the forecourt of Charing Cross station.\nThe cross also gave its name to Charing Cross Hospital, Charing Cross bridge and Charing Cross Road. This was at one time a main route for traffic, bypassing the actual cross.\nCharing Cross is the notional \"centre of London\". It is the point from which distances from London are calculated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":28},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":36},{"uri":"Eleanor_Cross","surface_form":"Eleanor Cross","offset":77},{"uri":"Edward_I_of_England","surface_form":"Edward I","offset":92},{"uri":"Eleanor_of_Castile","surface_form":"Eleanor of Castile","offset":124},{"uri":"Charing_Cross_station","surface_form":"Charing Cross station","offset":264},{"uri":"Charing_Cross_Hospital","surface_form":"Charing Cross Hospital","offset":319},{"uri":"Hungerford_Bridge","surface_form":"Charing Cross bridge","offset":343},{"uri":"Charing_Cross_Road","surface_form":"Charing Cross Road","offset":368}]}
