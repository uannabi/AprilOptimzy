{"id":194327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickie_(sex)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A quickie is a brief act of sexual intercourse.\nPeople will not usually have much foreplay with a quickie. The phrase is often used between regular partners to say that they wish to have sex, but don't have much time for it.\nA quickie may not always mean sexual intercourse. It may be oral sex or mutual masturbation. According to some, a quickie between a heterosexual couple generally satisfies only the man. Others claim that quickies (with intercourse or some other form of stimulation of the vulva) can be \"a major turn-on\" for a woman, too. Since it may not give a woman enough time to lubricate naturally, she might need a lubricant. Some consider quickies a solution to unequal sexual desire in a relationship. If they become the only form of sex, the relationship may suffer.\nFor gay men, a quickie sometimes means casual sex, like a hand job. It does not usually happen with lesbians, however.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":41},{"uri":"Foreplay","surface_form":"foreplay","offset":95},{"uri":"Oral_sex","surface_form":"oral sex","offset":298},{"uri":"Masturbation","surface_form":"masturbation","offset":317},{"uri":"Heterosexual","surface_form":"heterosexual","offset":370},{"uri":"Vulva","surface_form":"vulva","offset":510},{"uri":"Lubricant","surface_form":"lubricant","offset":643},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":802},{"uri":"Casual_sex","surface_form":"casual sex","offset":837},{"uri":"Hand_job","surface_form":"hand job","offset":856},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":898}]}
