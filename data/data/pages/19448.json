{"id":19448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove","text":"\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" (better known as only Dr. Strangelove) is a 1964 British-American black comedy movie directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick, and starring Peter Sellers.\nThe story concerns an unhinged United States Air Force general, George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson. He orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. It follows the President, his advisers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. It separately follows the crew of one B-52 bomber as they try to deliver their payload.\nDuring the movie's ending, the world is blown up by a Soviet deterrence weapon, the Cobalt-Thorium G \"doomsday machine\", whose existence had not been announced. Vera Lynn's recording of \"We'll Meet Again\" is played as the world meets its end (it was a famous song of World War II).\nThis is sometimes said to be a film of the book Peter George's thriller novel \"Red Alert\" (1958). But in this book Strangelove's character does not appear. It seems the director Stanley Kubrick had intended to use ideas from the book, but as the film developed the influence of tragi-comedy and the genius of Peter Sellers changed its direction.\nIn 1989, the United States Library of Congress chose this movie to be kept in the National Film Registry. This means the movie will be protected from damage that happens to older film that was used to make movies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":120},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":128},{"uri":"Black_comedy","surface_form":"black comedy","offset":137},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":150},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":156},{"uri":"Stanley_Kubrick","surface_form":"Stanley Kubrick","offset":181},{"uri":"Peter_Sellers","surface_form":"Peter Sellers","offset":211},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"United States Air Force","offset":257},{"uri":"George_C._Scott","surface_form":"George C.
