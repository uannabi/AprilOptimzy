{"id":194582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_temperature","text":"e=\"preserve\">Absolute temperature, also called thermodynamic temperature, is the temperature of an object on a scale where 0 is taken as absolute zero. Absolute temperature scales are \"Kelvin\" (degree units Celsius) and \"Rankine\" (degree units Fahrenheit).\nAbsolute zero is the temperature at which a system is in the state of lowest possible (minimum) energy. As molecules approach this temperature their movements drop towards zero. It is the lowest temperature a gas thermometer can measure. No electronic devices work at this temperature. The Kinetic energy of the molecules becomes negligible or zero.\nConversion.\nTo convert from the Celsius scale into the absolute temperature, you add 273.15 and change \u00B0C to K. To get a temperature on the absolute scale to the Celsius scale, subtract 273.15 and change K to \u00B0C.\nThis is normally used in the science world. Kelvin is used globally as a part of the International System of Units. It is one of the 7 base units of the system.\nThe value of Absolute temperature is 0K.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":81},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":99},{"uri":"0","surface_form":"0","offset":123},{"uri":"Absolute_zero","surface_form":"absolute zero","offset":137},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"Kelvin","offset":185},{"uri":"Degree_Celsius","surface_form":"degree units Celsius","offset":194},{"uri":"Rankine","surface_form":"Rankine","offset":221},{"uri":"Degree_Fahrenheit","surface_form":"degree units Fahrenheit","offset":231},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":364},{"uri":"Thermometer","surface_form":"thermometer","offset":470},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":509},{"uri":"Kinetic_energy","surface_form":"Kinetic energy","offset":547},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"International System of Units","offset":905}]}
