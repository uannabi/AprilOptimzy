{"id":194658,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Trust is a feeling that somebody or something can be relied upon, or will turn out to be good. It is the feeling of being sure about something, even if it cannot be proved.\nThere is also an adjective: trusting.\nIn religion, trust can be similar to faith. Someone who believes in God will put their trust in Him: the Book of Proverbs says: 'Trust in the LORD with all your heart' (3:5)\nGood or bad?\nTrusting does not necessarily mean that the person or thing that is trusted is good. Two criminals might be friends and they might trust one another, but what they trust one another to do is bad (although it might seem good to them).\nBeing trusting without thinking carefully about it might be dangerous. People can sometimes win someone\u2019s trust, but then they might break their trust.\nOpposites.\nThe opposite of \u201Ctrusting\u201D is \u201Cmistrust\u201D (\u201Cto have no trust in\u201D). This is similar to the word \u201Csuspicious\u201D.\nSomeone who is untrustworthy is someone who cannot be trusted.\nTo \u201Ctake something on trust\u201D means: to trust something without looking at it carefully.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":203},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":227},{"uri":"Faith","surface_form":"faith","offset":261},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":292},{"uri":"Book_of_Proverbs","surface_form":"Book of Proverbs","offset":329},{"uri":"YHWH","surface_form":"LORD","offset":366},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":500}]}
