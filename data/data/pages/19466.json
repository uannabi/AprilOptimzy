{"id":19466,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule","text":"A joule (or sometimes) is a unit in the SI system. It measures energy; usually in scientific or electrical appliances. It is named after James Prescott Joule.\nA joule refers to the amount of energy transferred to an object when a force of 1 newton is applied on it over a distance of 1 metre (1J = 1N \u00D7 1m). It is related to the watt (a unit of power): one watt equals one joule per second.\nIt can also be understood as the work done for passing one ampere of Electric current through an Electric circuit of external resistance equivalent to one ohm for one second.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Unit"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit","surface_form":"unit","offset":28},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":40},{"uri":"James_Prescott_Joule","surface_form":"James Prescott Joule","offset":137},{"uri":"Newton_(unit)","surface_form":"newton","offset":241},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":286},{"uri":"Watt","surface_form":"watt","offset":329},{"uri":"Power_(physics)","surface_form":"power","offset":345},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"Electric current","offset":460},{"uri":"Electric_circuit","surface_form":"Electric circuit","offset":488}]}
