It is the capital city of the Centre \"D\u00E9partement\".\nThe city is in the region called \"Plateau Central\" about northeast of Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has four \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): Hinche, Cerca-Cavajal (Krey\u00F2l: \"S\u00E8ka Kavajal\"), Ma\u00EFssade (Krey\u00F2l: \"Mayisad\") and Thomonde (Krey\u00F2l: \"Tomonn\").\nGeography.\nHinche is on the southern limit of the Plateau Central, a long valley between the \"Massif du Nord\", to the north, and the \"Montagne Noire\", to the south.\nThe city is on the right side of the River Guayamouc, a tributary of the River Artibonite.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1704 with families that came from the Canary Islands; it took the Ta\u00EDno name of the region: \"Hincha\". The French people changed the name to Hinche but in Spanish it is still Hincha. At that moment, the region was part of the Spanish colony of \"Santo Domingo\" (now the Dominican Republic).\nAfter the Haitian Revolution, in the early 19th century, this region became part of the new Republic of Haiti but the Dominican Republic accepted the transfer of the region to Haiti only in 1929.\nAttractions.\n\"Bassin Zim\", to the east of Hinche, is a beautiful 20 m waterfall, a 30-minute drive from town.\nIn the city you will also find the \"Cath\u00E9drale de Sacr\u00E9-Coeur\" (\"Sacred Heart Cathedral\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Haitian_Creole","surface_form":"Kr\u00E9y\u00F2l","offset":8},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":29},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":51},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":68},{"uri":"Centre_Department","surface_form":"Centre","offset":88},{"uri":"Departments_of_Haiti","surface_form":"D\u00E9partement","offset":96},{"uri":"Port-au-Prince","surface_form":"Port-au-Prince","offset":180},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":354},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":700},{"uri":"Artibonite_River","surface_form":"Artibonite","offset":723},{"uri":"Canary_Islands","surface_form":"Canary Islands","offset":806},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":834},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":874},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":922},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":1001}]}
