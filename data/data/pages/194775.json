{"id":194775,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile","text":"A projectile is something that is sent flying through the air, usually as a weapon. Any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile. For example, an arrow fired from a bow, a bullet, or even a rock from a slingshot are all projectiles.\nProjectile weapons have been used for a long time. Bows and slingshots are very old weapons that were used hundreds of years ago. Now most countries use projectile weapons instead of melee weapons like swords. This is because modern projectile weapons such as guns, rocket launchers, and artillery cannons can shoot at long ranges and are usually more deadly than melee weapons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":76},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrow","offset":175},{"uri":"Bow_(weapon)","surface_form":"bow","offset":194},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":201},{"uri":"Slingshot","surface_form":"slingshot","offset":231},{"uri":"Melee","surface_form":"melee","offset":445},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":522},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket launchers","offset":528},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":550},{"uri":"Long_range_shooting","surface_form":"long ranges","offset":581}]}
