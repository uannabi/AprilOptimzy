{"id":19483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma","text":"Blood plasma is the yellow liquid part of blood. In normal blood, the blood cells are suspended in the plasma.\nPlasma makes up about 55% of the total blood volume. It is mostly water (90% by volume) and contains dissolved proteins, glucose, clotting factors, mineral ions, hormones and carbon dioxide. Plasma is the transport medium for excretion.\nIn hospitals, blood plasma is prepared like this. An anti-coagulant stops the blood clotting. Then tubes of blood are spun very fast in a centrifuge. The blood cells go to the bottom of the tubes. The plasma is poured into another container.\nBlood serum is blood plasma without fibrinogen or the other clotting factors (that is, whole blood minus both the cells \"and\" the clotting factors).\nPlasmapheresis is a medical therapy which involves taking out blood plasma, treating it, and putting it back in the patient.\nStorage.\nWhole plasma may be stored frozen, or it may be stored dry. Dried plasma can be flown anywhere in the world, and is vital for the armed forces. The method was invented in the USA in 1940, and used widely in World War II. The Army/Navy standard pack was two tin cans, each with 400cc bottles inside. One held the plasma, the other distilled (pure) water. The plasma could be restored in three minutes, and remained fresh for about four hours.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":20},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":27},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":42},{"uri":"Blood_cell","surface_form":"blood cell","offset":70},{"uri":"Suspension","surface_form":"suspended","offset":86},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":156},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":222},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":232},{"uri":"Blood_clot","surface_form":"clotting factors","offset":241},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":259},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":267},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":273},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":286},{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"transport","offset":316},{"uri":"Excretion","surface_form":"excretion","offset":337},{"uri":"Coagulation","surface_form":"anti-coagulant","offset":401},{"uri":"Centrifuge","surface_form":"centrifuge","offset":486},{"uri":"Fibrinogen","surface_form":"fibrinogen","offset":626},{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":1003},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1080},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":1130}]}
