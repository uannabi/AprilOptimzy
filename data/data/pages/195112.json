{"id":195112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene","text":"e=\"preserve\">A cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen.\nUsually cutscenes tell part of the story, such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on. Sometimes, however, a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game, like a boss showing up, a ship taking off, or a building falling down.\nThere are many different types of cutscene. Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow. Others may be animated like a cartoon. Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine.\nMany new games use prerendered scenes, meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file. Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine, but some use Computer-generated imagery (CGI), which is separately made 3D graphics which are usually fancier than the game's normal graphics. Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game's intro video.\nA few games use live-action video footage, which is filmed like a movie or television show. Sometimes live-action footage will be used together with CGI.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":39},{"uri":"Boss_(video_game)","surface_form":"boss","offset":322},{"uri":"Slideshow","surface_form":"slideshow","offset":501},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":542},{"uri":"Game_engine","surface_form":"game engine","offset":598},{"uri":"Pre-rendering","surface_form":"prerendered","offset":630},{"uri":"Computer-generated_imagery","surface_form":"Computer-generated imagery","offset":838},{"uri":"Live-action","surface_form":"live-action","offset":1053}]}
