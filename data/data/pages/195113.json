{"id":195113,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","text":"The Thirteenth Amendment was an amendment to the United States Constitution, meaning that it was a change to the basic and most important laws that govern the United States. It abolished slavery in the United States. It was passed in December 6, 1865, at the end of the Civil War with only a handful of Democrats supporting the Amendment in both Chambers of Congress. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments. It repealed Article Four, Section 2, of the Constitution; the Fugitive Slave Clause.\nHistory.\nPrior to the Civil War, Constitution allowed slavery. However, many groups sought to end slavery in the United States. The groups became the Republican Party in 1856, and gained power in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln.\nIn 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves only in certain parts of the United States, and did not actually make slavery illegal.\nNear the end of the Civil War, Republicans, who controlled Congress, introduced an amendment to make slavery illegal (against the law) in every part of the United States. (In order for an amendment to happen, it first must be passed by both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, and then passed by three-quarters of the states' legislatures.) The amendment was passed by three-quarters of the states, and became law in late 1865.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amendment","surface_form":"amendment","offset":32},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":49},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":187},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":202},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":270},{"uri":"Reconstruction_Amendments","surface_form":"Reconstruction Amendments","offset":386},{"uri":"Repeal","surface_form":"repeal","offset":416},{"uri":"Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Article Four, Section 2, of the Constitution; the Fugitive Slave Clause","offset":425},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":520},{"uri":"Abolitionism","surface_form":"sought to end slavery","offset":582},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":648},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":720},{"uri":"Emancipation_Proclamation","surface_form":"Emancipation Proclamation","offset":765},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senate","offset":1143},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":1172}]}
