{"id":19514,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall","text":"\"Annie Hall\" is a 1977 American romantic comedy movie from United Artists. Woody Allen directed and stars in it. At first it was called \"Anhedonia\", then \"It Had To Be Jew\", but these titles would not sell the movie. \"Annie Hall\" has been considered a biography of Allen's real life, but the actor has denied this claim.\nPlot.\nThe movie takes place in New York City and the latter half in Los Angeles, California. It tells the story of Alvy Singer, a comedian from Brooklyn, who is obsessed with death. He has an affair with the title character, Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton) and the two embark on a romance. He encourages Annie to further her career as a nightclub singer.\nAlvy recalls how his Brooklyn house was below a roller coaster on Coney Island. His father was the owner of a place that had bumper cars, something that reflected the marriage between Alvy's father and Alvy's mother.\nThroughout the film, many flashbacks are included, often humourously; however, when Alvy recalls his times with Annie, the comedic mood turns nostalgic and Alvy is left wondering what could have happened differently if his insecurities were not in the way.\nAlvy asks Annie to marry him after they split. She tells him no, as she wants to stay friends.\nTechniques.\n\"Annie Hall\" is noted for its use of special elements such as double exposure (two pictures in one) and magic themes in a real setting.\nThere is an animated scene with a cartoon version of Allen, and the Witch from Disney's \"Snow White\".\nAcademy Awards.\nAllen was nominated for Best Actor.\nThe movie won one Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy (Diane Keaton). It was nominated for three more: Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Director (Woody Allen), and Best Actor in Musical or Comedy (Woody Allen). The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.\nRecognition.\nIt has been called one of the best comedy movies of all time. It has appeared on IMDb's Top 250 List, and was number thirty on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list. In 1992, it was selected to keep in the United States National Film Registry.\nInfluence.\nMany of today's romantic comedy movies have been influenced by \"Annie Hall\". The tie that was worn by Keaton's character was popular at the time of the movie's release.\nChristopher Walken, who would later become more famous, had a role as the title character's brother.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":23},{"uri":"Romantic_comedy","surface_form":"romantic comedy","offset":32},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":48},{"uri":"United_Artists","surface_form":"United Artists","offset":59},{"uri":"Woody_Allen","surface_form":"Woody Allen","offset":75},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":87},{"uri":"Anhedonia","surface_form":"Anhedonia","offset":137},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":168},{"uri":"Biography","surface_form":"biography","offset":252},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":352},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":389},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":402},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedian","offset":451},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":465},{"uri":"Diane_Keaton","surface_form":"Diane Keaton","offset":568},{"uri":"Roller_coaster","surface_form":"roller coaster","offset":728},{"uri":"Coney_Island","surface_form":"Coney Island","offset":746},{"uri":"Bumper_car","surface_form":"bumper car","offset":805},{"uri":"Double_exposure","surface_form":"double exposure","offset":1323},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":1409},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Pictures","surface_form":"Disney","offset":1476},{"uri":"Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs","surface_form":"Snow White","offset":1486},{"uri":"Golden_Globe","surface_form":"Golden Globe","offset":1569},{"uri":"Diane_Keaton","surface_form":"Diane Keaton","offset":1628},{"uri":"Woody_Allen","surface_form":"Woody Allen","offset":1732},{"uri":"Woody_Allen","surface_form":"Woody Allen","offset":1783},{"uri":"BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Film","surface_form":"BAFTA Award for Best Film","offset":1819},{"uri":"BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Screenplay","surface_form":"BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay","offset":1853},{"uri":"Internet_Movie_Database","surface_form":"IMDb","offset":1980},{"uri":"AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movies","surface_form":"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies","offset":2026},{"uri":"National_Film_Registry","surface_form":"National Film Registry","offset":2116},{"uri":"Tie","surface_form":"tie","offset":2232},{"uri":"Christopher_Walken","surface_form":"Christopher Walken","offset":2320},{"uri":"Brother","surface_form":"brother","offset":2412}]}
