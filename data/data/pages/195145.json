{"id":195145,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_vehicle","text":"An articulated vehicle is a vehicle which has a pivot joint. This allows the vehicle to turn more sharply.\nThere are many kinds of articulated vehicles: buses, trams and trains may be articulated. Steam locomotives were sometimes articulated so the driving wheels could pivot around turns. In fact, the whole idea of a train is an articulated set of vehicles which run along a track.\nAny vehicle towing a trailer could be described as articulated. The term (UK) of \"articulated lorry\" refers to the combination of a front part which pulls (the \"tractor\") and a rear part which follows (the \"trailor\"). In American English, these may be called semi-trailer trucks..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pivot","surface_form":"pivot","offset":48},{"uri":"Buses","surface_form":"buses","offset":153},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"tram","offset":160},{"uri":"Trains","surface_form":"trains","offset":170},{"uri":"Locomotive","surface_form":"Steam locomotives","offset":197},{"uri":"Semi-trailer_truck","surface_form":"semi-trailer truck","offset":643}]}
