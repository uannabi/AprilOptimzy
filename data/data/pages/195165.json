{"id":195165,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Sic\" is a Latin word meaning \"thus\", \"so\", \"as such\", or \"in such a manner\". In writing, it is put in square brackets and italic type \u2013 [\"sic\"] \u2013 to show that any incorrect or unusual spelling, phrases, punctuation, or other quoted material have been copied (word for word) from its original source.\nAt first, it was said like the English word \"seek\" (IPA /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word \"sick\" (/'s\u026Ak/).\nUsage.\nSometimes, \"sic\" is said to be an abbreviation for \"said in context\", \"spelled in context\", \"said in copy\", and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":24},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":94},{"uri":"Bracket","surface_form":"bracket","offset":123},{"uri":"Italic","surface_form":"italic type","offset":136},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":198},{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"phrases","offset":208},{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":217},{"uri":"IPA","surface_form":"IPA","offset":366},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":488}]}
