{"id":195174,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater","text":"Groundwater (or ground water) is water located below the ground surface. Groundwater starts as rain (or other precipitation), and flows under ground for long periods of time through aquifers. Groundwater flow returns to the surface again through springs and rivers. Groundwater is an important part of the water cycle.\nPeople bring groundwater to the surface by digging or drilling wells below the surface. They bring up water from the aquifer and use it for irrigation and other purposes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":33},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":95},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":110},{"uri":"Aquifer","surface_form":"aquifer","offset":182},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":246},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":258},{"uri":"Water_cycle","surface_form":"water cycle","offset":306},{"uri":"Well","surface_form":"well","offset":382}]}
