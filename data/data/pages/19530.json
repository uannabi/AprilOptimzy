{"id":19530,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician","text":"A politician (from Classical Greek \u03C0\u03CC\u03BB\u03B9\u03C2, \"polis\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues.\nSome politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. The word politician is sometimes replaced with the euphemism statesman. Basically, a \"politician\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.\nPoliticians have always used language, as in speeches or campaign advertisements. They use common themes to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters. Politicians become experts at using the media With the rise of mass media in the 19th century they made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters. The 20th century brought radio and television, and television commercials became the single most expensive part of an election campaign. In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with social media based on the Internet and smartphones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Classical Greek","offset":19},{"uri":"Polis","surface_form":"polis","offset":43},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"party","offset":73},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":79},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democratic","offset":145},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elective positions","offset":184},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":231},{"uri":"Resignation","surface_form":"resigned","offset":315},{"uri":"Bribery","surface_form":"bribery","offset":460},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":469},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":554},{"uri":"Euphemism","surface_form":"euphemism","offset":726},{"uri":"Statesman","surface_form":"statesman","offset":736},{"uri":"Political_power","surface_form":"political power","offset":808},{"uri":"Bureaucratic","surface_form":"bureaucratic","offset":831},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"advertisement","offset":923},{"uri":"Theme","surface_form":"theme","offset":955},{"uri":"Voter","surface_form":"voter","offset":1024},{"uri":"Expert","surface_form":"expert","offset":1051},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"mass media","offset":1095},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1113},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":1149},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":1161},{"uri":"Pamphlet","surface_form":"pamphlet","offset":1176},{"uri":"Poster","surface_form":"poster","offset":1198},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1211},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":1242},{"uri":"21st_century","surface_form":"21st century","offset":1351},{"uri":"Social_media","surface_form":"social media","offset":1409},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":1435},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":1448}]}
