{"id":19535,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsaturated_fat","text":"In cellular metabolism, an unsaturated fat molecule contains somewhat less energy (that is fewer calories) than the saturated fat molecule of the same length.\nExamples of unsaturated fats are palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, myristoleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid. Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado, nuts, and vegetable oils such as canola and olive oils. Meat products contain both saturated and unsaturated fats.\nHealth.\nUnsaturated fat is better for people than saturated fat. Some testing has shown that it can raise a person's HDL (\"good\" cholesterol) levels.\nUnsaturated fat is also very important for a healthy brain.\nPeople think that unsaturated fats are 'healthier' than saturated fats. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the amount of unsaturated fat consumed should not exceed 30% of one's daily caloric intake (or 67\u00A0grams given a 2000 Calorie diet). The new dietary guidelines have eliminated this recommendation at the request of the meat and dairy industries.\nMost foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fats. Food packages promote only one or the other, depending on which is the largest share in the product. So, various unsaturated fat vegetable oils, such as olive oils, also contain saturated fat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":12},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":75},{"uri":"Calorie","surface_form":"calorie","offset":97},{"uri":"Palmitoleic_acid","surface_form":"palmitoleic acid","offset":192},{"uri":"Oleic_acid","surface_form":"oleic acid","offset":210},{"uri":"Myristoleic_acid","surface_form":"myristoleic acid","offset":222},{"uri":"Linoleic_acid","surface_form":"linoleic acid","offset":240},{"uri":"Arachidonic_acid","surface_form":"arachidonic acid","offset":259},{"uri":"Avocado","surface_form":"avocado","offset":319},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":328},{"uri":"Vegetable_oil","surface_form":"vegetable oil","offset":338},{"uri":"Canola","surface_form":"canola","offset":361},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"olive oil","offset":372},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"Meat","offset":384},{"uri":"Saturated_fat","surface_form":"saturated fat","offset":493},{"uri":"High_density_lipoprotein","surface_form":"HDL","offset":560},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":572},{"uri":"Food_and_Drug_Administration","surface_form":"Food and Drug Administration","offset":743},{"uri":"Diet_(nutrition)","surface_form":"dietary","offset":935},{"uri":"Dairy_farming","surface_form":"dairy","offset":1021}]}
