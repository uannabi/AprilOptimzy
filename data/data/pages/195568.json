{"id":195568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees","text":"The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is an international agreement that defines who is a refugee. It lists the rights of people who are granted asylum (allowed to live in another country because it is not safe to live in their home country). It also lists the responsibilities of countries that give asylum to refugees.\nThe Convention also says which people are \"not\" seen as refugees, like war criminals.\nHistory.\nThe Convention was approved at a special United Nations conference on 28 July 1951. At first, it only talked about protecting European refugees after World War II. There were limits on how long the Convention would last, and who it protected.\nBut in 1967, a \"protocol\" (change) to the Convention took away these limits. This protocol made the Convention apply to all refugees.\nBecause the convention was approved in Geneva, it is often called \"the Geneva Convention.\" But it is not one of the more well-known Geneva Conventions that talk about what kind of behavior is allowed during wars.\nDenmark was the first state to ratify (agree to) the treaty, on 4 December 1952. Today, 147 countries have agreed to the Convention, the Protocol, or both.
