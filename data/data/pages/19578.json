{"id":19578,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_mass","text":"=\"preserve\">The Planck mass is a small unit of mass used in physics. It is derived using an equation involving Planck's constant, the speed of light in a vacuum, and the gravitational constant. It is approximately 21.76 \u03BCg, which is about the mass of a grain of rice.\nThe idea was to have a definition based only on fundamental universal constants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit","surface_form":"unit","offset":39},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":47},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":60},{"uri":"Planck%27s_constant","surface_form":"Planck's constant","offset":111},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":134},{"uri":"Gravitational_constant","surface_form":"gravitational constant","offset":170},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"\u03BCg","offset":220},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":291}]}
