{"id":195871,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Whitecaps_FC","text":"The Vancouver Whitecaps are a Canadian soccer team that plays in Major League Soccer in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nThe team plays their home games at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Other teams named \"Whitecaps\" have played Association football<nowiki/>in Vancouver since 1974 in the old North American Soccer League, the Canadian Soccer League, and the USL.\nHistory.\nThe original Vancouver Whitecaps were founded on December 11, 1973. During the 1970s and 1980s, they played in the North American Soccer League (NASL), a soccer league that no longer exists. The Whitecaps achieved success, winning the 1979 Soccer Bowl.\nIt was during this short time that soccer became popular in Vancouver. The Whitecaps crowds at Empire Stadium grew to sell out crowds, at 32,000 fans per match.\nAfter playing at Vancouver's 32,000-seat Empire Stadium for most of their early years, the team moved into the new 60,000-seat BC Place Stadium in 1983. However, the end of the NASL in 1984 meant the Whitecaps could not longer play in the NASL.\nWhitecaps did not play in 1985, but they joined the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) the next year and changed their name to the 86ers. They joined the United Soccer Leagues in 1990, and renamed themselves back to the Whitecaps and then to \"Vancouver Whitecaps FC\". For the next twenty years, they played in the second level of soccer in Canada, finally ending in 2010.\nNow they play in Major League Soccer, which they started playing in during 2011. On October 21, 2012, the Whitecaps became the first Canadian team to make it into the MLS Cup Playoffs. The team was eliminated in the knockout round by the LA Galaxy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":30},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":39},{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"Major League Soccer","offset":65},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":88},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":99},{"uri":"BC_Place","surface_form":"BC Place","offset":152},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"Association football","offset":235},{"uri":"North_American_Soccer_League","surface_form":"North American Soccer League","offset":299},{"uri":"Canadian_Soccer_League","surface_form":"Canadian Soccer League","offset":333},{"uri":"USL","surface_form":"USL","offset":365},{"uri":"North_American_Soccer_League","surface_form":"North American Soccer League","offset":494},{"uri":"Soccer_Bowl","surface_form":"Soccer Bowl","offset":619},{"uri":"Empire_Stadium%2C_Vancouver","surface_form":"Empire Stadium","offset":727},{"uri":"BC_Place_Stadium","surface_form":"BC Place Stadium","offset":920},{"uri":"Canadian_Soccer_League","surface_form":"Canadian Soccer League","offset":1090},{"uri":"United_Soccer_Leagues","surface_form":"United Soccer Leagues","offset":1186},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1372},{"uri":"LA_Galaxy","surface_form":"LA Galaxy","offset":1642}]}
