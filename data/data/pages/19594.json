{"id":19594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98","text":"Windows 98 is an operating system for computers. Released on June 25, 1998 by Microsoft, it is an updated version of Windows 95. It succeeded Windows NT 4.0 in NT, and Windows 95 in major versions. It preceded Windows 2000 in NT, and Windows Me in major versions.\nBecause Microsoft made Internet Explorer such an important part of Windows 98, the company was taken to court by the United States Government. This was because they felt it was unfair to other companies who made web browsers.\nIt is not supported anymore, but many people still use it on older computers that will not run Windows XP, Windows 7, or later versions of Windows.\nPress demonstration.\nBefore the release of Windows 98, there was a press demonstration at Comdex in April 1998. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). When presentation assistant Chris Capossela plugged a scanner in and attempted to install it, Windows 98 displayed a Blue Screen of Death. Gates remarked after applause and cheering from the audience, \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.\" Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.\nSecond Edition.\nWindows 98 Second Edition (SE) was released in 1999. This was an official upgrade to Windows 98 which allowed people to use more types of computer hardware, like monitors and printers, and also let more than one machine on a network use the same Internet connection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":17},{"uri":"June_25","surface_form":"June 25","offset":61},{"uri":"1998","surface_form":"1998","offset":70},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":78},{"uri":"Windows_95","surface_form":"Windows 95","offset":117},{"uri":"Windows_NT_4.0","surface_form":"Windows NT 4.0","offset":142},{"uri":"Windows_95","surface_form":"Windows 95","offset":168},{"uri":"Windows_2000","surface_form":"Windows 2000","offset":210},{"uri":"Windows_Me","surface_form":"Windows Me","offset":234},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":368},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":381},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"Government","offset":395},{"uri":"Windows_XP","surface_form":"Windows XP","offset":585},{"uri":"Windows_7","surface_form":"Windows 7","offset":597},{"uri":"Comdex","surface_form":"Comdex","offset":728},{"uri":"Bill_Gates","surface_form":"Bill Gates","offset":764},{"uri":"Legacy_Plug_and_Play","surface_form":"Plug and Play","offset":852},{"uri":"Image_scanner","surface_form":"scanner","offset":927},{"uri":"Blue_Screen_of_Death","surface_form":"Blue Screen of Death","offset":990},{"uri":"List_of_Internet_phenomena","surface_form":"Internet phenomenon","offset":1173},{"uri":"1999","surface_form":"1999","offset":1257},{"uri":"Computer_hardware","surface_form":"computer hardware","offset":1348},{"uri":"Computer_monitor","surface_form":"monitor","offset":1372},{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"printer","offset":1385},{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"network","offset":1435},{"uri":"Connection","surface_form":"connection","offset":1465}]}
