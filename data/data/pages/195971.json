It is also called sometimes \"Compostela de Azua\".\n\"Azua\" is the Ta\u00EDno name of the region where the old city was founded. In this place, Pedro Gallego (or Pedro Mariscal), a Spanish colonist, developed a farm and he gave it the name of \"Compostela\" after Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, nortwestern Spain.\nPopulation.\nThe municipality had, in 2010, a total population of 91,345: 46,280 men and 45,065 women. The urban population was of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality. The population of the city of Azua de Compostela without those municipal districts was 59,319.\nHistory.\nThe town was founded in 1504 by Diego Vel\u00E1zquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando. The town was in the original region of Azua, where there was a Ta\u00EDno town and Pedro Gallego had a farm. This place is called now \"Pueblo Viejo\" (in English, \"Old Town\"), at about 8\u00A0km to the soutwest of the modern city.\nThe first secretary of the town was Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s. He lived in Azua from 1504 to 1511, when he left to Cuba and, later, to conquest M\u00E9xico.\nSeveral sugar factories were established around the town and pirates came here to get the sugar and other products.\nIn 1751 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the old town and a new one was founded on the right (western) side of the River V\u00EDa, where the modern city is now.\nBecause Azua is on the road that goes from the western part of the island to Santo Domingo, the city was destroyed several times during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856). Two important battles (the \"Azua Battles\") were fought in the city; the first was on 19 March 1844 and the second on 1849.\nGeography.\nThe municipality of Azua de Compostela is in a very dry valley (the \"Azua Valley\" or \"Azua Plain\") where cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Farming is possible only with irrigation.\nThe territory around the city is very flat, with only a few very small hills but there are mountains in the north and northwest of the municipality; those mountains are part of the \"Cordillera Central\" mountain range. The only river in the municipality is the \"V\u00EDa\", a very small river that flows through the city.\nAzua de Compostela is at to the west of Santo Domingo. The limits of the municipality are Peralta to the north, Esteban\u00EDa to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, Pueblo Viejo to the southwest and Sabana Yegua to the west.\nClimate.\nAzua de Compostela has a subtropical steppe/semi-arid hot climate (K\u00F6ppen climate classification: BSh).\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is.
