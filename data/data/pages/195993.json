The name is properly used for the family Buccinidae, sometimes called the \"true whelks\".\nUse of the term.\nWhelk is a common name, and used for gastropods of various families.\nLife of a whelk.\nTrue whelks are carnivores and scavengers. They feed on clams, carrion, and sometimes even on detritus. Their sense of smell is very well-developed; they can sense chemical signals from their prey from a considerable distance. Many whelks can bore through the shell of bivalves. Because of this, they can cause harm in oyster farms. Whelks can even attack fish caught in a net by extending their probosces to twice the length of their own bodies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":30},{"uri":"Gastropod","surface_form":"gastropod","offset":37},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":67},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":81},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":338},{"uri":"Scavenger","surface_form":"scavenger","offset":353},{"uri":"Clam","surface_form":"clam","offset":378},{"uri":"Carrion","surface_form":"carrion","offset":385},{"uri":"Detritus","surface_form":"detritus","offset":416},{"uri":"Smell","surface_form":"smell","offset":441},{"uri":"Bivalves","surface_form":"bivalves","offset":591},{"uri":"Oyster","surface_form":"oyster","offset":641},{"uri":"Proboscis","surface_form":"probosces","offset":718}]}
