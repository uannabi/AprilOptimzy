{"id":19625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwish","text":"Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Finland. They formed in July 1996 and played acoustic mood music. The band's keyboardist and composer Tuomas Holopainen had the idea of forming a band. He asked Tarja Turunen to sing and Emppu Vuorinen to play guitar.\nAt the beginning of 1997, the band started playing stronger music. Jukka Nevalainen joined the band to play the drums. Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar. In May 1997, Nightwish signed a contract (binding agreement) with Spinefarm Records and they released their first album 'Angels Fall First'.\nIn 1998, Sami V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 joined the band to play bass guitar. The same year Nightwish released 'Oceanborn', which was quite different to\nIn May 2000 they released 'Wishmaster', which was similar to 'Oceanborn'. They also entered the contest to be Finland's representatives for the Eurovision Song Contest, with the song 'Sleepwalker'. They won the phone vote but the judges disagreed so they came second.\nThe other band members asked Tarja to leave the group in 2005 after their \"End of an Era\" tour. Tuomas wrote an open letter to her, stating the reasons why she had to leave. He then put the letter on the official website. In 2007, Swedish singer Anette Olzon became the new singer, and Nightwish released a single, 'Amaranth'. A few months later, they released the album 'Dark Passion Play'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Musical artist &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symphonic_metal_music","surface_form":"symphonic metal","offset":15},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":31},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":41},{"uri":"Acoustic","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":86},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":100},{"uri":"Keyboardist","surface_form":"keyboardist","offset":118},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":134},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"sing","offset":219},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":251},{"uri":"Drums","surface_form":"drums","offset":371},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":474},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":628},{"uri":"Eurovision_Song_Contest","surface_form":"Eurovision Song Contest","offset":860},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":933}]}
