{"id":196337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussycat_Dolls","text":"The Pussycat Dolls (sometimes called PCD) was an American pop-R&B girl group and dance group started by choreographer Robin Antin.\nThe group began in 1995 as a burlesque group based in Los Angeles, California. Antin was able to arrange a record deal with A&M Records and Interscope Records in 2003, and the Pussycat Dolls changed into a music group. By 2005 the group was lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, with Melody Thornton, Jessica Sutta, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Carmit Bachar. The group also went into reality television programs, a Las Vegas act, merchandising and other money making activities organized by Antin, Interscope, and their partners.\nThe Pussycat Dolls became famous around the world in 2005 with their album \"PCD\". It reached number five on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 Chart. The album included the hit singles \"Don't Cha\", \"Buttons\", and \"Stickwitu\"; a song that earned the group a Grammy Award nomination. After Carmit Bachar left the group in March 2008, the group continued as a quintet. They made their second album in 2008, \"Doll Domination\". This album included the singles \"When I Grow Up\", \"I Hate This Part\" and \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\". The group has been criticized for being too sexual in their image and dances. Some people have said they use lead singer Nicole Scherzinger too often; she sings nearly all of the group's lead and background vocals.\nMembers.\nRobin Antin Founder","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":58},{"uri":"Girl_group","surface_form":"girl group","offset":66},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":81},{"uri":"Choreographer","surface_form":"choreographer","offset":104},{"uri":"Robin_Antin","surface_form":"Robin Antin","offset":118},{"uri":"Burlesque","surface_form":"burlesque","offset":160},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":185},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":198},{"uri":"A%26amp%3BM_Records","surface_form":"A&M Records","offset":255},{"uri":"Interscope_Records","surface_form":"Interscope Records","offset":271},{"uri":"Music_group","surface_form":"music group","offset":337},{"uri":"Nicole_Scherzinger","surface_form":"Nicole Scherzinger","offset":384},{"uri":"Melody_Thornton","surface_form":"Melody Thornton","offset":409},{"uri":"Jessica_Sutta","surface_form":"Jessica Sutta","offset":426},{"uri":"Ashley_Roberts","surface_form":"Ashley Roberts","offset":441},{"uri":"Kimberly_Wyatt","surface_form":"Kimberly Wyatt","offset":457},{"uri":"Carmit_Bachar","surface_form":"Carmit Bachar","offset":476},{"uri":"Reality_television","surface_form":"reality television","offset":516},{"uri":"Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada","surface_form":"Las Vegas","offset":547},{"uri":"Album_(music)","surface_form":"album","offset":731},{"uri":"PCD_(album)","surface_form":"PCD","offset":738},{"uri":"Billboard_Magazine","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":780},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"200 Chart","offset":791},{"uri":"Don%27t_Cha","surface_form":"Don't Cha","offset":838},{"uri":"Buttons_(song)","surface_form":"Buttons","offset":851},{"uri":"Stickwitu","surface_form":"Stickwitu","offset":866},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":909},{"uri":"Carmit_Bachar","surface_form":"Carmit Bachar","offset":940},{"uri":"Quintet","surface_form":"quintet","offset":1009},{"uri":"Doll_Domination","surface_form":"Doll Domination","offset":1057},{"uri":"When_I_Grow_Up","surface_form":"When I Grow Up","offset":1108},{"uri":"I_Hate_This_Part","surface_form":"I Hate This Part","offset":1126},{"uri":"Jai_Ho%21_(You_Are_My_Destiny)","surface_form":"Jai Ho!
