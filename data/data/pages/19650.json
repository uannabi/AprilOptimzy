{"id":19650,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbert_Dollfuss","text":"Engelbert Dollfuss (\"German\": Dollfu\u00DF) (October 4, 1892 \u2013 July 25, 1934) was the Chancellor of Austria from 1932 until 1933. He led the country as a dictator from early 1933 until 1934.\nHe studied law in Vienna, and Economics in Berlin. During World War I, he served in the Alps and briefly became a Prisoner of War in 1918.\nHe became Chancellor on May 20, 1932 as head of a right-wing coalition government. He wanted to solve the problems caused by the Depression. He had problems finding majorities in parliament. The measures he liked to take to deal with inflation were not well liked. In March 1933, he suspended the Austrian parliament. He then governed by decree.\nWith Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in Germany, Dollfuss feared that the influence of the NSDAP would grow. This would then lead to a growth in popularity for its Austrian counterpart. Because of this, he banned the NSDAP in June 1933. He also banned the SDAP\u00D6 in February 1934.\nIn September 1933 he formed an umbrella grouping to support the regime, the \"Vaterl\u00E4ndische Front\" (Fatherland Front) and merged the Christian Social Party with the para-military Heimwehr (Home Guard), a Nationalist paramilitary group. The regime which was put into power by him and remained in power until 1938 is often called \"Austrofascism\". The form of state he employed was called the \"St\u00E4ndestaat\".\nOn July 25, 1934, eight Austrian Nazis entered the Chancellery building and shot and killed Dollfuss in an attempted coup, as a prelude to Anschluss. The Nazis surrendered and were executed. Kurt Schuschnigg became the new dictator of Austria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chancellor","surface_form":"Chancellor","offset":81},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":95},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":136},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":149},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":197},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":204},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"Economics","offset":216},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":229},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":244},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":274},{"uri":"Prisoner_of_War","surface_form":"Prisoner of War","offset":300},{"uri":"May_20","surface_form":"May 20","offset":349},{"uri":"1932","surface_form":"1932","offset":357},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":375},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":396},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Depression","offset":454},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":504},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":559},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":676},{"uri":"Chancellor","surface_form":"Chancellor","offset":692},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":706},{"uri":"Nationalsozialistische_Deutsche_Arbeiterpartei","surface_form":"NSDAP","offset":757},{"uri":"Sozialdemokarische_Arbeiterpartei_Osterreichs","surface_form":"SDAP\u00D6","offset":922},{"uri":"Umbrella_group","surface_form":"umbrella group","offset":977},{"uri":"Regime","surface_form":"regime","offset":1010},{"uri":"Christian_Social_Party","surface_form":"Christian Social Party","offset":1079},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1116},{"uri":"Heimwehr","surface_form":"Heimwehr","offset":1125},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"Nationalist","offset":1150},{"uri":"1938","surface_form":"1938","offset":1253},{"uri":"Austrofascism","surface_form":"Austrofascism","offset":1275},{"uri":"St%C3%A4ndestaat","surface_form":"St\u00E4ndestaat","offset":1337},{"uri":"July_25","surface_form":"July 25","offset":1354},{"uri":"1934","surface_form":"1934","offset":1363},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":1384},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":1414},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"shot","offset":1427},{"uri":"Kill","surface_form":"kill","offset":1436},{"uri":"Coup_d%27etat","surface_form":"coup","offset":1468},{"uri":"Anschluss","surface_form":"Anschluss","offset":1490},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"executed","offset":1532},{"uri":"Kurt_Schuschnigg","surface_form":"Kurt Schuschnigg","offset":1542}]}
