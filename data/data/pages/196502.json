{"id":196502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pascal's Wager (or Pascal's Gambit) is the name for an idea that Blaise Pascal had. He said that it is not possible to prove or disprove that God exists. Therefore, it is better to bet that God exists. If God existed, and the person believed in God, he would be rewarded (with happiness forever); if the person did not believe, he would be punished (with what is called \"eternal damnation\"). If God did not exist it would make no difference. For this reason, it would be better to believe in God, Pascal said. Indeed, Pascal strongly believed in this ideal.\n1. You may live a religious and moral life and be rewarded by eternal happiness.\n2. You may live a pleasure-seeking life and be denied eternal happiness.\n3. You may live a holy life but there is actually no God or eternal life.\n4. You may live a pleasure-seeking life but it makes no difference because there is no God.\nFor Pascal, the first of these options is the most important one because it represents the maximum gain and loss. Even if it should turn out that there is no God, the sheer risk of deciding against such a possibility warrants that we should take that option.\nThe case against Pascal's Wager.\nThe argument from inconsistent revelations shows we have no idea which hell to avoid since many different religions exist with different beliefs about hell. Within religions there are different denominations and sects with different ideas about heaven and hell. If we try to avoid the hell that Christians believe in we are at risk from the hell Muslims believe. So it goes on. Perhaps god does not like people who accept Pascal's Wager but god may not mind that atheists doubt. Atheists and believers could both be in trouble or neither could be in trouble.\nFurther three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam claim worshiping other gods is sinful. We have no proof that any particular deity is real and can easily choose the wrong god. Therefore we are safer worshiping a god or gods that are less exclusive and will not punish us for making the wrong choice.\nImportance in history.\nPierre de Fermat and Pascal created probability theory. Pascal's Wager was very important for the time, because it did new things with probability theory. It is also one of the first tries to use the concept of infinity, and the first use of decision theory. It was important for other philosophers who developed the ideas of pragmatism and voluntarism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":68},{"uri":"Blaise_Pascal","surface_form":"Blaise Pascal","offset":78},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":155},{"uri":"Bet","surface_form":"bet","offset":194},{"uri":"Happiness","surface_form":"happiness","offset":290},{"uri":"Argument_from_inconsistent_revelations","surface_form":"argument from inconsistent revelations","offset":1187},{"uri":"Denomination","surface_form":"denomination","offset":1377},{"uri":"Sect","surface_form":"sect","offset":1395},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":1529},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religion","offset":1756},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":1777},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":1786},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1803},{"uri":"Polytheism","surface_form":"gods","offset":1979},{"uri":"Pierre_de_Fermat","surface_form":"Pierre de Fermat","offset":2083},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":2218},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":2283},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":2294},{"uri":"Decision_theory","surface_form":"decision theory","offset":2325},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophers","offset":2369},{"uri":"Pragmatism","surface_form":"pragmatism","offset":2409},{"uri":"Voluntarism_(metaphysics)","surface_form":"voluntarism","offset":2424}]}
