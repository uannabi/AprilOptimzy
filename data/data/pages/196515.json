{"id":196515,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pig is a jeopardy (risk) dice game played with one die. In jeopardy dice games, a player decides to \"roll\" or \"hold\" (stop rolling). A player that rolls risks a turn total, and may gain a higher turn total or score nothing. A player that holds scores the turn total.\nJohn Scarne wrote about Pig as a common dice game in 1945. Optimal (perfect) play has been computed.\nTeachers often use Pig for fun lessons.\nRules.\nThe first player to score 100 or more points wins.\nExample Play.\nFor example, Ann begins a turn with a roll of 5. She could hold and score 5 points, but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 2. She could hold with a turn total of 7 points (2 + 5 = 7), but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 1 (\"pig\"). She must end her turn. Her score does not change. She hands the dice to the next player, Bob.\nBob rolls a 4, 5, 3, 5, and 5. He then decides to hold. Bob adds 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 22 points to his score.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dice","surface_form":"dice","offset":38},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":43},{"uri":"Dice","surface_form":"die","offset":64},{"uri":"Dice","surface_form":"dice","offset":81},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":86}]}
