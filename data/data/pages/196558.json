{"id":196558,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebephilia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hebephilia is when adults are mostly or only sexually attracted to people from early puberty until their mid-teenage years (generally between 11 and 14 years).\nAdults with this attraction are called \"hebephiles\" or \"hebophiles.\" The word \"hebephilia\" comes from Greek: \"Hebe\" is the Greek goddess of youth, and \"philia\" means \"love\". These days, many media reports cover hebephilic acts between female teachers and young students.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_attraction","surface_form":"sexually attracted","offset":58},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":98},{"uri":"Adolescence","surface_form":"mid-teenage years","offset":118},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":275},{"uri":"Hebe","surface_form":"Hebe","offset":283},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":302}]}
