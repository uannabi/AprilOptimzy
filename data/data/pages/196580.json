{"id":196580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephebophilia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ephebophilia is when an adult is mostly or only sexually attracted to post-pubescent teenagers\u2014usually those in the age range 15\u201319. Adults with this attraction are called \"ephebophiles\". Ephebophilia is not just the sexual attraction to teenage partners but is when an adult prefers such sexual partners.\nSpecific words are used by scientists for chronophilias, which is when people are mostly or only sexually attracted to specific age groups. Along with \"ephebophilia\", another example is \"hebephilia\", which means that a person is mostly or only sexually attracted to younger pubescent people. The word \"pedophilia\" means that a person is mostly or only sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children; but the term \"pedophilia\" is commonly misused to refer to any sexual interest in minors under the age of 18, even if they're post-pubescent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_attraction","surface_form":"sexually attracted","offset":61},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"pubescent","offset":88},{"uri":"Hebephilia","surface_form":"hebephilia","offset":506},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"pubescent","offset":593},{"uri":"Pedophilia","surface_form":"pedophilia","offset":621},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"pubescent","offset":697},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":707},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"pubescent","offset":847}]}
