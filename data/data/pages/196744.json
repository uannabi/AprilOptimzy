{"id":196744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Your_House","text":"In Your House was a pay-per-view (PPV) series made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\nThe original idea was in months where the WWF was not producing a major PPV event (WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble which ran for three hours) they would produce a two hour PPV event for a lower price of $19.95.\nWhen World Championship Wrestling (WCW) started producing three hour PPV's on a monthly basis, the WWF was forced to drop the concept.\nThe events were numbered numerically (example: In Your House #1, #2) until In Your House #7 where specific subtitles were added which usually referred to the main event, starting with In Your House #7: Good Friends, Better Enemies (refers to the Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel match).\nGradually the subtitles became \"In Your House\" (example: Unforgiven: In Your House). Current PPV's No Way Out, Backlash, Judgment Day and Unforgiven all came from the In Your House series.\nIn Your House dates and venues.\n__NOTOC__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":20},{"uri":"World_Wrestling_Entertainment","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":58},{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":175},{"uri":"King_of_the_Ring","surface_form":"King of the Ring","offset":189},{"uri":"SummerSlam","surface_form":"SummerSlam","offset":207},{"uri":"Survivor_Series","surface_form":"Survivor Series","offset":219},{"uri":"Royal_Rumble","surface_form":"Royal Rumble","offset":240},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"$","offset":341},{"uri":"World_Championship_Wrestling","surface_form":"World Championship Wrestling","offset":354},{"uri":"Shawn_Michaels","surface_form":"Shawn Michaels","offset":730},{"uri":"Kevin_Nash","surface_form":"Diesel","offset":749},{"uri":"WWE_No_Way_Out","surface_form":"No Way Out","offset":863},{"uri":"WWE_Backlash","surface_form":"Backlash","offset":875},{"uri":"WWE_Judgment_Day","surface_form":"Judgment Day","offset":885},{"uri":"WWE_Unforgiven","surface_form":"Unforgiven","offset":902}]}
