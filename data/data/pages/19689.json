{"id":19689,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy_and_the_Sundance_Kid","text":"\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is a 1969 American movie from 20th Century Fox. George Roy Hill directed it, and John Foreman produced it. It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as two robbers in Wyoming who go to Bolivia to escape the law.\nThe movie was loosely based on the real story of the two title characters (Butch Cassidy and his friend Harry Longabaugh, also called \"Sundance\"). But it made the legends of the two more popular.\nIt won four Academy Awards: for Best Cinematography (shooting work on a movie), Best Original Score, Best Song (Burt Bacharach's \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\") and Best Original Screenplay (William Goldman). It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Hill) and Best Sound. Goldman won the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.\nIt was one of the largest-grossing movies of the 1960s (with $102.3 million in the United States). It was number fifty on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.\nAt first, Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen (even Marlon Brando) were called upon to play the title roles. When Newman and Redford took their place, the roles were switched, with Newman as Sundance, and Redford as Cassidy. The studio, 20th Century Fox, did not like Redford's role. But the movie's director, Hill, wanted it that way.\nAs a result, Redford has said that the movie made him a more famous actor.\nThe Sundance Film Festival is named after Redford's role, as well his Utah ski resort.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":47},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":56},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox","surface_form":"20th Century Fox","offset":67},{"uri":"Paul_Newman","surface_form":"Paul Newman","offset":153},{"uri":"Robert_Redford","surface_form":"Robert Redford","offset":169},{"uri":"Robber","surface_form":"robber","offset":191},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":202},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":220},{"uri":"Butch_Cassidy","surface_form":"Butch Cassidy","offset":322},{"uri":"Harry_Longabaugh","surface_form":"Harry Longabaugh","offset":351},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":455},{"uri":"Burt_Bacharach","surface_form":"Burt Bacharach","offset":555},{"uri":"William_Goldman","surface_form":"William Goldman","offset":639},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"Sound","offset":727},{"uri":"BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Screenplay","surface_form":"BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay","offset":750},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":832},{"uri":"AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movies","surface_form":"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies","offset":905},{"uri":"Warren_Beatty","surface_form":"Warren Beatty","offset":951},{"uri":"Steve_McQueen","surface_form":"Steve McQueen","offset":969},{"uri":"Marlon_Brando","surface_form":"Marlon Brando","offset":989},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox","surface_form":"20th Century Fox","offset":1174},{"uri":"Sundance_Film_Festival","surface_form":"Sundance Film Festival","offset":1352},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":1418},{"uri":"Ski","surface_form":"ski","offset":1423},{"uri":"Resort","surface_form":"resort","offset":1427}]}
