{"id":196924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder","text":"A personality disorder or character disorder is a type of disorder where a person thinks, feels and behaves differently from how society expects them to. Where these traits would be flexible in most people, these traits are rigid and unworkable in someone with a personality disorder and create lasting patterns and often lasting problems. These thoughts, feelings and behaviours can cause problems for the person, and for other people around them. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries, personality disorders are classed as a kind of mental disorder and are treated by medical professionals. About ten percent of adults have PDs.\nTypes.\nIn the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\", a book about mental illness written by the American Psychiatric Association, there are ten personality disorders. They are split into three \"clusters\" or groups.\nCluster A.\nCluster A disorders are more common in men.\nCluster B.\nAll Cluster B disorders are comorbid with each other. There are things that are in more than one PD. For example, selfishness and lack of empathy are major parts of ASPD and NPD. Needing to be admired is a major part of HPD and NPD.\nICD.\nThe World Health Organization has a different way of describing personality disorders. It makes use of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disorder","surface_form":"disorder","offset":58},{"uri":"Behavior","surface_form":"behaves","offset":100},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":129},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":456},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":475},{"uri":"Mental_disorder","surface_form":"mental disorder","offset":564},{"uri":"Percent","surface_form":"percent","offset":632},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":643},{"uri":"Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","surface_form":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","offset":675},{"uri":"American_Psychiatric_Association","surface_form":"American Psychiatric Association","offset":774},{"uri":"Cluster","surface_form":"cluster","offset":872},{"uri":"Group","surface_form":"group","offset":885},{"uri":"Comorbid","surface_form":"comorbid","offset":987},{"uri":"Selfish","surface_form":"selfish","offset":1073},{"uri":"Empathy","surface_form":"empathy","offset":1097},{"uri":"Admire","surface_form":"admired","offset":1152},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":1201},{"uri":"ICD","surface_form":"ICD","offset":1386}]}
