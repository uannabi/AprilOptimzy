{"id":1970,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate","text":"Climate means the usual condition of the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and other meteorological elements in an area of the Earth's surface for a long time. In simple terms climate is the average condition for about thirty years. \"Climate and weather are different\". Weather is the day to day conditions in the atmosphere. The types of climates are: Tropical, dry, Temperate, Polar, Mediterranean.\nThe latitude, ground, and height can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the K\u00F6ppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir K\u00F6ppen. The Thornthwaite system, which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too. This makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from.\nClimates can change after a long time. Nowadays people are making the world warmer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":41},{"uri":"Humidity","surface_form":"humidity","offset":54},{"uri":"Atmospheric_pressure","surface_form":"atmospheric pressure","offset":64},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":86},{"uri":"Rainfall","surface_form":"rainfall","offset":92},{"uri":"Meteorology","surface_form":"meteorological","offset":112},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"elements","offset":127},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":154},{"uri":"Tropical_climate","surface_form":"Tropical","offset":380},{"uri":"Desert_climate","surface_form":"dry","offset":390},{"uri":"Temperate_zone","surface_form":"Temperate","offset":395},{"uri":"Polar_climate","surface_form":"Polar","offset":406},{"uri":"Mediterranean_climate","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":413},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":432},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":622},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":638},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":699},{"uri":"Evapotranspiration","surface_form":"evapotranspiration","offset":873},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"kinds of animal species","offset":950},{"uri":"Spatial_Synoptic_Classification_system","surface_form":"Spatial Synoptic Classification system","offset":1063},{"uri":"Air_mass","surface_form":"air mass","offset":1127},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"Climates can change","offset":1174},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"people are making the world warmer","offset":1222}]}
