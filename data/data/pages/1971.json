{"id":1971,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(geology)","text":"Rock often deforms in such a way that it bends instead of breaking. This is called a fold. The term fold is used in geology when one or a stack of originally flat, level surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of pressure and high temperature. The basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics.\nWhen two forces act towards each other from opposite sides, rock layers are bent into \"folds\". The process by which folds are formed due to compression is known as folding. Folding is one of the endogenetic processes; it takes place within the Earth's crust.\nFolds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes, on a variety of scales. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a \"fold belt\", a common feature of orogenic zones.\nThere are large-scale and small-scale folds. Large-scale folds are found mainly along a collision boundary between two tectonic plates.\nStructure of a fold.\nThe upfold is called an anticline. The downfold is called a syncline.\nThe imaginary line joining the highest points along the upfold is called the crest line.\nThe flanks of a fold are known as the limbs.\nThe central line from which the rock strata dip away in opposing directions is called the axis of fold.\nAccording to the degree of folding of the layers, folds can be classified into five main types.\nFormation of a fold mountain.\nLarge depressions called geosynclines form between plates. Seas filled the geosynclines and rivers flowing into them carried sediments (sand and silt) which build up on the sea bed.\nOver millions of years the sediments were compressed, by their own weight, into sedimentary rocks, e.g. sandstone, limestone etc.\nLandforms formed by folding.\nLarge-scale folding will develop parallel ranges of round-top mountains along destructive plate boundaries. These mountains are known as fold mountains.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":116},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":188},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":200},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":242},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":320},{"uri":"Compression","surface_form":"compression","offset":477},{"uri":"Endogenetic_process","surface_form":"endogenetic process","offset":532},{"uri":"Crust_(geology)","surface_form":"crust","offset":589},{"uri":"Orogeny","surface_form":"orogenic zones","offset":878},{"uri":"Collision_boundary","surface_form":"collision boundary","offset":982},{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":1013},{"uri":"Flanks","surface_form":"flanks","offset":1214},{"uri":"Fold_mountain","surface_form":"fold mountain","offset":1963}]}
