{"id":197127,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society","text":"The Flat Earth Society (or the International Flat Earth Research Society) is an organization claiming that the Earth is flat (most of us think it is round; a sphere). It was started by Samuel Shenton in 1956. Charles K. Johnson was the leader and made his home the organization's base. The Flat Earth Society is thought to have \"disbanded\" (stopped existing) after Johnson's death in 2001, but some websites still use the organization's name.\nSome people say NASA proved that the Earth is not flat by taking pictures of the planet from space. Others say the round Earth was proven long before NASA existed. The Society says the pictures are fake, and that NASA is a part of a conspiracy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":80},{"uri":"Flat_Earth","surface_form":"Earth is flat","offset":111},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":158},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":459},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":508},{"uri":"Conspiracy","surface_form":"conspiracy","offset":676}]}
