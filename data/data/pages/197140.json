It starred Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia who also was the film's producer. It based on the true story of 5 Australian news reporters working for Australian TV during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. They were murdered by the Indonesian army in the small village of Balibo.\nThe Indonesian National Armed Forces did not want the movie shown in Indonesia, with a spokesman saying the movie could harm Indonesia's relations with East Timor and Australia.\nThe movie was finally forbidden in Indonesia by the Film Censorship Agency. Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said the ban was to avoid a negative image of Indonesia. The Indonesian National Armed Forces supports the ban, with a spokesman saying the official version of the event is that the journalists were killed in a crossfire, and not murdered by Indonesian troops.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian","surface_form":"Australian","offset":15},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":26},{"uri":"Anthony_LaPaglia","surface_form":"Anthony LaPaglia","offset":110},{"uri":"Reporter","surface_form":"reporter","offset":209},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":256},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":267},{"uri":"East_Timor","surface_form":"East Timor","offset":279},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":309},{"uri":"Balibo%2C_East_Timor","surface_form":"Balibo","offset":365}]}
