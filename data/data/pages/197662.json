{"id":197662,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster","text":"A star cluster is a group of stars. They are held together by mutual gravitation. They are related by common origin, and have similar or identical ages.\nIn contrast, constellations and asterisms are just line-of-sight visual groups as seen from the Earth.\nStar clusters visible to the naked eye include the Pleiades, Hyades, and 47 Tucanae.\nSuper star clusters.\nSuper star clusters of very young large stars are known. They are thought to be precursors of globular clusters. The short-lived huge blue stars emit lots of UV radiation which ionises the surrounding gas. Examples are Westerlund 1 and 2 in the Milky Way, and R136 in the Larger Magellanic Cloud.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":29},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravitation","offset":69},{"uri":"Constellations","surface_form":"constellations","offset":166},{"uri":"Asterism","surface_form":"asterism","offset":185},{"uri":"Pleiades","surface_form":"Pleiades","offset":307},{"uri":"Hyades","surface_form":"Hyades","offset":317},{"uri":"47_Tucanae","surface_form":"47 Tucanae","offset":329},{"uri":"Globular_cluster","surface_form":"globular cluster","offset":456},{"uri":"UV","surface_form":"UV","offset":520},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":523},{"uri":"Ionisation","surface_form":"ionises","offset":539},{"uri":"Westerlund_1","surface_form":"Westerlund 1","offset":581},{"uri":"Westerlund_2","surface_form":"2","offset":598},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":607},{"uri":"R136","surface_form":"R136","offset":622},{"uri":"Larger_Magellanic_Cloud","surface_form":"Larger Magellanic Cloud","offset":634}]}
