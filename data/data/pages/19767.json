{"id":19767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa","text":"Lufthansa is the largest airline in Germany, and the second-largest in Europe. Some of Lufthansa's hubs are Frankfurt am Main and Munich, Germany. A hub is an airport where people who fly from one city to a second city can transfer or change airplanes.\nLufthansa buys airplanes from Boeing and Airbus. Lufthansa has big airplanes for flights to North America, Asia, and Africa. These flights are called long-haul flights because they are between cities that are far apart from each other. Lufthansa also has small airplanes for flights in Europe. These flights are called short-haul flights.\nLufthansa is a member of the Star Alliance, which means it is a partner with other airlines like United Airlines and Air Canada. Members of the Star Alliance cooperate or work together to schedule their flights better so that travelling is easier for passengers or people.\nThe name of Lufthansa's frequent flyer program is Miles and More. People earn points for flights they travel on. When they have enough points, they can get a free flight. Lufthansa has \"Miles and More\" to encourage people to fly with Lufthansa.\nMany regional flights are operated Lufthansa Regional with Lufthansa CityLine, Eurowings and Air Dolomiti.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":25},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":36},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":71},{"uri":"Airline_hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":99},{"uri":"Frankfurt_am_Main","surface_form":"Frankfurt am Main","offset":108},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":130},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":159},{"uri":"Transfer","surface_form":"transfer","offset":223},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":283},{"uri":"Airbus","surface_form":"Airbus","offset":294},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":345},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":360},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":370},{"uri":"Long-haul","surface_form":"long-haul","offset":403},{"uri":"Short-haul","surface_form":"short-haul","offset":572},{"uri":"Member","surface_form":"member","offset":607},{"uri":"Star_Alliance","surface_form":"Star Alliance","offset":621},{"uri":"United_Airlines","surface_form":"United Airlines","offset":689},{"uri":"Air_Canada","surface_form":"Air Canada","offset":709},{"uri":"Cooperate","surface_form":"cooperate","offset":750},{"uri":"Schedule","surface_form":"schedule","offset":780},{"uri":"Frequent_flyer","surface_form":"frequent flyer","offset":889},{"uri":"Miles_and_More","surface_form":"Miles and More","offset":915},{"uri":"Encourage","surface_form":"encourage","offset":1070}]}
