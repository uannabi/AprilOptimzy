Their name comes from their unusual equipment onboard \"Doctor\", and the color that they are painted in \"Yellow\". The color scheme was made from reversing the color scheme (blue with a yellow stripe) used on test trains on non-high speed lines into yellow with a blue stripe.\nThe trains can go as fast as normal shinkansen trains, up to 270\u00A0km/h on the T\u014Dkaid\u014D Shinkansen).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":29},{"uri":"Shinkansen","surface_form":"Shinkansen","offset":85},{"uri":"Train_line","surface_form":"train line","offset":107},{"uri":"T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Shinkansen","surface_form":"T\u014Dkaid\u014D Shinkansen","offset":561}]}
