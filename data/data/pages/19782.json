{"id":19782,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon","text":"Neon is a noble gas. It is chemical element 10 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Ne.\nThe word \"neon\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"new\". It was discovered by William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers in 1898.\nNeon does not react with other elements, so it is found by itself. There is not much neon in the air, and it is clear, so we do not see it.\nNeon gas is used in gas discharge lamps. When electricity goes through the neon, it lights up red. Due to this quality, it is used in signs. Similar signs use other gases to make other colors, but they are also often called \"neon signs\".\nNeon is also a term referring to a type of color that is very bright, such as lime green.\nNo true chemical compounds including the neutral compounds of neon are known. Where there is the helium compound HHeF, which might be stable, the analogous compound with Neon is not.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Noble_gas","surface_form":"noble gas","offset":10},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":27},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":54},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":309},{"uri":"Gas_discharge_lamp","surface_form":"gas discharge lamp","offset":372},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":398},{"uri":"Lime_green","surface_form":"lime green","offset":668},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":688},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":777}]}
