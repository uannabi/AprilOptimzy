{"id":19788,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas","text":"All of these gases are found in air. They make up around 0.96% of the atmosphere. Noble gas compounds can be formed from noble gases.\nOganesson (element 118) is probably the next noble gas after Radon because it is the next box down in the same group. However it has a half life of 0.89 ms, after which it decays to Livermorium (Element 116). This means its use is probably limited.\nNoble gases were discovered by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay. Rayleigh won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1904 for his work on noble gas. Ramsay won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 for his work with noble gas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":32},{"uri":"Noble_gas_compound","surface_form":"Noble gas compound","offset":82},{"uri":"Oganesson","surface_form":"Oganesson","offset":134},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half life","offset":269},{"uri":"Decay","surface_form":"decay","offset":306},{"uri":"Livermorium","surface_form":"Livermorium","offset":316},{"uri":"John_Strutt","surface_form":"Lord Rayleigh","offset":414},{"uri":"William_Ramsay","surface_form":"William Ramsay","offset":436},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":469},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":542}]}
