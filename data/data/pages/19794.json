{"id":19794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmium","text":"Osmium is a chemical element. It is element number 76 on the periodic table. Its symbol is \"Os\".\nThere is not much osmium on earth. There is actually such a small amount that osmium is very expensive.\nOsmium is a metal and it does not react very much, and such a metal is known as a \"noble metal\".\nOsmium is the densest (heaviest for the same amount) element on the periodic table.\nIt was discovered in 1804 by Smithson Tennant in London, England. He found it together with Iridium in a bit of Platinum, which he had dissolved in Aqua regia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":12},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":61},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":213},{"uri":"Noble_metal","surface_form":"noble metal","offset":284},{"uri":"Smithson_Tennant","surface_form":"Smithson Tennant","offset":411},{"uri":"Iridium","surface_form":"Iridium","offset":474},{"uri":"Platinum","surface_form":"Platinum","offset":494},{"uri":"Aqua_regia","surface_form":"Aqua regia","offset":530}]}
