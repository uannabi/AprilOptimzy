{"id":19798,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet","text":"Ethernet is a way of connecting computers together in a local area network or LAN. It has been the most widely used method of linking computers together in LANs since the 1990s. The basic idea of its design is that multiple computers have access to it and can send data at any time. This is comparatively easy to engineer.\nIf two computers send data at the same time, a collision will occur. When this happens, the data sent is not usable. In general, both computers will stop sending, and wait a random amount of time, before they try again. A special protocol was developed to deal with such problems. It is called Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection or CSMA/CD.\nDifferent cable types.\nThere are different Ethernet standards. Today, Ethernet cables look like thick telephone cables. They connect to boxes called hubs or switches. Each cable runs from a computer's network interface card (NIC) to such a box. This cable is called 10BaseT or 100BaseT, or 1000BaseT Cable.\nToday, the cables for 10BaseT, 100BaseT, and 1000BaseT are the same. Their transmission medium is unshielded twisted pair for Category 5 (UTP-Cat5) or 5e. Shielded cable (STP-Cat5 or Cat5e) can be used when there is a lot of electrical noise, and Category 6 (UTP-Cat6 or STP-Cat6) works better with faster signals such as 1GBit or 10GBit.\nDifferent devices.\nOther devices, such as video game console<nowiki/>s, can also be connected using the same kind of cabling. Certain computer peripherals, for example printers and certain hard disks can be directly connected to the network with such cables.\nDifferent speeds.\nEthernet can go at different speeds. In the beginning, Ethernet was at 10 MBits per second. The Ethernet most often used today is at 100 MBits per second. Most new computers now have the NIC built in, and can go at 1GBit per second. There are also standards for 1GBit per second and 10 GBit per second. 100 MBit can usually talk to 10 MBit, and 1 GBit can talk to 100 MBit and usually to 10 MBit (both full and half duplex).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Local_area_network","surface_form":"local area network","offset":56},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":171},{"uri":"Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection","surface_form":"Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection","offset":617},{"uri":"Ethernet_hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":833},{"uri":"Ethernet_switch","surface_form":"switch","offset":841},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":874},{"uri":"Network_interface_card","surface_form":"network interface card","offset":885},{"uri":"Transmission_medium","surface_form":"transmission medium","offset":1066},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game console","offset":1372},{"uri":"Computer_peripheral","surface_form":"computer peripheral","offset":1464},{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"printers","offset":1498},{"uri":"Hard_disk","surface_form":"hard disk","offset":1519}]}
