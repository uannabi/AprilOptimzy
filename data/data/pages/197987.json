The tea was named after Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, a British prime minister from the 1830s.\nThe name \"Earl Grey\" only used to be given to black tea, but now the name is used for other teas that have oil of bergamot, or a bergamot flavour. Twinings, a British tea company, uses a portrait of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey on its Earl Grey package.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":27},{"uri":"Bergamot_orange","surface_form":"bergamot","offset":76},{"uri":"Orange_(fruit)","surface_form":"orange","offset":85},{"uri":"Citrus_fruit","surface_form":"citrus fruit","offset":95},{"uri":"Charles_Grey%2C_2nd_Earl_Grey","surface_form":"Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey","offset":133},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":164},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":172},{"uri":"Black_tea","surface_form":"black tea","offset":249},{"uri":"Twinings","surface_form":"Twinings","offset":350},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":390}]}
