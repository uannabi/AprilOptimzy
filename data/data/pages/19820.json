{"id":19820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit","text":"=\"preserve\">Profit is how much money somebody (normally a company) makes. This is found by subtracting how much money they have spent (\"expenditure\") from how much money they have brought in (revenue).\nAn example.\nIf John spends $15 on some ice cream cones, and then sells them for $20, he has made a profit of $5. This is because he made $20 but when the $15 he used to buy the ice cream cones is subtracted, what is left is $5. In the end, he has $5 more than he had before he bought and sold the ice cream cones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":58},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtracting","offset":91},{"uri":"Revenue","surface_form":"revenue","offset":192},{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":241}]}
