Harrow has educated boys since 1243 but was officially founded by John Lyon under a Royal Charter of Elizabeth I in 1572. Harrow is located in Harrow on the Hill, now in the London Borough of Harrow. The school has about 800 students. They live across twelve boarding houses, and all of them board full time.\nHarrow is an independent fee-paying school, of the type known in Britain as \"public schools\". The equivalent term in the US would probably be \"private schools\" (see discussion at public school). The annual fees at Harrow are at present \u00A333,285 per year, which includes board, tuition and textbooks.\nThe Harrow Foundation also runs an independent Grammar School in Harrow, called the John Lyon School, and several international schools. The John Lyon School is also fee-paying and academically selective.\nIn 2013 66% of pupils got 5 A*-C GCSE grades including English and Maths. 14.1% of students go to Cambridge or Oxford.\nIn 2013 a TV series called Harrow: a Very British School started. It follows boys and staff of West Acre of the West Acre boarding house for a year\nFamous men who went to Harrow include Benedict Cumberbatch, eight prime ministers (seven UK and the first Prime Minister of India), Lord Byron, James Blunt, C. W. Alcock, and John Amery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":60},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Harrow","surface_form":"Harrow","offset":79},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":89},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":97},{"uri":"Elizabeth_I","surface_form":"Elizabeth I","offset":207},{"uri":"Harrow_on_the_Hill","surface_form":"Harrow on the Hill","offset":249},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Harrow","surface_form":"London Borough of Harrow","offset":280},{"uri":"Public_school","surface_form":"public school","offset":594},{"uri":"Grammar_School","surface_form":"Grammar School","offset":761},{"uri":"John_Lyon_School","surface_form":"John Lyon School","offset":798},{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":1017},{"uri":"Oxford_University","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":1030},{"uri":"Benedict_Cumberbatch","surface_form":"Benedict Cumberbatch","offset":1224},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1310},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"Lord Byron","offset":1318},{"uri":"James_Blunt","surface_form":"James Blunt","offset":1330},{"uri":"C._W._Alcock","surface_form":"C.
