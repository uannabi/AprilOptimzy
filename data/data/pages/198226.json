{"id":198226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">The mass number (symbol: A) of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus. The mass number is different for each isotope of a chemical element.\nWe write a mass number after an element's name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. We write it as carbon-12 or 12C.\nThe difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons (\"N\") in a given nucleus: \"N \"= \"A \"\u2212 \"Z\".\nThe mass number is not shown on the periodic table. For each element, what is shown is the \"standard atomic weight\" and the \"atomic number\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":47},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":80},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":106},{"uri":"Atomic_nucleus","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":122},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":169},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":182},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":343},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":582}]}
