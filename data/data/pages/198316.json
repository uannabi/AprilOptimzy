{"id":198316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Paul","text":"Wolfgang Paul (born in Lorenzkirch, Germany 1913 - Bonn 1993) was a German professor awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989.\nBiography.\nPaul was born on August 10 of 1913 in the German city of Lorenzkirch, Saxony. When he was young, his family moved to Munich, where his father taught pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of Munich. In 1932, he began his studies of physics at the Superior School in Munich, and soon moved to the 1934 at the headquarters of Berlin, getting his doctorate in 1939.\nIn 1944, he began his teaching at the University of G\u00F6ttingen and 1952 was hired at the University of Bonn as director of its Institute of Experimental Physics, a position he kept until his death.\nWolfgang Paul died December 7 of 1993 at his residence in Bonn.\nScientific research.\nDuring WWII he investigated the separation of isotopes, which is necessary to produce material to make nuclear fission for use in nuclear weapons.\nHe started his research into ions, developing the so-called ion trap.\nFor this discovery, in 1989 he was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with Hans G. Dehmelt.\nBetween 1965 and 1967, he was appointed Director of the Division of Nuclear Physics at CERN.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lorenzkirch","surface_form":"Lorenzkirch","offset":23},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":36},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":51},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":97},{"uri":"Lorenzkirch","surface_form":"Lorenzkirch","offset":197},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":210},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":257},{"uri":"Pharmaceutical","surface_form":"pharmaceutical","offset":289},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":304},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":376},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":468},{"uri":"University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen","surface_form":"University of G\u00F6ttingen","offset":545},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":609},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":762},{"uri":"WWII","surface_form":"WWII","offset":796},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":835},{"uri":"Nuclear_fission","surface_form":"nuclear fission","offset":892},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapons","surface_form":"nuclear weapons","offset":919},{"uri":"Ions","surface_form":"ions","offset":965},{"uri":"Ion_trap","surface_form":"ion trap","offset":996},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":1061},{"uri":"Hans_G._Dehmelt","surface_form":"Hans G.
