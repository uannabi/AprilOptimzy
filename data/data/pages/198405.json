The team plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00E9rie B and the Campeonato Baiano.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on May 13, 1899, by the brothers Artur and Art\u00EAmio Valente, along with seventeen other young fellows. On the start, the Vit\u00F3ria was a cricket club, named Club de Cricket Victoria, because all of them lived at the Vit\u00F3ria neighborhood, in Salvador.\nIn 1902, Victory started to have football as a sport, as well as athletics, swimming and rowing. Still in that year, the club changed its name to Sport Club Vict\u00F3ria, as cricket was no longer the only sport practiced, and changed its colors to red and black at the suggestion of Mr. Cesar Godinho Sp\u00EDnola, who came from Rio de Janeiro, who proposed creation of the nautical section in the club.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazilian","offset":61},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":71},{"uri":"Salvador%2C_Bahia","surface_form":"Salvador","offset":90},{"uri":"Bahia","surface_form":"Bahia","offset":102},{"uri":"Campeonato_Brasileiro_S%C3%A9rie_B","surface_form":"Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00E9rie B","offset":156},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":377},{"uri":"Athletics_(sport)","surface_form":"athletics","offset":556},{"uri":"Swimming","surface_form":"swimming","offset":567},{"uri":"Rowing","surface_form":"rowing","offset":580},{"uri":"Rio_de_Janeiro","surface_form":"Rio de Janeiro","offset":811}]}
