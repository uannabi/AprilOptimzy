{"id":1986,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket","text":"A basket is a container. It is usually light.\nBasket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a basket, such as bark, willow rods, leaves, wire, plastic, paper, and rope. There are three basic kinds of baskets\u2014coiled, twined, or woven. A woven basket is made of spokes and weavers: the spokes run up and down and the weavers go over and under the spokes. A coiled basket is made by sewing rings of a fibrous material to the previous ring. Twined baskets have flexible weavers that are twined around the spokes in a variety of patterns.\nBasketmaking is so old that it features in myths from various cultures. Baskets are used to carry babies, plants, fruit, cotton, and Easter eggs. Coroners once used a basket coffin to collect bodies, thus the expression \"a basket case\" which meant the person was dead.\nIn basketball, the basket is an open net fixed to a metal ring in which players try to throw the ball.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"container","offset":14},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":816},{"uri":"Net","surface_form":"net","offset":850}]}
