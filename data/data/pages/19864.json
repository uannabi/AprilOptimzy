{"id":19864,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee","text":"\"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", known in Japan as is a video game where players can choose from many people from famous Nintendo games and have them fight each other. Players can fight alone or team up with someone else against a friend. This game is a sequel to \"Super Smash Bros.\" for the Nintendo 64. \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" is for the Nintendo GameCube. The subsequent game is \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" for the Wii.\nCharacters.\n\"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" takes 26 characters from many of Nintendo's series. It includes all 12 veteran characters from \"Super Smash Bros. 64\", and adds 14 new characters, including Princess Peach and Bowser from the \"Super Mario Bros.\" series, Princess Zelda/Sheik and Ganondorf from \"The Legend of Zelda\", and new characters like Ice Climbers from \"Ice Climber\" and Marth from \"Fire Emblem\". Some characters seem to play more like other characters who were in the first game, like Ganondorf compared to Captain Falcon.\nSakurai planned to include more characters, including Diddy Kong, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Balloon Fighter, Solid Snake, and Lucas, but did not have time to fit them in. All of them except for Balloon Fighter made it into \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\".\nItems.\nItems from different games can fall from the sky, like Pok\u00E9 Balls from \"Pok\u00E9mon\" or Mushrooms from \"Mario\". These items can be used in different ways. For example, Pok\u00E9 Balls can summon Pok\u00E9mon, and Mushrooms can either grow the person whom touches it, unless it is a Poison Mushroom which makes them shrink.\nStages.\n\"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" has many stages that players can battle on. Most of the stages are based on Nintendo series like \"Mario\", \"Pok\u00E9mon\", and \"The Legend of Zelda\".\nTournament Play.\n\"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" has become very popular in tournaments. These tournaments do not use items or most stages, believing that these make the game unfair. In tournaments, however, a lot of characters are not strong enough to win. Some of the best characters for tournaments are Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi, and Jigglypuff.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":36},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":50},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":115},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros.","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.","offset":259},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":286},{"uri":"GameCube","surface_form":"Nintendo GameCube","offset":336},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.
