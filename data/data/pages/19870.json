{"id":19870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaliland","text":"Somaliland (; ', '), officially the Republic of Somaliland (, \"Jumh\u016Br\u012Byat \u1E62\u016Bm\u0101l\u012Bl\u0101nd\"), is an unrecognized state, which the international community considers part of Somalia. The territory covers the former protectorate British Somaliland. De facto, the territory is independent from the rest of Somalia. It borders Djibouti to the west, the Federal Republic of Ethiopia to the south and Somalia to the east.\nThe area used to be the Somali area which was part of the British empire along with Jubaland, which was called Trans-juba. It was called the British Somali Coast Protectorate before 26 June 1960. That year it united with Somalia called the \"Somali Republic\". In May of 1991, after a war, Somaliland regained independence.\nCurrently, Somaliland is an unrecognized state. This means that no country with membership in the United Nations or international organization views Somaliland as an independent country. Instead, they see Somaliland as a part of Somalia.\nSomaliland has a republican government with free elections. The capital is Hargeisa. Berbera is a beautiful city on the coast. About 55% of the people of Somalilands are nomads. Most Somalis are Sunni Muslims. Some people are part of Sufi orders.\nA territory in the west, called Khatumo State has been disputed between Somaliland and Puntland.\nLanguage.\nMost people in Somaliland speak Somali and Arabic. Article 6 of the Constitution of 2001 says the official language of Somaliland is Somali, but Arabic is a mandatory subject in school. English is also spoken and taught in schools.\nThe main Somali dialect is Standard Somali. Standard Somali is spoken in most of Somalia and in countries that border it. Standard Somali is used by almost all of the media in the Somaliland region.\nReligion.\nAlmost all Somalilanders are Muslims. This is because Islam is the state religion, and practicing a religion other than Islam is against the law. Small amounts of non-Islamic traditions exist in Somaliland, but Islam is very important to the Somali sense of national identity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unrecognized_state","surface_form":"unrecognized state","offset":94},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":166},{"uri":"Protectorate","surface_form":"protectorate","offset":207},{"uri":"British_Somaliland","surface_form":"British Somaliland","offset":220},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":308},{"uri":"Djibouti","surface_form":"Djibouti","offset":316},{"uri":"Federal_Republic_of_Ethiopia","surface_form":"Federal Republic of Ethiopia","offset":342},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":388},{"uri":"Jubaland","surface_form":"Jubaland","offset":493},{"uri":"Trans-juba","surface_form":"Trans-juba","offset":520},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":678},{"uri":"Unrecognized_state","surface_form":"unrecognized state","offset":759},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":829},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":847},{"uri":"Hargeisa","surface_form":"Hargeisa","offset":1044},{"uri":"Nomads","surface_form":"nomads","offset":1139},{"uri":"Sunni_Islam","surface_form":"Sunni","offset":1164},{"uri":"Muslims","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":1170},{"uri":"Sufism","surface_form":"Sufi","offset":1203},{"uri":"Khatumo_State","surface_form":"Khatumo State","offset":1248},{"uri":"Puntland","surface_form":"Puntland","offset":1303},{"uri":"Mandatory","surface_form":"mandatory","offset":1480},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1509},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1571},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":1793},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1818},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":1939}]}
