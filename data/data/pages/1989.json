{"id":1989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America","text":"South America is the continent to the south of North America. These two continents are separated by the Panama Canal.\nSouth America is attached to Central America at the boundary of Panama. Geographically all of Panama \u2013 including the part east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus \u2013 is usually included in North America alone, among the countries of Central America.\nNatural resources.\nThe soil in Argentina's Pampas is among the best in the world. Brazil's soil is very good for growing coffee. A great number of minerals have been found. Few, however, have been mined. Among those that were mined are iron, manganese, gold, and gemstones. The tropical forests are rich in valuable trees, like mahogany, ebony, and rubber. Oil is also a resource in some places.\nWildlife.\nSouth America is home to a large variety of animal life. These include animals such as jaguars, macaws, monkeys, anacondas, llamas, piranhas, toucans, tapirs, cougars, condors and chinchillas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":21},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":47},{"uri":"Panama_Canal","surface_form":"Panama Canal","offset":104},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":147},{"uri":"Boundary","surface_form":"boundary","offset":170},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"Geographically","offset":190},{"uri":"Panama_Canal","surface_form":"Panama Canal","offset":252},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":389},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":397},{"uri":"Pampas","surface_form":"Pampas","offset":409},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":487},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":513},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":602},{"uri":"Manganese","surface_form":"manganese","offset":608},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":619},{"uri":"Gemstone","surface_form":"gemstone","offset":629},{"uri":"Mahogany","surface_form":"mahogany","offset":694},{"uri":"Ebony_(tree)","surface_form":"ebony","offset":704},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":715},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"Oil","offset":723},{"uri":"Jaguar","surface_form":"jaguar","offset":859},{"uri":"Macaw","surface_form":"macaw","offset":868},{"uri":"Monkey","surface_form":"monkey","offset":876},{"uri":"Anaconda","surface_form":"anaconda","offset":885},{"uri":"Llama","surface_form":"llama","offset":896},{"uri":"Piranha","surface_form":"piranha","offset":904},{"uri":"Toucan","surface_form":"toucan","offset":914},{"uri":"Tapir","surface_form":"tapir","offset":923},{"uri":"Cougar","surface_form":"cougar","offset":931},{"uri":"Condor","surface_form":"condor","offset":940},{"uri":"Chinchilla","surface_form":"chinchilla","offset":952}]}
