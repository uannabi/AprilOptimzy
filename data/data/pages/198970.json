He conquered and governed the island of Jamaica for Spain.\nHe was born in Seville, Spain, about 1480. He came with Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando to America, to the Hispaniola island, in 1502. In 1503, Ovando sent him with 400 men to the eastern part of the island to fight the Ta\u00EDnos in that region, the Hig\u00FCey region. There he founded two new towns: \"Santa Cruz de Hicayagua\", or \"Icayagua\", the present city of Santa Cruz del Seibo; and \"Salvale\u00F3n de Hig\u00FCey\".\nIn 1509, the new Governor of the Hispaniola, Diego Columbus, sent Juan de Esquivel with 70 men to Jamaica to complete the conquest of that island. He founded a town, \"Sevilla La Nueva\" (in English, \"The New Seville\") on the north coast.\nHe died in Jamaica about 1513.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":49},{"uri":"Conquistador","surface_form":"Conquistador","offset":96},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":142},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":152},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":164},{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":186},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":195},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Ovando","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando","offset":227},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"America","offset":248},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":264},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":377},{"uri":"Santa_Cruz_del_Seibo","surface_form":"Santa Cruz del Seibo","offset":513},{"uri":"Salvale%C3%B3n_de_Hig%C3%BCey","surface_form":"Salvale\u00F3n de Hig\u00FCey","offset":540},{"uri":"Diego_Columbus","surface_form":"Diego Columbus","offset":607},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":751}]}
