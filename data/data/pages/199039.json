{"id":199039,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps","text":"Craps is a game that uses dice. It is a game of chance. Players make bets on the outcome of the roll. Players can bet other players or the casino. Players may wage money against each other (playing \"street craps\") or a bank (playing \"casino craps\", also known as \"table craps\", or often just \"craps\"). Because it requires little equipment, \"street craps\" can be played in informal settings. It is also very popular in the internet to play.\nGame Process.\nThe Boxman - is the one who\u2019s in charge of the Craps table. He\u2019s not only watching over the chips but also taking care of any issues that may arise during a game. Usually, he\u2019s wearing a suit and tie, and his place is in the center of the table at one side, near the chips.\nThe Stickman - is in charge of the center of the layout and uses a stick to move the dice. His place is on the opposite side of the table from the Boxman. The stick is needed because dealers never touch the dice, so the Stickman has to be able to reach them wherever they land. He\u2019s also announcing each roll of the dice and passes them to the shooter when all payoffs are done.\nThe Dealers - are the ones who take care of the layouts, one layout per dealer. There are two dealers at the table and one on a break, and they stand at the sides of the Boxman. Their duty is to correctly pay all bets at their side of the table and exchange chips for cash.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dice","surface_form":"dice","offset":26},{"uri":"Chance","surface_form":"chance","offset":48},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"bets","offset":69},{"uri":"Casino","surface_form":"casino","offset":139}]}
