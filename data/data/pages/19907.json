{"id":19907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass","text":"Grass is a monocotyledon plant, herbaceous plants with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in a lawn and other places. Grass normally gets water from the roots, which are located in the ground.\nThe grasses include the \"grass\", of the family Poaceae (also called Gramineae), as well as the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae). These three families are not closely related but belong to different clades in the order Poales.\nThe true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.\nMany grasses are short, but some grasses, like bamboo can grow very tall. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places, even if they are very cold or very dry. Several other plants that look similar but are not members of the grass family are also sometimes called grass; these include rushes, reeds, papyrus, and water chestnut.\nGrasses are an important food for many animals, like deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows. Without grass, dirt can wash away into rivers (erosion).\nEvolution of grass.\nGraminoids include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing grass phytoliths (silica stones inside grass leaves). Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are now the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for many animals.\nGrass and people.\nLawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building. Sometimes chemicals and water is used to help lawns to grow.\nPeople have used grasses for a long time. People eat parts of grasses. Corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice and millet are cereals, common grains whose seeds are used for food and to make alcohol such as beer.\nSugar comes from sugar cane, which is also a plant in the grass family. People have grown grasses as food for farm animals for about 4000 years. People use bamboo to build houses, fences, furniture and other things. Grass plants can also be used as fuel, to cover roofs, and to weave baskets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monocotyledon","surface_form":"monocotyledon","offset":11},{"uri":"Herbaceous_plant","surface_form":"herbaceous","offset":32},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":43},{"uri":"Lawn","surface_form":"lawn","offset":148},{"uri":"Poaceae","surface_form":"Poaceae","offset":293},{"uri":"Gramineae","surface_form":"Gramineae","offset":314},{"uri":"Sedges","surface_form":"sedges","offset":341},{"uri":"Cyperaceae","surface_form":"Cyperaceae","offset":349},{"uri":"Rushes","surface_form":"rushes","offset":369},{"uri":"Juncaceae","surface_form":"Juncaceae","offset":377},{"uri":"Clades","surface_form":"clades","offset":458},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":472},{"uri":"Poales","surface_form":"Poales","offset":478},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":511},{"uri":"Bamboo","surface_form":"bamboo","offset":520},{"uri":"Lawn","surface_form":"lawn","offset":546},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":563},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":602},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":611},{"uri":"Sprouting","surface_form":"sprouted grain","offset":618},{"uri":"Shoot","surface_form":"shoot","offset":634},{"uri":"Rhizome","surface_form":"rhizome","offset":644},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":662},{"uri":"Whisky","surface_form":"whisky","offset":668},{"uri":"Pasture","surface_form":"pasture","offset":677},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"livestock","offset":689},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":718},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":725},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":731},{"uri":"Thermal_insulation","surface_form":"insulation","offset":741},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":753},{"uri":"Basket","surface_form":"basket","offset":780},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"weaving","offset":787},{"uri":"Bamboo","surface_form":"bamboo","offset":859},{"uri":"Juncaceae","surface_form":"rush","offset":1106},{"uri":"Reed_(plant)","surface_form":"reeds","offset":1114},{"uri":"Papyrus","surface_form":"papyrus","offset":1121},{"uri":"Water_chestnut","surface_form":"water chestnut","offset":1134},{"uri":"Animals","surface_form":"animals","offset":1189},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":1203},{"uri":"Buffalo","surface_form":"buffalo","offset":1209},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":1218},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":1226},{"uri":"Grasshopper","surface_form":"grasshopper","offset":1232},{"uri":"Caterpillar","surface_form":"caterpillar","offset":1246},{"uri":"Grazer","surface_form":"grazer","offset":1275},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":1457},{"uri":"Life-form","surface_form":"life-form","offset":1539},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":1596},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1619},{"uri":"Phytolith","surface_form":"phytolith","offset":1679},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":1691},{"uri":"Rain_forest","surface_form":"rain forest","offset":1770},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1788},{"uri":"Intertidal","surface_form":"intertidal","offset":1821},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":1832},{"uri":"Sports","surface_form":"sports","offset":1999},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":2038},{"uri":"Chemicals","surface_form":"chemicals","offset":2058},{"uri":"Corn","surface_form":"Corn","offset":2180},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":2186},{"uri":"Barley","surface_form":"barley","offset":2193},{"uri":"Oats","surface_form":"oats","offset":2201},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":2207},{"uri":"Millet","surface_form":"millet","offset":2216},{"uri":"Cereals","surface_form":"cereals","offset":2227},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":2292},{"uri":"Sugar_cane","surface_form":"sugar cane","offset":2331},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"farm animal","offset":2424},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":2563},{"uri":"Roof","surface_form":"roof","offset":2578},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"weave","offset":2592},{"uri":"Basket","surface_form":"basket","offset":2598}]}
