{"id":199184,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali","text":"Ab\u016B \u1E24\u0101mid Mu\u1E25ammad ibn Mu\u1E25ammad al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012B (1058-1111) (), often Algazel in English, was born and died in Tus, in the Khorasan province of Persia. He was an Islamic theologian, jurist, philosopher, cosmologist, psychologist and mystic of Persian origin, and remains one of the most celebrated scholars in the history of Sunni Islamic thought.\nHe is considered to be a pioneer of the methods of doubt and skepticism, and in one of his major works, \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\", he changed the course of early Islamic philosophy. He changed the early Islamic philosophy away from an Islamic metaphysics influenced by ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. The new way was towards an Islamic philosophy based on cause-and-effect that was determined by God or intermediate angels, a theory now known as occasionalism.\nGhazali has sometimes been celebrated in both the East and the West as the greatest Muslim after Muhammad.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":76},{"uri":"Tus","surface_form":"Tus","offset":106},{"uri":"Greater_Khorasan","surface_form":"Khorasan","offset":118},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":139},{"uri":"Islamic","surface_form":"Islamic","offset":157},{"uri":"Theologian","surface_form":"theologian","offset":165},{"uri":"Fiqh","surface_form":"jurist","offset":177},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":185},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"cosmologist","offset":198},{"uri":"Psychologist","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":211},{"uri":"Sufism","surface_form":"mystic","offset":228},{"uri":"Persian_people","surface_form":"Persian","offset":238},{"uri":"Celebrated","surface_form":"celebrated","offset":282},{"uri":"Sunni","surface_form":"Sunni","offset":320},{"uri":"Pioneer","surface_form":"pioneer","offset":368},{"uri":"Method","surface_form":"method","offset":383},{"uri":"Doubt","surface_form":"doubt","offset":394},{"uri":"Skepticism","surface_form":"skepticism","offset":404},{"uri":"The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers","surface_form":"The Incoherence of the Philosophers","offset":448},{"uri":"Early_Islamic_philosophy","surface_form":"early Islamic philosophy","offset":511},{"uri":"Islamic_metaphysics","surface_form":"Islamic metaphysics","offset":590},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":610},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":624},{"uri":"Hellenistic_philosophy","surface_form":"Hellenistic philosophy","offset":642},{"uri":"Islamic_philosophy","surface_form":"Islamic philosophy","offset":693},{"uri":"Causality","surface_form":"cause-and-effect","offset":721},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":761},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":781},{"uri":"Occasionalism","surface_form":"occasionalism","offset":811},{"uri":"Celebrated","surface_form":"celebrated","offset":853},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":923}]}
