{"id":199195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Girl Scouts of the USA is a not-for-profit organization that is a branch of the Scouting movement, similar to the Boy Scouts of America, except it is for girls. It was founded in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low and first was called the Girl Guides of America, after the Girl Guides in the United Kingdom. Girl Scouts do many activities, which they often earn patches or \"merit badges\" for. They are best known for selling Girl Scout cookies every year to raise money.\nThere are also adult members of Girl Scouts who volunteer and help the organization. Adult members might be college students who became too old to be Girl Scouts, or they might be older adults. Both men and women are allowed to be adult members and volunteer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nonprofit","surface_form":"not-for-profit","offset":45},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":60},{"uri":"Scouting_movement","surface_form":"Scouting movement","offset":97},{"uri":"Boy_Scouts_of_America","surface_form":"Boy Scouts of America","offset":131},{"uri":"1912","surface_form":"1912","offset":196},{"uri":"Juliette_Gordon_Low","surface_form":"Juliette Gordon Low","offset":204},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":302},{"uri":"Merit_badge","surface_form":"merit badge","offset":384},{"uri":"Girl_Scout_cookie","surface_form":"Girl Scout cookie","offset":435},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":474},{"uri":"Volunteer","surface_form":"volunteer","offset":529},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":589}]}
