Many beds also have bed sheets to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads. A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric people used naturally material, such as piles of straw or leaves, to sleep on. Beds similar to ones used today were probably invented before the 4th millennium BC. Mattresses stuffed with feathers were first used in Ancient Rome.\nTypes of beds.\nThere are several kinds of bed in use today. Several terms refer to the size of the mattress. Some kinds are usually temporary, such as camp cots, air mattresses, and hammocks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Furniture","surface_form":"furniture","offset":20},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":42},{"uri":"Mattress","surface_form":"mattress","offset":75},{"uri":"Bed_frame","surface_form":"bed frame","offset":89},{"uri":"Bed_sheet","surface_form":"bed sheet","offset":120},{"uri":"Hammock","surface_form":"hammock","offset":761}]}
