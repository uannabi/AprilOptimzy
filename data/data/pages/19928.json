{"id":19928,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce","text":"In cooking, a sauce is a liquid mixture added to another food for flavour. Sauces are not normally eaten by themselves; they add flavour, moisture, and visual appeal to another dish. Sauces are an essential element in cuisines all over the world.\nThe main sauces of French cuisine are built on a basis of roux, which is just flour and the liquid part of butter. Examples from Italian cuisine are the egg, cheese and ham sauce called \"Carbonara\"; the ground meat sauce called \"bolognese\", and the herbs and garlic sauce called \"pesto\".\nBottled sauces can be poured over food when it is served. An example would be the tomato-based sauce that is usually poured over spaghetti. Gravy is a brown sauce served with meat.\n\"Sauce\" is a French word taken from the Latin \"salsus\", meaning \"salted\". Possibly the oldest sauce recorded is \"garum\", the fish sauce used by the Romans.\nSauces need a liquid component, but some sauces (for example, pico de gallo salsa or chutney) may contain more solid elements than liquid.\nSauces may be used for savoury dishes or for desserts. They can be prepared and served cold, like mayonnaise, prepared cold but served lukewarm like pesto, or can be cooked like bechamel and served warm or again cooked and served cold like apple sauce.\nSome sauces are commercial products like Worcestershire sauce, HP sauce, soy sauce or ketchup. In French cuisine they are freshly prepared by the chef. Sauces for salads are called salad dressing. A cook who specializes in making sauces is a saucier.\nFrench cuisine.\nSauces in French cuisine date back to the Middle Ages. There were hundreds of sauces in the culinary repertoire, and were a major defining characteristic of French cooking of the 19th and 20th centuries, until nouvelle cuisine.\nA sauce which is based on one of the mother sauces is sometimes called a small sauce, minor sauce, or secondary sauce. Most sauces commonly used in classical cuisine are small sauces, or derivatives of one of the above-mentioned mother sauces.\nMother sauces are not commonly served as they are; instead they are augmented with additional ingredients to make small (derivative) sauces. For example, Bechamel can be made into Mornay by the addition of Gruy\u00E8re or any cheese one may like, and Espagnole becomes Bordelaise with the addition and reduction of red wine, shallots, and poached beef marrow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":3},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":25},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":57},{"uri":"Flavour","surface_form":"flavour","offset":66},{"uri":"Flavour","surface_form":"flavour","offset":129},{"uri":"Moisture","surface_form":"moisture","offset":138},{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French cuisine","offset":266},{"uri":"Roux","surface_form":"roux","offset":305},{"uri":"Ham","surface_form":"ham","offset":416},{"uri":"Carbonara","surface_form":"Carbonara","offset":434},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":457},{"uri":"Bolognese_sauce","surface_form":"\"bolognese\"","offset":475},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":496},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":506},{"uri":"Pesto","surface_form":"pesto","offset":527},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":617},{"uri":"Spaghetti","surface_form":"spaghetti","offset":664},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":729},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":756},{"uri":"Garum","surface_form":"garum","offset":829},{"uri":"Fish_sauce","surface_form":"fish sauce","offset":841},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":864},{"uri":"Pico_de_gallo","surface_form":"pico de gallo salsa","offset":934},{"uri":"Chutney","surface_form":"chutney","offset":957},{"uri":"Mayonnaise","surface_form":"mayonnaise","offset":1109},{"uri":"Pesto","surface_form":"pesto","offset":1160},{"uri":"Bechamel","surface_form":"bechamel","offset":1189},{"uri":"Apple_sauce","surface_form":"apple sauce","offset":1251},{"uri":"Worcestershire_sauce","surface_form":"Worcestershire sauce","offset":1305},{"uri":"HP_sauce","surface_form":"HP sauce","offset":1327},{"uri":"Soy_sauce","surface_form":"soy sauce","offset":1337},{"uri":"Ketchup","surface_form":"ketchup","offset":1350},{"uri":"Salad_dressing","surface_form":"salad dressing","offset":1445},{"uri":"Saucier","surface_form":"saucier","offset":1506},{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French cuisine","offset":1541},{"uri":"Nouvelle_cuisine","surface_form":"nouvelle cuisine","offset":1741},{"uri":"Mornay_sauce","surface_form":"Mornay","offset":2183},{"uri":"Gruy%C3%A8re_(cheese)","surface_form":"Gruy\u00E8re","offset":2209}]}
