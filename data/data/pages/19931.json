{"id":19931,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti","text":"Spaghetti is a long, string-shaped kind of pasta.\nThe word \"spaghetti\" was first used in 1849 as \"sparghetti\" in Eliza Acton's \"Modern Cookery\". It comes from Italian \"spaghetto\", which means \"string\".\nSpaghetti is made from wheat noodles, which are boiled in water for a short time. Spaghetti can either be served as a side dish, or as a main dish. As a main dish, a sauce is added. There are many different kinds of sauces. Simpler ones are made of butter, more complicated ones include tomatos, garlic, olive oil and various other herbs. Different varieties with mussels, fish or meat also exist. Ground Parmesan cheese is often added.\nIn Italy the sauce is usually mixed with the spaghetti while they are being prepared. Usually, spaghetti are eaten only with a fork, or with a fork and a spoon. Sometimes, they are cut with a knife for small children. Many Italians see using a knife to eat spaghetti as bad manners, except to prepare them for small children.\nIn the United States, there is a kind of spaghetti called \"Alvaro's spaghetti\" which is served with alfredo sauce. In some countries,like United States or Canada, meatballs are often in the spaghetti sauce.\nIn China, spaghetti is often made by hand. In Italy, spaghetti is made with a machine so that large amounts can be made quickly. Italy is the biggest producer and consumer of spaghetti in the world.\nIt is also a popular dish in Libya.\nSpaghetti is called by other words when it has a different thickness: \"spaghettini (n. 3)\", \"spaghetti (n. 5)\", and \"spaghettoni (n. 8)\".\nUsually, spaghetti leftovers last in a fridge for around 3 to 5 days, while spaghetti in a freezer will last more than one month.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pasta","surface_form":"pasta","offset":43},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":159},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":225},{"uri":"Noodle","surface_form":"noodle","offset":231},{"uri":"Boiling","surface_form":"boiled","offset":250},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":260},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":368},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":451},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":489},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":498},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"olive oil","offset":506},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":534},{"uri":"Mussel","surface_form":"mussel","offset":566},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":575},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":583},{"uri":"Parmesan_cheese","surface_form":"Parmesan cheese","offset":607},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":642},{"uri":"Fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":766},{"uri":"Spoon","surface_form":"spoon","offset":793},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":831},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":972},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1103},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1120},{"uri":"Meatball","surface_form":"meatball","offset":1128},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":1400},{"uri":"Thickness","surface_form":"thickness","offset":1466},{"uri":"Fridge","surface_form":"fridge","offset":1584},{"uri":"Freezer","surface_form":"freezer","offset":1636}]}
