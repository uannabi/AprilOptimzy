{"id":199423,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber","text":"\"Dream of the Red Chamber\" (also \"Red Chamber Dream\", \"Hung Lou Meng\" or \"A Dream of Red Mansions\") (), originally \"The Story of the Stone\" (), is thought to be a great work of Chinese literature and is one of the Chinese Four Great Classical Novels. The novel was written in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty. Its author is thought to be Cao Xueqin (Chinese: \u66F9\u96EA\u82B9). Redology is the study of the book.\nThe book is based on Cao's family. It is meant to be a memorial to the women that he met when he was young, including friends, relatives and servants. This novel is thought to be one of the first feminist novels. It is also one of the first novels to be written in vernacular, not classical, Chinese. This means that it was written in the same way people spoke at the time, rather than in a posh way. This helped to make vernacular Chinese an acceptable way of writing literature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":177},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":185},{"uri":"Four_Great_Classical_Novels","surface_form":"Four Great Classical Novels","offset":222},{"uri":"Qing_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qing Dynasty","offset":318},{"uri":"Cao_Xueqin","surface_form":"Cao Xueqin","offset":360},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":477},{"uri":"Feminist","surface_form":"feminist","offset":618},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":891}]}
