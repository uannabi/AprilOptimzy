{"id":19943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">A complex number is a number, but is different from common numbers in many ways. A complex number is made up using two numbers combined together. The first part is a real number, and the second part is an imaginary number. The most important imaginary number is called formula_1, defined as a number that will be -1 when squared (\"squared\" means \"multiplied by itself\"): formula_1. All the other imaginary numbers are formula_1 multiplied by a real number, in the same way that all real numbers can be thought of as 1 multiplied by another number. Arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be used with complex numbers. They also follow commutative, associative and distributive properties, just like real numbers. The set of complex numbers is often represented using the symbol formula_1.\nComplex numbers were discovered while attempting to solve special equations that have exponents in them. These began to pose real problems for mathematicians. As a comparison, using negative numbers, it is possible to find the \"x\" in the equation formula_1 for all real values of \"a\" and \"b\", but if only positive numbers are allowed for \"x\", it is sometimes impossible to find a positive \"x\", as in the equation.\nWith exponentiation, there is a difficulty to be overcome. There is no real number that gives \u22121 when it is squared. In other words, \u22121 (or any other negative number) has no real square root. For example, there is no real number formula_1 that solves the equation formula_1. To solve this problem, mathematicians introduced a symbol \"i\" and called it the \"imaginary unit\". This is the imaginary number that will give \u22121 when it is squared.\nThe first mathematicians to have thought of this were probably Gerolamo Cardano and Raffaele Bombelli. They lived in the 16th century. It was probably Leonhard Euler who introduced writing formula_1 for that number.\nAll complex numbers can be written as formula_1 (or formula_1), where \"a\" is called the \"real part\" of the number, and \"b\" is called the \"imaginary part\". We write formula_1 or formula_1 for the real part of a complex number formula_1. So, if formula_1, we write formula_1. Similarly, we write formula_1 or formula_1 for the imaginary part of a complex number formula_1; formula_1, for the same. Every real number is also a complex number; it is a complex number with formula_1.\nA complex number can also be written as an ordered pair, where both \"a\" and \"b\" are real numbers. Any real number can simply be written as formula_1, or as the pair.\nSometimes, formula_1 is written instead of formula_1. In electrical engineering for instance, formula_1 means electric current, so writing formula_1 can cause a lot of problems because some numbers in electrical engineering are complex numbers.\nThe set of all complex numbers is usually written as formula_1.\nOperations over complex numbers.\nAddition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation (raising numbers to exponents) are all possible with complex numbers. Division is also possible with complex numbers\u2014as long as the divisor is not zero, Some other calculations are also possible with complex numbers.\nLet formula_1, then formula_1, and formula_1.\nformula_1\nAnother notable operation for complex numbers is \"conjugation\". A complex conjugate formula_1 to formula_1 is formula_1.\nformula_1.\nformula_1\nformula_1\nOther forms of describing complex numbers.\nComplex numbers can be shown on a so-called complex plane. If you have a number formula_1, you can go to point \"a\" on the real axis and point \"b\" on the imaginary axis, and draw a vector from formula_1 to formula_1. The length of this vector can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, and the angle of this vector is simply the angle between the positive real axis and this vector\u2014going counterclockwise. The length of a vector for a number formula_1 is called its modulus or absolute value (written as formula_1), and the angle is called its argument (formula_1).\nformula_1\nThis is closely connected to De Moivre's formula.\nThere exists even another form, called exponential form.\nConclusion.\nWith the introduction of complex numbers to math, every polynomial with complex coefficients has roots in complex numbers. This introduction also helped to open a path to the creation of another kind of numbers, which could help resolve and explain many different problems. These include the hypercomplex numbers, sedenion, hyperreal numbers, surreal numbers and many others.
