{"id":199738,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Coup","text":"May Coup was a coup d'\u00E9tat that happened in Poland in May 1926. It was organised by the former Polish leader and national hero J\u00F3zef Pi\u0142sudski to remove the \"weak\" democratic government from power. It started on 12 May and ended on 15 May.\nPi\u0142sudski and his followers were victorious and the Polish democracy was replaced with an authoritarian regime that remained in power until the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II. After Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935 the regime became more and more radical, with regular persecution of the political opponents, never changing into totalitarianism though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":15},{"uri":"Second_Polish_Republic","surface_form":"Poland","offset":44},{"uri":"J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski","surface_form":"J\u00F3zef Pi\u0142sudski","offset":127},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democratic","offset":164},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":441},{"uri":"Totalitarianism","surface_form":"totalitarianism","offset":601}]}
