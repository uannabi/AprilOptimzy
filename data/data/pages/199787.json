{"id":199787,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_White","text":"Gilbert White (18 July 1720 \u2013 26 June 1793) was a pioneering English naturalist and ornithologist.\nEarly life and education.\nWhite was born in his grandfather's vicarage at Selborne in Hampshire. He was educated by a private tutor in Basingstoke before going to Oriel College, Oxford University. He obtained his deacon's orders in 1746, being fully ordained in 1749.\nThen he held several curacies in Hampshire and Wiltshire, including Selbourne. White also held the office of Junior Proctor at Oxford and was Dean of Oriel College. In 1784 he became curate of Selborne for the last time, remaining so until his death.\nPublications.\nWhite is best known for the \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" (1789). This was a collection of his letters to Thomas Pennant, the leading British zoologist of the day, and the Hon. Daines Barrington, an English barrister and Fellow of the Royal Society. These letters contained White's discoveries on local birds, animals and plants. White believed in observing birds rather than collecting specimens. He was one of the first people to separate the similar-looking Chiffchaff, Willow Warbler and Wood Warbler by means of their song.\nWhite is regarded by many as England's first ecologist and one of the founders of modern respect for nature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pioneer","surface_form":"pioneer","offset":50},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":61},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":69},{"uri":"Ornithologist","surface_form":"ornithologist","offset":84},{"uri":"Selborne","surface_form":"Selborne","offset":173},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":185},{"uri":"Tutor","surface_form":"tutor","offset":225},{"uri":"Basingstoke","surface_form":"Basingstoke","offset":234},{"uri":"Oxford_University","surface_form":"Oxford University","offset":277},{"uri":"Deacon","surface_form":"deacon","offset":312},{"uri":"Ordination","surface_form":"ordained","offset":349},{"uri":"Curate","surface_form":"curacies","offset":388},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":400},{"uri":"Wiltshire","surface_form":"Wiltshire","offset":414},{"uri":"Oriel_College","surface_form":"Oriel College","offset":517},{"uri":"The_Natural_History_and_Antiquities_of_Selborne","surface_form":"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne","offset":661},{"uri":"Zoologist","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":794},{"uri":"Barrister","surface_form":"barrister","offset":859},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":887},{"uri":"Chiffchaff","surface_form":"Chiffchaff","offset":1113},{"uri":"Willow_Warbler","surface_form":"Willow Warbler","offset":1125},{"uri":"Wood_Warbler","surface_form":"Wood Warbler","offset":1144},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecologist","offset":1226}]}
