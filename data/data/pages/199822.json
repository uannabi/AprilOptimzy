{"id":199822,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky","text":"e=\"preserve\">Theodosius Dobzhansky, or Theodore Dobzhansky, (24 January 1900 \u2013 18 December 1975) was a noted geneticist and an evolutionary biologist.\nDobzhansky was born in the Ukraine (then part of Imperial Russia) and emigrated to the United States in 1927. He was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work on the fruit-fly \"Drosophila\". He did research on these flies in California, mostly on populations of \"Drosophila pseudoobscura\".\nDobzhansky was important in the modern evolutionary synthesis, which was the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics.\nUkraine and Russia.\nAt school Dobzhansky collected butterflies and beetles, and studied biology at Kiev University. After graduation he moved to St Petersburg (then called Leningrad), and studied under Yuri Filipchenko, who had a \"Drosophila\" lab. Dobzhansky collected Coccinellidae (ladybird beetles) in the wild, and explored their genetics.\nAmerica.\nDobzhansky emigrated to the United States in 1927. He worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University, who had pioneered the use of fruit flies (\"Drosophila melanogaster\") in genetics experiments. He followed Morgan to the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1940. Dobzhansky took fruit fly research out of the laboratory and into the field. He discovered that regional varieties of flies were more similar to each other genetically than to flies from other regions.\nIn 1937 Dobzhansky published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis, entitled \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\". He defined evolution as \"a change in the allele frequency within a gene pool\". It is through changes in the proportion of alleles in a population that evolution takes place. Also in 1937, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. During this time he had a falling out with one of his \"Drosophila\" collaborators, Alfred Sturtevant, based perhaps on professional competition.\nDobzhansky returned to Columbia University from 1940 to 1962. He was one of the signatories of the 1950 UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\". He then moved to the Rockefeller University) until his retirement in 1971.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":109},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":127},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":140},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":178},{"uri":"Imperial_Russia","surface_form":"Imperial Russia","offset":200},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":238},{"uri":"Evolutionary_biology","surface_form":"evolutionary biology","offset":301},{"uri":"Drosophila","surface_form":"Drosophila","offset":353},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":400},{"uri":"Drosophila_pseudoobscura","surface_form":"Drosophila pseudoobscura","offset":438},{"uri":"Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","surface_form":"modern evolutionary synthesis","offset":497},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":581},{"uri":"Butterflies","surface_form":"butterflies","offset":642},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":658},{"uri":"St_Petersburg","surface_form":"St Petersburg","offset":736},{"uri":"Drosophila","surface_form":"Drosophila","offset":822},{"uri":"Coccinellidae","surface_form":"Coccinellidae","offset":860},{"uri":"Thomas_Hunt_Morgan","surface_form":"Thomas Hunt Morgan","offset":1010},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":1032},{"uri":"Drosophila_melanogaster","surface_form":"Drosophila melanogaster","offset":1096},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"California Institute of Technology","offset":1173},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":1273},{"uri":"Field_research","surface_form":"field","offset":1297},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1577},{"uri":"Allele_frequency","surface_form":"allele frequency","offset":1607},{"uri":"Gene_pool","surface_form":"gene pool","offset":1633},{"uri":"Naturalized_citizen","surface_form":"naturalized citizen","offset":1766},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1793},{"uri":"Alfred_Sturtevant","surface_form":"Alfred Sturtevant","offset":1890},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":1975},{"uri":"Rockefeller_University","surface_form":"Rockefeller University","offset":2115}]}
