{"id":199843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel_Big_Fish","text":"Reel Big Fish is a ska punk band that started in 1992 in California. They have only ever played ska/rock music but moved more to a pop sound during the album \"Cheer Up!\" They have had many different members since the start of the band, including two different singers and over 10 different horn players. They mainly got successful from the album \"Turn The Radio Off\", which had the single \"Sell Out,\" in 1997, their most famous song.\nRecord Companies.\nA common theme throughout some of their songs (such as \"Don't Start A Band\" and \"Sell Out\") is their disapproval of big record companies. Reel Big Fish was signed onto Jive Records, but after their short-lived success, the record company neglected them and did not advertise their albums. In their 2005 album, We're Not Happy Til' You're Not Happy, Reel Big Fish directly and indirectly expresses their anger towards their record company in several of their songs.\nDuring 2006, Reel Big Fish was dropped from Jive Records. The band formed their own label and released a 3-disc live performance CD/DVD set, Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album. This package became available on July 18, 2006 on the Internet and in retail stores on August 22. Jive later released a Reel Big Fish greatest hits album, Greatest Hit...And More, because they owned the rights to all previous songs. The band did not approve of, or make any money from the album, and have spoken out against it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ska_punk","surface_form":"ska punk","offset":19},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":28},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":57},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":152},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":260}]}
