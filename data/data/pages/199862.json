{"id":199862,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Tribulation","text":"Cape Tribulation () is both a headland and small town in northern Queensland, Australia north of Cairns. It is in the Daintree National Park and the Wet Tropics World Heritage area. The first people to live in the area were the Kuku Yalanji. The first European to settle in the area was John Moffat in 1880 who set up a farm to grow food for the miners in the west.\nThere is a sealed road to the area from the south from the Daintree River Ferry. To the north there is a four wheel drive unsealed road, called the Bloomfield Track. This goes to the Bloomfield River, Wujal Wujal, Bloomfield Falls and Cooktown. It is often closed during the wet season (Feb-Apr).\nTribulation means trouble and great suffering. Cape Tribulation was named by British explorer Lt. James Cook on 10 June 1770 after his ship ran into a coral reef near the headland; \"...because here began all our Troubles...\"\nCape Tribulation is in a rainforest and it gets a lot of rain. In 2006, the rainfall recorded was over 5.7 metres.\nMost people visit the area during the dry season between July and November. There are four main resorts to stay in as well as several smaller bed and breakfast places. The town has two small supermarkets, two ATMs, one takeaway food outlet and five restaurants. During the wet season marine stingers are common so people swim in the many waterholes. There are crocodiles in the creeks.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is very close to the coast, only due east. There are two boats that take visitors to the reef. Other activities available are guided night walks, 4 wheel drive tours, horseriding, kayaking, jungle surfing, tropical fruit tasting and crocodile cruises.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":66},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":78},{"uri":"Cairns%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Cairns","offset":97},{"uri":"Daintree_National_Park","surface_form":"Daintree National Park","offset":118},{"uri":"Wet_Tropics_of_Queensland","surface_form":"Wet Tropics","offset":149},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage","offset":161},{"uri":"Kuku_Yalanji","surface_form":"Kuku Yalanji","offset":228},{"uri":"Daintree_River_Ferry","surface_form":"Daintree River Ferry","offset":425},{"uri":"Four_wheel_drive","surface_form":"four wheel drive","offset":471},{"uri":"Bloomfield_Track","surface_form":"Bloomfield Track","offset":514},{"uri":"Bloomfield_River","surface_form":"Bloomfield River","offset":549},{"uri":"Wujal_Wujal","surface_form":"Wujal Wujal","offset":567},{"uri":"Bloomfield_Falls","surface_form":"Bloomfield Falls","offset":580},{"uri":"Cooktown%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Cooktown","offset":601},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":740},{"uri":"James_Cook","surface_form":"Lt.
