{"id":199890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds","text":"Sir Joshua Reynolds RA FRS FRSA (16 July 1723 \u2013 23 February 1792) was an English painter of portraits. He helped to start the Royal Academy of Arts and was its first president. King George III made him \"Sir\" Joshua Reynolds in 1769.\nSome critics disliked Reynolds and the Royal Academy. The Pre-Raphaelites called him \"Sir Sloshua\" and William Blake published a savage pamphlet \"Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses\" in 1808. On the other hand, Turner was a strong supporter, and asked to be buried at Reynolds' side.\nReynolds has over 1000 portraits in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Despite Blake's criticisms, Reynold's \"Discourses\" had a lasting impact on the theory and practice of art.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Academy","surface_form":"RA","offset":20},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":23},{"uri":"Royal_Society_of_Arts","surface_form":"FRSA","offset":27},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":81},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":92},{"uri":"Royal_Academy_of_Arts","surface_form":"Royal Academy of Arts","offset":126},{"uri":"George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George III","offset":177},{"uri":"Pre-Raphaelites","surface_form":"Pre-Raphaelites","offset":291},{"uri":"William_Blake","surface_form":"William Blake","offset":336},{"uri":"J.M.W._Turner","surface_form":"Turner","offset":455},{"uri":"National_Portrait_Gallery%2C_London","surface_form":"National Portrait Gallery, London","offset":568}]}
