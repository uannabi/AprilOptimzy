{"id":200221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_Park_City","text":"Battery Park City is a 92-acre (0.4\u00A0km\u00B2) planned community at the southwestern tip of Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. The land upon which it stands was created on the Hudson River using 1.2 million cubic yards (917,000 m3) of dirt and rocks excavated during the construction of the World Trade Center and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from New York Harbor off Staten Island. The neighborhood, which is the site of the World Financial Center along with many housing, commercial, and retail buildings, is named for adjacent Battery Park.\nBattery Park City is owned and managed by the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA), a public-benefit corporation created by New York State under the authority of the Urban Development Corporation. It was founded and ran by Charles J. Urstadt. Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in the Bronx and Harlem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lower_Manhattan","surface_form":"Lower Manhattan","offset":86},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":105},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":120},{"uri":"Hudson_River","surface_form":"Hudson River","offset":184},{"uri":"World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)","surface_form":"World Trade Center","offset":299},{"uri":"New_York_Harbor","surface_form":"New York Harbor","offset":393},{"uri":"Staten_Island","surface_form":"Staten Island","offset":413},{"uri":"World_Financial_Center","surface_form":"World Financial Center","offset":471},{"uri":"New_York_State","surface_form":"New York State","offset":711},{"uri":"Charles_J._Urstadt","surface_form":"Charles J.
