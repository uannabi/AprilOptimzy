{"id":20029,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackinac_Island","text":"=\"preserve\">Mackinac Island is an island in Lake Huron. It is part of the U.S. state of Michigan and is 8 miles (13 kilometers) around.\nMany people go to see Mackinac Island in the summer because the island passed a local law that says that no one can use a car on the island. Everybody has to ride a horse or a bicycle. In recent years, young people have been using roller skates or roller blades to get around the island. There is a narrow paved road that follows the 8 miles of shoreline. This road is for horses (and their buggies), bicycles, skaters and joggers or just people taking a long walk.\nIn order to get to Mackinac Island, visitors have to buy a ticket on a ferry boat. The boat ride has views of Lake Huron and the Mackinac Bridge. After they get to Mackinac Island, many visitors buy locally made fudge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":34},{"uri":"Lake_Huron","surface_form":"Lake Huron","offset":44},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":74},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":88},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":106},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometers","offset":116},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":181},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":222},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":258},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":301},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":312},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":679},{"uri":"Lake_Huron","surface_form":"Lake Huron","offset":712},{"uri":"Mackinac_Bridge","surface_form":"Mackinac Bridge","offset":731},{"uri":"Fudge","surface_form":"fudge","offset":814}]}
