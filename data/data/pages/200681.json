{"id":200681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd","text":"Volgograd formerly called Tsaritsyn (1589\u20131925) and Stalingrad (1925\u20131961) is an industrial city of great importance and the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast, Russia. It is 80\u00A0km long, north to south, on the western bank of the Volga River and has a population of over 1.011 millon people. The city was made famous for its heroic resistance and bloody siege during the Battle of Stalingrad taking place during World War II.\nHistory.\nVolgograd developed from 1589 when the fortress of Tsaritsyn was founded at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga Rivers.\nDuring the Russian Civil War the city was the scene of heavy fighting. Bolshevik forces occupied it during 1918, but were attacked by White forces. It was renamed as Stalingrad in 1925.\nUnder Stalin, the city became heavily industrialized as a centre of heavy industry and trans-shipment by rail and river. During World War II, Stalingrad became the center of the Battle of Stalingrad as well as a turning point in the war against Germany. Essentially, the German offensive was checked at Stalingrad. The Battle of Stalingrad lasted from August 21, 1942 to February 2, 1943, where 1.7 million to 2 million Axis and Soviet soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, in addition to over 40,000 civilians killed. The city was reduced to rubble during the fierce fighting, but reconstruction began soon after the Germans were expelled from the city.\nNikita Khrushchev renamed the city in 1961.\nTwin towns \u2014 Sister cities.\nA number of communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence \"Place de Stalingrad\" in Paris and the Paris M\u00E9tro station of Stalingrad.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":92},{"uri":"Oblast","surface_form":"Oblast","offset":160},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":168},{"uri":"Volga_River","surface_form":"Volga River","offset":237},{"uri":"Battle_of_Stalingrad","surface_form":"Battle of Stalingrad","offset":378},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":419},{"uri":"Confluence","surface_form":"confluence","offset":522},{"uri":"Tsaritsa_River","surface_form":"Tsaritsa","offset":540},{"uri":"Volga_River","surface_form":"Volga River","offset":553},{"uri":"Russian_Civil_War","surface_form":"Russian Civil War","offset":578},{"uri":"Bolshevik","surface_form":"Bolshevik","offset":638},{"uri":"Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":759},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":881},{"uri":"Battle_of_Stalingrad","surface_form":"Battle of Stalingrad","offset":931},{"uri":"August_21","surface_form":"August 21","offset":1105},{"uri":"1942","surface_form":"1942","offset":1116},{"uri":"February_2","surface_form":"February 2","offset":1124},{"uri":"1943","surface_form":"1943","offset":1136},{"uri":"Axis_powers_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Axis","offset":1173},{"uri":"Nikita_Khrushchev","surface_form":"Nikita Khrushchev","offset":1413},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1512},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1523},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1608}]}
