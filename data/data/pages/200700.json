{"id":200700,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_inconsistent_revelations","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Argument from inconsistent revelations (also known as Avoiding the wrong hell problem) is an argument that says that God probably does not exist. There are many religions which are based on revelations. The problem with these revelations is that they contradict each other. A person must either accept or reject at least one of these revelations in order to be part of a religious group. That way, accepting one means rejecting some (if not all) of the others. Unless the revelation is personal, the follower must to some extent rely on the judgment or the stories of others. Assuming the revelation is personal, the follower is still ignoring the revelations of those before him.\nChristians believe that Jesus is the savior of the world and the son of God; Jews believe just as strongly that he is not. Similarly, Muslims believe that the Qur'an was divinely authored, while Jews and Christians do not. There are many examples of such contrasting views. Positions where one religion contradicts another, or where one group of people contradicts another are common. There are many denominations in Christianity who do not agree about many things.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":110},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":134},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":178},{"uri":"Revelation","surface_form":"revelation","offset":207},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christians","offset":698},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":722},{"uri":"Messiah","surface_form":"son of God","offset":763},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":775},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":832},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":857},{"uri":"Christian_denomination","surface_form":"denominations","offset":1098}]}
