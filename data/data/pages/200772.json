{"id":200772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman","text":"Richard Feynman (11 May 1918 \u2013 15 February 1988) was an American physicist of Jewish descent. He was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York City. He was part of the Manhattan Project team that made the atomic bomb. Feynman won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1965. He was one of the first people to study quantum physics. Feynman added significantly to a branch of science called quantum electrodynamics and invented the Feynman diagram. He died of liposarcoma in Los Angeles, California.\nHis sister Joan Feynman (born 1927) is a retired astrophysicist.\nSelected books.\nFeynman wrote some best-selling autobiographies, and his lecture notes became popular with physics students and qualified professionals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":56},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physicist","offset":65},{"uri":"Far_Rockaway%2C_Queens","surface_form":"Far Rockaway, Queens","offset":109},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":131},{"uri":"Manhattan_Project","surface_form":"Manhattan Project","offset":165},{"uri":"Atomic_bomb","surface_form":"atomic bomb","offset":202},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":231},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"Physics","offset":246},{"uri":"Quantum_physics","surface_form":"quantum physics","offset":300},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":350},{"uri":"Quantum_electrodynamics","surface_form":"quantum electrodynamics","offset":375},{"uri":"Feynman_diagram","surface_form":"Feynman diagram","offset":416},{"uri":"Liposarcoma","surface_form":"liposarcoma","offset":444},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":459},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":472},{"uri":"Joan_Feynman","surface_form":"Joan Feynman","offset":495},{"uri":"Retire","surface_form":"retire","offset":525},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysicist","offset":533},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiographies","offset":597}]}
