{"id":200902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plinian_eruption","text":"A Plinian eruption is a kind of volcanic eruption which is similar to that of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79 AD. It is named after Pliny the Younger who wrote the only surviving eyewitness account of the eruption. That eruption of Vesuvius killed Pliny the Elder, the uncle of Pliny the Younger.\nPlinian eruptions have columns of gas and volcanic ash high into the stratosphere. There is a large amount of pumice into the atmosphere and very powerful gas blast eruptions.\nShort eruptions can end in less than a day. Longer ones can take several days to months. These eruptions begin with clouds of volcanic ash and occasionally pyroclastic flows. Sometimes the amount of magma erupted is so large that the top of the volcano collapses. This leaves a caldera behind. Fine ash can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions often happen with loud noises, such as those created by Krakatoa.\nLarge Plinian eruptions.\nThe lava is usually rhyolitic and has a lot of silicates. Basaltic lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions; the most recent example is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.\nPliny's description.\nPliny the Elder went to rescue some of the victims. He sailed across the Gulf of Naples to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny the Younger wrote an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted by the volcano. His body was found buried under the ashes of the Vesuvius with no apparent injuries on 26 August, after the plume had dispersed. This confirmed the death through asphyxiation or poisoning.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic eruption","offset":32},{"uri":"Mount_Vesuvius","surface_form":"Mount Vesuvius","offset":78},{"uri":"Pliny_the_Younger","surface_form":"Pliny the Younger","offset":130},{"uri":"Pliny_the_Elder","surface_form":"Pliny the Elder","offset":246},{"uri":"Column","surface_form":"column","offset":318},{"uri":"Volcanic_gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":329},{"uri":"Tuff","surface_form":"volcanic ash","offset":337},{"uri":"Stratosphere","surface_form":"stratosphere","offset":364},{"uri":"Pumice","surface_form":"pumice","offset":405},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":421},{"uri":"Ash_cloud","surface_form":"clouds","offset":587},{"uri":"Pyroclastic_flow","surface_form":"pyroclastic flow","offset":627},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":670},{"uri":"Caldera","surface_form":"caldera","offset":749},{"uri":"Create","surface_form":"create","offset":867},{"uri":"Krakatoa","surface_form":"Krakatoa","offset":878},{"uri":"Rhyolite","surface_form":"rhyolitic","offset":933},{"uri":"Silicates","surface_form":"silicates","offset":960},{"uri":"Basaltic","surface_form":"Basaltic","offset":971},{"uri":"Mount_Tarawera","surface_form":"Mount Tarawera","offset":1069},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Naples","surface_form":"Gulf of Naples","offset":1179},{"uri":"Stabiae","surface_form":"Stabiae","offset":1197},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1363},{"uri":"Asphyxiation","surface_form":"asphyxiation","offset":1565}]}
