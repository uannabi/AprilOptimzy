It is located in the Southern Hemisphere.\nMythology.\nThe name \"Crater\" is taken from a Greek myth. In the story, a crow or raven serves Apollo. It is sent to get water, but it rests lazily on the journey. After finally getting the water in a cup, it takes back a water snake as well, as an excuse. According to the myth, Apollo saw through the trick and angrily cast the cup, crow, and snake into the sky. The constellations of Corvus the crow and Hydra the water-snake are also taken from this myth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":15},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":33},{"uri":"Cup","surface_form":"cup","offset":48},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":78},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":95},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":166},{"uri":"Ptolemy","surface_form":"Ptolemy","offset":177},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":256},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek myth","offset":322},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"crow","offset":350},{"uri":"Raven","surface_form":"raven","offset":358},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":371},{"uri":"Corvus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Corvus","offset":663},{"uri":"Hydra_(constellation)","surface_form":"Hydra","offset":683}]}
