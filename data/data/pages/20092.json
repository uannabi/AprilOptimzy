{"id":20092,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal","text":"Lake Baikal is a huge lake in Siberia, Russia. It is the biggest fresh water reservoir in the world. The lake is near Irkutsk.\nBaikal is about long. It is wide. At it\u2019s deepest point, it is deep. With this depth it is the deepest lake on Earth. The lake is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It holds about 20% of the world's unfrozen surface fresh water,\nThe lake has fish that exist only here and nowhere else. It is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals, two-thirds of which can be found nowhere else in the world.\nGeology.\nLake Baikal fills an ancient rift valley, just as Lake Tanganyika does in East Africa.\nAt the Baikal Rift Zone, the Earth's crust pulls apart. It is the deepest lake in the world at. The bottom of the lake is below sea level, but below this lies some of sediment. This means the rift floor is below the surface: the deepest continental rift on Earth.\nIn geological terms, the rift is young and active it widens about two cm per year. The fault zone is also seismically active; there are hot springs in the area and notable earthquakes every few years.\nBaikal's age is 25\u201330 million years: it is one of the oldest lakes. It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, because its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. U.S. and Russian studies of core sediment in the 1990s gave a detailed record of climatic variation over the past 250,000 years. Longer and deeper sediment cores are expected soon. Lake Baikal is the only confined freshwater lake in which evidence of gas hydrates exists.\nThe lake is completely surrounded by mountains. The Baikal Mountains on the north shore and the taiga are protected as a national park. It has 27 islands; the largest, Olkhon, is long and is the third-largest lake-bound island in the world. The lake is fed by as many as 330 inflowing rivers. It is drained through a single outlet, the Angara River.\nDespite its great depth, the lake's waters are well-mixed and well-oxygenated throughout the water column, compared to the stratification that occurs in such bodies of water as Lake Tanganyika and the Black Sea.\nWildlife.\nLake Baikal has over 1000 species of plants and 1550 species and varieties of animals. Over 60% of animals are endemic; that means of 52 species of fish 27 are endemic.\nThe omul fish (\"Coregonus autumnalis migratorius\") is local to Lake Baikal. It is fished, smoked, and sold on all markets around the lake. For many travellers on the Trans-Siberian railway, purchasing smoked omul is one of the highlights of the long journey.\nBaikal also hosts a species of seals, Baikal seal or \"nerpa\".\nBears and deer can be watched and hunted by Baikal coasts.\nEcosystem.\nIn 1986, Baikalskyi and Barguzinskyi became Biosphere Reserves. The ecosystems are part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":22},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":30},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":39},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":65},{"uri":"Irkutsk","surface_form":"Irkutsk","offset":118},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":238},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":259},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":266},{"uri":"Rift_valley","surface_form":"rift valley","offset":567},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":588},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":612},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":753},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":792},{"uri":"Rift_(geology)","surface_form":"rift","offset":874},{"uri":"Cm","surface_form":"cm","offset":959},{"uri":"Hot_spring","surface_form":"hot spring","offset":1025},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1061},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":1217},{"uri":"Hydrate","surface_form":"hydrate","offset":1542},{"uri":"Baikal_Mountains","surface_form":"Baikal Mountains","offset":1611},{"uri":"Taiga","surface_form":"taiga","offset":1655},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":1680},{"uri":"Olkhon","surface_form":"Olkhon","offset":1727},{"uri":"Angara_River","surface_form":"Angara River","offset":1895},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":1976},{"uri":"Stratification_(water)","surface_form":"stratification","offset":2032},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":2086},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":2110},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":2242},{"uri":"Omul","surface_form":"omul","offset":2304},{"uri":"Smoked_fish","surface_form":"smoked","offset":2390},{"uri":"Trans-Siberian_railway","surface_form":"Trans-Siberian railway","offset":2466},{"uri":"Pinniped","surface_form":"seals","offset":2590},{"uri":"Baikal_seal","surface_form":"Baikal seal","offset":2597},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"Bear","offset":2621},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":2631},{"uri":"Baikalskyi","surface_form":"Baikalskyi","offset":2700},{"uri":"Barguzinskyi","surface_form":"Barguzinskyi","offset":2715},{"uri":"Biosphere_Reserve","surface_form":"Biosphere Reserve","offset":2735},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":2759}]}
