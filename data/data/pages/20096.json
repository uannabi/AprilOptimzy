{"id":20096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_turkey","text":"The wild turkey (\"Meleagris gallopavo\") is the name of the more common of the two species of turkey. This large bird is found across much of the United States and southern Canada.\nWild turkeys prefer hardwood and mixed conifer-hardwood forests with scattered openings such as pastures, fields, orchards and seasonal marshes. They can adapt to any dense plant community so long as there is cover and openings to fly out. Open, mature forests with a variety of tree species seem to be best.\nThe \"domesticated turkey\" has been tamed and bred from wild turkeys, by people, to raise on farms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":82},{"uri":"Turkey_(bird)","surface_form":"turkey","offset":93},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":145},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":172},{"uri":"Hardwood","surface_form":"hardwood","offset":200},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":219},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":236},{"uri":"Pasture","surface_form":"pasture","offset":276},{"uri":"Field","surface_form":"field","offset":286},{"uri":"Orchard","surface_form":"orchard","offset":294},{"uri":"Marshes","surface_form":"marshes","offset":316},{"uri":"Domesticate","surface_form":"tame","offset":524},{"uri":"Breeding","surface_form":"bred","offset":534}]}
