{"id":201037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_League_(Pakistan)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Pakistan Muslim League was founded in 1962, as a successor to the previously disbanded Muslim League in Pakistan. Unlike the original PML which ended in 1958 when General Ayub Khan banned all political parties, each subsequent Muslim League was in some way propped by the military dictators of the time: Ayub Khan, General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf. Every time the pro-establishment political leaders were put together, who splintered apart when the general's blessings faded away.\nRecently Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q) made headlines when on 31 December 2007, armed men belonging to the party kidnapped the human rights lawyer, Asma Jahangirs daughters who were in company of some friends, at gun point and brought them to the PML-Q main election office. The girls were detained illegally, abused, severely beaten. Asma's youngest daughter was then dragged off to a separate room by some of the gunmen. Asma Jahangir only barely managed to rescue her daughters and their friends and called the police for assistance. The girls had been out filing ripped and torn election posters in Lahore City in the aftermath of the assassination of Benezir Bhutto. The police took the side of the gunmen, insisting that the girls hand over the tape, or else they would be kidnapped, raped and killed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Zia-ul-Haq","surface_form":"Zia-ul-Haq","offset":340},{"uri":"Pervez_Musharraf","surface_form":"Pervez Musharraf","offset":363}]}
