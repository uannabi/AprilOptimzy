It is useful for finding metal within other objects, or for finding metal underground. Most metal detectors will make a sound or have a needle move on a sensor in order to show where objects are. Most of the tiem a metal detector will tell you how close you are to an object - for example, by making a higher-pitched sound when you are closer to an object.\nHistory of the metal detector.\nAlexander Graham Bell invented a kind of metal detector in 1881 in a to try and find the bullet in President James Garfield's body after he had been shot. The metal detector worked but it was confused between the bullet and a coiled bed-spring which he had been lying on. Gerhard Fischer made a better version in the 1920s but the detector got confused when someone was approaching ore-bearing rocks. He was given a patent in 1925.\nA businessman named Shirl Herr had also tried to get a patent for a metal detector but was not given one until 1928.\nUses.\nA metal detector can be used by archaeologists for finding things like metallic coins, bullets, and jewellery underneath or inside a surface.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":35},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":70},{"uri":"Alexander_Graham_Bell","surface_form":"Alexander Graham Bell","offset":472},{"uri":"1881","surface_form":"1881","offset":531},{"uri":"James_Garfield","surface_form":"James Garfield","offset":581},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":854},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":888},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":1059},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"coin","offset":1107},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":1114},{"uri":"Jewellery","surface_form":"jewellery","offset":1127}]}
