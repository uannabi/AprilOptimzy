{"id":2012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">A tone language, or tonal language, is a language in which words can differ in tones (like pitches in music) in addition to consonants and vowels.\nMany Asian languages are tone languages, such as Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Punjabi. Most languages, including Indo-European languages like English are not tone languages, but Punjabi is an exception. Moreover, many African languages like Yor\u00F9b\u00E1, Igbo, Luganda, Ewe and Zulu use tone as well.\nIn some languages, it is pitch accent that is important instead. A word's meaning can then change if a different syllable is stressed. Examples include Ancient Greek, Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian, Serbo-Croatian, Lithuanian, and some Asian languages like Japanese. However, pitch accent is different from tones.\nSome tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language. They are the most difficult part of learning a tone language for those people.\nExample.\nIn Mandarin, the most famous example \"m\u0101 m\u00E1 m\u01CE m\u00E0\" ()\" has four different words each pronounced in exactly the same way but with four different tones. If numbers identify the tones, they can be written m\"a1 ma2 ma3 ma4\", which means \"mom hemp horse scold.\" Some ways of romanization mark each tone by a different spelling; \"ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4\" in Pinyin would be written \"ma mha maa mah\" in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Most use numbers or accent marks (\"m\u0101 m\u00E1 m\u01CE m\u00E0\" in Pinyin). There is a passage called Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den (). It has 92 characters; all read the same way in Mandarin (\"shi\") but with different tones.\nMandarin does not have many syllables: the words for \"mother,\" \"hemp,\" \"horse,\" \"scold,\" and a word put at the end of sentences to make it a question are all pronounced \"ma:\"\nMandarin has \"first tone,\" \"second tone,\" \"third tone,\" \"fourth tone,\" and \"neutral tone.\" Other Chinese dialects have more tones, some as many as twelve.\nTonal markings.\nVietnamese and Pinyin use accents as the tone marks for the Latin alphabet. Each accent shows an altered sound for the syllable. Most syllables have only one tone marking, but the letters in the syllable can be altered by other markings. Syllables usually form one word in un-hyphenated compound words.\nPinyin may have style differences because its use is to help Westerners. On the other hand, Vietnamese has a national script that always follows and uses the same style.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":54},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":72},{"uri":"Pitch_(music)","surface_form":"pitches in music","offset":104},{"uri":"Consonants","surface_form":"consonants","offset":137},{"uri":"Vowels","surface_form":"vowels","offset":152},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":209},{"uri":"Vietnamese_language","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":218},{"uri":"Thai_language","surface_form":"Thai","offset":230},{"uri":"Punjabi_language","surface_form":"Punjabi","offset":240},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European languages","offset":275},{"uri":"Yoruba_language","surface_form":"Yor\u00F9b\u00E1","offset":403},{"uri":"Igbo_language","surface_form":"Igbo","offset":411},{"uri":"Luganda_language","surface_form":"Luganda","offset":417},{"uri":"Ewe_language","surface_form":"Ewe","offset":426},{"uri":"Zulu_language","surface_form":"Zulu","offset":434},{"uri":"Pitch-accent_language","surface_form":"pitch accent","offset":482},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":570},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":609},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":624},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":632},{"uri":"Norwegian_language","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":641},{"uri":"Serbo-Croatian","surface_form":"Serbo-Croatian","offset":652},{"uri":"Lithuanian_language","surface_form":"Lithuanian","offset":668},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":710},{"uri":"Mandarin_language","surface_form":"Mandarin","offset":929},{"uri":"Hemp","surface_form":"hemp","offset":1164},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":1169},{"uri":"Romanization","surface_form":"romanization","offset":1196},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"Pinyin","offset":1270},{"uri":"Gwoyeu_Romatzyh","surface_form":"Gwoyeu Romatzyh","offset":1314},{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"accent marks","offset":1351},{"uri":"Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den","surface_form":"Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den","offset":1417},{"uri":"Chinese_character","surface_form":"characters","offset":1465},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":1573},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1825},{"uri":"Vietnamese_language","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":1891},{"uri":"Mark","surface_form":"mark","offset":1937},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":1951},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":2010},{"uri":"Hyphen","surface_form":"hyphen","offset":2167},{"uri":"Compound_word","surface_form":"compound","offset":2178}]}
