{"id":20124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion","text":"Emotions are what people feel. They are very ancient, and can be seen in all mammals.\nEmotions are caused by a complex mixture of hormones and the unconscious mind. Only with great difficulty can we control our emotions by conscious effort. They cause mammals to change behaviour according to changes in their situation. In our case they sometimes run against our attempt to live our lives in a logical way.\nIn physical terms, emotions involve body systems which have operated for hundreds of millions of years. These are the hormone system, the autonomic nervous system and the 'lower' brain centres (hindbrain and midbrain).\nFunction of emotions.\nThe study of emotions became one of Darwin's books after \"The Descent of Man\". He published \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\" in 1873. He had discovered, by sending letters and a list of questions worldwide, that in different societies emotions were expressed in almost the same way.\nIf so, the mechanisms which made the expressions must be inherited. They must have been developed in the same way as all other features of man, evolution by natural selection. It was already known from anatomy that the muscles and nerves of the face were the same or similar in all humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":77},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":130},{"uri":"Unconscious_mind","surface_form":"unconscious mind","offset":147},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":270},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":526},{"uri":"Autonomic_nervous_system","surface_form":"autonomic nervous system","offset":546},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":587},{"uri":"Hindbrain","surface_form":"hindbrain","offset":602},{"uri":"Midbrain","surface_form":"midbrain","offset":616},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Darwin's","offset":685},{"uri":"The_Descent_of_Man","surface_form":"The Descent of Man","offset":707},{"uri":"The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals","surface_form":"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals","offset":742},{"uri":"Heritable","surface_form":"inherited","offset":1008},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1095},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":1108},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":1153}]}
