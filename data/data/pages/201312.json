{"id":201312,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring","text":"\"The Rite of Spring\" (\"Le Sacre du Printemps\") is a ballet in two parts. The entire ballet was a concept developed by Igor Stravinsky. He wrote the music. The set and costumes were designed by Nicholas Roerich. The dances, which Stravinsky hated, were choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky. Stravinsky complained that Nijinsky had no understanding of the rudiments of music.\nThe ballet was first performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes at the Theatre du Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es in Paris on 29 May 1913. The dress rehearsal met with approval from critics and invited guests, but the premiere was greeted with tumult and riot only stilled by the performance of Marie Piltz as the sacrificial maiden. Subsequent performances were received with growing appreciation, but the ballet's great difficulties forced it to be presented only six times.\nThe ballet was revived in 1920 by the Ballets Russes, but the music had been performed in its entirety in concert before the revival. Nijinsky's dances had been forgotten so Leonide Massine (who had not seen the original performances) designed the dances anew. These met with Stravinsky's approval. In 1940, Walt Disney used the music to accompany a segment of the animated movie \"Fantasia\". This segment depicted lumbering dinosaurs and smoldering volcanoes.\nStravinsky's music.\nThe music lasts about 40 minutes, and is divided into two parts. It has the subtitle \"Pictures from Pagan Russia\". Stravinsky had the idea of composing music which was about country people from old times in Russia who danced a fertility rite. This means: a ceremony which is supposed to bring good luck to the next year\u2019s harvest. In this ancient Russian dance, one young girl is chosen to dance and dance until she dies. She is the sacrifice. She is sacrificed to the god of spring.\nHow Stravinsky wrote the score.\nThe painter Nicholas Roerich talked with Stravinsky about the idea for this ballet in 1910. Stravinsky started writing down musical ideas while he was still working on his ballet \"The Firebird\". Then he worked on \"Petrushka\". In 1912 he was able to concentrate on \"The Rite of Spring\". All these ballets were composed for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. They were a very famous group of Russian dancers who worked in Europe, mostly in Paris.\nFirst performance.\n\"The Rite of Spring\" was first performed by the Ballets Russes on 29 May 1913 at the Th\u00E9\u00E2tre des Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es in Paris. The conductor was Pierre Monteux. The audience were shocked at the primitive kind of dancing and the irregular rhythms and strange orchestral sounds and unusual chords. Nijinsky\u2019s choreography was so different from classical ballet. Nijinsky found it difficult to work with Stravinsky and difficult to work with the music.\n\"A certain part of the audience was thrilled by what it considered to be a blasphemous attempt to destroy music as an art, and, swept away with wrath, began very soon after the rise of the curtain, to make cat-calls and to offer audible suggestions as to how the performance should proceed. The orchestra played unheard, except occasionally when a slight lull occurred. The young man seated behind me in the box stood up during the course of the ballet to enable himself to see more clearly. The intense excitement under which he was labouring betrayed itself presently when he began to beat rhythmically on top of my head with his fists. My emotion was so great that I did not feel the blows for some time\".\nMarie Rambert heard someone in the gallery call out: \"Un docteur \u2026 un dentiste \u2026 deux docteurs\u2026\". The second performance (June 4) was fortunately less eventful, and, according to Maurice Ravel, the entire work could actually be heard.\nThe complicated music and violent dance steps caused some to boo. They started to shout and whistle. They argued, and other people who liked it argued back. Then some people started to fight. In the end the police were called. Stravinksy was very upset and ran out of the theatre. The performance was a scandal, but this actually made people curious and soon the ballet became very famous. It was performed six times that season, and there were no more interruptions during the other performances.\nMusical characteristics.\nStravinsky's music has many complex harmonies with dissonant sounds. There are passages with polyrhythms (several rhythms at once) as well as polytonality (music in several keys at once). The time signatures keep changing, and he often uses ostinati (repeated patterns).\nStravinsky wanted his music to describe the releasing of lots of energy. Most composers would have done this by using a lot of percussion instruments. However, although two players are needed for the timpani, there are not many other percussion instruments. Instead, the whole orchestra becomes a kind of percussion instrument. Also, the music often sounds like Russian folkmusic.\nThe dance.\nNijinsky's choreography was thought almost as shocking as the music. The idea is: a tribe sacrifices a young virgin each year in the Spring to please their gods, and make sure crops grow well. The dancers adopt a pigeon-toed stance (position); their moves are heavy. They move together in groups; their movements are like a ritual. They look like a primitive tribe performing a ritual. The ritual moves towards the sacrifice of the girl. \"The Rite of Spring\" is a link between classical ballet and Modern dance.p395\nReconstruction of Ballet.\nNijinsky's choreography has not been kept very well, but there have been efforts in recent years to reconstruct his performance, using costumes and set designs that look like the original ones from 1912.\nFantasia.\n\"The Rite of Spring\" became even more popular when Walt Disney used some of the music in his animated movie \"Fantasia\" in 1940. It is used in the film to describe early life on planet earth with dinosaurs roaming about.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Igor Stravinsky","offset":118},{"uri":"Vaslav_Nijinsky","surface_form":"Vaslav Nijinsky","offset":269},{"uri":"Diaghilev","surface_form":"Diaghilev","offset":404},{"uri":"Ballets_Russes","surface_form":"Ballets Russes","offset":416},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":1135},{"uri":"Fantasia_(1940_movie)","surface_form":"Fantasia","offset":1208},{"uri":"Countryside","surface_form":"country","offset":1481},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1514},{"uri":"Fertility","surface_form":"fertility","offset":1534},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremony","offset":1564},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":1629},{"uri":"Human_sacrifice","surface_form":"sacrifice","offset":1740},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":1776},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":1783},{"uri":"The_Firebird","surface_form":"The Firebird","offset":2003},{"uri":"Petrushka_(ballet)","surface_form":"Petrushka","offset":2037},{"uri":"Sergei_Diaghilev","surface_form":"Sergei Diaghilev","offset":2145},{"uri":"Ballets_Russes","surface_form":"Ballets Russes","offset":2164},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2243},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":2261},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_des_Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre des Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es","offset":2372},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":2402},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":2413},{"uri":"Pierre_Monteux","surface_form":"Pierre Monteux","offset":2427},{"uri":"Choreography","surface_form":"choreography","offset":2589},{"uri":"Marie_Rambert","surface_form":"Marie Rambert","offset":3441},{"uri":"Maurice_Ravel","surface_form":"Maurice Ravel","offset":3620},{"uri":"Boo","surface_form":"boo","offset":3737},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":3883},{"uri":"Scandal","surface_form":"scandal","offset":3979},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmonies","offset":4235},{"uri":"Dissonant","surface_form":"dissonant","offset":4250},{"uri":"Ostinato","surface_form":"ostinati","offset":4440},{"uri":"Percussion","surface_form":"percussion","offset":4597},{"uri":"Folkmusic","surface_form":"folkmusic","offset":4840},{"uri":"Virgin","surface_form":"virgin","offset":4971},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":5038},{"uri":"Modern_dance","surface_form":"Modern dance","offset":5360},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":5669},{"uri":"Fantasia_(film)","surface_form":"Fantasia","offset":5727},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":5802},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":5813}]}
