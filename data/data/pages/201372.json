{"id":201372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donington_Park","text":"Donington Park is a park and motor racing track near Derbyshire in North West Leicestershire, England.\nThe land was part of the Donington Hall estate. Tom Wheatcroft owns it. It is mainly used as a motor racing track, but the land is also used for music festivals and a Sunday market.\nIn July 2009, it was announced that the Formula One British Grand Prix would be at Donington Park from 2010 until 2020. However, by November that year, money had not been raised to improve the track and the hosting of the Grand Prix remained in doubt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":53},{"uri":"Leicestershire","surface_form":"Leicestershire","offset":78},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":94},{"uri":"Tom_Wheatcroft","surface_form":"Tom Wheatcroft","offset":151},{"uri":"Music_festival","surface_form":"music festival","offset":248},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":325},{"uri":"British_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"British Grand Prix","offset":337}]}
