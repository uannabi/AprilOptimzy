In fact, Maisonnave is the sixth most expensive avenue in the whole of Spain, which gives an idea of the importance that this street has. The Corte ingl\u00E9s has in this central street both branches that it possesses in Alicant, one at each end of the avenue.\nSanta Barbara's Castle is 166 metres up the Benacantil mountain. It's very strong with great strategic value. It's called Santa Barbara's Castle because the 4th of December is Santa Barbara's day and the 4th of December in 1248 is when it was taken from the Arabs by Alfonso of Castilla.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Valencian_language","surface_form":"Valencian","offset":23},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":48},{"uri":"Alicante_(province)","surface_form":"Alicante","offset":92},{"uri":"Valencian_Community","surface_form":"Valencian Community","offset":136},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":179},{"uri":"Valencian_Community","surface_form":"Valencian","offset":305},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":417},{"uri":"Elche","surface_form":"Elche","offset":446},{"uri":"List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_Spain_by_population","surface_form":"metropolitan area of Spain","offset":542},{"uri":"Harbour","surface_form":"port","offset":588},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist centre","offset":599},{"uri":"Semi-arid_climate","surface_form":"semi-arid climate","offset":628},{"uri":"Koeppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koeppen climate classification","offset":660},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":846},{"uri":"Corte_ingl%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Corte ingl\u00E9s","offset":917}]}
