{"id":20221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalquivir","text":"Guadalquivir is a river in southern Spain. It crosses the autonomous community of Andalusia. The name derives from the Arab \"Wadi al-Kabir\" (\"big river\"), whereas the Romans were called it \"Betis\".\nGuadalquivir starts in the Glen of the Sources in the mountains near Cazorla (Jaen province) and ends in Sanlucar de Barrameda (Cadiz province). It goes through the provinces of Jaen, Cordoba, Seville and Cadiz. The river is long. The main tributaries are the rivers Genil (which flows through Granada), The Minor Guadiana, Guadalbullon, and Guadajoz on the left side, and Guadalmena, Jandula, and Guadiato on the right.\nIt is the only river in Spain with shipping traffic. At present, it only is navigable up to Seville. In the Roman epoch it was navigable up to Cordoba.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":36},{"uri":"Andalusia","surface_form":"Andalusia","offset":82},{"uri":"Jaen_province","surface_form":"Jaen","offset":376},{"uri":"C%C3%B3rdoba_Province_(Spain)","surface_form":"Cordoba","offset":382},{"uri":"Seville_province","surface_form":"Seville","offset":391},{"uri":"Cadiz_province","surface_form":"Cadiz","offset":403},{"uri":"Genil","surface_form":"Genil","offset":465},{"uri":"Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":492},{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":711},{"uri":"C%C3%B3rdoba%2C_Andalusia","surface_form":"Cordoba","offset":762}]}
