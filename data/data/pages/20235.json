{"id":20235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane","text":"Methane is an organic compound with the chemical formula. It is an alkane with one carbon atom. It is often found as the main part of natural gas. Methane is a greenhouse gas 23 times more effective than carbon dioxide. It is also less stable and slowly oxidates by oxygen to carbon dioxide and water.\nUses.\nMethane is used in gas taps in places such as kitchens, chemistry classrooms, laboratories, etc. as it burns very easily because of its simple molecular structure.\nMolecular structure.\nMethane's molecular structure is very simple. It is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms.\nProduction.\nMethane can be made by many chemical ways, but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by fractional distillation, after it has become liquid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":14},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":40},{"uri":"Alkane","surface_form":"alkane","offset":67},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":90},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":134},{"uri":"Greenhouse_gas","surface_form":"greenhouse gas","offset":160},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":204},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":266},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":295},{"uri":"Gas_taps","surface_form":"gas taps","offset":327},{"uri":"Kitchen","surface_form":"kitchen","offset":354},{"uri":"Molecular_structure","surface_form":"molecular structure","offset":451},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":554},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":561},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":585},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":594},{"uri":"Fractional_distillation","surface_form":"fractional distillation","offset":711}]}
