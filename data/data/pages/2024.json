It can be compared to a postal address. An IP address is a long\nnumber written in binary. Since such numbers are difficult to communicate, IP addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order. Devices using IP addresses use the internet protocol to communicate.\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigns IP addresses to regional internet registries (RIRs). The RIRs assign them to Internet Service Providers. Internet Service Providers then assign IP addresses to their customers. Very often, people have a router or gateway at home, to which they connect computers, printers, and other devices. These routers or gateways are often configured to assign \"local\" IP addresses to the devices that are connected.\nEach address has two parts: One that specifies the computer or group of computers, and another which specifies the network. A device can have more than one IP address. Certain types of IP addresses are used to address a group of devices, while others are used to address only one device. Certain types of addresses are unique, others can be re-used. A number of IP addresses are used for special purposes, for example to obtain an IP address automatically.\nAn IP address is converted to physical or Media Access Control Address using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). If an IP address is your phone number, then your MAC address is your name. You may change your phone number, but your name will not change.\nExample.\nSuppose one of our friend wants to meet us but they don\u2019t know our address. He asks for our address & then we give our address like 02, Vidyapuri Road, Supaul, Bihar, India. After giving the address, he or she can easily locate our address. The same thing is done in case of internet. Every network is assigned an address.\nWho allocates IP Address.\nIANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates the IP address. IANA is responsible for the IP addressing system\nWhat an IP address looks like.\nAn IP address is a long binary number, made of ones and zeros. An IPv4 address is 32 binary digits (or bits) long. An IPv6 is 128 bits long, allowing many more IP addresses to be used. IP addresses are usually written in human-readable form, where 8 bits are grouped into one octet. IPv4 addresses are usually written as a group of four numbers. Each number can take a value from 0 to 255. IPv6 addresses are written as a group of eight hexadecimal numbers. Many Ipv6 addresses contain many zeroes. There are special rules which say that in certain cases, these zeroes do not need to be written.\nPublic and private addresses.\nCertain IP addresses can be assigned freely on the local area network. Since they are not unique, they are not routed on the internet. The addresses which can be freely assigned are called private IP addresses, the ones which are unique are called public. To be routed, a private address needs to be translated into a public one. This process of translating between private and public addresses is called network address translation, or NAT. Routers and firewalls often also perform this task.\nObtaining a new IP address.\nThere are different ways of getting a new IP address. One of them is called Bootstrap Protocol (usually shortened to BOOTP). The device that needs a new address, does not know what network it is in, so it uses an IP address of all zeroes (0.0.0.0) which it sends as a broadcast to the current network, on a special port. In addition, it sends the MAC address of the network card, plus a 4 byte random number. The BOOTP server will send a reply, also as broadcast, addressed to a different port. The reply will contain the mac address of the client, the random number, and the IP address of the client. When the client receives the data, it will set the address specified. If the BOOTP server is configured that way, it will also send the IP address and hostname of the BOOTP Server, the name and path to a file which should be loaded to boot the client (using TFTP) or the name of a directory, which the client should mount using NFS.\nDHCP extends BOOTP, and allows to send more information, such as the address of a time server, or information which is useful for routing.\nIP addresses obtained automatically can be dynamic or static. Static addressing means the same machine will always get the same IP address. With dynamic addresses, a device will get the next address which is not used. Dynamic addresses which are used need to be reviewed from time to time. If they are not renewed, they can be used for other devices.\nIP Version 4.\nWith IPv4, each address consists of four 8-digit binary numbers, called octets. An IPv4 address is 32 bits in total. The biggest number one can make with 8 regular digits is 99,999,999, but the biggest number one can make with 8 binary digits is 255 (11111111 in binary), so each octet can be any number from 0 to 255.\nEach octet is converted to its decimal form and separated by a period.\nAlso, there are special meanings associated with two different ending numbers. In general, a last number of 0 stands for the network (called \"base address\"), and a last number of 255 stands for all hosts on that network (called \"broadcast address\"). Computers that are on the same local network share 3 of the 4 numbers. A computer can be on more than one network. It can also have several names.\nPublic/Private addresses.\nThe problem with IPv4 is that it only allows for 4.3 billion addresses, and we've almost used them all. To delay this, Network Address Translation (NAT) was created. Network Address Translation has a network share one \"public\" IP address and give every computer on the network a \"private\" IP address. Everyone living in the same house uses the same address, but mail can be meant for multiple different people living in the house.\nSpecial IP addresses.\nThere are some IP addresses that are reserved for special purposes. For example, the address \"127.0.0.1\" is called the Loopback Address and will \"loop back\" any packets sent to this address back to the computer that sent them, like sending mail to yourself. Although this may not seem useful, it is used to test servers.\nNetwork.\nIt may define as the it identifies the class of network\nHost Part.\nIt may be define as the it identifies the host on network\nStatic IP Address.\nIt is a permanent internet address. It can\u2019t be changed in this we have to configure manually. It is used in smaller network all server uses static IP\u2019s. It is a simple way for Communication.\nDynamic IP Address.\nIt is a temporary internet address. It assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server from a specific range of IP address.\nIPv4 subnetting.\nTo make a network work faster, it is split up into subnets. To do this, an IP address contains a \"network\" ID, \"subnet\" ID, and a \"host\" ID. A special binary number called a Subnet Mask is used to determine the size of the network, subnet, and host IDs.\nThe original IPv4 only supported 254 networks, so in 1981 the Internet addressing specification was changed to a classful network architecture. Classful network design allowed for a larger number of individual networks. The first three bits of an IP address determined its \"class\". Three classes (\"A\", \"B\", and \"C\") were defined for normal computer communication (Unicast). The size of the network ID was based on the class of the IP address. Each class used more octets for the network ID, making the host ID smaller and reducing the number of possible hosts.\nClassful networks have been replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) since 1993. CIDR also provides a network address and host address. CIDR does not have classes, which means network and host address sizes don't have to be in octets.\nAn IPv4 Address in CIDR notation looks like\"192.168.0.14/24\"The slash and number represent the amount of bits that the network id uses, in this case 24 or 3 octets.\nIP Version 6.\nBecause IPv4 is only 32 bits, the number of available addresses will run out. To prevent this, an organization called the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created IP Version 6 (IPv6), which will eventually finish replacing IPv4.\nDNS.\nDNS stands for Domain Name System\nIt is also called service server. It is based on client server network architecture. It contain a database of public IP address. DNS is like a phonebook.\nOther versions.\nVersions before IPv4 were experimental and never widely used. Version 5 was used exclusively for the Internet Stream Protocol, which was also never widely used.\n__NOINDEX__\n__NONEWSECTIONLINK__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"computer network","offset":128},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":158},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":232},{"uri":"Binary_number","surface_form":"binary","offset":250},{"uri":"Internet_Protocol","surface_form":"internet protocol","offset":413},{"uri":"Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority","surface_form":"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority","offset":451},{"uri":"Regional_internet_registry","surface_form":"regional internet registries","offset":511},{"uri":"Internet_service_provider","surface_form":"Internet Service Providers","offset":572},{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"network","offset":1015},{"uri":"MAC_address","surface_form":"Media Access Control Address","offset":1399},{"uri":"Address_Resolution_Protocol","surface_form":"Address Resolution Protocol","offset":1438},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bits","offset":2223},{"uri":"Octet","surface_form":"octet","offset":2396},{"uri":"Hexadecimal_numeral_system","surface_form":"hexadecimal","offset":2557},{"uri":"Network_address_translation","surface_form":"network address translation","offset":3151},{"uri":"Router","surface_form":"Routers","offset":3188},{"uri":"Firewall_(networking)","surface_form":"firewalls","offset":3200},{"uri":"Bootstrap_Protocol","surface_form":"Bootstrap Protocol","offset":3344},{"uri":"Network_port","surface_form":"port","offset":3583},{"uri":"TFTP","surface_form":"TFTP","offset":4128},{"uri":"NFS","surface_form":"NFS","offset":4198},{"uri":"Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","surface_form":"DHCP","offset":4203},{"uri":"Octet","surface_form":"octets","offset":4779},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal","offset":5057},{"uri":"Network_address_translation","surface_form":"Network Address Translation","offset":5639},{"uri":"Loopback_Address","surface_form":"Loopback Address","offset":6092},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"servers","offset":6285},{"uri":"Subnet","surface_form":"subnets","offset":6867},{"uri":"Subnet_Mask","surface_form":"Subnet Mask","offset":6990},{"uri":"Classful_network","surface_form":"classful network","offset":7183},{"uri":"Unicast","surface_form":"Unicast","offset":7434},{"uri":"Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing","surface_form":"Classless Inter-Domain Routing","offset":7671},{"uri":"Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers","surface_form":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","offset":8176},{"uri":"Internet_Stream_Protocol","surface_form":"Internet Stream Protocol","offset":8617}]}
