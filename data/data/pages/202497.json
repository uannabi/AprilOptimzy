The yuan was instead of the Chinese \"tael\". The tael was common and was in use in Manchuria. A tael would buy about 40 grams of silver.\nHistory.\nThe Manchukuo yuan would buy 24 grams of silver in 1932. The price of silver changed and the yuan would not buy 24 grams of silver. To show that the yuan had value it was made equal to Japanese money. The Japanese money was called the yen. In 1940 the Manchukuo yuan was being used to measure Manchukuo exports and imports to America, Germany and Japan.\nThe paper money was in five values in 1932. Each piece of paper money is called a note. There was a one hundred yuan note, a ten yuan note, a five yuan note, a one yuan note and a small value note. A new 1000 yuan note was made in 1944.\nThe paper money or notes had pictures of Chinese emperors printed on them. The money was first made in Japan. Later they were made by the Bank in the Manchukuo capital of Hsinking (Hsinking is now called Changchun).\nThe Yuan was subdivided into 10 \"chiao\", 100 \"fen\" or 1000 \"li\". Coins were made that were worth 5 \"li\" and bigger values. The largest value coin was 10 \"fen\".\nIn 1944 and 1945, Manchukuo made coins of red or brown cardboard. These may be unique as to coining material, but they are not particularly scarce.\nOn January 1946 Manchukuo Yuan was replaced. The Chinese allowed people to swap 1 Manchukuo for a new type of money called a \"North-Eastern Yuan\". In 1948 these new yuan could be swapped by a \"Gold Yuan\". One Gold Yuan cost 150,000 \"North Eastern Yuans\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manchukuo","surface_form":"Empire of Manchukuo","offset":45},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":141},{"uri":"Manchuria","surface_form":"Manchuria","offset":231},{"uri":"Yen","surface_form":"yen","offset":529},{"uri":"Changchun","surface_form":"Hsinking","offset":1056},{"uri":"Changchun","surface_form":"Changchun","offset":1089},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"Coin","offset":1166},{"uri":"Cardboard","surface_form":"cardboard","offset":1316}]}
