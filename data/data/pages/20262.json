{"id":20262,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba","text":"Aruba is an island in the Caribbean Sea, just north of the Venezuelan Paraguan\u00E1 Peninsula. It is in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, it has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism, because visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather.\nThe island broke off from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986, hoping to gain its independence by 1996. In 1990, that effort stopped at the request of the island people.\nAruba is one of the four countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The other nations are the Netherlands, Cura\u00E7ao and Sint Maarten. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch.\nAbout three quarters of the Aruban gross national product is earned through tourism or related activities.\nThe island came into the news after U.S. high school student Natalee Holloway disappeared on a graduation trip on May 30, 2005. Today, some refer to Aruba as \"One Happy Island\".\nGeography.\nAruba is a generally flat, riverless island. It is in the southern part of the Caribbean Sea. The western and southern beaches have white sandy beaches. They are generally protected from the ocean currents. This is one of the reasons Aruba is a popular tourist location.\nTogether with Bonaire and Cura\u00E7ao, Aruba forms a group referred to as the ABC islands. Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean.\nAruba has no administrative subdivisions. For census purposes, it is divided into eight regions. Its capital is Oranjestad.\nPeople.\nThe Aruba population is about 75% mixed, 15% black, and 10% white.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":12},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":26},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":59},{"uri":"Paraguan%C3%A1_Peninsula","surface_form":"Paraguan\u00E1 Peninsula","offset":70},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Kingdom of the Netherlands","offset":104},{"uri":"Netherlands_Antilles","surface_form":"Netherlands Antilles","offset":363},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":412},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Kingdom of the Netherlands","offset":549},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":603},{"uri":"Cura%C3%A7ao","surface_form":"Cura\u00E7ao","offset":616},{"uri":"Sint_Maarten","surface_form":"Sint Maarten","offset":628},{"uri":"Gross_national_product","surface_form":"gross national product","offset":748},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":861},{"uri":"Natalee_Holloway","surface_form":"Natalee Holloway","offset":881},{"uri":"Missing_person","surface_form":"disappeared","offset":898},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduation","offset":915},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":1088},{"uri":"Bonaire","surface_form":"Bonaire","offset":1294},{"uri":"Cura%C3%A7ao","surface_form":"Cura\u00E7ao","offset":1306},{"uri":"ABC_islands_(Lesser_Antilles)","surface_form":"ABC islands","offset":1354},{"uri":"Dutch_Caribbean","surface_form":"Dutch Caribbean","offset":1453},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":1516},{"uri":"Oranjestad%2C_Aruba","surface_form":"Oranjestad","offset":1582}]}
