{"id":202664,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitride","text":"=\"preserve\">In chemistry, a nitride is a compound of nitrogen with a less electronegative element, attached together in a specific way. Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications.\nMost of the names for nitrides follow a simple pattern: the name of the element attached to the nitrogen, then \"nitride\". So, GaN would be gallium nitride.\nThere are some exceptions, however, for the compounds that has had a usual name before. For example, NH3 is not called \"hydrogen nitride\", even if it is the most simple of this class of molecules, but it is still commonly called ammonia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":15},{"uri":"Electronegativity","surface_form":"electronegative","offset":74},{"uri":"Gallium","surface_form":"gallium","offset":365},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":611}]}
