{"id":20278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia","text":"Andalusia () is the first in population among the 17 Autonomous communities in Spain and the second, after of Madrid, in area. The territory is divided into eight provinces: Almer\u00EDa, C\u00E1diz, C\u00F3rdoba, Granada, Huelva, Ja\u00E9n, M\u00E1laga and Seville. Its capital is the city of Seville (Spanish: \"Sevilla\").\nAndalusia is in the south of the Iberian peninsula, just to the south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha; west of the autonomous community of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. The small British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar shares a land border with the Andalusian province of C\u00E1diz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nHistory.\nThe name Andalusia is the modern version of the Arabic language \"Al-Andalus\" (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062F\u0644\u0633), name used by the Muslims for all of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula under their control. During that period, northern Iberian Peninsula was controlled by Christian kings and the southern Iberian Peninsula was controlled by Muslims.\nIn 711 CE, the Muslims invaded the Iberian Peninsula, then controlled by Christians of Visigothic origin. By 719 the Muslims conquered all of the peninsula except for a small area in the northern Pyrenees Mountains. The Muslims used the name Al-Andalus for all of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula under their control.\nChristians in the north waged war for more than seven centuries against the Muslims, gradually taking over more and more of the southern areas. This process of war is called the \"Reconquista\" (a Spanish and Portuguese word meaning \"to conquest again\"). In the year 1492, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain retook the last stronghold in the southern area at Granada. In that same year, the Muslims and Jews were forced to leave Spain.\nSymbols.\nThe Andalusian coat of arms shows the figure of Hercules and two lions between the two pillars of Hercules that tradition puts on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. The words below read \"Andaluc\u00EDa por s\u00ED, para Espa\u00F1a y la Humanidad\" (\"Andalusia by herself, for Spain and Humanity\"). Over the two columns is an arch in the colors of the flag of Andalusia, with the Latin words \"Dominator Hercules Fundator\".\nThe official flag of Andalusia has three equal horizontal stripes, colored green, white, and green respectively; the Andalusian coat of arms is on the central stripe. It was approved in a meeting in 1918 of Andalusian nationalists at Ronda, a city in the province of M\u00E1laga.\nThe anthem of Andalusia was composed by Jos\u00E9 del Castillo D\u00EDaz with lyrics by Blas Infante. The music was inspired by \"Santo Dios\", a religious folk song sung at harvest time by peasants.\nThe national holiday, the \"D\u00EDa de Andaluc\u00EDa\", is celebrated on 28 February.\nGeography.\nAndalusia is one of the 17 Spanish autonomous communities and is in the southwestern region of the European Union. It has a surface area of, 17.3 percent of the territory of Spain. By area, it is the second Spanish autonomous community.\nThe natural limits of Andalusia are: to the south, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea; to the north, the Sierra Morena, mountain range that separates Andalusia from the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha; to the west is Portugal; and to the east is Murcia.\nRelief.\nAndalusia has the Iberian peninsula's highest mountains and nearly 15 percent of its terrain over. The picture is similar for areas under (with the Baetic Depression), and for the variety of slopes.\nThe Atlantic coast is mostly beach and gradually sloping coasts; the Mediterranean coast has many cliffs. These differences divide the region naturally into Upper Andalusia (two mountainous areas) and Lower Andalusia (the broad basin of the Guadalquivir).\nClimate.\nIn general, Andalusia has a Mediterranean climate, except in the Valley of Granada (), with occasional heavy rains and extremely hot temperatures.\nRainfall decreases from west to east. The place in Andalusia with the highest rainfall is in the Sierra de Grazalema (per year) and the driest place is Cabo de Gata, the place with the least amount of rainfall in Europe with only of rain per year.\nThe average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over. Averages in the cities range from in Baeza to in M\u00E1laga. Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about. The coldest month is January when Granada at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of. The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of for Andalusia as a whole. C\u00F3rdoba is the hottest provincial capital, followed by Seville.\nThe mountain ranges are cooler than the plains and have a higher rainfall with some snow in winter. The Sierra Nevada, above, is snow covered for most of the year.\nRivers.\nAndalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the Guadiana, Odiel-Tinto, Guadalquivir, Guadalete, and Barbate. Flowing to the Mediterranean are the Guadiaro, Guadalhorce, Guadalmedina, Guadalfeo, Andarax (also known as the Almer\u00EDa) and Almanzora. Of these, the Guadalquivir is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at.\nPeople.\nThe Andalusians are the inhabitants of Andalusia of the southern region in Iberian Peninsula. They are generally considered an ethnically distinct peoples because of the two of the most important markers of distinctiveness: their own language and an awareness of a presumed common origin. Andalusian is said to be a distinct dialect of Spanish, although it is debatable, according to the nationalists. The Andalusians have a rich culture which includes the famous flamenco style of music and dance, even though it was adopted by the Spanish gypsies who have changed it and monopolized into their own culture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ranked_list_of_Spanish_autonomous_communities_by_population","surface_form":"first in
