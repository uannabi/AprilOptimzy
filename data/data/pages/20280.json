The population is 130,000, but it is the centre of a metropolitan area, the Bay of Cadiz, with more than 500,000 inhabitants.\nCadiz is known for its attractive beaches where many nautical sports can be practiced. This is possible thanks to the excellent climate all year round. It is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe and it used to be one of the most imporant Spanish ports during the Spanish Golden Age and the Age of Discovery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":11},{"uri":"Province_of_C%C3%A1diz","surface_form":"Province","offset":40},{"uri":"Andalusia","surface_form":"Andalusia","offset":62},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":111}]}
