{"id":20289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","text":"Bosnia~Herzegovina or Bosnia-Herzegovina (locally: \"Bosna i Hercegovina/\u0411\u043E\u0441\u043D\u0430 \u0438 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433\u043E\u0432\u0438\u043D\u0430\", most commonly abbreviated as \"BiH/\u0411\u0438\u0425\") is a country in Southeastern Europe, with an area of 51,197 km2 and 4,600,000 people. Countries around Bosnia and Herzegovina are Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro. The capital is Sarajevo, and other important cities are Banja Luka, Mostar, Zenica and Tuzla.\nHistory.\nThe first state in Bosnia and Herzegovina was in the Middle Ages. During the Ottoman Empire, it was a very important province in the Balkans and the capital, Sarajevo, had 100,000 people. In 1878, it became a province of Austria-Hungary when the Empire took over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908. In 1914 the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, were assassinated in Sarajevo, leading to World War I. From 1918 until 1992, the country was a part of the former Yugoslavia. After a 3-year long war, Bosnia and Herzegovina proclaimed independence as a country consisting mostly of Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims.\nDivisions.\nThe country is divided into two entities: Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. These are then divided into 10 cantons.\nCities.\nThis is a list of the ten largest towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only Sarajevo and Banja Luka have more than 200,000 people.\nSports.\nBosnia and Herzegovina has produced many athletes. Many of them were famous in the Yugoslav national teams before Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence.\nThe most important international sporting event in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the hosting of the 14th Winter Olympics, held in Sarajevo.\nThe Borac handball club has won seven Yugoslav Handball Championships, as well as the European Championship Cup in 1976 and the International Handball Federation Cup in 1991.\nThe Bosna basketball club from Sarajevo were European Champions in 1979. The Yugoslav national basketball team medaled in every world championship from 1963 through 1990. The team included Bosnian players such as Dra\u017Een Dalipagi\u0107 and Mirza Deliba\u0161i\u0107. Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly qualifies for the European Championship in Basketball. Jedinstvo Aida women's basketball club, based in Tuzla, has won the 1989 European Championships in Florence.\nBosnia has many world-class basketball players, notably Mirza Teletovi\u0107, the first Bosnian in the NBA. Among others are, Elmedin Kikanovi\u0107, Nihad \u0110edovi\u0107, Ognjen Kuzmi\u0107, Jusuf Nurki\u0107, Ned\u017Ead Sinanovi\u0107, and Nemanja Mitrovi\u0107.\nThe Tuzla-Sinalco karate club from Tuzla has won the most Yugoslav championships, as well as four European Championships and one World Championship.\nThe Bosnian chess team has been Champion of Yugoslavia seven times. In addition the club \u0160K Bosna Sarajevo won four Chess Club Cup: 1994 in Lyon, 1999 in Bugojno, 2000 in Neum, and 2001 in Kallithea Elassonos. Chess grandmaster Borki Predojevi\u0107 has also won European Championships: Under-12 years Litochoro (Greece) in 1999, and Under-14 years Kallithea Elassonos (Greece) in 2001, and in 2003 won World Championship Under-16 years Halkidiki (Greece).\nMiddle-weight boxer Marijan Bene\u0161 has won several Championships of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslav Championships and the European Championship. In 1978 he won the World Title against Elisha Obed from the Bahamas. Another middle-weight boxer, Anton Josipovi\u0107 won the Olympic Gold in Los Angeles, 1984. He also won Yugoslav Championship in 1982, the Championship of the Balkans in 1983, and the Belgrade Trophy in 1985.\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It dates from 1903, but its popularity grew significantly after World War I. At the local level, FK Sarajevo (1967 and 1984), \u017Deljezni\u010Dar (1972) have both won the Yugoslav Championship. The former Yugoslav national football team has included a number of Bosnian players, such as Josip Katalinski, Bla\u017E Sli\u0161kovi\u0107, Du\u0161an Bajevi\u0107, Enver Mari\u0107, Mehmed Ba\u017Edarevi\u0107, Ivica Osim, Safet Su\u0161i\u0107, Vahidin Musemi\u0107 and Mirsad Fazlagi\u0107.\nToday, the team of Bosnia and Herzegovina has modern footballers like Edin D\u017Eeko, Zvjezdan Misimovi\u0107, Vedad Ibi\u0161evi\u0107, Emir Spahi\u0107, Asmir Begovi\u0107, Miralem Pjani\u0107, Sejad Salihovi\u0107, Senad Luli\u0107 and others. The independent Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team has not qualified for a European or World Championship but has played twice in the play-off stages.\nBosnian national teams have struggled to draft the best national players. Many players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina choose to play for other countries because of their ethnic identification. For example, Nikica Jelavi\u0107 and Vedran \u0106orluka were both born in Bosnia and Herzegovina but play for Croatia. Other internationally famous players from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have made similar choices, are: Dejan Lovren, Mladen Petri\u0107, Mario Stani\u0107, Neven Suboti\u0107, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Marko Marin, Boris \u017Divkovi\u0107, Zlatko Junuzovi\u0107, Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107.\nBosnia and Herzegovina was the world champion of volleyball at the 2004 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics. Many among those on the team lost their legs in the Bosnian War.\nCuisine.\nBosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water. The sauces are fully natural, with little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, dried beans, fresh beans, plums, milk, paprika and cream called Pavlaka. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between Western and Eastern influences. As a result of the Ottoman administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to Turkish, Greek, and other former Ottoman and Mediterranean cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include mostly beef and lamb. Some local specialties are \u0107evapi, burek, dolma, sarma, pilaf, goulash, ajvar and a whole range of Eastern sweets. Local wines come from Herzegovina where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian loza (similar to Italian Grappa but less sweet) is very popular. Plum or apple alcohol beverages are made in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of brandy. Brandy is the base of most alcoholic drinks.\nCoffeehouses, where Bosnian coffee is served in d\u017Eezva with rahat lokum and sugar cubes, are in many places in Sarajevo and every city in the country. Coffee drinking is a favorite Bosnian pastime and part of the culture. Bosnians are believed to be some of the heaviest coffee drinkers in the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Southeastern_Europe","surface_form":"Southeastern
