{"id":2029,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural","text":"e=\"preserve\">In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., \"-32 degrees, no bananas\", \"0.5 liters\", \"1.2 grams\", \"two times\", \"three fish\", \"20 mothers\"). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., \"one time\", \"a glass\", \"the sun\", \"my mother\", \"Jennifer\"). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., \"water\", \"the meat\", \"some space\", etc.).\nIn many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In English, the normal plural suffix \"i\"s \"-s\" (e.g., \"cat\" is singular, and \"cats\" is plural).\nPlurals in English.\nIt is fair to say that most native English speakers do make mistakes in this area: it is one of the more troublesome aspects of the English language.\nOther languages.\nAll European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each one of these other languages is different from the suffix that is applied to English nouns.\nIn other languages, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is usually no plural ending.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistics","offset":16},{"uri":"Noun_phrase","surface_form":"noun phrase","offset":29},{"uri":"Grammatical_number","surface_form":"grammatical number","offset":47},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":580},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":656},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":683},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1087},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":1130},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":1139},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1150}]}
