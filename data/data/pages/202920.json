{"id":202920,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process","text":"e=\"preserve\">A process is a series of stages in time where the last stage is the product, result or goal.\nProcesses may be \"planned\" or \"unplanned\".\nA process planned by humans has a purpose. It is a course of action, or a procedure, to achieve a result, or an end-product. The sequence from start to finish is the plan. A plan may be written, or programmed, or just held in the mind. Examples include building a house, fighting a battle. sowing crops; organising a wedding.\nNatural processes are not planned by humans. They are investigated and described. Examples: volcanic eruption, the evolution of the solar system; biological evolution; the melting of ice and other phase changes; the process of development from egg to adult.\nProcesses often repeat whenever certain conditions hold. Example: car low on petrol/gas, visit garage and refill. Most computer programs are of this type. Processes may be circular: planets revolve around sun; eggs produce chickens, and chickens produce eggs. Rain water flows into rivers, evaporates, and returns as rain.\nProcesses, especially those which are cyclical, may be subject to feedback. A simple case is a central heating system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":48},{"uri":"Result","surface_form":"result","offset":90},{"uri":"Goal","surface_form":"goal","offset":100},{"uri":"Planning","surface_form":"planned","offset":124},{"uri":"Action","surface_form":"action","offset":210},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"written","offset":335},{"uri":"Program","surface_form":"program","offset":347},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":379},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":431},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":466},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"volcanic eruption","offset":567},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":607},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":632},{"uri":"Melting","surface_form":"melting","offset":647},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":658},{"uri":"Phase_change","surface_form":"phase change","offset":672},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":702},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":719},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":726},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"Rain","offset":993},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1015},{"uri":"Evaporate","surface_form":"evaporate","offset":1023},{"uri":"Feedback","surface_form":"feedback","offset":1122},{"uri":"Heating","surface_form":"heating","offset":1159}]}
