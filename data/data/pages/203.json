{"id":203,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance","text":"Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. It is also a measure of the space between two things. It can be measured along any path. Thus, someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance, even though his position has not changed.\nIn geometry, the distance between two points \"A\" and \"B\" is sometimes written as formula_1. Pythagorean theorem is often used in the calculation of distance. Distance is a scalar, and thus is different from displacement. Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line (and in only one path). Displacement is the shortest way to travel the distance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measure","offset":66},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"position","offset":225},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":254},{"uri":"Pythagorean_theorem","surface_form":"Pythagorean theorem","offset":343},{"uri":"Scalar","surface_form":"scalar","offset":423},{"uri":"Displacement_vector","surface_form":"displacement","offset":458},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":490}]}
