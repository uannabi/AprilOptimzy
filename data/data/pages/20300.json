{"id":20300,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarck_(ship)","text":"The German battleship \"Bismarck\" was built by Nazi Germany and was one of the most famous and recognized warships of World War II. It only sailed for one mission, known as Operation \"Rhein\u00FCbung\", It's construction began on July 1, 1936 in a shipyard in Hamburg, Germany and was launched in February 14, 1940. The \"Bismarck\" class battleship was one of the largest battleships built by any European power and the were the largest built by Nazi Germany with her sister ship \"Tirpitz\" being the second \"Bismarck-class battleship.\"\nDescription.\nThe \"Bismarck\" and \"Tirpitz\" were planned in the mid 1930's by the German Kriegsmarine to counter France and its own naval expansion. Construction began in 1936 and were supposed to fall within the 35,000 long ton limit as imposed by the Washington regime and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement during the Interwar period. Both of them secretly ignored the limits but before it's completion, the agreement and the treaty fell apart due to Japan's withdrawal in 1937. \"Bismarck\" weighed 41,700t (long tons) and 50,300 t (49,500 long tons) when fully loaded and had a overall length of 251m (823 ft 6in) which was the largest built than any other European power until HMS Vanguard after the war. \"Bismarck\" had a top speed of 30.01 knots (55.58 km/h; 34.53 mph) during trials and had a max distance of 16,430 km (10,210 mi) without refuels. Bismarck had a crew of 2000-2200 and had them divided into twelve divisions of 180-200 per division and half of them were assigned to main and secondary weaponry while the other half were support crew. (Cooks, Radio Operators) The \"Bismarck\" had an armament of eight 38cm (15in) guns, twelve 15cm (5.9in) guns, sixteen 10.5cm (4.1in) guns, sixteen 3.7 (1.5in) guns, and twelve 2cm (0.79in) guns. \"Bismarck's\" main belt had a thickness of 320mm (12.6in) and was additionally covered with upper and main armor deck ranging from 50mm to 120mm (2in to 4.7in) while the turret faces were protected by 360mm (14.2in) fronts while the sides were 220mm (8.7in) thick.\nOperation \"Rhein\u00FCbung\".\nOn May 5th 1941 Hitler commenced Operation Rhein\u00FCbung to sever Britain's lifeline which consisted of merchant ships brining vital supplies such as food and raw materials and if it was severed Britain would be forced to either sue for peace, negotiate an armistice or leave the British Isles. The goal of Rhein\u00FCbung was to break into the Atlantic ocean and attacked allied merchant ships transporting essential goods. German Naval Command (OKM) established a network of tankers and supply ships around the area \"Bismarck\" and \"Prinz Eugen\" sailed. Britain knew Nazi Germany was going to attack these supply lines and stationed multiple battlecruisers, aircraft carriers, and battleships.\nBattle of Denmark Strait.\nAt 05:45 24th of May, German lookouts spotted smoke in the distance which turned out to be from two of the Royal Navy's ships called HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales. At 05:52 \"Hood\" opened fire at what they thought was \"Bismarck\" but instead of \"Prinz Eugen\" while \"Prince of Wales\" fired on \"Bismarck\". Both \"Prince of Wales\" and \"Hood\" attacked \"Bismarck\" and \"Prinz Eugen\" head on only allowing them to use their front guns while \"Bismarck\" and \"Prinz Eugen\" could fire with all their weaponry. After several minutes of shelling, \"Hood\" turned 20\u00B0 left to use its rear turrets and after a minute of firing, \"Prinz Eugen\" scored a hit on \"Hood\" causing an ammunition fire which was quickly extinguished. \"Bismarck\" fired three salvos which caused it to find the range to \"Hood\" and the order to rapid-fire was given. \"Hood\" turned 20\u00B0 to the left again to make itself parallel with \"Bismarck\" and \"Prinz Eugen. Prinz Eugen\" shifted its fire towards \"Prince of Wales\" to keep both British ships under fire and scored a couple of hits on \"Wales.\" \"Prinz Eugen\" was ordered to move behind \"Bismarck\" to keep track of \"Norfolk\" and \"Suffolk.\" At 06:00 \"Hood\" was completing her second turn to the left when \"Bismarck's\" salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short while one of the shells struck \"Hood's\" thin deck armor and caused 112 t (110 long tons) of ammo to explode causing \"Hood\" to split in half in only eight minutes and only three out of 1149 crew survived. After the sinking of \"Hood, Bismarck\" redirected its fire towards \"Prince of Wales\" and hit \"Wales\" directly in the bridge killing all but 3 officers and was still being fired upon and guns were malfunctioning on the new battleship and after scoring a bunch of ineffective hits on \"Bismarck\", the order was given to retreat at 06:13","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battleship","surface_form":"battleship","offset":11},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":46},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warships","offset":105},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":117},{"uri":"Bismarck_class_battleship","surface_form":"\"Bismarck\" class battleship","offset":313},{"uri":"Tirpitz","surface_form":"Tirpitz","offset":473},{"uri":"Bismarck-class_battleship","surface_form":"Bismarck-class battleship","offset":500},{"uri":"Tirpitz","surface_form":"Tirpitz","offset":561},{"uri":"Kriegsmarine","surface_form":"Kriegsmarine","offset":615},{"uri":"Long_ton","surface_form":"long ton","offset":746},{"uri":"Washington_regime","surface_form":"Washington regime","offset":779},{"uri":"Anglo-german_naval_agreement","surface_form":"Anglo-German Naval Agreement","offset":805},{"uri":"Interwar_period","surface_form":"Interwar period","offset":845},{"uri":"Fully_loaded","surface_form":"fully loaded","offset":1082},{"uri":"Overall_length","surface_form":"overall length","offset":1105},{"uri":"HMS_Vanguard","surface_form":"HMS Vanguard","offset":1205},{"uri":"Knot_(speed)","surface_form":"knots","offset":1269},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":2622},{"uri":"Battle_cruiser","surface_form":"battlecruisers","offset":2697},{"uri":"Aircraft_carrier","surface_form":"aircraft carriers","offset":2713},{"uri":"Battleship","surface_form":"battleships","offset":2736},{"uri":"HMS_Hood","surface_form":"HMS Hood","offset":2908},{"uri":"HMS_Prince_of_Wales","surface_form":"HMS Prince of Wales","offset":2921}]}
