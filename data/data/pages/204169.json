A \u201Cbenedict\u201D was slang for a newly married gent who had been single for a very long time. Many of these\"benedict\" did not take well to married life and often sought refuge of strange beds and bedfellows. It is for them that the dish was named.\nIn an interview in \"The New Yorker\" magazine in 1942, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered \"buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon and a hooker of hollandaise.\" Oscar Tschirky, the \"ma\u00EEtre d'h\u00F4tel\", was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham and a toasted English muffin for the bacon and toast.\nCraig Claiborne, in September 1967, wrote a column in \"The New York Times Magazine\" about a letter he had received from Edward P. Montgomery, an American living in France. In it, Montgomery related that the dish was created by Commodore E.C. Benedict, a banker and yachtsman, who died in 1920 at the age of 86. Montgomery also included a recipe for eggs Benedict, stating that the recipe had been given to him by his mother, who had received it from her brother, who was a friend of the Commodore.\nPublished references.\nDates given refer to date of publication.\n1898 \u2014 In \"Eggs, and how to use them\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as \"split and toast some small muffins; put on each a nice round slice of broiled ham, and on the ham the poached egg; pour over some Hollandaise sauce\"\n1900 \u2014 In \"The Connecticut Magazine: an Illustrated Monthly, Volume VI\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as \"A third variety is called Eggs Benedict.

Serve individually.\"\n1907 \u2014 In \"Many Ways for Cooking Eggs\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given that starts with the muffins. Unlike yeast leavened English muffins, the recipe muffins use baking powder and beaten egg whites for leavening; however, they are still baked on a griddle in muffin rings. The remainder of the recipe reads \"Broil thin slices of ham. Make a sauce Hollandaise. Chop a truffle. Poach the required number of eggs. Dish the muffins, put a square of ham on each, then a poached egg and cover each egg nicely with sauce Hollandaise.

On tasting it, great chefs have broken their egg-beaters over their knees and wept in jealousy! It is made of butter fragrant from timothy and alfalfa, eggs to which their mothers are still clucking at this hour, lemon and pungent spices! It is not profaned with a drop of oil or any substitutes. Serve it over cauliflower, artichokes, lettuce, eggs Benedict, fish, singing 'Broccoli, Broccoli,' as you eat\".\n1942 \u2014 In an interview in \"The New Yorker\", Lemuel Benedict claims to have originated the dish with an order at the Waldorf Hotel, hoping for a hangover cure.\n1967 \u2014 Craig Claiborne writes in \"The New York Times Magazine\" that Edward P.
