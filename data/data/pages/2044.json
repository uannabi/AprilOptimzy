{"id":2044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics","text":"General semantics is a philosophy that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning. It was created by Alfred Korzybski during the 1920s and early 1930s.\nThe goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something, either mentally or in language, that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified. How people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality. General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen, heard, felt, or believed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":23},{"uri":"Alfred_Korzybski","surface_form":"Alfred Korzybski","offset":137},{"uri":"1920s","surface_form":"1920s","offset":165},{"uri":"1930s","surface_form":"1930s","offset":181},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mentally","offset":280},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":295},{"uri":"Reality","surface_form":"reality","offset":394}]}
