{"id":204602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrewsarchus","text":"\"Andrewsarchus mongoliensis\" (Andrews + Greek \u1F00\u03C1\u03C7\u03CC\u03C2, \"ruler\"), was a mammalian Mesonychid predator.\nThis large heavily-built, wolf-like, mammal lived during the Eocene, about 45 to 36 million years ago. It walked on four short legs and had a long body, a long tail, and feet with hoofed toes. It had a long snout with large, sharp teeth and flat cheek teeth that may have been used to crush bones.\nBecause \"Andrewsarchus\" is only known from a skull and a few other bones, whether it was an active predator or merely a large scavenger is open to debate, as is its exact time range.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":40},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":69},{"uri":"Mesonychid","surface_form":"Mesonychid","offset":79},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":90},{"uri":"Wolf","surface_form":"wolf","offset":126},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":161},{"uri":"Hoof","surface_form":"hoof","offset":280},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":497}]}
