{"id":20468,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin","text":"Odin (Old Norse: \"\u00D3\u00F0inn\") is the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic in Norse mythology. Son of Bor and the giantess (j\u00F6tunn) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the \u00C6sir and king of Asgard. He is married to the goddess Frigg, and is father to the gods Thor, Baldr, H\u00F6\u00F0r, V\u00ED\u00F0arr, and V\u00E1li.\nKnown as the All-Father, Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, along with the wolves Geri and Freki; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir, which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said to never miss its target.\nA defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from the Well of Ur\u00F0r, which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being M\u00EDmir, which recites secret knowledge to him. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to Valhalla, Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to F\u00F3lkvangr, Freyja's realm. Odin was known in Old English as W\u014Dden, in Old Saxon as W\u014Ddan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or W\u014Dtan'\", all of which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *\"w\u014D\u0111anaz\".\nThe modern English weekday name Wednesday bears the god\u2019s name. (from Old English \"W\u014Ddnesd\u00E6g\", \u201CW\u014Dden\u2019s day\u201D).\nFamily.\nOdin is the son of Borr and the j\u00F6tunn Bestla. He is married to the goddess Frigg, by whom he is the father of the twin gods Baldr and H\u00F6\u00F0r. With the giantesses Gr\u00ED\u00F0r and Rindr, Odin has two other sons named V\u00ED\u00F0arr and V\u00E1li. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder, born to him by J\u00F6r\u00F0, the personification of the Earth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":6},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tnar","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunn","offset":134},{"uri":"%C3%86sir","surface_form":"\u00C6sir","offset":175},{"uri":"Asgard","surface_form":"Asgard","offset":192},{"uri":"Frigg","surface_form":"Frigg","offset":229},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":262},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":268},{"uri":"H%C3%B6%C3%B0r","surface_form":"H\u00F6\u00F0r","offset":275},{"uri":"Vidar","surface_form":"V\u00ED\u00F0arr,","offset":281},{"uri":"V%C3%A1li_(son_of_Odin)","surface_form":"V\u00E1li","offset":293},{"uri":"Hugin_and_Munin","surface_form":"Huginn and Muninn","offset":365},{"uri":"Geri_and_Freki","surface_form":"Geri and Freki","offset":406},{"uri":"Sleipnir","surface_form":"Sleipnir","offset":476},{"uri":"Gungnir","surface_form":"Gungnir","offset":514},{"uri":"Ur%C3%B0arbrunnr","surface_form":"Well of Ur\u00F0r","offset":741},{"uri":"M%C3%ADmir","surface_form":"M\u00EDmir","offset":901},{"uri":"Valkyries","surface_form":"Valkyries","offset":1012},{"uri":"Valhalla","surface_form":"Valhalla","offset":1042},{"uri":"Freyja","surface_form":"Freyja's","offset":1119},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":1153},{"uri":"Wednesday","surface_form":"Wednesday","offset":1343},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":1381},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tnar","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunn","offset":1462},{"uri":"Frigg","surface_form":"Frigg","offset":1506},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":1555},{"uri":"H%C3%B6%C3%B0r","surface_form":"H\u00F6\u00F0r","offset":1565},{"uri":"Grid_(Jotun)","surface_form":"Gr\u00ED\u00F0r","offset":1591},{"uri":"Vidar","surface_form":"V\u00ED\u00F0arr","offset":1638},{"uri":"V%C3%A1li_(son_of_Odin)","surface_form":"V\u00E1li","offset":1649},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":1673},{"uri":"J%C3%B6r%C3%B0","surface_form":"J\u00F6r\u00F0","offset":1710}]}
