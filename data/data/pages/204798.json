It lies on the banks of River Swat about 2\u00A0km from Saidu Sharif, the capital of Swat.\nIn 1998 the population of Mingora was about 175,000. The city was once a major tourist destination and was described by Queen Elizabeth as the \"Switzerland\" of the former British Empire.\nHowever because of the Taliban, tourism has suffered due to fighting between the Taliban and the government. In March 2009 the city came under Taliban rule due to a peace agreement with the government. But the agreement was soon broken and in May 2009 the government were fighting with the Taliban to end their occupation of the city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swat_District","surface_form":"Swat District","offset":31},{"uri":"Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","surface_form":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","offset":46},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":66},{"uri":"Saidu_Sharif","surface_form":"Saidu Sharif","offset":127},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth","offset":282},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":306},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"former British Empire","offset":326},{"uri":"Taliban","surface_form":"Taliban","offset":372}]}
