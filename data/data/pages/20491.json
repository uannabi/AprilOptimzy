{"id":20491,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Diplomacy is the use of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge. It may include the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner. Diplomacy often involves countries making an agreement with each other, such as a treaty. Diplomacy is the talk between the representatives of states, such as their heads of state. Sometimes, these talks are about trade or business, and sometimes they are about war and peace. Diplomacy happens a lot when two or more countries fight.\nDiplomats are people that are sent from their home country, to meet with and talk to diplomats and leaders of foreign countries. An important type of diplomat is called an ambassador. An ambassador lives in a foreign country and works in an embassy to be available for meetings with the government of that country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tact","surface_form":"tact","offset":37},{"uri":"Advantage","surface_form":"advantage","offset":60},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solutions","offset":101},{"uri":"Challenge","surface_form":"challenge","offset":123},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":245},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":302},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":363},{"uri":"Heads_of_state","surface_form":"heads of state","offset":385},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":434},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":443},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":482},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":490},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":606},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"ambassador","offset":727},{"uri":"Embassy","surface_form":"embassy","offset":796}]}
