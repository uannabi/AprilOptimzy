{"id":204923,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakicetus","text":"Pakicetus is a genus of extinct cetaceans found in the early Eocene of Pakistan 55.8 \u00B1 0.2 - 33.9 \u00B1 0.1 million years ago (mya). The strata where the fossils were found was then on the coast of the Tethys Sea.\nDescription.\nThe first fossil, a lone skull, was thought to be a mesonychid, but Gingerich and Russell recognized it as an early cetacean. It had characteristics of the inner ear which are found only in cetaceans: the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only. This suggests that it is a transitional species between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans.\nComplete skeletons were discovered in 2001. \"Pakicetus\" was mainly a land animal, about the size of a wolf, and very similar in form to the related mesonychids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cetacean","surface_form":"cetacean","offset":32},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":61},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":71},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":133},{"uri":"Tethys_Sea","surface_form":"Tethys Sea","offset":198},{"uri":"Mesonychid","surface_form":"mesonychid","offset":275},{"uri":"Inner_ear","surface_form":"inner ear","offset":379},{"uri":"Transitional_species","surface_form":"transitional species","offset":519},{"uri":"Mesonychid","surface_form":"mesonychid","offset":739}]}
