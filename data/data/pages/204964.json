Dahlerup, who specialised in Italian Renaissance style design had previously designed the Hotel D\u2019Angleterre, Jesus Church in Valby, National Gallery, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, amongst others. Completed in 1899, the building of the mansion cost M\u00F8nsted half a million krone.\nThe entrance was decorated with a monogram with the initials AOM (for Anna-Otto-M\u00F8nsted). The M\u00F8nsteds kept a large staff in their mansion. Gardeners creating a large garden. In the garage M\u00F8nsted kept Copenhagen's most expensive car. The M\u00F8nsteds also bred Scottish hunting dogs and kept race horses in the barn.\nIn 1934 Anna M\u00F8nsted sold the mansion for 265,000 krone to Countess Musse Scheel. Scheel was a Danish actress and became the last private owner of the mansion. Scheel was an animal lover and was regarded as being eccentric. Scheel kept a hen house in the yard and sold eggs to her neighbours.\nDuring the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany the mansion was the headquarters of the \"Northern Society\". The Northern Society promoted cultural co-operation between Nazi Germany and the Nordic countries.\nIn 1950, the Soviet Union signed a contract leasing the mansion for 20,000 krone per year. In 1982, the mansion, as well as Kristianiagade 3 (consulate) and Bergensgade 11 (embassy school), were granted to the Soviets, on the basis of reciprocity, free of charge for the purpose of embassy requirements for a period of 70 years, until 31 December 2051.\nThe building and garage are heritage listed buildings.
