It starts at on the southern slopes of Loch Fell, near Moffat, and then flows along a narrow valley to the Annan.\nDryfe Water gives its name to the parish, Dryfesdale, and the common Scottish surname, Drysdale. A second name is the much less common surname Dryfe (or Drife). The meaning of the word Dryfe is unknown. It may be from the Norse, Anglo-Saxon or Brythonic languages which were all used at different times in Dumfriesshire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":30},{"uri":"River_Annan","surface_form":"River Annan","offset":85},{"uri":"Lockerbie","surface_form":"Lockerbie","offset":106},{"uri":"Loch_Fell","surface_form":"Loch Fell","offset":156},{"uri":"Moffat","surface_form":"Moffat","offset":172},{"uri":"Norse","surface_form":"Norse","offset":453},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":460},{"uri":"Brythonic","surface_form":"Brythonic","offset":475},{"uri":"Dumfriesshire","surface_form":"Dumfriesshire","offset":537}]}
