{"id":205294,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pe%C3%B1a","text":"Federico Fabian Pe\u00F1a (born March 15, 1947) was United States Secretary of Transportation from 1993 to 1997 and United States Secretary of Energy from 1997 to 1998, during the presidency of Bill Clinton.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Laredo, Texas, Pe\u00F1a earned a B.A. (1969) and a J.D. (1972) from the University of Texas at Austin and The University of Texas School of Law. Moving to Colorado, where he became an attorney, Pe\u00F1a was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1979, where he became the Minority Leader. In 1983, Pe\u00F1a became the first Hispanic Mayor of Denver, and he was re-elected in 1987.\nCareer.\nPe\u00F1a advised Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton on transportation issues during Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and Clinton chose Pe\u00F1a to head the United States Department of Transportation. Although he was going to leave Clinton's cabinet after Clinton's first term, Pe\u00F1a also served as Secretary of Energy for one year, from 1997 to 1998. In 1995 the Justice Department began a preliminary investigation into a California transit agency's awarding of a pension management contract to Pe\u00F1a's former investment management firm. However, Pe\u00F1a had cut all connections to his former company both before the contract and before becoming Transportation Secretary. On March 17, 1995 Janet Reno ended the investigation.\nLater career.\nWhen Pe\u00F1a left the Clinton administration, he returned to Denver and joined investment firm Vestar Capital Partners in August 1998, as Senior Advisor. On January 18, 2000, Vestar announced that Pe\u00F1a had become one of the firm's Managing Directors.\nPersonal life.\nPe\u00F1a is the father of three children: Nelia, Cristina, and Ryan Pe\u00F1a. The divorce of Federico Pe\u00F1a and his first wife, Ellen Hart Pe\u00F1a, became final on September 10, 2001. Federico Pe\u00F1a married Cindy Velasquez on September 2, 2006. Cindy Velasquez is a former broadcast executive for Channel 7, KMGH-TV, and Channel 9, KUSA-TV, in Denver, Colorado.\nOn September 7, 2007, Pe\u00F1a announced that he would support Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, and also serve as Obama's National Campaign Co-chair. The move was important in that Pe\u00F1a did not support Sen. Hillary Clinton, the wife of the president under whom he served. On November 5, 2008, he was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.\nHonors.\nPe\u00F1a Boulevard, a freeway in Denver connecting Denver International Airport to Interstate 70, is named for him. As mayor of Denver, Pe\u00F1a led the effort to build the airport.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation","surface_form":"United States Secretary of Transportation","offset":47},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Energy","surface_form":"United States Secretary of Energy","offset":111},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":189},{"uri":"Laredo%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Laredo, Texas","offset":223},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"B.A.","offset":252},{"uri":"Juris_Doctor","surface_form":"J.D.","offset":270},{"uri":"University_of_Texas_at_Austin","surface_form":"University of Texas at Austin","offset":291},{"uri":"University_of_Texas_School_of_Law","surface_form":"The University of Texas School of Law","offset":325},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":374},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"attorney","offset":403},{"uri":"Colorado_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Colorado House of Representatives","offset":437},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":476},{"uri":"Minority_Leader","surface_form":"Minority Leader","offset":514},{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":562},{"uri":"Mayor_of_Denver","surface_form":"Mayor of Denver","offset":571},{"uri":"Advise","surface_form":"advised","offset":632},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":640},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":658},{"uri":"Transportation","surface_form":"transportation","offset":674},{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaign","offset":742},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Transportation","surface_form":"United States Department of Transportation","offset":787},{"uri":"United_States_Cabinet","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":872},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Energy","surface_form":"Secretary of Energy","offset":928},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Justice","surface_form":"Justice Department","offset":993},{"uri":"Preliminary","surface_form":"preliminary","offset":1020},{"uri":"Investigation","surface_form":"investigation","offset":1032},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1053},{"uri":"Agency","surface_form":"agency","offset":1072},{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"awarding","offset":1081},{"uri":"Pension","surface_form":"pension","offset":1095},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":1114},{"uri":"Investment","surface_form":"investment","offset":1140},{"uri":"Connection","surface_form":"connection","offset":1194},{"uri":"Janet_Reno","surface_form":"Janet Reno","offset":1317},{"uri":"Vestar_Capital_Partners","surface_form":"Vestar Capital Partners","offset":1459},{"uri":"Senior","surface_form":"Senior","offset":1502},{"uri":"Managing","surface_form":"Managing","offset":1595},{"uri":"Board_of_Directors","surface_form":"Directors","offset":1604},{"uri":"Ellen_Hart_Pe%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Ellen Hart Pe\u00F1a","offset":1749},{"uri":"Former","surface_form":"former","offset":1883},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":1890},{"uri":"Executive","surface_form":"executive","offset":1900},{"uri":"KMGH-TV","surface_form":"KMGH-TV","offset":1925},{"uri":"KUSA-TV","surface_form":"KUSA-TV","offset":1949},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":2043},{"uri":"2008_presidential_election","surface_form":"2008 presidential election","offset":2063},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton","surface_form":"Hillary Clinton","offset":2202},{"uri":"Obama-Biden_Transition_Project","surface_form":"Obama-Biden Transition Project","offset":2330},{"uri":"Pe%C3%B1a_Boulevard","surface_form":"Pe\u00F1a Boulevard","offset":2370},{"uri":"Freeway","surface_form":"freeway","offset":2388},{"uri":"Denver_International_Airport","surface_form":"Denver International Airport","offset":2417},{"uri":"Interstate_70","surface_form":"Interstate 70","offset":2449}]}
