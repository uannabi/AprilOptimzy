{"id":205590,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium","text":"Dodger Stadium is a baseball park in Los Angeles, California. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Los Angeles Dodgers. It was built in 1962, making it one of the oldest ball parks. (Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts and Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois are older.) It is also the largest baseball park in seating capacity.\nDodger Stadium was constructed from 1959 to 1962 at a cost of $23 million dollars. A neighborhood called Chavez Ravine had to be torn down to build the stadium. The Los Angeles Angels rented from the Dodgers from 1962 through 1965, before moving to Anaheim Stadium. The Angels called the ballpark Chavez Ravine Stadium.\nOver five million people have seen a game in Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers have won four World Series while playing in the stadium, in 1963, 1965, 1981 and 1988.\nThere was talk of tearing down the stadium to build a football stadium, but that did not happen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball_park","surface_form":"baseball park","offset":20},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":37},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":50},{"uri":"Home_(sports)","surface_form":"home","offset":72},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":90},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Dodgers","surface_form":"Los Angeles Dodgers","offset":128},{"uri":"Fenway_Park","surface_form":"Fenway Park","offset":212},{"uri":"Boston%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Boston, Massachusetts","offset":227},{"uri":"Wrigley_Field","surface_form":"Wrigley Field","offset":253},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":270},{"uri":"Seating_capacity","surface_form":"seating capacity","offset":340},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":424},{"uri":"Dollar","surface_form":"dollar","offset":432},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim","surface_form":"Los Angeles Angels","offset":523},{"uri":"Angel_Stadium_of_Anaheim","surface_form":"Anaheim Stadium","offset":607},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":765}]}
