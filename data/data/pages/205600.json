{"id":205600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum","text":"Similar to the ER is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) found only in muscle cells. The SR stores and pumps calcium ions. The SR contains large stores of calcium, which it releases when the muscle cell is stimulated. Another type of cytoplasmic network is the plate-like Golgi apparatus.\nThe lacey membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 by scientists using an electron microscope.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":67},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":105},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":113},{"uri":"Golgi_apparatus","surface_form":"Golgi apparatus","offset":268},{"uri":"Electron_microscope","surface_form":"electron microscope","offset":381}]}
