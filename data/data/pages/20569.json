The organization\u2019s main buildings are in Z\u00FCrich, Switzerland. FIFA organizes major international football tournaments, and the most famous one is the FIFA World Cup, which has been held since 1930.

The organization\u2019s official languages are English, French, German and Spanish.\nThe president of FIFA is currently Gianni Infantino, serving since 26 February 2016.\nThe most powerful organ of FIFA is the FIFA Congress, which is an assembly made up of representatives from each member association. The Congress holds a regular meeting once a year, and since 1998 an additional meeting has been held every year. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's laws.\nThe Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of FIFA's Executive Committee. The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA. The Executive Committee, with the President as its head, is responsible for deciding the dates, locations and format of tournaments.\nAlso, there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the seven different continents of the world. National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFA's competitions. The six confederations are AFC (Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia), CAF (Conf\u00E9d\u00E9ration Africaine de Football in Africa), CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America), CONMEBOL (Confederaci\u00F3n Sudamericana de F\u00FAtbol in South America), OFC (Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania) and UEFA (Union Europ\u00E9enne de Football Association in Europe).","categories":[],"infobox_types":["organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":11},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":122},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":210},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":218},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":319},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":407},{"uri":"Gianni_Infantino","surface_form":"Gianni Infantino","offset":577}]}
