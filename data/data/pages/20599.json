{"id":20599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonid_dynasty","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Solomonid dynasty was a line of emperors that ruled in Ethiopia from 1270 to 1975. There were some other emperors that ruled who were not from the Solomonid dynasty, but the Solomonids were in control most of the time.\nThe emperors did not use their real name when they became Emperor of Ethiopia, but they made up a new one for their rule. For example, the first Emperor of the Solomonids was Yekuno Amlak. But he used the name \"Tasfa Iyassus\" after he became ruler.\nThe dynasty began in 1270, when Yekuno Amlak killed the last king of the Zagwe dynasty, which had ruled Ethiopia. Yekuno Amlak was made king, and European historians say was the first ruler of the dynasty. But most Ethiopian books say that Menelik I, the son of King Solomon of Israel and the Queen of Sheba, was the first Emperor of this dynasty.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":50},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":73},{"uri":"1270","surface_form":"1270","offset":87},{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":95},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Ethiopia","surface_form":"Emperor of Ethiopia","offset":295},{"uri":"Yekuno_Amlak","surface_form":"Yekuno Amlak","offset":412},{"uri":"1270","surface_form":"1270","offset":507},{"uri":"Zagwe_dynasty","surface_form":"Zagwe dynasty","offset":559},{"uri":"Solomon","surface_form":"Solomon","offset":753},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":764},{"uri":"Queen_of_Sheba","surface_form":"Queen of Sheba","offset":779}]}
