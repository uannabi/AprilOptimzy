The band has since had a string of hits both in the United Kingdom including six number ones, and in several other countries. The band has changed its line-up three times, because of reported differences between the members of the band. The original lineup was Siobhan, Mutya, and Keisha. Their first album,\" One Touch\", was released in 2000. Siobhan left in 2001. Heidi Range, an original member of Atomic Kitten, replaced her.

It was their first UK number one album. It was also popular in other countries including Australia, Ireland, and Switzerland. In December 2005 it was announced that Mutya was no longer a member. Amelle Berrabah replaced her in the same month. \"Follow Me Home\" was rerecorded and released as the album's fourth single. In 2006 British Hit Singles & Albums named the band the most successful all-female group in the 21st century.
