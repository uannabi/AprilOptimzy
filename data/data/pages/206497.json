Victor married \"Dorothy Newton\" in 1922, a few days after winning the World Ballroom Dancing Championship.\nSilvester was born in Wembley, Middlesex. He died in France.\nAfter World War II, his orchestra and his weekly television programme, \"Victor Silvester's Dancing Club\", kept him in the public eye. His 1927 textbook, \"Modern Ballroom Dancing\", was an immediate bestseller and has remained in print through many editions, the last issued in 2005. He wrote ten other books, including his autobiography.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"OBE","offset":42},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":88},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":96},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":104},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":112},{"uri":"Dance_music","surface_form":"dance band","offset":125},{"uri":"Ballroom_dance","surface_form":"ballroom dance","offset":267},{"uri":"Wembley","surface_form":"Wembley","offset":454},{"uri":"Middlesex","surface_form":"Middlesex","offset":463},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":485},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":499},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":517},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiography","offset":815}]}
