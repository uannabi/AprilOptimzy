{"id":206499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginoplasty","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vaginoplasty is surgery to shape a vagina. Some babies are born with a problem where the vagina did not grow right. Doctors fix this with a vaginoplasty. Some women do not like how their vagina looks or feels. They can ask for a vaginoplasty. Some transsexual women ask for a vaginoplasty when they go from male to female.\nThere are many ways to do a vaginoplasty. Most use tissue from other parts of the body of the patient. They can use tissue from inside the mouth, skin tissue, the vaginal labia, or the intestines. For transgender women, they can use the penis and scrotum to make a vagina, but they must continue to dilate the new vagina to keep it by a tool.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":29},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":48},{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"babies","offset":61},{"uri":"Transsexual","surface_form":"transsexual","offset":261},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":320},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":328},{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":387},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":475},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":482},{"uri":"Labia","surface_form":"labia","offset":507},{"uri":"Intestine","surface_form":"intestine","offset":521},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":573},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":583}]}
