Finding the prime numbers is called factorization.\nThis theorem can be used in cryptography.\nProof.\nThe first person who proved the theorem was Euclid. The first detailed and correct proof was in the \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" by Carl Friedrich Gau\u00DF.\nSome people may think that the theorem is true everywhere. However, the theorem is \"not\" true in more general number systems, like algebraic integers. This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843, in his work on Fermat's last theorem. For more information about that: read algebraic number theory.\nThe proof consists of two parts: \"first\" we show that every number can be written as a product of primes; \"second\" we show that if we write a number as a product of primes for a second time, then the two lists of prime numbers must be the same.\nFirst part of the proof.\nWe show that if \"not\" every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes, we end up in some kind of impossibility. So after that we conclude that it \"must\" be true that every number can be written as a product of primes.\nSo, now see what happens when somebody says that he/she knows a positive integer, greater than 1, which can \"not\" be written as a product of primes. In that case we ask him/her to mention \"all\" the numbers, greater than 1, that can \"not\" be written as a product of primes. One of these numbers must be the \"smallest\": let's call it \"n\". Of course, this number \"n\" cannot be 1. Further, it cannot be a prime number, because a prime number is a 'product' of a single prime: itself. So it \"must\" be a product of numbers. Thus-\nwhere both \"a\" and \"b\" are positive integers that are of course smaller than \"n\". But: \"n\" was the \"smallest\" number that can not be written as a product of primes. So it must be possible to write \"a\" and \"b\" as products of primes, because they are both smaller than \"n\". But then the product\ncan be written as a product of primes as well. This is an impossibility because we said that \"n\" can not be written as a product of primes.\nWe have now shown the impossibility which exists if the first part of the theorem would not be true. In this way we have now proven the first part of the theorem.\nSecond part of the proof.\nNow we have to prove that there is only one way to write a positive number greater than 1 as a product of prime numbers.\nTo do this, we use the following lemma: if a prime number \"p\" divides a product \"ab\", then it divides \"a\" or it divides \"b\" (Euclid's lemma).\nFirst we now prove this lemma. Well, assume now that \"p\" does not divide \"a\". Then \"p\" and \"a\" are coprime and we have Bezout's identity that says that there must be integers \"x\" and \"y\" such that\nRemember that \"ab\" could be divided by \"p\". So now, on the left-hand side we have two terms that are divisible by \"p\". So the term on the right-hand side is also divisible by \"p\". We have now proven that if \"p\" does not divide \"a\", it must divide \"b\". That proves the lemma.\nNow we will prove that we can write an integer greater than 1 in \"only one\" way as a product of prime numbers. Take two products of primes \"A\" and \"B\" which have the same outcome. So we know for the outcome of the products that \"A\" = \"B\". Take any prime \"p\" from the first product \"A\". It divides the \"A\", so it also divides \"B\". Using several times the lemma that we just proved, we can see that \"p\" must then divide at least one factor \"b\" of \"B\". But the factors are all primes themselves, so also \"b\" is prime. But we know that \"p\" is also prime, so \"p\" must be equal to \"b\". So now we divide \"A\" by \"p\" and also divide \"B\" by \"p\". And we get a result like \"A*\" = \"B*\". Again we can take a prime \"p\" from the first product \"A*\" and find out that is equal to some number in the product \"B*\". Continuing in this way, at the end we see that the prime factors of the two products must be exactly the same. This proves that we can write a positive integer as a product of primes in only one unique way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Factorization","surface_form":"factorization","offset":233},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":276},{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":329},{"uri":"Euclid","surface_form":"Euclid","offset":341},{"uri":"Proof","surface_form":"proof","offset":380},{"uri":"Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae","surface_form":"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae","offset":398},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gau%C3%9F","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gau\u00DF","offset":430},{"uri":"Algebraic_integer","surface_form":"algebraic integers","offset":582},{"uri":"Ernst_Kummer","surface_form":"Ernst Kummer","offset":630},{"uri":"Fermat%27s_last_theorem","surface_form":"Fermat's last theorem","offset":667},{"uri":"Algebraic_number_theory","surface_form":"algebraic number theory","offset":728},{"uri":"Lemma_(mathematics)","surface_form":"lemma","offset":2559},{"uri":"Euclid%27s_lemma","surface_form":"Euclid's lemma","offset":2651},{"uri":"Coprime","surface_form":"coprime","offset":2767},{"uri":"B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity","surface_form":"Bezout's identity","offset":2787}]}
