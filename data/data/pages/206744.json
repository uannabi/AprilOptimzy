{"id":206744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyracotherium","text":"\"Hyracotherium\" was previously called \"Eohippus\" (meaning \"dawn horse\"). It is a Eurasian species, a Palaeothere. That group is ancestral to the horses and brontotheres. Therefore, it is not the same animal as \"Eohippus\", which is the earliest horse.\n\"Hyracotherium\" lived during the early Eocene epoch, about 5545 million years ago. It lived in the northern hemisphere in Asia and Europe. The first fossils of this tiny animal were found in England by Richard Owen in 1841 and named \"Hyracotherium\".\nThe original type species \"H. leporinum\" is now regarded as an \"Eohippus\". So that name has been brought back to describe the early proto-horse found in North America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eohippus","surface_form":"Eohippus","offset":39},{"uri":"Palaeothere","surface_form":"Palaeothere","offset":101},{"uri":"Brontothere","surface_form":"brontothere","offset":156},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":290},{"uri":"Northern_hemisphere","surface_form":"northern hemisphere","offset":350},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":373},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":382},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":442},{"uri":"Richard_Owen","surface_form":"Richard Owen","offset":453},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":514}]}
