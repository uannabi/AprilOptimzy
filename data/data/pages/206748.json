{"id":206748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(mathematics)","text":"The degree of a polynomial formula_1, represented by the symbol formula_1, is the highest exponent that occurs inside that polynomial.\nFor example, if we look at the polynomial formula_1, then we can see that the degree of this polynomial is 3, because the highest power in the variable x is 3. It occurs in the term formula_1.\nThe name of the variable is not important. For example, the polynomial formula_1 has degree 5, because the highest power of the variable, in this case y, is 5, which occurs in the term formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":16},{"uri":"Exponent","surface_form":"exponent","offset":90}]}
