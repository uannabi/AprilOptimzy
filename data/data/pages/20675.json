Spam Lite, a newer kind of Spam, is made with pork and chicken.\nThere have been many ideas about what the word \"Spam\" means. The Hormel Foods Corporation once said that it means \"Shoulder of Pork and Ham\", but in some dictionaries \"Spam\" means \"spiced ham\".\nMembers of staff at the SPAM museum say it stands for Specially Produced American Meat.\nIn 2019, Spam began making advertisements containing the definition \u201CSizzle Pork And Mmmm\u201D.\nSpam was used a lot in World War II, as there wasn't proper meat. Because of that, spam was used as a rationed item.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canned_food","surface_form":"canned","offset":10},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":17},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":81},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":86},{"uri":"Ham","surface_form":"ham","offset":104},{"uri":"Spam_Lite","surface_form":"Spam Lite","offset":109},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":164},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":570}]}
