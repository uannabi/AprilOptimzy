{"id":20678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization","text":"e=\"preserve\">Factorization (also called factorisation and factoring) is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number. These smaller numbers are called factors or divisors. 1 is a factor of all numbers.\nPrime factorization is breaking apart a composite numbers into prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the larger number. Note that since 1 is not prime, it is not included in the prime factorization.\nFor example, 12 can be factored as 4\u00A0\u00D7\u00A03. Since 4 is not a prime number, that is not its prime factorization. 12's prime factorization is in fact 3\u00A0\u00D7\u00A02\u00A0\u00D7\u00A02.\nSince finding the numbers to multiply together is very difficult for large numbers, this fact can be used in cryptography.\nPolynomials.\nThis is how one type of polynomial is factored.\nformula_1\nFind two numbers that add up to 9 and can be multiplied to get 20. Here, these numbers are 4 and 5.\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Composite_number","surface_form":"composite number","offset":81},{"uri":"Divisor","surface_form":"divisor","offset":212},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":315},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":724},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":775}]}
