{"id":206810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_and_checkmate","text":"If none of these works, then it is not a check but \"checkmate\".\nCheckmate.\nCheckmate (often called mate) is when a player's king is attacked (in check) and there is no way to escape that attack. Or, simply put, the king is under attack and cannot get out of being captured. Giving checkmate is the main goal in chess: a player who is mated loses the game.\nHistory.\nThese rules have been part of chess since its beginning. Until the early 20th century, it was customary to announce \"Check!\" verbally when making the move. This would be regarded as strange today; players do not address each other in competitive chess except where necessary.\nUntil the 19th century it was customary to warn one's opponent when attacking his queen: \"Check to the queen!\" Most players today do not know this was ever done.p74","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_(chess)","surface_form":"king","offset":124}]}
