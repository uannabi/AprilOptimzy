{"id":20725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism","text":"Anthropomorphism is suggesting that non-human things have human traits, emotions, and intentions. It is common for people to do this.\nAnthropomorphism is often used in stories and art. The story of the \"Three Little Pigs\" has a wolf and pigs who talk and act like humans. Mickey Mouse also talks and acts like a human. These are examples of a type of anthropomorphism called \"furry\".\nThe novel \"The Call of the Wild\" also uses anthropomorphism. The main character is a dog named Buck. Many other characters are dogs and wolves. In the story, the animals think and act more like humans than real dogs do.\nReasons for anthropomorphism.\nPeople can explain why they do things. People are not as good at knowing why non-human things do things. This can lead to people assuming non-human things will act or think like humans.\nKnowledge about humans is got early in life. It is more detailed than knowledge about non-human entities, and is better remembered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":58},{"uri":"Trait","surface_form":"trait","offset":64},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":72},{"uri":"Three_Little_Pigs","surface_form":"Three Little Pigs","offset":203},{"uri":"Wolf","surface_form":"wolf","offset":228},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":237},{"uri":"Mickey_Mouse","surface_form":"Mickey Mouse","offset":272},{"uri":"Furry","surface_form":"furry","offset":376},{"uri":"The_Call_of_the_Wild","surface_form":"The Call of the Wild","offset":395}]}
