It stars Tom Hanks, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, and Michael Clarke Duncan. It was directed by Frank Darabont.\nPlot summary.\nIn Louisiana in 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row \"The Green Mile\" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (played by Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate arrives: John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is to be executed for the murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (played by David Morse) and Stanton (played by Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing, like bringing a dead mouse back to life, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have done the crimes with which he was charged.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Green mile\" is said to \"metaphorically\" represent the short distance of land (therefore the use of the word \"mile\") that a prisoner need to walk or otherwise run before he or she are executed on prison grounds.\nAwards.\n1999 Academy Awards\n2000 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films\n2000 Broadcast Music Incorporated Film & TV Awards\n2000 Black Reel Awards\n2000 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards\n2000 Bram Stoker Awards\n2000 Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards\n2000 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards\n2000 Directors Guild of America\n2000 Golden Globe Awards\n2000 NAACP Image Awards\n2000 MTV Movie Awards\n2000 Motion Picture Sound Editors (Golden Reel Awards)\n2000 People's Choice Awards\n2001 Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (Nebula Award)\n2000 Screen Actors Guild Awards","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":27},{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama movie","offset":36},{"uri":"Tom_Hanks","surface_form":"Tom Hanks","offset":117},{"uri":"David_Morse","surface_form":"David Morse","offset":128},{"uri":"Bonnie_Hunt","surface_form":"Bonnie Hunt","offset":141},{"uri":"Michael_Clarke_Duncan","surface_form":"Michael Clarke Duncan","offset":158},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":188},{"uri":"Frank_Darabont","surface_form":"Frank Darabont","offset":200},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":233},{"uri":"72nd_Academy_Awards","surface_form":"1999","offset":1394},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":1399},{"uri":"Saturn_Award","surface_form":"2000 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films","offset":1414},{"uri":"Broadcast_Music_Incorporated","surface_form":"Broadcast Music Incorporated","offset":1475},{"uri":"Black_Reel_Awards","surface_form":"Black Reel Awards","offset":1526},{"uri":"Blockbuster_Inc.","surface_form":"Blockbuster","offset":1549},{"uri":"Bram_Stoker_Award","surface_form":"Bram Stoker Award","offset":1587},{"uri":"Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association","surface_form":"Broadcast Film Critics Association","offset":1611},{"uri":"Chicago_Film_Critics_Association","surface_form":"Chicago Film Critics Association","offset":1658},{"uri":"Directors_Guild_of_America","surface_form":"Directors Guild of America","offset":1703},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award","surface_form":"Golden Globe Award","offset":1735},{"uri":"NAACP_Image_Awards","surface_form":"NAACP Image Awards","offset":1760},{"uri":"MTV_Movie_Awards","surface_form":"MTV Movie Awards","offset":1784},{"uri":"Motion_Picture_Sound_Editors","surface_form":"Motion Picture Sound Editors","offset":1806},{"uri":"People%27s_Choice_Awards","surface_form":"People's Choice Awards","offset":1861},{"uri":"Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Writers_of_America","surface_form":"Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America","offset":1889},{"uri":"Nebula_Award","surface_form":"Nebula Award","offset":1937},{"uri":"Screen_Actors_Guild","surface_form":"Screen Actors Guild","offset":1956},{"uri":"Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards","surface_form":"Awards","offset":1976}]}
