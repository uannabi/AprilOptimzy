{"id":20731,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe","text":"e=\"preserve\">The apostrophe is a punctuation mark used in writing. It is a diacritic (a mark used with letters).\nIts versus it's.\nThe most common grammatical 'mistake in written English is to put \"it's\" where \"its\" is correct.\n\"Its\": a possessive adjective and pronoun of the personal pronoun \"it\".\n\"It's\": a contraction of the verbal phrase \"it is\" or \"it has\".\nThe same applies to \"yours\", \"theirs\" and \"ours\" because these are also possessive adjectives of personal pronouns.\nThe intrusive apostrophe.\nComes in plurals which don't (\"do not\") need it. Do not put an apostrophe in word ending in s, such as a plural. Put an apostrophe, or 's, at the end of the word instead.\nWriting dialogue or titles.\nThis is just a version of the abbreviation function.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":33},{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"diacritic","offset":75},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":247},{"uri":"Pronoun","surface_form":"pronoun","offset":261},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":446},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":514},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":610}]}
