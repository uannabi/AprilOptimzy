{"id":207332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_scarf","text":"e=\"preserve\">Headscarves are scarves covering most or all of the top of a woman's hair and her head. Headscarves may be worn for a variety of purposes, such as for warmth, for sanitation, for fashion or social distinction; with religious significance, to hide rampant baldness, out of modesty, or other forms of social convention.\nTypes of headscarves.\nHeadscarves may have specific religious significance. Observant married Orthodox Jewish women, for example, are required to cover their hair, often employing scarves (or sometimes wigs) for the purpose. Headscarves were also worn by married Christian women in Medieval Europe, and even among some of the unmarried. This headcovering habit is better known as a wimple in English.\nIslamic law says that women should dress in a special way. This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children.\nNote that the Arabic word \"hijab\" refers to modest behaviour in general, and pertains to men and women, but it is sometimes used in other languages to describe the Muslim headscarf, also known as a \"khimar\".\nSome English speakers use the word \"babushka\" (grandma in Russian) to indicate the headscarf tied below the chin, as commonly worn in Eastern Europe. In most parts of Eastern Europe, headscarves are used mainly by elderly women (grandmothers) and this led the incorrect use of the \"babushka\" term. In Russia they are worn by women when they go to church to show their convictions to Russian Orthodoxy.\nA plain red or scarlet headscarf was worn by female commissars and other women aligning themselves with Bolshevism in times of Russian Revolution and civil war.\nA head tie is a west and southern African women's head scarf, specifically an elaborate ornamental head covering.\nThe Keffiyeh is commonly used by Muslim men.\nAncien Egyptiant men wore a Nemes headcloth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scarf","surface_form":"scarves","offset":29},{"uri":"Fashion","surface_form":"fashion","offset":192},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":203},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":228},{"uri":"Baldness","surface_form":"baldness","offset":268},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious significance","offset":383},{"uri":"Orthodox_Judaism","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":425},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":434},{"uri":"Wigs","surface_form":"wigs","offset":533},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":613},{"uri":"Wimple","surface_form":"wimple","offset":713},{"uri":"Dress_code","surface_form":"dress code","offset":796},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":881},{"uri":"Hijab","surface_form":"hijab","offset":894},{"uri":"Babushka","surface_form":"babushka","offset":1111},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":1133},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":1209},{"uri":"Commissars","surface_form":"commissars","offset":1529},{"uri":"Bolshevism","surface_form":"Bolshevism","offset":1581},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1672},{"uri":"Keffiyeh","surface_form":"Keffiyeh","offset":1756},{"uri":"Nemes_headcloth","surface_form":"Nemes headcloth","offset":1825}]}
