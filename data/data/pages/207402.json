{"id":207402,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien","text":"Joseph Jacques Jean Chr\u00E9tien (born January 11, 1934) is a Canadian politician. He was the 20th Prime Minister of Canada from 1993 to 2003 and the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1990 to 2003. During his career, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada for over 35 years.\nChr\u00E9tien was born in Shawinigan, Quebec. He studied law at Universit\u00E9 Laval. He became a politician in 1963, when he was first elected to the House of Commons. While Pierre Trudeau was Prime Minister, Chr\u00E9tien was a member of his cabinet. He was the Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister when John Turner was Prime Minister.\nChr\u00E9tien was elected leader of the Liberal Party in 1990. The Liberals won 177 seats in the House of Commons in the 1993 election, meaning they were the largest party and could form a government. He was re-elected two times in 1997 and 2000 and led a majority government the entire time he was Prime Minister.\nChr\u00E9tien retired in 2003. He was replaced as the Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party by Paul Martin.\nBeginning of career.\nFor the 1963 federal election, Chr\u00E9tien was chosen to be the Liberal Party's candidate for the riding of Saint-Maurice\u2014Lafl\u00E8che in Shawinigan. He was elected in this riding and became a Member of Parliament for the first time. After this, he became the parliamentary secretary for the Prime Minister at the time, Lester B. Pearson.\nBeginning in 1966, he was the parliamentary secretary for Mitchell Sharp, who was the Minister of Finance at the time. He spent a longer amount of time working with Sharp than he did with Pearson.\nChr\u00E9tien was chosen by Pearson to be the Minister of National Revenue in January 1968.\nIn Trudeau's second cabinet.\nThe Liberal Party lost the 1979 federal election. The Progressive Conservatives formed a very short government led by Joe Clark. After Trudeau and the Liberals won the election the year after, Trudeau chose Chr\u00E9tien to become the Minister of Justice.\nChr\u00E9tien was a very important person in the 1980 Quebec referendum, when there was a referendum on whether Quebec should leave Canada. He fought very hard for the federal government and was against Quebec leaving Canada.\nAs Leader of the Opposition.\nTurner stopped being the leader of the Liberal Party in 1990. There was an election to decide who would be the person to replace him at the June 1990 party conference.\nWhen Chr\u00E9tien won the Liberal Party leadership election, the Liberals had the second-most seats in the House of Commons. Because of this, he also became the Leader of the Opposition. At first, he had many problems as the leader. For example, some Quebec Liberal MPs chose to leave the party after he became the leader.\n1993 election.\nWhen Brian Mulroney retired in 1993, he was replaced as the Prime Minister and as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party by Kim Campbell. She was a part of Mulroney's cabinet at the time. Because elections in Canada have to happen at least once every five years, there was going to be an election in October of that year.\nOne of Chr\u00E9tien's promises was that a Liberal government would remove the Goods and Service Tax. It was created by Mulroney's government and was not very popular among the Canadian public. Chr\u00E9tien also promised that they would negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) a second time, and to bring down Canada's deficit.\nChr\u00E9tien and the Liberal Party won the election. The Liberals won 177 seats and became the largest party in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives lost almost all their seats in that election, winning only two seats.\nPolitical views.\nChr\u00E9tien was part of the Liberal Party's left-wing in the beginning of his career. While he was Prime Minister, however, he was very neoliberal and fiscally conservative.\nPersonal life.\nHis parents were Wellie Chr\u00E9tien and Marie Boisvert.\nChr\u00E9tien married Aline Cha\u00EEn\u00E9 in 1957. They both knew each other when they were young in Shawinigan. Cha\u00EEn\u00E9 became one of the people Chr\u00E9tien trusted the most when making important decisions. They stayed married until she died in 2020. They had 2 sons and 1 daughter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":58},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":67},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Canada","offset":95},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Canada","surface_form":"Liberal Party of Canada","offset":160},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament_(Canada)","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":231},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_Canada","surface_form":"House of Commons of Canada","offset":264},{"uri":"Shawinigan%2C_Quebec","surface_form":"Shawinigan","offset":331},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":343},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":362},{"uri":"Universit%C3%A9_Laval","surface_form":"Universit\u00E9 Laval","offset":369},{"uri":"Pierre_Trudeau","surface_form":"Pierre Trudeau","offset":476},{"uri":"Cabinet_of_Canada","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":540},{"uri":"Minister_of_Justice_(Canada)","surface_form":"Minister of Justice","offset":560},{"uri":"Minister_of_Finance_(Canada)","surface_form":"Minister of Finance","offset":581},{"uri":"Minister_of_Indian_Affairs_and_Northern_Development","surface_form":"Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development","offset":610},{"uri":"Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Deputy Prime Minister","offset":679},{"uri":"John_Turner","surface_form":"John Turner","offset":706},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":989},{"uri":"Retirement","surface_form":"retired","offset":1057},{"uri":"Paul_Martin","surface_form":"Paul Martin","offset":1147},{"uri":"1963_Canadian_federal_election","surface_form":"1963 federal election","offset":1189},{"uri":"Candidate","surface_form":"candidate","offset":1258},{"uri":"Electoral_district_(Canada)","surface_form":"riding","offset":1276},{"uri":"Saint-Maurice%E2%80%94Lafl%C3%A8che","surface_form":"Saint-Maurice\u2014Lafl\u00E8che","offset":1286},{"uri":"Parliamentary_secretary","surface_form":"parliamentary secretary","offset":1434},{"uri":"Lester_B._Pearson","surface_form":"Lester B.
