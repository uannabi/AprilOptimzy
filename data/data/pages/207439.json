They had a mascot named \"Zeddy\", which is a teddy bear.\nIn 2011, the leaseholds of 189 Zellers stores were taken over by Target Corporation. Target got the leaseholds because they are expanding their stores into Canada in 2013 and 2014. HBC said most Zellers stores would close and retire the Zellers banner from Canadian retail by March 31, 2013.\nThere were two Zellers stores left in Canada, in Toronto, and Ottawa Ontario, and they closed on January 26, 2020","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":12},{"uri":"Department_stores","surface_form":"department stores","offset":62},{"uri":"Brampton","surface_form":"Brampton","offset":106},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":116},{"uri":"Target_(store)","surface_form":"Target Corporation","offset":246},{"uri":"Target_Canada","surface_form":"expanding their stores into Canada","offset":309},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":522},{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":535}]}
