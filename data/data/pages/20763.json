{"id":20763,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness","text":"Happiness is a feeling of pleasure and positivity. When someone feels good, proud, excited, relieved or satisfied about something, that person is said to be \"happy\". Feeling happy may help people to relax and to smile.\nHappiness is usually thought of as the opposite of sadness. However, it is possible to feel both at once, often about different things, or sometimes even about the same thing.\nMany philosophers have said that people in the world go back and forth between times of happiness and sadness, but there is nobody who is always happy or always sad. Happiness sometimes causes people to cry when they laugh because the emotion takes control of them, people should learn how to be happy in life. Happiness was thought of as the key to love in ancient civilizations such as the Incas and the Mayans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"feeling","offset":15},{"uri":"Smile","surface_form":"smile","offset":212},{"uri":"Opposite","surface_form":"opposite","offset":258},{"uri":"Sad","surface_form":"sad","offset":270},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":400},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":753},{"uri":"Civilizations","surface_form":"civilizations","offset":761},{"uri":"Inca","surface_form":"Inca","offset":787},{"uri":"Maya_civilization","surface_form":"Mayans","offset":801}]}
