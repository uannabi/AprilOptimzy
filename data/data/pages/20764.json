{"id":20764,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A number is called a perfect number if by adding all the positive divisors of the number (except itself), the result is the number itself.\n6 is the first perfect number. Its divisors (other than the number itself: 6) are 1, 2, and 3 and 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6. Other perfect numbers include 28, 496 and 8128.\nPerfect numbers that are even.\nEuclid saw that 2\"n\" - 1 is a prime number in these four cases. He then proved that the formula 2\"n\"-1(2\"n\" - 1) gives an even perfect number whenever 2\"n\" - 1 is prime (Euclid, Prop. IX.36).\nThe fifth perfect number (formula_1) has 8 digits. This falsifies the first assumption. For the second assumption, the fifth perfect number indeed ends with a 6. However, the sixth (8 589 869 056) also ends in a 6. It is straightforward to show the last digit of any even perfect number must be 6 or 8.\nIn order for formula_1 to be prime, it is necessary that formula_1 should be prime. Prime numbers of the form 2\"n\" - 1 are known as Mersenne primes, after the seventeenth-century monk Marin Mersenne, who studied number theory and perfect numbers.\nTwo millennia after Euclid, Euler proved that the formula 2\"n\"-1(2\"n\" - 1) will yield all the even perfect numbers. Therefore, every Mersenne prime will yield a distinct even perfect number\u2013there is a concrete one-to-one association between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. This result is often referred to as the \"Euclid-Euler Theorem\". Till January 2013, only 48 Mersenne primes are known. This means there are 48 perfect numbers known, the largest being 257,885,160 \u00D7 (257,885,161 - 1) with 34,850,340 digits.\nThe first 42 even perfect numbers are 2\"n\"-1(2\"n\" - 1) for\nThe other 7 known are for \"n\" = 30402457, 32582657, 37156667, 42643801, 43112609, 57885161, 74207281.\nIt is currently not known whether there are others between them.\nIt is still not known if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and perfect numbers. The search for new Mersenne primes is the goal of the GIMPS distributed computing project.\nPerfect numbers that are odd.\nIt is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers. Various results have been obtained, but none that has helped to locate one or otherwise resolve the question of their existence. Carl Pomerance has presented a heuristic argument which suggests that no odd perfect numbers exist.[http://oddperfect.org/pomerance.html] Also, it has been conjectured that there are no odd Ore's harmonic numbers. If true, this would mean that there are no odd perfect numbers.\nProof.\nLet formula_1 be odd perfect number. Since divisor function is multiplicative,\nformula_1.\nformula_1 must be an even not divisible by 4 and all the remaining must be odd.\nformula_1\nforces formula_1.\nRelated concepts.\nThe sum of proper divisors gives various other kinds of numbers. Numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient, and where it is greater than the number, abundant. These terms, together with \"perfect\" itself, come from Greek numerology. A pair of numbers which are the sum of each other's proper divisors are called amicable, and larger cycles of numbers are called sociable. A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a practical number.\nBy definition, a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted sum-of-divisors function s(n) = \u03C3(n) \u2212 n, and the aliquot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":16},{"uri":"Divisor","surface_form":"divisor","offset":80},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":380},{"uri":"Mersenne_prime","surface_form":"Mersenne prime","offset":977},{"uri":"Marin_Mersenne","surface_form":"Marin Mersenne","offset":1029},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":1057},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Euler","offset":1120},{"uri":"GIMPS","surface_form":"GIMPS","offset":1982},{"uri":"Carl_Pomerance","surface_form":"Carl Pomerance","offset":2237},{"uri":"Heuristic","surface_form":"heuristic","offset":2268},{"uri":"Ore%27s_harmonic_number","surface_form":"Ore's harmonic number","offset":2427},{"uri":"Deficient_number","surface_form":"deficient","offset":2867},{"uri":"Abundant_number","surface_form":"abundant","offset":2919},{"uri":"Numerology","surface_form":"numerology","offset":2990},{"uri":"Amicable_number","surface_form":"amicable","offset":3081},{"uri":"Sociable_number","surface_form":"sociable","offset":3131},{"uri":"Practical_number","surface_form":"practical number","offset":3242},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":3263},{"uri":"Fixed_point_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fixed point","offset":3297},{"uri":"Divisor_function","surface_form":"sum-of-divisors function","offset":3327},{"uri":"Aliquot_sequence","surface_form":"aliquot sequence","offset":3377},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":3441}]}
