{"id":207678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-staff","text":"Half-staff or half-mast describes a flag being displayed at halfway up a flagpole or a ship's mast. This is done in many countries as a symbol of respect, mourning, or distress, or a form of honor.\nThe flag does not always have to be flown at exactly the half-way point, sometimes it is acceptable to have the \"half-mast\" flag at slightly lower or slightly higher than the middle of the flagpole or mast. Originally, \"half-staff\" meant that the flag had to be flown one flag-width from the top to allow for the \"invisible flag of mourning\" to be at the top.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":36},{"uri":"Flagpole","surface_form":"flagpole","offset":73},{"uri":"Mast","surface_form":"mast","offset":94}]}
