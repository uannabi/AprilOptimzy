{"id":207771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegle","text":"e=\"preserve\">Omegle is website that allows one to talk with one person anonymously and randomly without signing up. The nicknames that are used are \"You\" and \"Stranger\". It was started in late March of 2009 by an eighteen-year-old, Leif K-Brooks, who lives in Vermont.\nFeatures.\nThe website has started using a lot of new things in the chat. One thing is that people can chat using webcams. Another feature is that one person can ask something while watching two other strangers discussing it. Usually, the asker can't talk, but they can watch them discuss the question. One new feature that people can do is use Facebook Connect to find strangers who have liked the same things on Facebook. You can also type in common interests, these will only connect you to people who have the same interests.\nCriticism.\nThe website does not ban users because of their age. A user may experience nudity or sexual content on camera. K-Brooks says, that at one time, he felt \"disappointment\" at the way in which the site has been used.\nSince 2013, Omegle has monitored the video chats. There is a moderated video section and an unmoderated video section. The unmoderated video section is for adults who are 18 and over. The moderated video section is for everyone. If someone is seen naked on the moderated video section, they will be banned and only be able to use the unmoderated section.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":23},{"uri":"Anonymity","surface_form":"anonymous","offset":71},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":87},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":120},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":260},{"uri":"Webcam","surface_form":"webcam","offset":382},{"uri":"Facebook_Connect","surface_form":"Facebook Connect","offset":613},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":682}]}
