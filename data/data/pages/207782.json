{"id":207782,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City","text":"Kowloon Walled City was a tiny Chinese enclave in Hong Kong.\nIt was a military fort for hundreds of years, but later became a very dense settlement. In 1980, the city had about 35,000 people on about 20,000 m\u00B2 of land, making it one of the most densely populated places on earth. It was torn down in 1993, and a park called Kowloon Walled City Park was built in 1994.\nThe area where Kowloon Walled City was located is now called Kowloon City. It is part of the Kowloon City District of Kowloon, Hong Kong. At the end of the whole destruction process of the kowloon Walled City, 51% of people had to go to temporary housing just outside of the walled city. When they destroyed the walled city it was hard to destroy all of the walled city's machinery. The walled city was known for three things. brothels, dentists, and opium houses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":31},{"uri":"Enclave","surface_form":"enclave","offset":39},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":50},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":70},{"uri":"Fort","surface_form":"fort","offset":79},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"densely populated","offset":245},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":312},{"uri":"Kowloon","surface_form":"Kowloon","offset":486}]}
