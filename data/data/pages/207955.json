{"id":207955,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass-baritone","text":"e=\"preserve\">A bass-baritone is a male singer whose voice is quite low, like a deep baritone, but not quite as low as really deep bass. People started to describe some singers as \"bass-baritones\" in the 19th century, particularly when the composer Richard Wagner wrote operas which needed singers with that kind of heroic voice. Wagner's roles for bass-baritone include: the Dutchman in Der fliegende Holl\u00E4nder, Wotan/Der Wanderer in the Ring Cycle and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N\u00FCrnberg. Wagner called these roles \"Hoher Bass\" (\"high bass\").\nSome bass-baritones often sing baritone roles. Others prefer to sing bass roles.\nFamous singers who have been, or are, described as bass-baritone include Hans Hotter, Jos\u00E9 van Dam, Thomas Quasthoff, Friedrich Schnorr, John Shirley-Quirk, Bryn Terfel and Willard White.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":34},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":39},{"uri":"Baritone","surface_form":"baritone","offset":84},{"uri":"Bass_(singer)","surface_form":"bass","offset":130},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":203},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":239},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":248},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":269},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":315},{"uri":"The_Flying_Dutchman_(opera)","surface_form":"Der fliegende Holl\u00E4nder","offset":387},{"uri":"Ring_Cycle","surface_form":"Ring Cycle","offset":438},{"uri":"Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg","surface_form":"Die Meistersinger von N\u00FCrnberg","offset":467},{"uri":"Baritone","surface_form":"baritone","offset":584},{"uri":"Bass_(vocal_range)","surface_form":"bass","offset":622},{"uri":"Hans_Hotter","surface_form":"Hans Hotter","offset":707},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_van_Dam","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 van Dam","offset":720},{"uri":"Thomas_Quasthoff","surface_form":"Thomas Quasthoff","offset":734},{"uri":"Friedrich_Schnorr","surface_form":"Friedrich Schnorr","offset":752},{"uri":"John_Shirley-Quirk","surface_form":"John Shirley-Quirk","offset":771},{"uri":"Bryn_Terfel","surface_form":"Bryn Terfel","offset":791},{"uri":"Willard_White","surface_form":"Willard White","offset":807}]}
