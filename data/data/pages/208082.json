{"id":208082,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet","text":"A Wavelet is a mathematical function used to write down a function or signal in terms of other functions that are simpler to study. Many signal processing tasks can be seen in terms of a wavelet transform. Informally speaking, the signal can be seen under the lens with a magnification given by the scale of the wavelet. In doing so, we can see only the information that is determined by the shape of the wavelet used.\nThe English term \"wavelet\" was introduced in the early 1980s by French physicists Jean Morlet and Alex Grossman.\nThey used the French word \"ondelette\" (which means \"small wave\").\nLater, this word was brought into English by translating \"onde\" into \"wave\" giving \"wavelet\".\nWavelet is (complex) function from the Hilbert space formula_1. For practical applications it should satisfy following conditions.\nIt must satisfy an admissibility condition.\nZero mean condition implies from admissibility condition.\nThe function formula_1 is called mother wavelet. Its translated (shifted) and dilated (scaled) normalized versions are defined as following.\nOriginal mother wavelet has parameters formula_1 and formula_1. Translation is described by formula_1 parameter and dilatation by formula_1 parameter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":28},{"uri":"Signal_processing","surface_form":"signal","offset":70},{"uri":"Signal_processing","surface_form":"signal processing","offset":137},{"uri":"Wavelet_transform","surface_form":"wavelet transform","offset":187},{"uri":"Scale","surface_form":"scale","offset":299},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":354},{"uri":"Jean_Morlet","surface_form":"Jean Morlet","offset":501},{"uri":"Alex_Grossman","surface_form":"Alex Grossman","offset":517},{"uri":"Hilbert_space","surface_form":"Hilbert space","offset":731}]}
