{"id":208170,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_number","text":"A mixed numeral (also called a mixed fraction or mixed number) is a traditional denotation of the sum of a non-zero integer and a proper fraction (having the same sign). It is used primarily in measurement: {\\displaystyle 2{\\displaystyle 2inches, for example. Scientific measurements almost invariably use decimal notation rather than mixed numbers. The sum is implied without the use of a visible operator such as the appropriate \"+\". For example, in referring to two entire cakes and three quarters of another cake, the numerals denoting the integer part and the fractional part of the cakes are written next to each other as {\\displaystyle 22{\\tfrac instead of the unambiguous notation {\\displaystyle 2+{\\displaystyle 2+ Negative mixed numerals, as in {\\displaystyle -2-2{\\tfrac, are treated like {\\displaystyle -(2+{\\displaystyle -(2+ Any such sum of a whole plus a part can be converted to an improper fraction by applying the rules of adding unlike quantities.\nThis tradition is, formally, in conflict with the notation in algebra where adjacent factors, without an explicit infix operator, denote a product. When two algebraic expressions are written next to each other, the operation of multiplication is implied by this general rule: 2xalways means the product of 2and, even if the value of xis a fraction. The expression {\\displaystyle 2{\\displaystyle 2for example is not a mixed number; instead, multiplication is expressly required, where {\\displaystyle 2{\\tfrac =2\\cdot {\\displaystyle 2{\\tfrac =2\\cdot\nFor better readability, the multiplication is sometimes made explicit or parentheses are added.
