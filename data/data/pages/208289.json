{"id":208289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_mirror_filter","text":"The quadrature mirror filters (QMF) are two filters with frequency characteristics symmetric about formula_1 of sampling frequency (i.e. formula_1). They are used especially in process of orthogonal discrete wavelet transform design.\nSimple variant.\nIn notation of Z-transform, we can create the quadrature mirror filter formula_1 to (original) filter formula_1 by substitution formula_1 with formula_1 in the transfer function of formula_1.\nBy doing it, the transfer characteristic of formula_1 is shifted to formula_1 by formula_1.\nImpulse characteristic is therefore\nAccording to the picture above, the signal split and passed into these filters can be downsampled by a factor of two. Nevertheless, original signal can be still reconstructed by using reconstruction filters formula_1 and formula_1. Reconstruction filters are given by time reversal analysis filters.\nOrthogonal filter banks.\nFor orthogonal discrete wavelet transform formula_1 is given by\nReconstruction filters are still given by same equations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frequency_characteristic","surface_form":"frequency characteristic","offset":57},{"uri":"Sampling_frequency","surface_form":"sampling frequency","offset":112},{"uri":"Discrete_wavelet_transform","surface_form":"discrete wavelet transform","offset":199},{"uri":"Z-transform","surface_form":"Z-transform","offset":265},{"uri":"Transfer_function","surface_form":"transfer function","offset":410},{"uri":"Impulse_characteristic","surface_form":"Impulse characteristic","offset":534},{"uri":"Signal_processing","surface_form":"signal","offset":606}]}
