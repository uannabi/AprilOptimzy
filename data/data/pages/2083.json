{"id":2083,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour","text":"Colour or color is a property of light as seen by people. In Latin, as well as the United States, the word is spelled \u201Ccolor\u201D (without a \u2018u\u2019.) In traditional English, it is spelled \u201Ccolour\u201D (with a \u2018u\u2019).\n\"Primary colours\" can be mixed to make the other colours. Red, yellow and blue are the three traditional primary colours. The primary colours for television screens and computer monitors are red, green and blue. Printers use magenta, yellow and cyan as their primary colours; they also use black.\nPeople who can not see colours or have a distorted sense of colour are called colour blind. Most colour blind people are male.\nColours are sometimes added to food. Food colouring is used to colour food, but some foods have natural colourings, like beta carotene.\nWhen something has no colour, it is transparent. An example is air.\nThe science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science\nA translucent material is not the same as a colourless material because it can still have a colour, like stained glass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"property","offset":21},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":33},{"uri":"Vision","surface_form":"seen","offset":42},{"uri":"Primary_colour","surface_form":"Primary colour","offset":205},{"uri":"Colour_blind","surface_form":"colour blind","offset":579},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":622},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":659},{"uri":"Food_coloring","surface_form":"Food colouring","offset":665},{"uri":"Transparency","surface_form":"transparent","offset":800},{"uri":"Translucent","surface_form":"translucent","offset":924},{"uri":"Stained_glass","surface_form":"stained glass","offset":1027}]}
