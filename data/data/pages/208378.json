{"id":208378,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_Function","text":"The Heaviside function, often written as \"H\"(x), is a non-continuous function whose value is zero for a negative input and one for a positive input.\nThe function is used in the mathematics of control theory to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time, and which stays switched on indefinitely. It was named after the Englishman Oliver Heaviside.\nThe Heaviside function is the integral of the Dirac delta function: \"H\"\u2032(x) = \"\u03B4\"(x). This is sometimes written as\nDiscrete form.\nwhere \"n\" is an integer.\nThe discrete-time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step\nis the discrete unit impulse function.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":69},{"uri":"0_(number)","surface_form":"zero","offset":93},{"uri":"1_(number)","surface_form":"one","offset":123},{"uri":"Control_theory","surface_form":"control theory","offset":192},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"Englishman","offset":332},{"uri":"Oliver_Heaviside","surface_form":"Oliver Heaviside","offset":343},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integral","offset":391},{"uri":"Dirac_delta_function","surface_form":"Dirac delta function","offset":407},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":507},{"uri":"Degenerate_distribution","surface_form":"discrete unit impulse function","offset":604}]}
