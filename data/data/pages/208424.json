{"id":208424,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubechies_wavelet","text":"Daubechies wavelets are a family of orthogonal wavelets named after Belgian physicist and mathematician Ingrid Daubechies. They are used in discrete wavelet transform.\nDefinition.\nScale function coefficients (low pass filter in orthogonal filter banks) must satisfy following conditions (formula_1 is length of filter).\nThere is more than one solution (except case of formula_1). However, it is necessary to distinguish between low pass and high pass filter.\nWavelets are denoted like D\"x\", where \"x\" is either number of coefficients (formula_1) or number of vanishing moments (formula_1). First case of notation (number of coefficients) is more recent and more frequented (e.g. D8 is wavelet with 8 coefficients).\nExample.\nMATLAB code for enumeration of wavelet with 4 coefficients (denoted as D4).\n'h0*h0 + h1*h1 + h2*h2 + h3*h3 = 1', % normalization\n'h2*h0 + h3*h1 = 0', % orthogonality\n'+(0^0)*h0 -(1^0)*h1 +(2^0)*h2 -(3^0)*h3 = 0', % zero\n'+(0^1)*h0 -(1^1)*h1 +(2^1)*h2 -(3^1)*h3 = 0' % and first vanishing moments","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wavelet","surface_form":"wavelet","offset":47},{"uri":"Ingrid_Daubechies","surface_form":"Ingrid Daubechies","offset":104},{"uri":"Discrete_wavelet_transform","surface_form":"discrete wavelet transform","offset":140},{"uri":"Quadrature_mirror_filter","surface_form":"orthogonal filter banks","offset":228},{"uri":"MATLAB","surface_form":"MATLAB","offset":724}]}
