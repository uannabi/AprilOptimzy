Someone who is a humanitarian is a person who helps to improve the lives of other people without thinking about their race, belief or nationality.\nHumanitarianism is not the same thing as Humanism which is about not believing in a god.\nA good example of Humanitarianism is the well-known story from the New Testament about the Good Samaritan who goes to help the poor man who has been robbed.\nHumanitarianism also means basic morality indispensable for human being. There are international laws called \"international humanitarian laws\" considered to created out of humanitarianism of this mean. Among them, Geneva Conventions on the matter made at the time of wars are well known.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":201},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":207},{"uri":"Nationality","surface_form":"nationality","offset":217},{"uri":"Humanism","surface_form":"Humanism","offset":271},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":314},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":386},{"uri":"Good_Samaritan","surface_form":"Good Samaritan","offset":410},{"uri":"Theft","surface_form":"robbed","offset":468},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"morality","offset":509},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":559},{"uri":"Geneva_Conventions","surface_form":"Geneva Conventions","offset":690},{"uri":"Laws_of_war","surface_form":"time of wars","offset":735}]}
