Nearly 400,000 people live there.\nMartinique was known by indigenous peoples of the Caribbean as Madiana or Madinina. It was colonized by the French in the 17th century, and they introduced racist slavery there as they spread it all around the world. France still claims to own the island today, even though there has been an independence movement.\nThe capital city is Fort-de-France. Other towns include Sainte-Anne and St. Pierre (which was destroyed by a volcano named Mont Pel\u00E9e in 1902).\nMartinique is well known for its zouk music. Artists such as Kassav' have made it famous over the years. Frantz Fanon, an important anti-colonial revolutionary, was born there.\nThe ethnic makeup of the country is: 90% African and Mixed African with anything from Chinese, East Indian or White. and 10% White, Amerindian, Chinese and East Indian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":17},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":31},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":56},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous peoples","offset":133},{"uri":"Colonization","surface_form":"colonized","offset":200},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":217},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":231},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racist","offset":265},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":272},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":401},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":428},{"uri":"Fort-de-France","surface_form":"Fort-de-France","offset":444},{"uri":"Sainte-Anne","surface_form":"Sainte-Anne","offset":480},{"uri":"St._Pierre","surface_form":"St. Pierre","offset":496},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":533},{"uri":"Mont_Pel%C3%A9e","surface_form":"Mont Pel\u00E9e","offset":547},{"uri":"1902","surface_form":"1902","offset":561},{"uri":"Zouk","surface_form":"zouk","offset":601},{"uri":"Kassav%27","surface_form":"Kassav'","offset":629},{"uri":"Frantz_Fanon","surface_form":"Frantz Fanon","offset":673},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonial","offset":705},{"uri":"Revolutionary","surface_form":"revolutionary","offset":714}]}
