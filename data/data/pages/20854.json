{"id":20854,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP","text":"PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language that helps people make web pages more interactive by allowing them to do more intelligent, complex things. PHP code is run on the web server.\nA website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website with no programming cannot do this without other complex things. Standard PHP file extensions are:.php.php3 or.phtml, but a web server can be set up to use any extension.\nIts structure was influenced by many languages like C, Perl, Java, C++, and even Python. It is considered to be free software by the Free Software Foundation.\nHistory.\nPHP was first created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995. It is now developed and improved by a large team of people. Its name at first stood for Personal Home Page, but it was later changed to PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor; using its old acronym in the new name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scripting_language","surface_form":"scripting language","offset":39},{"uri":"File_extension","surface_form":"file extension","offset":362},{"uri":"C_programming_language","surface_form":"C","offset":507},{"uri":"Perl","surface_form":"Perl","offset":510},{"uri":"Java_programming_language","surface_form":"Java","offset":516},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":522},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":536},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software","offset":567},{"uri":"Free_Software_Foundation","surface_form":"Free Software Foundation","offset":588},{"uri":"Rasmus_Lerdorf","surface_form":"Rasmus Lerdorf","offset":648}]}
