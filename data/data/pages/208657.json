{"id":208657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Alban","text":"St. Alban was the first British Christian martyr. He was a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity.\nA priest was being chased by the Romans and St. Alban swapped clothes with the priest so he could escape. When they found out, the romans ordered St. Alban to be killed. As he was a fine soldier, he was allowed to be beheaded by the sword than by the axe, because it was more honorable. When they cut off St. Alban's head, the executioner's eyes fell out into his hand, and he was blinded.\nThe bones of St. Alban were kept in a shrine in St. Albans Abbey. They were stolen during the 19th century. The town of St. Albans is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":24},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":32},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":42},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":59},{"uri":"St._Albans_Abbey","surface_form":"St. Albans Abbey","offset":542},{"uri":"St._Albans","surface_form":"St. Albans","offset":614}]}
