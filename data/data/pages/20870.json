{"id":20870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML","text":"The Extensible Markup Language (short XML) is a markup language like HTML but is extensible. It's created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XML defines rules for the construction of a document. XML adds context to the information in a document. It does not say how this should be displayed.\nSome programs get information out of an XML-document. To do that, they need an API. There are many APIs for XML.\nYou can write a description of an XML document in a way that is useful for programmers. There are several languages for this; the best known is called DTD.\nSyntax.\nXML uses less than (<) and greater than (>) to show tags. For example, a paragraph in HTML would be codice_2.\nA closing tag is a tag used to enclose the value of the tag. The tag has a slash (/) before its name. For example, codice_2\nA tag which is empty can be represented as an opening tag but with a slash before the codice_2. For example, codice_2\nLanguages.\nThe following languages are based on XML.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Markup_language","surface_form":"markup language","offset":48},{"uri":"HTML","surface_form":"HTML","offset":69},{"uri":"Extensible","surface_form":"extensible","offset":81},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web_Consortium","surface_form":"World Wide Web Consortium","offset":113},{"uri":"API","surface_form":"API","offset":376},{"uri":"DTD","surface_form":"DTD","offset":561},{"uri":"HTML","surface_form":"HTML","offset":660},{"uri":"Value","surface_form":"value","offset":727}]}
