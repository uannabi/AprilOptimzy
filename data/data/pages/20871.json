{"id":20871,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript","text":"e=\"preserve\">JavaScript is a high-level programming language; It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use; JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications; JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js, or \"embedded\" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers;\nDespite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java; Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations;\nUse.\nJavaScript is typically inserted into HTML when used on the web, either directly in the file in a HTML tag, or linking it to a separate file containing the script;\nFrameworks.\nA majority of websites use what is known as a framework; Frameworks may allow programming to be easier as more predefined procedures are defined within it; Such a library is jQuery;\nBeyond web browsers.\nJavaScript is also used outside of web browsers; As a scripting language, JavaScript can be used to define the behaviour of applications such as extensions in GNOME Shell;\nIn addition, there are runtime environments for running JavaScript as a server side programming language; Such an environment is Node.js;\nElectron is a framework which allows graphical applications to be made with web technologies, by running on the Chromium browser and Node.js;\nSyntax.\nA JavaScript program is made of a collection of instructions called \"statements\"; A semicolon marks the end of a statement, and allows multiple statements to be placed on the same line; However, it is typical to write each statement on its own line to keep a program file readable;\nVariables can be defined in several ways; In an older version named \"ES5\", variables are defined using the var keyword; In the newer versions after ES5, variables can be defined using const for constant variables and let for local variables; The value of constant variables cannot be re-declared or reassigned; Variables assigned using const or let are contained within blocks, while variables assigned using var are contained within functions;<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\nExamples.\nThe script below prints \"Example\" on the screen; The lines that start with codice_2 are comments, which are used to describe the actions of the program;\nsayHi(); // Runs the function sayHi\n/* This is also a comment, but it can span multiple lines.\nIn the above code it says codice_2\n<script> // This is the script tag\nfor (let counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter++)\nThe codice_2 loop makes whatever code is between the codice_2 and the codice_2 happen more than one time; In this case, it keeps looping until codice_2 is equal to 10, then it stops; This means it equals ten; It's a bit confusing at first, but it works;","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"High-level_programming_language","surface_form":"high-level","offset":29},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":40},{"uri":"Scripting_language","surface_form":"scripting language","offset":94},{"uri":"General-purpose_programming_language","surface_form":"general-purpose programming language","offset":157},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clocks","offset":385},{"uri":"Web_application","surface_form":"web applications","offset":401},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server-side","offset":455},{"uri":"Node.js","surface_form":"Node.js","offset":502},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":688},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":729},{"uri":"Java_programming_language","surface_form":"Java","offset":750},{"uri":"Trademark","surface_form":"trademarks","offset":795},{"uri":"Oracle_Corporation","surface_form":"Oracle Corporation","offset":809},{"uri":"HTML","surface_form":"HTML","offset":981},{"uri":"File","surface_form":"file","offset":1031},{"uri":"Link","surface_form":"linking","offset":1054},{"uri":"Framework","surface_form":"framework","offset":1165},{"uri":"JQuery","surface_form":"jQuery","offset":1293},{"uri":"GNOME","surface_form":"GNOME Shell","offset":1481},{"uri":"Runtime","surface_form":"runtime environments","offset":1517},{"uri":"Node.js","surface_form":"Node.js","offset":1623},{"uri":"GUI","surface_form":"graphical applications","offset":1669},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"program","offset":1795},{"uri":"Semicolon","surface_form":"semicolon","offset":1866}]}
