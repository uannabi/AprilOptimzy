{"id":209155,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_Man","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ages of Man is an Ancient Greek myth that divides the history of the world into five eras. In the first eras, humans lived close to gods and were happy. In the latest eras, the gods have left the world and humans live in pain and unhappiness. This myth was first written down by Greek poet Hesiod, about 2700 years ago.\nRoman poet Ovid also wrote about the Ages of Man about two thousand years ago, although he did not mention the Heroic Age.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":31},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":45},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":67},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":82},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":123},{"uri":"Gods","surface_form":"gods","offset":145},{"uri":"Hesiod","surface_form":"Hesiod","offset":303},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":333},{"uri":"Ovid","surface_form":"Ovid","offset":344}]}
