It usually has a black bar on the top edge of the hind wing (the bottom wing). There is normally a bright yellow patch near the base (where the wing connects to the body) of the fore wing (the top wing). Some individuals also have black borders along the top edges of the fore wing. The underside of the wings varies. They vary from a greenish color to bright yellow to almost white. Greener individuals have a whitish vein in the center of the hind wing. The fore wing has a bright yellow basal patch. The wingspan is 1.5 to 2.38 in. (3.8 to 6\u00A0cm.).\nSimilar species.\nSimilar species in the Lyside Sulphur's range include Queen Alexandra's Sulphur (\"Colias alexandra\"), the Cloudless Sulphur (\"Phoebis sennae\"), and the Statira Sulphur (\"Phoebis statira\").\nQueen Alexandra's Sulphur has more yellow on the underside of the fore wing. It has a whitish spot in the center of the hind wing.\nThe Cloudless Sulphur is larger. It is much more yellow.\nThe Statira Sulphur has a more yellowish upper side. The underside of the wings is pale greenish to white. Females have light pinkish markings.\nFlight period.\nThis butterfly is seen almost all year in southern Texas. It is seen from early July to mid November in Arizona.
