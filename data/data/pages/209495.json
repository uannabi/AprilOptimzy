{"id":209495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger","text":"A dagger is a knife which is used to stab people. It has a double-edged blade, so it cannot be used for normal cutting like a knife.\nDaggers are small, so they can often be hidden under the attacker's clothing and then suddenly produced.\nThey were also used in the Middle Ages for the infantry armies to defend or attack their opponents.\nSome people like Julius Caesar were assassinated with a dagger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":265},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":355},{"uri":"Assassinate","surface_form":"assassinate","offset":374}]}
