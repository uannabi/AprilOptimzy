{"id":209690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_South","text":"\"Song of the South\" is a movie produced by Walt Disney. It was released on November 12, 1946, by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the Uncle Remus stories written by Joel Chandler Harris.\n\"Song of the South\" has never been fully released on home video in the USA because of content which some people could see as racism towards black people and is thus subject to rumors. However, a song from the movie, Zip a Dee Doo Dah, is very popular, and there is a ride based on the movie at various Disney theme parks, though it was recently announced that it will be changed to a ride based on The Princess and the Frog as a result of the George Floyd protests. The movie also got a limited home video release in Asia, Europe, and South America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":25},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":43},{"uri":"Movie_release","surface_form":"released","offset":63},{"uri":"RKO_Pictures","surface_form":"RKO Radio Pictures","offset":97},{"uri":"Uncle_Remus","surface_form":"Uncle Remus","offset":136},{"uri":"Home_video","surface_form":"home video","offset":242},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"USA","offset":260},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":314},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":329},{"uri":"Rumor","surface_form":"rumors","offset":365},{"uri":"The_Princess_and_the_Frog","surface_form":"The Princess and the Frog","offset":587},{"uri":"George_Floyd_protests","surface_form":"George Floyd protests","offset":632},{"uri":"Home_video","surface_form":"home video","offset":684},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":706},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":712},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":724}]}
