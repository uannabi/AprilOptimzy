{"id":209805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chronic stress is stress that happens over a long period of time. It is different than acute stress, which happens over a short period of time and then goes away.\nStress is a normal part of every living thing's daily life. However, when stress becomes chronic, it can damage the body and the mind. When a person (or animal) is stressed, the body reacts in certain ways - for example, by releasing chemicals called corticosteroids. If this happens again and again, over a long period of time, it can change the way the brain works. These changes can damage working memory spatial memory, and decision-making skills. They can also increase aggression.\nChronic stress can cause (or worsen) many different medical problems. For example, people who have had chronic stress are more likely to get hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stress","surface_form":"stress","offset":31},{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":577},{"uri":"Aggression","surface_form":"aggression","offset":651},{"uri":"Hypertension","surface_form":"hypertension","offset":804},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":823},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":843}]}
