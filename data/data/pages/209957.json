{"id":209957,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Weston","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pamela Weston (born London, 17 October 1921; died 9 September 2009, Z\u00FCrich, Switzerland) was a British clarinettist, teacher and writer. She inspired many musicians through her inspiring teaching and her books about clarinettists and clarinet playing.\nPamela Weston was born in London. Her father was a doctor. She went to Priors Field School, then went to the Royal Academy of Music and then got a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music. She studied privately with Frederick Thurston, the principal clarinettist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. She became Professor of Clarinet at the Guildhall in 1951, and stayed there until 1969.\nShe played in many concerts: sometimes as a soloist with orchestras, sometimes giving recitals or playing in chamber music. She was a member of the Klarion Trio (soprano, clarinet and piano) with whom she often played newly composed music including the \"Songs of Innocence\" which was written for them in 1957 by Arnold Cooke.\nShe wrote several books about famous clarinet players of the past. She also wrote \"The Clarinet Teacher's Companion\", a book which was used by many clarinet teachers.\nDuring her last years she had a serious illness called encephalomyelitis. She did not want to suffer any more, so she travelled to Switzerland where she was allowed to have an assisted suicide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":33},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":81},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":89},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":108},{"uri":"Clarinet","surface_form":"clarinet","offset":116},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":316},{"uri":"Royal_Academy_of_Music","surface_form":"Royal Academy of Music","offset":374},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":412},{"uri":"Guildhall_School_of_Music","surface_form":"Guildhall School of Music","offset":431},{"uri":"Frederick_Thurston","surface_form":"Frederick Thurston","offset":485},{"uri":"BBC_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"BBC Symphony Orchestra","offset":539},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":708},{"uri":"Recital","surface_form":"recital","offset":737},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber music","offset":760},{"uri":"Encephalomyelitis","surface_form":"encephalomyelitis","offset":1199},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1275},{"uri":"Assisted_suicide","surface_form":"assisted suicide","offset":1320}]}
