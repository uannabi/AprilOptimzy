{"id":209994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cygnus\u00A0X-1 (abbreviated Cyg\u00A0X-1) is a well-known galactic X-ray source. It is thought to be a black hole in the constellation Cygnus.\nIt was discovered in 1964 during a rocket flight, and is one of the strongest X-ray sources seen from Earth. Cygnus\u00A0X-1 was the first X-ray source accepted as a black hole. It is among the most studied astronomical objects in its class. The compact object is estimated to have a mass about 14.8 times the mass of the Sun. It is too small to be any known kind of normal star, or other likely object besides a black hole. If so, the radius of its event horizon is about.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":71},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":107},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":125},{"uri":"Cygnus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Cygnus","offset":139},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":182},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":249},{"uri":"Astronomical_object","surface_form":"astronomical object","offset":349},{"uri":"Solar_mass","surface_form":"mass of the Sun","offset":452},{"uri":"Event_horizon","surface_form":"event horizon","offset":592}]}
