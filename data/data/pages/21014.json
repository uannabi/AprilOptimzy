{"id":21014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub","text":"A shrub or bush is a category of plants. A tree usually has one stem, which at some height has branches. A \"shrub\" can have multiple stems from the bottom up. Usually, bushes do not grow as tall as trees, very often they are less than 1\u20132 m tall.\nVery many plants can be either shrubs or trees, depending on the growing conditions. Small, low shrubs such as lavender, periwinkle and thyme are often termed subshrubs. Shrubs can be either deciduous or evergreen.\nA shrubbery is a garden with shrubs as the main feature.\nShrubs as a botanical structural form.\nIn botany and ecology a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical structural or plant life-form of woody plants which are less than 8 meters high and usually have many stems arising at or near the base.\nFor example, a descriptive system widely used in Australia is based on structural characteristics based on life-form, plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or dominant species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":33},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":64},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":95},{"uri":"Lavender","surface_form":"lavender","offset":358},{"uri":"Periwinkle_(plant)","surface_form":"periwinkle","offset":368},{"uri":"Thyme","surface_form":"thyme","offset":383},{"uri":"Subshrub","surface_form":"subshrub","offset":406},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":438},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":451},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":479},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":572},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":836},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":982}]}
