He is known for his \"Give me Liberty, or give me death\" speech in 1775 shortly before the American Revolutionary War in St. John's Church. He was a fiery speaker who evoked great emotion from listeners. He unsuccessfully opposed the United States Constitution, which made him an enemy of John Adams and the Federalist Party. After the French Revolution, however, he supported Adams.\nHis wife, Sarah Shelton, had a mental illness and died in 1775. He married his second wife, Dorthea Dandrige, two years later in 1777.\nAs governor of Virginia, Patrick Henry since 1776, he was one of the main architects of the requests for aid to the nascent United States, for which, in 1776 he requested support from the governor of Louisiana, Luis de Unzaga, key help for this birth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Governor_of_Virginia","surface_form":"Governor of Virginia","offset":78},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":208},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":351},{"uri":"John_Adams","surface_form":"John Adams","offset":406},{"uri":"Federalist_Party","surface_form":"Federalist Party","offset":425},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":453},{"uri":"Patrick_Henry","surface_form":"Patrick Henry","offset":661},{"uri":"Luis_de_Unzaga","surface_form":"Luis de Unzaga","offset":847}]}
