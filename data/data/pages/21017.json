{"id":21017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade","text":"A place is called in the shade when the sun is shining, and some object, a tree for example, blocks the direct sunlight. So the sunlight can not reach the spot. The dark image, which the object casts on the ground (or on another object) is called shadow, not \"shade\".\nShade can also mean a darker or lighter color of the same base color. For example: in a picture of a tree's shadow, the grass in the shade will be a darker \"shade\" of green than the grass out of the shade.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":75},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":170},{"uri":"Shadow","surface_form":"shadow","offset":247}]}
