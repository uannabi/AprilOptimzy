It has hosted many different sporting events. In 1932 and 1984, it hosted the track events and ceremonies of the Olympic Games.\nIn football, it used to be the stadium of the Chargers, Raiders and Rams before they moved to other cities. The University of Southern California, which is across the street, has played in the Coliseum for many years, and UCLA played there for several years as well. The Coliseum hosted two Super Bowls and 20 Pro Bowls, or NFL All-Star Games. On January 13, 2016, the Rams relocated back to Los Angeles.
