Much the same way that sh\u00F4nen is meant for boys up to about high school age, seinen is meant for men older than high school age. It\u2019s basically the next male demographic.\nSeinen manga and anime have a very wide range of stories. Seinen can be almost anything that\u2019s intended for men over 18 years of age. Action, comedy, drama and even hentai can all be called seinen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":29},{"uri":"Anime","surface_form":"anime","offset":82}]}
