{"id":210923,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei","text":"=\"preserve\">Josei anime is anime intended for women older than high school age. \"Josei\" means \u201Cwomen\u201D. It is the next female demographic after sh\u014Djo. Much like sh\u014Dnen and seinen there is a little overlap. Some anime fitting both demographics.\nJosei might share some traits with sh\u00F4jo, but josei tends to be more realistic. The stories portrayed in Josei anime are usually more like real life than the stories found in sh\u00F4jo. This is because the Josei audience is more mature, and want more mature anime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anime","surface_form":"anime","offset":27},{"uri":"Sh%C5%8Djo","surface_form":"sh\u014Djo","offset":143},{"uri":"Sh%C5%8Dnen_(media)","surface_form":"sh\u014Dnen","offset":160},{"uri":"Seinen","surface_form":"seinen","offset":171}]}
