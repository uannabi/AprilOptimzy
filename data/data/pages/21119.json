{"id":21119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_movie_studios","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Big Five are the United States's major movie production studios which also distribute their product. All of them have historic flagship production facilities near Hollywood.\nWith the possible exception of Disney, all five major studios are parts of much larger business enterprises, with their corporate headquarters offices far from Hollywood.\nThe group of major studios long numbered seven, but was reduced to six with the fading from importance of MGM in the 1980s. They became five when, on December 14, 2017, Disney announced its deal to buy Fox for $52.4 billion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":34},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":56},{"uri":"Movie_studio","surface_form":"studios","offset":73},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":180}]}
