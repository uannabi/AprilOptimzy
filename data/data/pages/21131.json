{"id":21131,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion","text":"A delusion is a false belief held by a person. If doctors talk about delusions they mean that the false belief is the result of some disease, usually a disease of the mind, such as \"paranoia\", \"schizophrenia\" or \"bipolar disorder, but not always neccesarily, delusions can come in many different forms such as political differences, economic differences such as a god complex upheld by someone who believes they are all powerful and many other types.\"\nStudies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.\nDelusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'. Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.\nA doctor or psychiatrist may say that a delusion is false, because it \"seems\" to be unlikely or bizarre.Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person\u2019s claims; this means that some true beliefs are erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness. Only after the Watergate scandal was she proved right, and sane.\nTreating delusions is difficult, but in some cases antypsychotics can be used. If the delusions pose a risk to the health of the patient (if consented) or the health of others, people may also be treated against their will.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":22},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctors","offset":50},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":133},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":167},{"uri":"Paranoia","surface_form":"paranoia","offset":182},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":194},{"uri":"Bipolar_disorder","surface_form":"bipolar disorder","offset":213},{"uri":"Martha_Mitchell_effect","surface_form":"Martha Mitchell effect","offset":1256},{"uri":"United_States_Attorney_General","surface_form":"attorney general","offset":1302},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":1377},{"uri":"Watergate_scandal","surface_form":"Watergate scandal","offset":1472},{"uri":"Antipsychotic","surface_form":"antypsychotics","offset":1573}]}
