{"id":21176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle","text":"The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude (imaginary lines around the Earth) that are often marked on maps of the Earth. This is the parallel of latitude that (in 2000) runs 66\u00B0 33' 39\" north of the Equator.\nThe Arctic Circle is one way to say what part of the Earth is in the Arctic. The North Pole is in the center of the Arctic Circle.\nThe position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed. It directly depends on the Earth's axial tilt. The axial tilt fluctuates within a margin of 2\u00B0 over a 40,000-year period, mostly due to tidal forces from the orbit of the Moon. The tilt is currently diminishing, so the Arctic Circle is drifting northwards at a speed of about per year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circle_of_latitude","surface_form":"circles of latitude","offset":43},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":135},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":166},{"uri":"Degree_(angle)","surface_form":"66\u00B0 33' 39\"","offset":195},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"Equator","offset":220},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":298},{"uri":"North_Pole","surface_form":"North Pole","offset":310},{"uri":"Axial_tilt","surface_form":"axial tilt","offset":443},{"uri":"Tidal_force","surface_form":"tidal force","offset":544},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":579}]}
