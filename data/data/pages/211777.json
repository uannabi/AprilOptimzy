{"id":211777,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen","text":"Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) created by British chemist Stewart Adams. It is used to stop pain, help reduce fevers, relieve arthritis pain, and acts as an inflammatory part. Ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache, dental pain, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, or arthritis. It is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold. If you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis, ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain. See also Warning section.\nCheck the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. The manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. Also, products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. Taking the wrong product could harm you. If you are taking the over-the-counter product, read all directions on the product package before taking this medication. If your doctor has prescribed this medication, read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking ibuprofen and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nTake this medication by mouth, usually every 4 to 6 hours with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) unless your doctor directs you otherwise. Do not lie down for at least 10 minutes after taking this drug. If you have stomach upset while taking this medication, take it with food, milk, or an antacid.\nThe dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. To reduce your risk of stomach bleeding and other side effects, take this medication at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Do not increase your dose or take this drug more often than directed by your doctor or the package label. For ongoing conditions such as arthritis, continue taking this medication as directed by your doctor.\nWhen ibuprofen is used by children, the dose is based on the child's weight. Read the package directions to find the proper dose for your child's weight. Consult the pharmacist or doctor if you have questions or if you need help choosing a nonprescription product.\nFor certain conditions (such as arthritis), it may take up to two weeks of taking this drug regularly until you get the full benefit.\nIf you are taking this drug \"as needed\" (not on a regular schedule), remember that pain medications work best if they are used as the first signs of pain occur. If you wait until the pain has worsened, the medication may not work as well.\nIf your condition persists or worsens, or if you think you may have a serious medical problem, get medical help right away. If you are using the nonprescription product to treat yourself or a child for fever or pain, consult the doctor right away if fever worsens or lasts more than 3 days, or if pain worsens or lasts more than 10 days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug","surface_form":"non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","offset":15},{"uri":"Stewart_Adams","surface_form":"Stewart Adams","offset":87},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":121},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":139},{"uri":"Relieve","surface_form":"relieve","offset":147},{"uri":"Arthritis","surface_form":"arthritis","offset":155},{"uri":"Inflammatory","surface_form":"inflammatory","offset":186}]}
