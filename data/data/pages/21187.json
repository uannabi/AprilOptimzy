{"id":21187,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrench","text":"A wrench (or spanner) is a tool used to provide grip and turn nuts and bolts, and similarly shaped objects.\nIn British English, \"spanner\" is the standard term. The most common shapes are called \"open-ended spanner\" and \"ring spanner\". The term \"wrench\" is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or may be used for a monkey wrench \u2013 an adjustable spanner.\nWhat a wrench or spanner does is to grip. Pulling or pushing the handle to rotate gives mechanical advantage. It applies torque to turn objects \u2013 usually rotary fasteners, such as nuts and bolts \u2013 or keep them from turning.\nAdjustable wrenches.\nAn adjustable spanner, or adjustable wrench, or crescent wrench in American English, is a tool. It may move its jaw to rotate nuts or bolts of different sizes. It was invented by Edwin Beard Budding (1795\u20131846), who also invented the lawnmower.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":27},{"uri":"Nut_(hardware)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":62},{"uri":"Bolt","surface_form":"bolt","offset":71},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":111},{"uri":"Monkey_wrench","surface_form":"monkey wrench","offset":369},{"uri":"Mechanical_advantage","surface_form":"mechanical advantage","offset":496},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":529},{"uri":"Fastener","surface_form":"fastener","offset":569},{"uri":"Adjustable_wrench","surface_form":"adjustable wrench","offset":679},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":720},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":743},{"uri":"Invented","surface_form":"invented","offset":820},{"uri":"Edwin_Beard_Budding","surface_form":"Edwin Beard Budding","offset":832},{"uri":"Lawnmower","surface_form":"lawnmower","offset":887}]}
