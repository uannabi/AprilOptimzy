Even though the team is only the Honda team with a new name, the FIA considered Brawn GP to be a new team, but agreed to let the join F1 for free instead of the usual price.\nThe new team first raced at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix on 28 March 2009, where they took 1st and 2nd place in qualifying. The team went on to win the top two positions in their debut Grand Prix race on 29 March 2009, with Jenson Button winning the race and Rubens Barrichello coming in second.\nThe team used Mercedes-Benz engines and its cars were driven by the old Honda team of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, which has lasted for 3 years.
