It is sometimes called the Southern Dimorphic Skipper.\nDescription.\nThis small butterfly triangle-shaped wings. The upper side of the male's wings is mostly orange. The edges of the wings are dark brown. The underside of the male's wings is mainly yellow-orange. The edges of the wings are dark brown. On the hind wing (the bottom wing) there is a brown basal (basal means near where the wings connect to the body) patch with a yellow spot in it. The upper side of the female's wings is dark brown. There are large, glassy spots near the edge of the fore wing (the top wing). The underside of the female's wings is a brownish-purplish color. The hind wing has a white streak on the top edge. The wingspan is 1\u215C to 1\u215D inches.\nSimilar species.\nThe only similar species in the Zabulon Skipper's range is the Hobomok Skipper (\"Poanes hobomok\").\nThe Hobomok Skipper has a more northern range. It has a different flight period. They also have more rounded wings. The upper side of the male Hobomok Skipper's wings has thicker dark brown edges. The underside of the male's hind wing does not have the yellow spot in the brown basal patch. While the female Zabulon Skipper has one form, the female Hobomok Skipper has two forms. There is the normal form and the \"pocahontas\" form. The upper side of the \"pocahontas\" form has smaller glassy spots.\nDistribution.\nIt ranges from Wisconsin east to the East Coast, south to Georgia, Texas, and Panama.\nHabitat.\nThe Zabulon Skipper can be found in a variety of habitats such as woodland edges, woodland openings, near roads, and near streams. It can adapt to other habitats including suburban areas, parks, and gardens.\nFlight period.\nThis butterfly can be seen from March to April and again in August to October in the southern part of its range. In the northern part of its range, it is seen from May to July and again in August to September.\nLife cycle.\nCourtship takes place in the afternoon. However, it will sometimes happen as early as 8:20 A.M. Females lay their eggs singly on the underside of host plant leaves. The caterpillar is either brown or green. It sometimes has a pinkish [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hue#Noun hue]. It is often impossible to tell the difference between closely related caterpillars. The chrysalis is often formed inside a leaf shelter. It is brown. The abdomen is a lighter brown with small black dots. The hibernating stage is unknown. The Zabulon Skipper has 2 broods per year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":44},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterfly","offset":59},{"uri":"Wingspan","surface_form":"wingspan","offset":766},{"uri":"Poanes_hobomok","surface_form":"Poanes hobomok","offset":893},{"uri":"Different","surface_form":"different","offset":967},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":1438},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":1481},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":1490},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":1501},{"uri":"Variety","surface_form":"variety","offset":1556},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":1567},{"uri":"Adapt","surface_form":"adapt","offset":1656},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":2077},{"uri":"Caterpillar","surface_form":"caterpillar","offset":2132},{"uri":"Impossible","surface_form":"impossible","offset":2255},{"uri":"Difference","surface_form":"difference","offset":2278},{"uri":"Chrysalis","surface_form":"chrysalis","offset":2331},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":2371},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":2397},{"uri":"Hibernation","surface_form":"hibernating","offset":2451},{"uri":"Brood","surface_form":"brood","offset":2507}]}
