{"id":212222,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mab","text":"e=\"preserve\">Queen Mab is a fairy referred to in Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. In the play she is described by Mercutio as a tiny creature who drives a chariot across the faces of people while they are asleep, causing them to dream of their wishes coming true. She has also appeared in other books afterwards, including Moby Dick and Sense and Sensibility.\nMercutio's Speech.\n\"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies\u2019 midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nAthwart men\u2019s noses as they lie asleep;\nHer wagon-spokes made of long spinners\u2019 legs,\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\nThe traces of the smallest spider\u2019s web,\nThe collars of the moonshine\u2019s watery beams,\nHer whip of cricket\u2019s bone; the lash of film;\nHer waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot half so big as a round little worm\nHer chariot is an empty hazel-nut\nMade by the joiner squirrel or an old grub,\nTime out o\u2019 mind the fairies\u2019 coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers\u2019 brains, and then they dream of love;\nO\u2019er courtiers\u2019 knees, that dream on court\u2019sies straight,\nO\u2019er lawyers\u2019 fingers, who straight dream on fees,\nO\u2019er ladies \u2018 lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nSometime she gallops o\u2019er a courtier\u2019s nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\u2019s tail\nTickling a parson\u2019s nose as a\u2019 lies asleep,\nSometime she driveth o\u2019er a soldier\u2019s neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf healths five-fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plaits the manes of horses in the night,\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fairy","surface_form":"fairy","offset":28},{"uri":"Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare","offset":49},{"uri":"Romeo_and_Juliet","surface_form":"Romeo and Juliet","offset":68},{"uri":"Mercutio","surface_form":"Mercutio","offset":118},{"uri":"Moby_Dick","surface_form":"Moby Dick","offset":327},{"uri":"Sense_and_Sensibility","surface_form":"Sense and Sensibility","offset":341}]}
