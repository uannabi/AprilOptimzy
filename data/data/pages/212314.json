{"id":212314,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Jimmy_Moore","text":"Cowboy Jimmy Moore (September 14, 1910 \u2013 November 17, 1999), born James William Moore, was a world famous American pocket billiards (pool) player. He was originally from Troup County, Georgia, and lived for much of his life in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is best known for his skill in the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous).\nMoore was an excellent athlete at other sports. He has set many records in billiards. He won the Michigan State Billiard Championship four times. He came in second at the World Championship five times while playing the best in the world such as Willie Mosconi, Irving Crane and Luther Lassiter. He won the United States National Pocket Billiards Championship in 1958, the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship in 1965, and the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition in 1984.\nMoore was known for playing in straight pool. He was a feared road player (a player who hustled while traveling across the United States). He was also known for his unusual pool style, which included wearing cowboy clothing, and an unusual way of using his pool cue when he was hitting ball\u2014a technique known as a \"slip stroke\". Moore also worked as a technical adviser for scenes in television and film that showed pool. He did so for the movie \"My Living Doll\", and the Jerry Lewis movie \"The Family Jewels\". He was honored by election to the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame, the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nJames William Moore was born on September 14, 1910 on a farm in Troup County, Georgia, just outside the City of Hogansville. He was the son of a Georgia blacksmith, sheriff and streetcar conductor. He began working at a young age to supplement his family's income. He worked at many jobs including as a cotton picker earning 35 cents per 100\u00A0pound, managing a fruit stand, and delivering newspapers. His family moved to Detroit when he was 13. There, he found other ways of making money. Moore ran card games and pursued other games of chance. He even pitched pennies. He was very good at gambling games and was a naturally gifted athlete. He was a Triple-A level baseball player in the minor leagues. He once bowled a perfect game, and was a good golfer.\nIn 1928 at 18 years of age, Moore took a job as a pinsetter at Car Barns, a local bowling alley, earning six cents a line. Moore learned fast. For a time he achieved a 233 bowling average. Moore first picked up a cue stick at Car Barns, playing on the single 4\u00A0x\u00A08\u00A0foot pool table the bowling alley had. According to Moore, he immediately fell in love with the game. Specifically, the game he loved was straight pool (14.1 continuous). This was the main game he competed at during his career. He did, however, play other billiard games. In fact, in later years Moore become U.S. national snooker champion, and came in second at the 1961 First Annual World's One-Pocket Billiards Tournament in Johnston City, Illinois.\nStraight pool was the game of championship pocket billiards competition until approximately the 1980s. Then, it was overtaken by \"faster\" games such as nine-ball. In the game, a shooter may attempt to pocket any ball on the table (but the cue ball). The object is to reach a set number of points which is agreed before the game. Professional competition is often played to 150 points. One point is scored for each ball sunk in a pocket that must be called by the player. According to Moore, his high run in the game was 236 ball in a row.\nSix months after he first started playing, Moore entered and won the 1929 Michigan State billiard championship. He successfully defended that title in the following three years. During the middle of the Great Depression, however, playing pool for trophies was not a luxury Moore could afford. Instead, he took his game on the road to attempt to make a living gambling.\nOn the road.\nMoore and Willis became traveling partners after that match. They often traveled on the road with future six-time world champion Luther \"Wimpy\" Lassiter. Because of his skill and well known road partners, Moore's name began to be known in the billiard world. In 1940, the World Pocket Billiards (straight pool) titleholder of that year, Andrew Ponzi, sought out Moore looking for a challenge. At the match arranged, Moore first beat Ponzi out of $80 playing nine-ball. He then beat him at his own game, straight pool. Moore scored 125 points to Ponzi's 82.\nAfter Moore's match with Ponzi, he was hired by Ponzi's employer, Sylvester Livingston. Livingston was a man who hosted exhibitions with a lot of top pool talent, including Irving Crane. Crane, like Lassiter, would become a six-time world champion. During 1941, Moore performed 250 exhibitions across the U.S. He earned $5 for matinees, and $7 for evening performances. He lost only one match over the year. During that same time he had straight pool runs of 100 or more points in 24 out of the 250 exhibitions.\nBy that time Moore was recognizable for his cowboy characteristics. He customarily wore cowboy boots, a white Stetson hat and a string tie. He kept his hair in a crew-cut, and was rarely seen without a cigar. He was also known for his unusual form of stroke. Moore employed a slip stroke. This is a way of shooting in which a player releases his gripping hand briefly and re-grasps the cue farther back on the butt just before hitting the cue ball. Using the slip stroke, Moore was deadly accurate, but could also shoot with great power.\nIn 1945, Moore's purchased a home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He would live there for the rest of his life with his wife, Julie Chavez, whom he married in 1949. They had seven children together: sons Jamie, Raymond and Tommy, and daughters Pamela Nathan, Kolma Moore, Emily DiLorenzo and Linda Bates. Soon after moving to Albuquerque, he became co-owner and operator of the U Cue Billiards Hall in the City. It was said that hustlers avoided going through Albuquerque just to avoid getting into a money game with Moore.\nExhibition and competition.\nThough Moore continued playing on the road\u2014as he would for over 40 years\u2014he began competing and placing in top-tier tournaments. His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner-up finishes that would earn him the nickname \"pool's underpaid prince\" in such publications as Esquire Magazine. The name that stuck with him for life, however, was Cowboy. According to Moore, he became 'Cowboy' Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo, but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat.\nThe second-place-saga started in 1951 at the two week long, double-elimination, round robin format, World Championship tournament, held that year in Boston. At the competition, Moore was defeated in his last match by Willie Mosconi. His record was seven wins in nine matches, including triumphs over future Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Hall-of-Famers, Irving Crane and Arthur \"Babe\" Cranfield.\nIn 1952 he made a strong showing in the same competition, held once more in Boston, running 93 balls against Lassiter, beating him 150\u00A0to\u00A025, but again finishing behind Willie Mosconi, this time sharing second place with Jimmy Caras and Joe Procita. Moore's match with Mosconi had an ending score of 150\u00A0to\u00A058 in 19 innings. Moore competed in the 1953 World Championship in San Francisco, but did not place, losing in his last match to Crane, 150-56 in 7 innings.\nThe following year Moore took second place yet again in the World Championship, held that year in Philadelphia. The 1954 tournament was not sponsored and was unsanctioned by the BCA; in its absence being organized by Irving Crane. It was denominated by newspapers, such as \"The New York Times\", as the \"Unofficial World Pocket Billiard Championship.\" In a career highlight in the penultimate match there, Moore was losing 148\u00A0to\u00A08 to Irving Crane. When Crane let him back to the table, Moore ran 142 balls and out. Despite this feat, Moore was dispatched to second place by Lassiter, with a final score of 150\u00A0to\u00A095, sharing second place with Crane. The defending champion, Mosconi, did not participate.\nMoore's runner-up streak continued in the 1956 World Championship held at Judice's Academy in Brooklyn, New York. He clinched second place, to Willie Mosconi's now almost ubiquitous first, with a 150\u00A0to\u00A050 score over Al Coslosky of Philadelphia in 15 innings, a win over Richard Riggie of Baltimore, 150\u00A0to\u00A0121, with an inspired run of 107 balls, but a loss to Lassiter, 150\u00A0to\u00A070 in 7 innings. That same year Moore played Mosconi at a challenge match in Kinston, North Carolina. It was not Moore's day as Mosconi posted a career highlight; a perfect match\u2014150 balls in a row in one inning.\nIn all, Moore came in second at the World Championship five times but never took the crown. He did however win the National Pocket Billiards Championship held in Chicago at Bensinger's Billiards in 1958. The tournament was a challenge match, marathon straight pool race to 3,000 points between Moore and Luther Lassiter. It was a tight competition, with Lassiter leading at one point 1,800\u00A0to\u00A01,512. Moore battled back and eventually won with a final score of 3,000\u00A0to\u00A02,634.\nMoore would eventually have ten second-place finishes in world-title competition. Nevertheless, he frequently competed with and beat all of the players whom he so often played second fiddle to in sanctioned tournament play. In fact, later in 1958, the same year he won the National Pocket Billiards Championship against Lassiter, he roundly defeated Mosconi in a two-day exhibition match in his home town of Albuquerque, with a final score of 500\u00A0to\u00A0397. Moore and Mosconi would battle it out many times in unsanctioned but publicized play. In addition to matches previously mentioned, they vied at Albuquerque's old Chaplin Alley on 1956; at the Highland Bowl in 1958; and later, in matches in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Chicago and Johnston City at the Jansco Brother's Stardust Open, where Moore would win the prize for \"all-around honors\".\nIt was not until 1965 at the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship, seven years after his last first-place finish, that he would repeat as champion in a sanctioned tournament. At that contest held at the Riviera Terrace in New York City, along the way to first place and the prize of $4,000, Moore defeated: Onofrio Lauri 150\u00A0to\u00A0117; Joe Balsis 150\u00A0to\u00A0-3; Cisero Murphy 150\u00A0to\u00A096; \"Champagne\" Edwin Kelly 150\u00A0to\u00A083 in 3 innings; and the ever-present Luther Lassiter, 150\u00A0to\u00A041 in 4 innings. The runner up in the tourney was Joe Balsis.\nIn addition to competition, Moore served as a technical adviser for billiard-related scenes in television and film, including \"My Living Doll\" starring Julie Newmar and Robert Cummings in 1964, and the Jerry Lewis movie \"The Family Jewels\" in 1965.\nLater life.\nMoore was inducted into the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame in 1982, the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame in 1994, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He remained competitive in tournament and match play well into his 70s. In 1984, at age 74, Moore won the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition on ESPN. Even in later years he was still deadly on a pool table, running 111 balls three days after his 80th birthday. \"Until the traffic accident I had about a year ago, I was still playing my usual speed\" Moore said in July 1999 at the age of 89. However, Moore's health declined rapidly that same year. He died on November 17, 1999 of natural causes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pocket_billiards","surface_form":"pocket billiards","offset":115},{"uri":"Troup_County%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Troup County, Georgia","offset":170},{"uri":"Albuquerque%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","offset":227},{"uri":"Straight_pool","surface_form":"straight pool (14.1 continuous)","offset":298},{"uri":"Willie_Mosconi","surface_form":"Willie Mosconi","offset":576},{"uri":"Irving_Crane","surface_form":"Irving Crane","offset":592},{"uri":"Luther_Lassiter","surface_form":"Luther Lassiter","offset":609},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":942},{"uri":"Cowboy","surface_form":"cowboy","offset":1027},{"uri":"Clothes","surface_form":"clothing","offset":1034},{"uri":"My_Living_Doll","surface_form":"My Living Doll","offset":1266},{"uri":"Jerry_Lewis","surface_form":"Jerry Lewis","offset":1291},{"uri":"The_Family_Jewels","surface_form":"The Family Jewels","offset":1310},{"uri":"Billiard_Congress_of_America","surface_form":"Billiard Congress of America","offset":1364},{"uri":"Hogansville%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Hogansville","offset":1624},{"uri":"Blacksmith","surface_form":"blacksmith","offset":1665},{"uri":"Sheriff","surface_form":"sheriff","offset":1677},{"uri":"Conductor_(transportation)","surface_form":"conductor","offset":1699},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":1769},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":1815},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1872},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":1900},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":1932},{"uri":"Card","surface_form":"card","offset":2010},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":2015},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"games of chance","offset":2039},{"uri":"Minor_league_baseball","surface_form":"minor leagues","offset":2199},{"uri":"Bowling","surface_form":"bowled","offset":2222},{"uri":"Golf","surface_form":"golf","offset":2260},{"uri":"Bowling_alley","surface_form":"bowling alley","offset":2350},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":2448},{"uri":"Billiard_table","surface_form":"pool table","offset":2538},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":2615},{"uri":"Straight_pool","surface_form":"straight pool (14.1 continuous)","offset":2671},{"uri":"Snooker","surface_form":"snooker","offset":2856},{"uri":"Johnston_City%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Johnston City, Illinois","offset":2961},{"uri":"Nine-ball","surface_form":"nine-ball","offset":3138},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":3728},{"uri":"Trophy","surface_form":"trophies","offset":3772},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":3931},{"uri":"Luther_Lassiter","surface_form":"Luther \"Wimpy\" Lassiter","offset":4036},{"uri":"Andrew_Ponzi","surface_form":"Andrew Ponzi","offset":4244},{"uri":"Nine-ball","surface_form":"nine-ball","offset":4365},{"uri":"Irving_Crane","surface_form":"Irving Crane","offset":4637},{"uri":"Matinee","surface_form":"matinee","offset":4791},{"uri":"Cowboy","surface_form":"cowboy","offset":5020},{"uri":"Cowboy_boot","surface_form":"cowboy boot","offset":5064},{"uri":"Stetson","surface_form":"Stetson hat","offset":5086},{"uri":"Esquire_Magazine","surface_form":"Esquire Magazine","offset":6363},{"uri":"Double-elimination_tournament","surface_form":"double-elimination","offset":6741},{"uri":"Round-robin_tournament","surface_form":"round robin","offset":6761},{"uri":"Willie_Mosconi","surface_form":"Willie Mosconi","offset":6898},{"uri":"Arthur_Cranfield","surface_form":"Arthur \"Babe\" Cranfield","offset":7056},{"uri":"Jimmy_Caras","surface_form":"Jimmy Caras","offset":7302},{"uri":"Joe_Procita","surface_form":"Joe Procita","offset":7318},{"uri":"Irving_Crane","surface_form":"Irving Crane","offset":7762},{"uri":"Irving_Crane","surface_form":"Irving Crane","offset":7979},{"uri":"Kinston%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Kinston, North Carolina","offset":8704},{"uri":"Race","surface_form":"race","offset":9105},{"uri":"Winston-Salem%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","offset":10011},{"uri":"Onofrio_Lauri","surface_form":"Onofrio Lauri","offset":10498},{"uri":"Joe_Balsis","surface_form":"Joe Balsis","offset":10524},{"uri":"Cisero_Murphy","surface_form":"Cisero Murphy","offset":10546},{"uri":"Edwin_Kelly","surface_form":"\"Champagne\" Edwin Kelly","offset":10571},{"uri":"My_Living_Doll","surface_form":"My Living Doll","offset":10853},{"uri":"Julie_Newmar","surface_form":"Julie Newmar","offset":10878},{"uri":"Robert_Cummings","surface_form":"Robert Cummings","offset":10895},{"uri":"The_Family_Jewels_(film)","surface_form":"The Family Jewels","offset":10947},{"uri":"Billiard_Congress_of_America","surface_form":"Billiard Congress of America","offset":11072}]}
