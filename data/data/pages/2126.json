{"id":2126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon","text":"Argon is a chemical element. The symbol for argon is Ar, and its atomic number (or proton number) is 18. It is a noble gas and no electrons or protons can be lost or gained from this atom.\nArgon atoms are found in air. About 1% of the Earth's atmosphere (the air around us) is argon.\nArgon is often used when welding steel and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the oxygen in the air can't join with the metal being welded.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":11},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":65},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":83},{"uri":"Noble_gas","surface_form":"noble gas","offset":113},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":130},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":195},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":214},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":235},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":243}]}
