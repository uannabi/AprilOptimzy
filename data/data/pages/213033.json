{"id":213033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phulra","text":"Phulra was a minor princely state of both Pakistan and British India, in the modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It was east of the nearby princely Amb. Both states ended in 1950 when they were merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. There is some dispute as to whether Phulra ranked as a full princely state or as a minor noble estate (\"jagir\") of the Indian Empire.\nAt present, Phulra is a small town and union council in Mansehra District, Hazara, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"princely state","offset":19},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":42},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":55},{"uri":"Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","surface_form":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","offset":84},{"uri":"Amb_(princely_state)","surface_form":"Amb","offset":139},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"Indian Empire","offset":349},{"uri":"Mansehra_District","surface_form":"Mansehra District","offset":420},{"uri":"Hazara","surface_form":"Hazara","offset":439}]}
