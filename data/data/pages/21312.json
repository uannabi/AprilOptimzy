{"id":21312,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey","text":"Jersey is an island in the English Channel off the northwest coast of France. It is a crown dependency of the British monarchy. Jersey is called a \"bailiwick\" because the person who is the head of law for the island is called the \"Bailiff\". The Bailiwick of Jersey also includes the islands of the Minquiers and Ecr\u00E9hous, where nobody lives. The other islands of the Channel Islands belong to the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The country code (also used for internet) is JE.\nOver 106 000 people live on the main island. Thirty per cent of them live in its only town, Saint Helier.\nAlong with English and French, more than two thousand people speak J\u00E8rriais, a local variation of the Norman language.\nPolitics.\nJersey is not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union, but the Queen of the UK is the Queen of Jersey as well. It has its own parliament called the \"States of Jersey\" which passes laws for the island.\nThe \"Chief Minister\" of Jersey is in charge of the government. His name is John Le Fondr\u00E9.\nJersey is divided into 12 parishes which elect their own politicians and have control over some roads and the \"Honorary\" (volunteer) police.\nHistory.\nPeople lived in Jersey before the sea rose and made it an island.

It is 22 kilometres (14 miles) from France and 160 kilometres (100 miles) from England. It is the biggest of the \"Channel Islands\", a group of islands. The other big Channel Island is called Guernsey.\nThe island is around 9 miles from east to west and 5 miles from north to south, so it is often called \"nine-by-five\".\nThe island can have a hot weather in summer and normally has mild weather in winter but sometimes is as cold as -10.3 degrees Celcius.
