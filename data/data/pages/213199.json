{"id":213199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer","text":"Manuel Neuer (born 27 March 1986) is a German footballer. He is the goalkeeper for FC Bayern Munich and Germany national team.\nCareer.\nNeuer started playing for the youth teams of Schalke 04 when he was five years old. On 19 August 2006 he played his first match in the Bundesliga. Because he was very good, he replaced Frank Rost as Schalke's number one. Rost left Schalke in 2007 and plays now for the New York Red Bulls.\nOn 1 June 2011 Schalke and Bayern Munich announced that Neuer would move to Bayern Munich in July 2011. There he signed a five-year contract that will last until June 2016. The transfer was worth \u20AC18 million, therefore making him the third most expensive goalkeeper of all time. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup Neuer made some world class saves and only conceded a few goals during the tournament, but in the European qualifiers he conceded 2 major goals in a 2-0 loss to Poland. Despite injuries in the 2017 - 2018 season, he was picked to be Germany's number one goalkeeper at the 2018 World Cup until their early exit following a 2 - 0 loss to South Korea. T\nhe result led to Germany\u2019s earliest World Cup exit since the 1930s loss to Switzerland.\nNeuer has also played for all of the youth teams of the Germany national football team from the Under-18 team and on. On 2 June 2009, he played for the first time in the senior team against the United Arab Emirates.\nNeuer was selected as Germany's number one for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The star goalkeeper is considered one of the world\u2019s best goalkeepers as he won the IFFHS World\u2019s Best Goalkeeper from 2013 to 2016. He also won the FIFA best goalkeeper award following Germany\u2019s victory at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In addition, he also finished third behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at the 2014 FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or Award.\nThe following season, his power saving skills helped Schalke to advance to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League; thus emerging UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year.\nGiven the captain band of the Schalke team in 2010, Manuel led the team to the Champions League semi-final that year and after the 2011/12 season, he ended his career with Schalke. Joining Bayern Munich in June 2011, Manuel Neuer has been the first choice goalkeeper for the club and has led the team to win several championships.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":39},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"footballer","offset":46},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":68},{"uri":"FC_Bayern_Munich","surface_form":"FC Bayern Munich","offset":83},{"uri":"Germany_national_football_team","surface_form":"Germany national team","offset":104},{"uri":"FC_Schalke_04","surface_form":"Schalke 04","offset":180},{"uri":"Bundesliga","surface_form":"Bundesliga","offset":270},{"uri":"Frank_Rost","surface_form":"Frank Rost","offset":320},{"uri":"New_York_Red_Bulls","surface_form":"New York Red Bulls","offset":404},{"uri":"FC_Bayern_Munich","surface_form":"Bayern Munich","offset":451},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":679},{"uri":"2014_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2014 FIFA World Cup","offset":714},{"uri":"Poland_national_football_team","surface_form":"Poland","offset":895},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":967},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":988},{"uri":"2010_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2018 World Cup","offset":1006},{"uri":"Germany_national_football_team","surface_form":"Germany national football team","offset":1229},{"uri":"United_Arab_Emirates_national_football_team","surface_form":"United Arab Emirates","offset":1367},{"uri":"2010_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2010 FIFA World Cup","offset":1440},{"uri":"2014_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2014 FIFA World Cup","offset":1672},{"uri":"Cristiano_Ronaldo","surface_form":"Cristiano Ronaldo","offset":1736},{"uri":"Lionel_Messi","surface_form":"Lionel Messi","offset":1758}]}
