{"id":21323,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor","text":"The Democratic Republic of East Timor or Timor Leste is a country in Southeast Asia. It is on the eastern side of the island of Timor. It also includes the smaller islands of Atauro and Jaco Island, and a small area, named Oecusse, inside the west side of Timor. Oecusse is an exclave, which means it is separated from the main part of the country by part of another country. That other country is Indonesia.\nThe capital and largest city, Dili, is home to one hundred and fifty thousand people. The next largest city is Baucau. (see List of settlements in East Timor).\nEast Timor gets its name from the Malay word for \"east\", \"timur\".\nIt is a member of the United Nations the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.\nHistory.\nFor a long time, Portugal controlled the East Timor and called it the Colony of Portuguese Timor. In 1975, the Portuguese army left, and East Timor was invaded (taken over) by the Indonesian army in 1975. The invasion was very violent. The army stayed there until 1999, when they gave up control of the territory with the help of the United Nations.\nAt the time, the United States government said it did not know Indonesia was going to invade East Timor. But secret documents, released from 2002 to 2005, show that Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, did know, and supported the invasion.\nWhen it got its independence on 20 May 2002, it became the first country to become independent in the twenty-first century (since the year 2001). In 2006, when Montenegro became independent, East Timor was no longer the newest one.\nSince then, East Timor has not been given much attention in the news. Recently, the Colombian music artist Shakira made a song named \"Timor\", which talks about the country. The attention is because there has been fighting in East Timor between gangs (groups of criminals with guns), security forces (the country's army). Australia, a large nearby country, sent troops in to make peace.\nEast Timor is a small country located between Australia and Indonesia, 3,000 years ago, East Timor was a mountainous island composed of migrant indigenous people from New Guinea, Australia and Melanesia.\nThere were some migrants from Austronesia searching for a new life on this island. Some of the people arrived from South China and North Indochina looking for trade because East Timor had resources which could be exported, like sandalwood, honey, slaves and wax.\nDuring the Second World War, the Japanese occupied the region, encountered strong resistance to their attempts to force the population to grow foods for their troops and export. At the time 30% of the population died.\nOn 25 April 1974, the Portuguese Armed Forces headed by General Ant\u00F3nio de Sp\u00EDnola organized a Military Coup against Salazar\u2019s regime called the Revolution of Carnations. After this revolution, Portugal decided to give freedom to the colonized countries.\nGeography.\nEast Timor is the largest of the Lesser Sunda Islands. To the north of the island are the Ombai Strait, Wetar Strait, and the greater Banda Sea. To the south the Timor Sea separates the island from Australia.\nThe country has many mountains. Its highest point is Tatamailau (also known as Mount Ramelau) at. The climate is tropical and generally hot and humid.\nThe Nino Konis Santana National Park is on the eastern tip of the island. The park includes coral reefs, coastal area, and mountains.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":58},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":69},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":118},{"uri":"Timor","surface_form":"Timor","offset":128},{"uri":"Atauro","surface_form":"Atauro","offset":175},{"uri":"Jaco_Island","surface_form":"Jaco Island","offset":186},{"uri":"Oecusse","surface_form":"Oecusse","offset":223},{"uri":"Exclave","surface_form":"exclave","offset":277},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":398},{"uri":"Dili","surface_form":"Dili","offset":439},{"uri":"Baucau%2C_Timor_Leste","surface_form":"Baucau.","offset":520},{"uri":"List_of_settlements_in_East_Timor","surface_form":"List of settlements in East Timor","offset":533},{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay","offset":603},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":657},{"uri":"Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations","surface_form":"Association of Southeast Asian Nations","offset":676},{"uri":"Community_of_Portuguese_Language_Countries","surface_form":"Community of Portuguese Language Countries","offset":723},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":793},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1110},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1143},{"uri":"Henry_Kissinger","surface_form":"Henry Kissinger","offset":1291},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1338},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":1407},{"uri":"Montenegro","surface_form":"Montenegro","offset":1551},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":1707},{"uri":"Shakira","surface_form":"Shakira","offset":1730},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":1745},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1944},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":2002},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":2334},{"uri":"Indochina","surface_form":"Indochina","offset":2350},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":2487},{"uri":"Japanese_people","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":2509},{"uri":"Salazar","surface_form":"Salazar","offset":2811},{"uri":"Lesser_Sunda_Islands","surface_form":"Lesser Sunda Islands","offset":2993},{"uri":"Ombai_Strait","surface_form":"Ombai Strait","offset":3050},{"uri":"Wetar_Strait","surface_form":"Wetar Strait","offset":3064},{"uri":"Banda_Sea","surface_form":"Banda Sea","offset":3094},{"uri":"Timor_Sea","surface_form":"Timor Sea","offset":3122},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":3158},{"uri":"Tatamailau","surface_form":"Tatamailau","offset":3222},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":3282},{"uri":"Nino_Konis_Santana_National_Park","surface_form":"Nino Konis Santana National Park","offset":3324},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":3412}]}
