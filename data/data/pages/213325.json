{"id":213325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center","text":"United Center (nicknamed \"The Madhouse on Madison II\",\"The UC\" and \"The House That Jordan Built\") is a sports arena located in Chicago, Illinois. The arena opened in 1994, and right now the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) play there. There is a statue of Michael Jordan on the east side of the arena.\nThe Bulls and Blackhawks moved to the United Center in 1994. This was a change for both organizations as they had previously played in the older Chicago Stadium for many years. The Blackhawks, previously also called the Chicago Stadium Corporation, rather than the Bulls, were the actual owners of both the previous Chicago Stadium and now the United Center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":103},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":110},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":127},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":136},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":190},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League (NHL)","offset":216},{"uri":"Chicago_Bulls","surface_form":"Chicago Bulls","offset":253},{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"National Basketball Association (NBA)","offset":274},{"uri":"Michael_Jordan","surface_form":"Michael Jordan","offset":345},{"uri":"Chicago_Stadium","surface_form":"Chicago Stadium","offset":536}]}
