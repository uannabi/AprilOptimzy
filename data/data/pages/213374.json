{"id":213374,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity","text":"=\"preserve\">Heredity is the passing of traits (characteristics) from parents to offspring. In biology, the study of heredity is called genetics. With most living things, heredity is analysed by breeding (making crosses), often in a laboratory. But with humans, heredity is studied in other ways. Family pedigrees, identical twins and DNA genome analysis all provide clues.\nA trait which may be inherited is heritable; it is inborn or innate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"traits","offset":39},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":94},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":135},{"uri":"Breeding","surface_form":"breeding","offset":194},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":232},{"uri":"Humans","surface_form":"humans","offset":253},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"Family","offset":296},{"uri":"Pedigree","surface_form":"pedigree","offset":303},{"uri":"Identical_twins","surface_form":"identical twins","offset":314},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":334},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":338}]}
