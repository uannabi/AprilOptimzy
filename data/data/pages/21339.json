Perhaps his best-known play is called \"Publikumsbeschimpfung\" (translates roughly as \"insulting /offending the audience\"). The play consists of actors insulting and offending the audience, and later congratulating them for the good performance. The play has been labelled as \"antitheater\".\nIn 2019, Handke was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carinthia_(state)","surface_form":"Carinthia","offset":48},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":66},{"uri":"Translator","surface_form":"translator","offset":86},{"uri":"Antitheater","surface_form":"antitheater","offset":465},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":511}]}
