He worked on embryology, and also discovered unmyelinated nerve fibres and the nerve cells in the heart sometimes called Remak's ganglia. He studied under Johannes Muller at the University of Berlin.\nRemak discovered that the origin of cells was by the division of pre-existing cells.\nDespite his accomplishments, because of his Jewish faith he was repeatedly denied full professor status until late in life, and even then was denied the usual benefits of the position.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":51},{"uri":"Embryologist","surface_form":"embryologist","offset":58},{"uri":"Physiologist","surface_form":"physiologist","offset":72},{"uri":"Neurologist","surface_form":"neurologist","offset":90},{"uri":"Posen","surface_form":"Posen","offset":111},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":118},{"uri":"Humboldt-University_of_Berlin","surface_form":"Friedrich Wilhelm University","offset":166},{"uri":"Embryology","surface_form":"embryology","offset":253},{"uri":"Remak%27s_ganglia","surface_form":"Remak's ganglia","offset":361},{"uri":"Johannes_Muller","surface_form":"Johannes Muller","offset":395},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"division","offset":493},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":569}]}
