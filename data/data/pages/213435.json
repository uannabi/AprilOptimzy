{"id":213435,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Strasburger","text":"Eduard Adolf Strasburger (1 February 1844 in Warsaw \u2013 19 May 1912 in Bonn) was a German professor who was one of the most famous botanists of the 19th century.\nIn 1868 he taught at the University of Warsaw. In 1869 Strasburger was appointed professor of botany at the University of Jena. After 1881 he was head of the \"Botanisches Institut\" at the University of Bonn.\nAccomplishments.\nStrasburger was a founder of the famous \"Lehrbuch der Botanik f\u00FCr Hochschulen\" (\"Textbook of Botany\"), which first appeared in 1894. He was the first to provide an accurate description of the embryonic sac in gymnosperms (such as conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants), along with demonstrating double-fertilization in angiosperms. He came up with one of the modern laws of plant cytology: \"New cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other nuclei\", and originated the terms cytoplasm and nucleoplasm.\nAt about the same time as Walther Flemming, and Edouard van Beneden, he worked out chromosome movement during mitosis in plant cells. His work on the upward movement of tree sap proved that the process was physical and not physiological.\nAwards.\nHe was awarded the Linnean Society's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Warsaw","surface_form":"Warsaw","offset":45},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":69},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":81},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":129},{"uri":"University_of_Warsaw","surface_form":"University of Warsaw","offset":185},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":254},{"uri":"University_of_Jena","surface_form":"University of Jena","offset":268},{"uri":"University_of_Bonn","surface_form":"University of Bonn","offset":348},{"uri":"Gymnosperm","surface_form":"gymnosperm","offset":594},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":615},{"uri":"Angiosperms","surface_form":"angiosperms","offset":629},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cytology","offset":771},{"uri":"Cytoplasm","surface_form":"cytoplasm","offset":874},{"uri":"Walther_Flemming","surface_form":"Walther Flemming","offset":927},{"uri":"Edouard_van_Beneden","surface_form":"Edouard van Beneden","offset":949},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":984},{"uri":"Mitosis","surface_form":"mitosis","offset":1011},{"uri":"Sap","surface_form":"tree sap","offset":1070},{"uri":"Darwin-Wallace_Medal","surface_form":"Darwin-Wallace Medal","offset":1196}]}
