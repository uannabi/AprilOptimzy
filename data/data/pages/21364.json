{"id":21364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner","text":"In computing, an image scanner is a device used to transfer images or text into a computer. There are special models for scanning photo negatives, or to scan books. In the computer, the signal from the scanner is transferred to a digital image. This image can then be edited, printed, etc. All scanners have special parts which are used to take a picture from an object.\nCharge-coupled device or Contact Image Sensor parts take the light from the object and change it into a digital signal. The digital signal is then transferred to the computer memory or is read in the scanner's processor. With some software it can be changed to a compressed digital image, like JPEG or PNG. Text printed or written by hand can be changed to ASCII code by an OCR program.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":60},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":70},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":82},{"uri":"Film_negative","surface_form":"photo negative","offset":130},{"uri":"Digital_media","surface_form":"digital image","offset":230},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":347},{"uri":"Digital_signal","surface_form":"digital signal","offset":475},{"uri":"Computer_memory","surface_form":"computer memory","offset":537},{"uri":"Processor","surface_form":"processor","offset":581},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":602},{"uri":"JPEG","surface_form":"JPEG","offset":665},{"uri":"ASCII","surface_form":"ASCII","offset":728},{"uri":"Optical_character_recognition","surface_form":"OCR","offset":745}]}
