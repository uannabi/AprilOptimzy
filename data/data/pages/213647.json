{"id":213647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphalidae","text":"The Nymphalidae is the largest family of butterflies, with about 6,000 species. They live on all continents except Antarctica. They are commonly known as nymphalids, brushfoots, or brush-footed butterflies.\nCharacteristics.\nBrushfoots get their name from their front pair of legs. This pair of legs is reduced. They do not have claws at the end. Only the middle and last pair of legs are used for walking. This is why they are called brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies.\nMany species are brightly colored and include popular species such as the emperors, admirals, tortoiseshells, and fritillaries. Most hold their colourful wings flat when they are at rest. However, the underwings are often dull; in some species they look just like dead leaves, or are much paler. So when they raise their wings in the normal butterfly position, this cryptic effect helps the butterfly disappear into its surroundings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":31},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterflies","offset":41},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":71},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":97},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":115},{"uri":"Reduce","surface_form":"reduced","offset":302},{"uri":"Claw","surface_form":"claw","offset":328},{"uri":"Crypsis","surface_form":"cryptic","offset":853}]}
