{"id":213702,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Arminius","text":"e=\"preserve\">Jacobus Arminius (October 10, 1560 \u2013 October 19, 1609), is the Latin name of the Dutch theologian Jakob Harmenszoon. He is also known by the names of Jacob Arminius or James Arminius. Arminius was a professor of theology at the University of Leiden from 1603 until he died in 1609. He wrote many books and papers on theology, which is the study of God, and his views became the basis for the Dutch Remonstrants.\nAfter he died, his views on theology were most widely known for being the opposite of the five points of Calvinism, though Arminius only objected to three: unconditional election, limited atonement, and irresistible grace; and he doubted the perseverance of the saints. His view on total depravity agreed with John Calvin, only changing the view held by Calvinists a little bit.\nLife.\nArminius was born at Oudewater, Utrecht. His father Herman died when Arminius was a baby, leaving his wife (and Jacob's mother) as a single mother with small children.\nTheodorus Aemilius, a priest, adopted Jacobus and sent him to school at Utrecht. His mother was killed by the Spanish in Oudewater in 1575. About that same year the kindness of his friends allowed him to go study theology at the University of Leiden.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":76},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":94},{"uri":"Theologian","surface_form":"theologian","offset":100},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":361},{"uri":"Remonstrants","surface_form":"Remonstrants","offset":411},{"uri":"Five_points_of_Calvinism","surface_form":"five points of Calvinism","offset":515},{"uri":"Unconditional_election","surface_form":"unconditional election","offset":581},{"uri":"Limited_atonement","surface_form":"limited atonement","offset":605},{"uri":"Irresistible_grace","surface_form":"irresistible grace","offset":628},{"uri":"Perseverance_of_the_saints","surface_form":"perseverance of the saints","offset":667},{"uri":"Total_depravity","surface_form":"total depravity","offset":707},{"uri":"John_Calvin","surface_form":"John Calvin","offset":735},{"uri":"Oudewater","surface_form":"Oudewater","offset":831},{"uri":"Utrecht_(province)","surface_form":"Utrecht","offset":842},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adopted","offset":1008},{"uri":"Utrecht_(city)","surface_form":"Utrecht","offset":1050},{"uri":"University_of_Leiden","surface_form":"University of Leiden","offset":1207}]}
