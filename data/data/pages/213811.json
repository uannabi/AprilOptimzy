{"id":213811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Beecher_Wilson","text":"e=\"preserve\">Edmund Beecher Wilson (Geneva, Illinois, 19 October 1856 \u2013 3 March 1939) was a pioneering American zoologist and cell biologist. He wrote one of the most famous textbooks in the history of modern biology, \"The Cell\".\nCareer.\nWilson graduated from Yale in 1878. He earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins in 1881. He was a lecturer at Williams College in 1883\u201384 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1884\u201385. He served as professor of biology at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 to 1891.\nHe spent the balance of his career at Columbia University where he was successively adjunct professor of biology (1891\u201394), professor of invertebrate zoology (1894\u20131897), and professor of zoology (from 1897).\nWilson is credited as America's first cell biologist. In 1898 he used the similarity in embryos to describe evolutionary relationships. By observing spiral cleavage in molluscs, flatworms and annelids he concluded that the same organs came from the same group of cells and concluded that all these organisms must have a common ancestor.\nHe also discovered the chromosomal XY sex-determination system in 1905\u2014that males have XY and females XX sex chromosomes. Nettie Stevens independently made the same discovery the same year.\nIn 1907, he described, for the first time, the additional or supernumerary chromosomes, now called B-chromosomes.\nProfessor Wilson published many papers on embryology, and served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1913.\nThe American Society for Cell Biology annually awards the E.B. Wilson Medal in his honour.\nSutton and Boveri.\n1902\u20131904: Theodor Boveri (1862\u20131915), a German biologist, in a series of papers, drew attention to the correspondence between the behaviour of chromosomes and the results obtained by Mendel. He said that chromosomes were \"independent entities which retain their independence even in the resting nucleus... What comes out of the nucleus is what goes into it\".\nIn 1903 Walter Sutton suggested that chromosomes, which segregate in a Mendelian fashion, are hereditary units. Wilson, who was Sutton's teacher, called this the \"Sutton\u2013Boveri hypothesis\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geneva%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":36},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":44},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":103},{"uri":"Zoologist","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":112},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale","offset":260},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctorate","offset":288},{"uri":"Johns_Hopkins_University","surface_form":"Johns Hopkins","offset":301},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","offset":384},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":447},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":460},{"uri":"Bryn_Mawr_College","surface_form":"Bryn Mawr College","offset":471},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":546},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":645},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cell biologist","offset":755},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":805},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":825},{"uri":"Mollusc","surface_form":"mollusc","offset":885},{"uri":"Flatworm","surface_form":"flatworm","offset":895},{"uri":"Annelid","surface_form":"annelid","offset":909},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosomal","offset":1077},{"uri":"B_chromosome","surface_form":"B-chromosomes","offset":1343},{"uri":"American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","surface_form":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","offset":1443},{"uri":"American_Society_for_Cell_Biology","surface_form":"American Society for Cell Biology","offset":1508},{"uri":"Theodor_Boveri","surface_form":"Theodor Boveri","offset":1625},{"uri":"Walter_Sutton","surface_form":"Walter Sutton","offset":1982}]}
