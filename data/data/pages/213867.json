Dordrecht is often called \"Dort\" in English.\nToday, the Canons of Dort are part of the Three Forms of Unity, which is one of the confession standards of many of the Reformed churches around the world. The Reformed churches continued use of the Canons as a standard keeps the Reformed churches from being in full harmony with the followers of Jacob Arminius, the Remonstrants and the Dutch Reformed Churches, who disagree with the Canons.\nThe Canons are not supposed to be an absolute explanation of the Reformed doctrine, but only explain the five points of doctrine that were being argued over. These Canons introduced the Five Points of Calvinism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Synod_of_Dort","surface_form":"Synod of Dort","offset":102},{"uri":"Doctrine","surface_form":"Doctrine","offset":143},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":256},{"uri":"Dordrecht","surface_form":"Dordrecht","offset":270},{"uri":"Three_Forms_of_Unity","surface_form":"Three Forms of Unity","offset":383},{"uri":"Reformed_churches","surface_form":"Reformed churches","offset":461},{"uri":"Jacob_Arminius","surface_form":"Jacob Arminius","offset":638}]}
