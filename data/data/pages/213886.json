{"id":213886,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_depravity","text":"Total depravity (also called total inability or total corruption) is a theological teaching that comes from Augustine's teachings on original sin. It is the teaching that, since the Fall of Man, every person who has been born into the world is a slave of sin and, without the irresistible grace of God, it is not possible for man to choose to follow God or accept salvation as He freely offers it.\nTotal depravity is taught by many Protestant confessions of faith, including Lutheranism, and Methodism, Arminianism, and Calvinism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theological","offset":71},{"uri":"Augustine","surface_form":"Augustine","offset":108},{"uri":"Original_sin","surface_form":"original sin","offset":133},{"uri":"Fall_of_Man","surface_form":"Fall of Man","offset":182},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":255},{"uri":"Irresistible_grace","surface_form":"irresistible grace","offset":276},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":298},{"uri":"Salvation","surface_form":"salvation","offset":364},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":432},{"uri":"Lutheranism","surface_form":"Lutheranism","offset":475},{"uri":"Methodism","surface_form":"Methodism","offset":492},{"uri":"Arminianism","surface_form":"Arminianism","offset":503},{"uri":"Calvinism","surface_form":"Calvinism","offset":520}]}
