{"id":213902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordrecht_Confession_of_Faith","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dordrecht Confession of Faith is a statement of faith that was created by Dutch Mennonite leaders at a meeting (also known as a Synod) in Dordrecht, Netherlands, on April 21, 1632. It has 18 articles of faith that talk about the importance of salvation through Jesus Christ, baptism, nonviolence, feet washing, and not taking oaths.\nIt was a very important part of the Radical Reformation and is still a very important document to many Anabaptist groups today, such as the Amish. In 1725, Jacob Gottshalk with sixteen other ministers from Pennsylvania and together they created the Dutch Mennonite Dordrecht Confession of Faith.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":91},{"uri":"Mennonite","surface_form":"Mennonite","offset":97},{"uri":"Dordrecht","surface_form":"Dordrecht","offset":155},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":166},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":278},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptism","offset":292},{"uri":"Nonviolence","surface_form":"nonviolence","offset":301},{"uri":"Reformation","surface_form":"Reformation","offset":394},{"uri":"Anabaptist","surface_form":"Anabaptist","offset":453},{"uri":"Amish","surface_form":"Amish","offset":490}]}
