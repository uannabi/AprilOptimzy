Only very rarely is her name anglicized as Margaret II.\nLife.\nPrincess Margrethe was born at Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, to Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid. She was baptised on 14 May 1940 at the Naval Church in Copenhagen. As King Christian X of Denmark was also the King of Iceland at the time of her birth, the Princess was given an Icelandic name, \"\u00DE\u00F3rhildur\" (spelled with the Icelandic thorn character, simplified as \"th\").\nShe studied archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge in 1960-1961. She was also at the London School of Economics in 1965.\nMargrethe was not born to be monarch, even though she was the eldest child of the Crown Prince, later King. At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark.\nThe act of succession was changed in 1953.\nHer father King Frederik IX died in 1972, and Queen Margrethe II became the first female Danish Sovereign.\nIn 2018, her husband Prince Henrik died of pneumonia in February and her first cousin Princess Elisabeth died in June.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queen_regnant","surface_form":"Queen regnant","offset":84},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":101},{"uri":"Amalienborg_Palace","surface_form":"Amalienborg Palace","offset":203},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":223},{"uri":"Frederik_IX_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Crown Prince Frederik","offset":238},{"uri":"Ingrid_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Crown Princess Ingrid","offset":264},{"uri":"Christian_X_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Christian X of Denmark","offset":362},{"uri":"King_of_Iceland","surface_form":"King of Iceland","offset":398},{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic","offset":466},{"uri":"Thorn_(letter)","surface_form":"thorn","offset":522},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeology","offset":572},{"uri":"Girton_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Girton College, Cambridge","offset":587},{"uri":"London_School_of_Economics","surface_form":"London School of Economics","offset":647},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"Sovereign","offset":1003},{"uri":"Henrik%2C_Prince_Consort_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Prince Henrik","offset":1035},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":1057},{"uri":"Princess_Elisabeth_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Princess Elisabeth","offset":1100}]}
