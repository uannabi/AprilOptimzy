{"id":214106,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._J._Muller","text":"Hermann Joseph Muller, generally known as H. J. Muller, (21 December 1890 \u2013 5 April 1967) was an American geneticist, educator, and Nobel Prize winner. He was best known for his work on the physiological and genetic effects of radiation, as well as his outspoken political beliefs. Muller frequently warned of the long-term dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear explosions.\nMuller's life was as extraordinary as could be imagined. Born in New York City, he got his PhD at CalTech in Morgan's \"Drosophila\" fly lab. He next worked at Rice University, and then spent twelve years at the University of Texas. Then he moved to Berlin in 1932, then to Leningrad (St Petersburg), and then to Moscow. In all these places he organised a genetics lab, and sometimes taught as well. Then arose the scientific charlatan Lysenko, who saw to it that genuine genetics scientists came under the disapproval of Stalin. Once again Muller moved, this time to Edinburgh, with 250 strains of \"Drosophila\", then finally back to the United States in 1940, where he became an advisor to the Manhattan Project. He became Professor of Zoology at Indiana University.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":97},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":106},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":132},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":227},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":263},{"uri":"Nuclear_explosion","surface_form":"nuclear explosion","offset":360},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":445},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"CalTech","offset":478},{"uri":"Thomas_Hunt_Morgan","surface_form":"Morgan","offset":489},{"uri":"Drosophila","surface_form":"Drosophila","offset":499},{"uri":"Rice_University","surface_form":"Rice University","offset":538},{"uri":"Colleges_and_universities_in_Texas","surface_form":"University of Texas","offset":590},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":628},{"uri":"Leningrad","surface_form":"Leningrad","offset":652},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":691},{"uri":"Lysenko","surface_form":"Lysenko","offset":814},{"uri":"Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":900},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":946},{"uri":"Manhattan_Project","surface_form":"Manhattan Project","offset":1073},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"Zoology","offset":1115},{"uri":"Indiana_University","surface_form":"Indiana University","offset":1126}]}
