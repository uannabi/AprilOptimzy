{"id":21415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate","text":"=\"preserve\">In the beginning, a gate was a place between two parts of a wall, or a fence which could be opened and closed to let people go through it.\nIn the Middle Ages, a city gate also allowed people to go into a (walled) city.\nNowadays, people also talk about \"gates\" at airports. When going on an aircraft, people need to get together in a certain area of the airport first. They then pass through some kind of doorway to get onto the plane. That is what is called \"gate\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wall","surface_form":"wall","offset":72},{"uri":"Fence","surface_form":"fence","offset":83},{"uri":"City_gate","surface_form":"city gate","offset":173},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":225},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":275},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":302},{"uri":"Door","surface_form":"door","offset":416}]}
