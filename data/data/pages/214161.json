{"id":214161,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Haiti","text":"Haiti (;) is a country in the Caribbean. It occupies the western three-eighths of Hispaniola; the Dominican Republic occupies the eastern five-eighths (63%) of the island.\nThe country has a total area of, of which 27,560\u00A0km\u00B2 is land and 190\u00A0km\u00B2 is water. Haiti has of coast-line and a border with the Dominican Republic.\nThe limits of the country are the Dominican Republic to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north, and the Caribbean Sea to the south and west. The capital, Port-au-Prince, is a seaport located on the west coast.\nCuba is to the northwest and Jamaica to the southwest of Haiti; the Winward Passage separates Cuba from Haiti (and Hispaniola), and the Jamaica Channel separates Haiti from Jamaica.\nThere are two large peninsulas: the Northwestern on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Southern peninsulas on the Caribbean Sea. The Northwestern, or just Northern, Peninsula () is also known as the Saint-Nicolas Peninsula; it was the first part of the Hispaniola visited by Christopher Columbus on 1492. The historical name of the Southern Peninsula () was Tibur\u00F3n Peninsula.\nBetween those two large peninsulas there is a gulf (a very large bay): the Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve. It is named so after the Gon\u00E2ve Island that is in the middle of the gulf. It was called also Gulf of L\u00E9ogane after the city of L\u00E9ogane, one of the oldest in Haiti.\nClimate.\nHaiti has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"Trade winds\" (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean, full of water vapour), which blow from the Atlantic all year long. In low lands with mountains to the northeast, the climate is arid (dry) because the trade winds leave their water in those mountains rather than the valleys and plains.\nThere are two rainy seasons, in spring and fall to the south, and in spring and winter to the north. From June to November (mainly from August to October), tropical storms and hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the country.\nMountains and valleys.\nThe chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern Peninsula, where they have a direction west-east. The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction.\nRivers and lakes.\nThe river \"Artibonite\" is the longest river of the island and of Haiti. It is 321\u00A0km long (68\u00A0km in the Dominican Republic, 253\u00A0km in Haiti). Its sources are in the Cordillera Central (Dominican Republic) and flows into the Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve. Its watershed has an area of 6,399\u00A0km\u00B2 in Haiti and 2,614\u00A0km\u00B2 in the Dominican Republic.\nAnother important Haitian river is the \"Trois Rivi\u00E8res\" (Three Rivers). It is 150\u00A0km long and its sources are in the Massif du Nord and flows into the Atlantic Ocean, near the city of Po//\nOthers lakes are \"\u00C9tang de Mirago\u00E2ne\" (25\u00A0km\u00B2), of fresh water at 4\u00A0km southeast from the city of Mirago\u00E2ne; and \"Trou Ca\u00EFman\" (16.2\u00A0km\u00B2), a small lake at 6\u00A0km from \u00C9tang Saum\u00E2tre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":15},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":82},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":98},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":164},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":268},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":391},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":428},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":469},{"uri":"Port-au-Prince","surface_form":"Port-au-Prince","offset":478},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":534},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":563},{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"Passage","offset":610},{"uri":"Channel","surface_form":"Channel","offset":678},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":736},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":984},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":1018},{"uri":"Headlands_and_bays","surface_form":"bay","offset":1151},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Gon%C3%A2ve","surface_form":"Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve","offset":1161},{"uri":"Gon%C3%A2ve_Island","surface_form":"Gon\u00E2ve Island","offset":1202},{"uri":"Tropical_climate","surface_form":"tropical climate","offset":1362},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":1395},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"Trade winds","offset":1414},{"uri":"Water_vapour","surface_form":"water vapour","offset":1497},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":1606},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":1705},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":1717},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical storm","offset":1881},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":1901},{"uri":"Northwest","surface_form":"northwest","offset":2028},{"uri":"Southeast","surface_form":"southeast","offset":2038},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":2153},{"uri":"Artibonite_River","surface_form":"Artibonite","offset":2223},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":2456},{"uri":"Port-de-Paix","surface_form":"Po","offset":2725},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":2781},{"uri":"Mirago%C3%A2ne","surface_form":"Mirago\u00E2ne","offset":2828}]}
