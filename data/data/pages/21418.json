{"id":21418,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern","text":"Bern is the capital city of Switzerland. It is also the capital of the canton of Bern.\nAs of early 2006, 127.000 people live in the city.\nHistory.\nBern was started in 1191 by Berchthold V. von Z\u00E4hringen. A legend says that he said he would name the city after the next animal he caught. So when he caught a bear (German: \"B\u00E4r\") the city was named Bern. Z\u00E4hringen built the city in the half-circle the river Aare makes.\nTraffic.\nPublic streetcars and buses are run by an organization called BernMobil. There are 3 streetcar lines and about 15 bus lines. Most of the lines are in the city but some travel away from the city. There is also the Marzilibahn, a funicular (inclined- or cliff-railway) which goes from the banks of the Aare up to the Federal Building (German: \"Bundeshaus\"). The Marzilibahn is 105 meters long. It is the shortest funicular in Europe. Another funicular, called the Gurtenbahn, goes from the section of Bern called Wabern, which is on the river Aare, up to the top of Gurten, a large hill 585 meters high that is just south of Bern. A small airport, Belpmoos, is located a short distance south of Bern in Belp.\nZibelem\u00E4rit (onion market).\nEach year, on the 4th Monday in November, there is the Onion Market in Bern, where onions are sold. Many people visit the market in the early morning and throw confetti. They also hit other people with hammers made out of plastic\nAareleuchten (glowing Aare).\nSince 1996, every August 1 (a national holiday in Switzerland) they hold the Aareleuchten. The Aareleuchten is paid for by SwissAid. During the festival, people put small ships with a light in them into the river Aare. All of these small lights make the Aare \"glow.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Swiss town"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":12},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":20},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":28},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":71},{"uri":"Bern_(canton)","surface_form":"Bern","offset":81},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":99},{"uri":"Berchthold_V._von_Z%C3%A4hringen","surface_form":"Berchthold V. von Z\u00E4hringen","offset":175},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":206},{"uri":"Next","surface_form":"next","offset":264},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"bear","offset":307},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":313},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":390},{"uri":"River_Aare","surface_form":"river Aare","offset":401},{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"Public","offset":428},{"uri":"Streetcar","surface_form":"streetcar","offset":435},{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":450},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":470},{"uri":"Funicular","surface_form":"funicular","offset":656},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":686},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"banks","offset":715},{"uri":"Federal_Building","surface_form":"Federal Building","offset":743},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"meters","offset":807},{"uri":"Gurten","surface_form":"Gurten","offset":992},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":1065},{"uri":"Belp","surface_form":"Belp","offset":1129},{"uri":"Onion_Market","surface_form":"Onion Market","offset":1218},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":1285},{"uri":"Confetti","surface_form":"confetti","offset":1323},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":1365},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":1385},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":1452},{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":1461},{"uri":"SwissAid","surface_form":"SwissAid","offset":1545},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":1566}]}
