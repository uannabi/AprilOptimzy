{"id":214239,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movement","text":"The pro-life movement, also called the anti-abortion movement, are a group of people who share the view that human life begins at conception and that the life of unborn children should be protected. They believe that an unborn child is a living human being from the moment of conception. They oppose abortion. As abortion is an important political topic, they are called anti-choice by the \"pro-choice movement\". The pro-choice movement believes that the mother should have a choice to end the pregnancy. The most important difference between the two movements is on whether or not unborn children are living human beings, and if they are, whether they have equal human rights of fully developed human beings or not.\nPeople who are pro-life believe that all humans, including the unborn, have a right to life. Within the pro-life community some believe that an unborn baby has life as soon as it has been conceived, because they believe that having a human genome is enough for a developing organism to be called a living human being. Others believe that an organism should be identified as a living human being once a heartbeat has been detected, so they believe the law should consider abortion a crime to protect innocent life while in the womb. Many pro-life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should look for alternatives to abortion such as adoption.\nThere are many advocacy groups that want to help women considering abortion as an option, and try to convince more people that abortion is wrong.\nBeing pro-life is most associated with conservative politics. In one poll in the United States, 66% of conservatives called themselves pro-life. It is also associated with the Catholic Church. Pope Francis has said that \"Every child that isn't born, but is unjustly condemned to be aborted, has the face of Jesus Christ, has the face of the Lord.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":169},{"uri":"Conception","surface_form":"conception","offset":276},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":300},{"uri":"Pro-choice","surface_form":"pro-choice","offset":391},{"uri":"Humans","surface_form":"humans","offset":758},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"unborn","offset":780},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":804},{"uri":"Fertilization","surface_form":"conceived","offset":905},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":1199},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adoption","offset":1381},{"uri":"Activism","surface_form":"advocacy","offset":1406},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":1576},{"uri":"Opinion_poll","surface_form":"poll","offset":1606},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1618},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":1713},{"uri":"Pope_Francis","surface_form":"Pope Francis","offset":1730},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":1844},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"Lord","offset":1878}]}
