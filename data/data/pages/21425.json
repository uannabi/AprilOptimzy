{"id":21425,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are different definitions of price. Perhaps the simplest definition is to say \"price is the value of a product (good) or service\". A price is expressed in other goods, services, or in money.\nHere is an example about price: Peter raises sheep for their wool. Sally raises chickens for their eggs. Winter is coming, so Sally wants to make a warm wool coat.\nShe first measures how much wool she needs for a coat. She thinks she needs the wool from 2 sheep for the coat. She then goes to Peter and asks him what he wants for the wool she needs. Peter then tells her the price he is asking for his wool. Sally might trade some of her chicken eggs for the wool.\nSometimes trading eggs for wool is difficult. So people invented something they called \"money\". This is cash or currency used for trading.\nIf Peter does not need eggs, he will not trade his wool for eggs. The price for his wool \"in eggs\" is zero, but Peter does need something else. So Sally goes to a market and sells some of her eggs for money. Then she goes to Peter and gives him money for the wool. How much money Peter wants for his wool is the price.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Value","surface_form":"value","offset":111},{"uri":"Product_(business)","surface_form":"product","offset":122},{"uri":"Good_(economics)","surface_form":"good","offset":131},{"uri":"Service_(economics)","surface_form":"service","offset":140},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":203},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":255},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":271},{"uri":"Chickens","surface_form":"chickens","offset":290},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":309},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":630}]}
