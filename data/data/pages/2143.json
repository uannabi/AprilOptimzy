{"id":2143,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year","text":"e=\"preserve\">A light year (symbol: ly) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year. Since the speed of light is about 300,000 km per second (about 186,000 miles per second), then a light year is about 10 trillion kilometers (about 6 trillion miles). A light year is not a length of time.\nThe light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge. Space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds, thousands or millions of light years away.\nExample.\nThink of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on Earth. Light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us. When we see the star's light, we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":112},{"uri":"Trillion","surface_form":"trillion","offset":222},{"uri":"Kilometer","surface_form":"kilometer","offset":231},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":260},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":332},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":354},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":394},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":404},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":566}]}
