It fires 9x19mm cartridges and it can hold 15 of them. It is the standard side-arm of many police and military units and the United States Army. In the US Army, the pistol got the name M9.\nAfter the US military ended its ban on foreign-made weapons, its allies in NATO pressured the US to adopt a 9mm handgun to replace the M1911 because NATO has a rule that all NATO countries must use weapons with the same kinds of ammunition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pistol","surface_form":"pistol","offset":18},{"uri":"Beretta","surface_form":"Beretta","offset":86},{"uri":"9x19mm_Parabellum","surface_form":"9x19mm","offset":104},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"cartridge","offset":111},{"uri":"Side-arm","surface_form":"side-arm","offset":169},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapons","offset":336},{"uri":"Alliance","surface_form":"allies","offset":349},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":359},{"uri":"Pistol","surface_form":"handgun","offset":396},{"uri":"M1911_pistol","surface_form":"M1911","offset":419},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":463},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":513}]}
