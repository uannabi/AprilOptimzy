{"id":21437,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip","text":"The Gaza Strip is a self-governing stretch of land along the Mediterranean. The main city in the Gaza Strip is called Gaza. The strip is currently governed by Hamas, a group declared as terrorists by many western nations for its launching of rockets into Israel.\nThe territory is 41 kilometers (25 mi) long, and from 6 to 12 kilometers (3.7 to 7.5 mi) wide, with a total area of 365 square kilometers (141 sq mi). About 1.8 million Palestinians live on a surface of roughly 360\u00A0km\u00B2, making Gaza the 3rd most densely populated area on Earth.\nHistory.\nGaza was formed in 1967 when Israel moved Jewish settlements and troops into Gaza. Israel controlled the Strip's borders, coastline and airspace until 2005, when it withdrew. An election was held in January 2006, which Hamas won. Since then, Israel has conducted several wars with Hamas due to alleged terrorist acts, causing much of the infrastructure of Gaza to be non functional. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott since 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":61},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":85},{"uri":"Gaza","surface_form":"Gaza","offset":118},{"uri":"Hamas","surface_form":"Hamas","offset":159},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":186},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":579},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":728},{"uri":"Hamas","surface_form":"Hamas","offset":769}]}
