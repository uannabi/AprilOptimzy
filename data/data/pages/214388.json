{"id":214388,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_squid","text":"The colossal squid, \"Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni\", is the biggest squid in the world, 9\u201310 metres (30\u201333 feet) long.\nThe colossal squid is bigger than a giant squid. Its body is reddish brown and it lives up to 2000m below the surface of the Southern Ocean. It is the main food eaten by sperm whales. The colossal squid has ammonium chloride in its body, so it tastes bad for humans.\nIt is believed to feed on prey such as chaetognatha, large fish like the Patagonian toothfish and other squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence.\nThe colossal squid is thought to have a slow metabolic rate, requiring only around 30\u00A0g of prey daily. Estimates of its energetic demands suggest that it is a slow-moving ambush predator, using its large eyes primarily for predator detection rather than active hunting.\nThe eye is 27\u00A0cm (10.63\u00A0in) wide, with a lens 12\u00A0cm across. This is the largest eye of any known animal. These measurements are of the partly collapsed specimen: when living the eye was probably 30 to 40\u00A0cm (12 to 16 in) across.\nThe Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is displaying this specimen in an exhibition which opened in 2008. A website on the squid specimen is also available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":65},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":90},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"feet","offset":104},{"uri":"Giant_squid","surface_form":"giant squid","offset":152},{"uri":"Southern_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Ocean","offset":241},{"uri":"Sperm_Whale","surface_form":"sperm whales","offset":286},{"uri":"Ammonium_chloride","surface_form":"ammonium chloride","offset":323},{"uri":"Chaetognatha","surface_form":"chaetognatha","offset":422},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":442},{"uri":"Patagonian_toothfish","surface_form":"Patagonian toothfish","offset":456},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":487},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":505},{"uri":"Bioluminescence","surface_form":"bioluminescence","offset":517},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolic rate","offset":579},{"uri":"Ambush_predator","surface_form":"ambush predator","offset":705},{"uri":"Museum_of_New_Zealand_Te_Papa_Tongarewa","surface_form":"Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa","offset":1037}]}
