Along with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Lloyd is remembered as one of the most popular and influential comedians of the silent movie years.\nHarold Lloyd made nearly 200 movies. Many were without sound but later movies had sound.\nHis movies usually had \"thrill\" sections where Lloyd would be in fast chases and performed his own stunts. Lloyd did these dangerous stunts himself even though a movie accident had caused the loss of his right thumb and index finger.\nAlthough Lloyd's movies were not as commercially successful as Chaplin's, Lloyd made a lot more money than Chaplin during their movie years. ($15.7 million to Chaplin's $10.5 million).\nLloyd died of prostate cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":66},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":75},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":85},{"uri":"Charlie_Chaplin","surface_form":"Charlie Chaplin","offset":106},{"uri":"Buster_Keaton","surface_form":"Buster Keaton","offset":126},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"$","offset":706},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":712},{"uri":"Prostate_cancer","surface_form":"prostate cancer","offset":763}]}
