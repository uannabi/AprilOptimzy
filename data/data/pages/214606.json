{"id":214606,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Embankment","text":"The Thames Embankment is a major feat of 19th century civil engineering. It reclaimed marshy land next to the River Thames in central London.\nOverview.\nThe Embankment now runs on the northern side of the river from Parliament in Westminster to the City of London. It is a continuous four-lane road (mostly a double carriageway). It connects with all the bridges along the route from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars Bridge.\nIt was built in two parts, the Victoria and the Chelsea Embankment, but it is now unified. Londoners regard it as a single road, the Embankment. There is a much smaller road on the south side of the river, called the Albert Embankment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civil_engineering","surface_form":"civil engineering","offset":54},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marsh","offset":86},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":110},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":134},{"uri":"Palace_of_Westminster","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":215},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":229},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":248},{"uri":"Westminster_Bridge","surface_form":"Westminster Bridge","offset":383},{"uri":"Blackfriars_Bridge","surface_form":"Blackfriars Bridge","offset":405},{"uri":"Victoria_Embankment","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":456},{"uri":"Chelsea_Embankment","surface_form":"Chelsea Embankment","offset":473},{"uri":"Albert_Embankment","surface_form":"Albert Embankment","offset":642}]}
