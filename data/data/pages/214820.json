{"id":214820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didcot","text":"Didcot is a town in Oxfordshire about south of Oxford. Until 1974 it was part of Berkshire.\nHistory and economy.\nDuring the Roman Empire the Romans dug a ditch that runs north through what is now known as the Ladygrove area north of the town near Long Wittenham.\nDidcot first appears in historical records in the 13th century as Dudcotte, Berkshire. Parts of the original village still exist in the Lydalls Road area and part of All Saints' Church dates back to the 11th century.\nRailways.\nThe Great Western Railway, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, reached Didcot in 1839. In 1844 the Didcot railway station was opened. The original station burnt down in the later part of 19th century.\nDidcot is junction of the routes to London, Bristol and Oxford. It was formerly a junction for Southampton via the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway but that closed in the 1960s.\nThe traffic to Southampton meant that the town had strategic importance to military logistics, in particular during the First World War campaign on the Western Front and the Second World War preparations for D-Day.\nPower stations.\nThe Didcot Power Stations (which are next to each other, and actually in \"Sutton Courtenay\") supply electricity to the National Grid. The power station has also proved a popular man-made object for local photographers. One power station was closed in 2013 and has been demolished. The other is still operating in 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":12},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":20},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":47},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":81},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":124},{"uri":"Ditch","surface_form":"ditch","offset":154},{"uri":"Long_Wittenham","surface_form":"Long Wittenham","offset":247},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":313},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":339},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":466},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":494},{"uri":"Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel","surface_form":"Isambard Kingdom Brunel","offset":529},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":597},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":678},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":728},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":736},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":748},{"uri":"Southampton","surface_form":"Southampton","offset":787},{"uri":"Didcot%2C_Newbury_and_Southampton_Railway","surface_form":"Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway","offset":807},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"First World War","offset":997},{"uri":"Western_Front","surface_form":"Western Front","offset":1029},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":1051},{"uri":"D-Day","surface_form":"D-Day","offset":1085},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":1208},{"uri":"Electric_power_transmission","surface_form":"National Grid","offset":1227}]}
