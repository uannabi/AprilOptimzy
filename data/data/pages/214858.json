The three main people running were: George H. W. Bush, a Republican from Texas and the President; Bill Clinton, who was a Democrat and Governor of Arkansas; and Ross Perot an Independent candidate.\nBill Clinton was the winner of the election. Clinton got 370 Electoral votes, Bush got 168, and Perot got 0. A person running for president will need to get 270 to win.\nGeorge H.W. Bush may have lost the election for several reasons. He broke his promise of \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" by increasing taxes during his term. Some of his most well-known accomplishments during his presidency came from his foreign policy, and because of the Cold War and Gulf War being over, foreign policy became a smaller issue, as the economy became a bigger issues, since the economy was bad.\nPrior to 2020, this was the last election where a candidate won the presidency without winning Florida.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":79},{"uri":"George_H._W._Bush","surface_form":"George H.
