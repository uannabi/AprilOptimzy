{"id":214996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)","text":"=\"preserve\">Winger, in hockey, is a forward position of a player who is on either side of the centre forward, often along the playing area. They usually work by going beside the centre. At first, the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Now, there are different types of wingers in the game: they either are mainly goal scorers, or help stop the other team from scoring.\nThis position is commonly referred to by the side of the rink that the winger normally takes. Players to the left of the centre are called \"left wingers,\" and players on the right are called \"right wingers.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"hockey","offset":23},{"uri":"Forward_(hockey)","surface_form":"forward","offset":36},{"uri":"Centre_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"centre","offset":94}]}
