{"id":21500,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character","text":"e=\"preserve\">A fictional character is a person or animal in a narrative work of art (such as a novel, play, television series, or movie) The character can be completely fictional or based on a real-life person. In that case, the difference between a \"fictional\" and \"real\" character can be made. Coming from the ancient Greek word \u03C7\u03B1\u03C1\u03B1\u03BA\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1, the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in \"Tom Jones\" in 1749. From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed. Character, mainly when played by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person.\" In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.\nThe word character can also mean \"personality\". We can say that someone has a \"strong character\" meaning a strong, confident personality. It is sometimes used as a noun in this sense: \"He is a real character\" (meaning someone you cannot easily forget).\nA character role in a play means one of the people in the play who have a particular character (personality). They contrast with the main characters of the play. For example, there may be two lovers who are the main characters of the story. The character roles might be: a wicked step-mother, a kind nurse, an old wise man, a stupid fool, a domestic worker who is very old etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":40},{"uri":"Narrative","surface_form":"narrative","offset":62},{"uri":"Work_of_art","surface_form":"work of art","offset":72},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":95},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":102},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":108},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":130},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":312},{"uri":"English_Restoration","surface_form":"Restoration","offset":373},{"uri":"The_History_of_Tom_Jones%2C_a_Foundling","surface_form":"Tom Jones","offset":442},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":507},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":574},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"cinema","offset":585},{"uri":"Impersonation","surface_form":"impersonation","offset":857},{"uri":"Characterisation","surface_form":"characterisation","offset":991},{"uri":"Step-mother","surface_form":"step-mother","offset":1542},{"uri":"Nurse","surface_form":"nurse","offset":1562},{"uri":"Wise","surface_form":"wise","offset":1576},{"uri":"Fool","surface_form":"fool","offset":1595},{"uri":"Domestic_worker","surface_form":"domestic worker","offset":1603}]}
