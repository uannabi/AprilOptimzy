{"id":215017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Nordiques","text":"The Quebec Nordiques (, pronounced in Quebec French, in Canadian English, meaning \"Northmen\" or \"Northerners\") were a professional ice hockey team from Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The Nordiques played in the World Hockey Association (1972\u20131979) and the National Hockey League (1979\u20131995). The team moved to Denver, Colorado in 1995 and changed their name to the Colorado Avalanche.\nAs the value of the Canadian dollar was failing, the Quebec Nordiques were compelled to sell their team. With the salaries of players rising and the arena in need of repairs, the ownership of the Nordiques was sold to a group of investors in Denver, Colorado. To make matters worse, during their first season in Colorado, the former Nordiques, now Colorado Avalanche, won the Stanley Cup.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quebec_French","surface_form":"Quebec French","offset":38},{"uri":"Canadian_English","surface_form":"Canadian English","offset":56},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":131},{"uri":"Quebec_City","surface_form":"Quebec City","offset":152},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":165},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":173},{"uri":"World_Hockey_Association","surface_form":"World Hockey Association","offset":209},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":254},{"uri":"Denver%2C_Colorado","surface_form":"Denver, Colorado","offset":308},{"uri":"1995%E2%80%9396_NHL_season","surface_form":"1995","offset":328},{"uri":"Colorado_Avalanche","surface_form":"Colorado Avalanche","offset":363}]}
