{"id":215074,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar","text":"e=\"preserve\">The assassination (murder) of Julius Caesar was the result of a conspiracy by forty Roman senators, the self-styled \"Liberatores\". They were led by Cassius and Brutus.\nThe senators stabbed Caesar to death in the \"Theatre of Pompey\" on the Ides of March, 15 March 44 BC. Caesar was the dictator of the Roman Republic at the time. He had been declared \"dictator perpetuo\" (dictator for life) by the Senate. This declaration resulted in many senators fearing that Caesar wanted to overthrow the Senate in favour of a tyranny.\nThe assassination led to civil war. The Second Triumvirate led to the ascendancy of Caesar's adopted heir Octavian to the position of emperor, and the end of the Republic leading to the Roman Empire. In the end, by murdering Caesar, the Liberators caused the end of the Republic they supported.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassination","offset":17},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":43},{"uri":"Conspiracy","surface_form":"conspiracy","offset":77},{"uri":"Senator","surface_form":"senator","offset":103},{"uri":"Gaius_Cassius_Longinus","surface_form":"Cassius","offset":161},{"uri":"Marcus_Junius_Brutus","surface_form":"Brutus","offset":173},{"uri":"Ides_of_March","surface_form":"Ides of March","offset":252},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":279},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":298},{"uri":"Roman_Republic","surface_form":"Roman Republic","offset":314},{"uri":"Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":410},{"uri":"Tyranny","surface_form":"tyranny","offset":527},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"civil war","offset":561},{"uri":"Second_Triumvirate","surface_form":"Second Triumvirate","offset":576},{"uri":"Augustus","surface_form":"Octavian","offset":642},{"uri":"Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":670},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":722}]}
