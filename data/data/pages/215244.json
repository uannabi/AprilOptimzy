He investigated number theory and mathematical analysis.\nHardy's classic text \"A course of pure mathematics\" was first published in 1908 and has been in print ever since. He wrote \"A Mathematician's Apology\" in 1940.\nIn 1908, unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become ubiquitous in a population, Reginald Punnett introduced his problem to Hardy, with whom he played cricket. Hardy went on to formulate what became known as the Hardy\u2013Weinberg law.\nHardy discovered the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was a brilliant student. Hardy saw his extraordinary intelligence and they worked together on many mathematical subjects. In an interview given to Paul Erd\u0151s, Hardy said that the discovery of Ramanujan was his (Hardy's) greatest contribution to mathematics and that their collaboration was \"the one romantic incident in my life\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":18},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":50},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":75},{"uri":"Cambridgeshire","surface_form":"Cambridgeshire","offset":86},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":115},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":123},{"uri":"Mathematical_analysis","surface_form":"mathematical analysis","offset":172},{"uri":"A_Mathematician%27s_Apology","surface_form":"A Mathematician's Apology","offset":319},{"uri":"Allele","surface_form":"dominant","offset":388},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":397},{"uri":"Reginald_Punnett","surface_form":"Reginald Punnett","offset":447},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":517},{"uri":"Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_law","surface_form":"Hardy\u2013Weinberg law","offset":578},{"uri":"Srinivasa_Ramanujan","surface_form":"Srinivasa Ramanujan","offset":640},{"uri":"Paul_Erd%C5%91s","surface_form":"Paul Erd\u0151s","offset":812}]}
