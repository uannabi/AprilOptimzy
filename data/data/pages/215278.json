{"id":215278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcrossing","text":"=\"preserve\">Outcrossing is a term used in genetics for the mating of unrelated individuals in a population or species. It was originally used for the crossing of an inbred strain with the wild type. Hybrid vigour is the great improvement in fitness which usually occurs as a result of outcrossing a previously inbred line.\nOutcrossing leads to random mating, whereas mating of relatives leads to inbreeding.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":42},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":96},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":110},{"uri":"Inbred_strain","surface_form":"inbred strain","offset":165},{"uri":"Wild_type","surface_form":"wild type","offset":188},{"uri":"Hybrid_vigour","surface_form":"Hybrid vigour","offset":199},{"uri":"Fitness","surface_form":"fitness","offset":241},{"uri":"Random_mating","surface_form":"random mating","offset":344},{"uri":"Inbreeding","surface_form":"inbreeding","offset":396}]}
