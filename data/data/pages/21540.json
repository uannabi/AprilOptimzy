{"id":21540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy","text":"e=\"preserve\">The United States Navy is part of the United States Armed Forces (the military of the USA). It is the largest navy in the world.\nHistory.\nThe navy was called the Continental Navy from 1775 until Congress disbanded it and sold the ships in 1785. It was started again as the Department of the Navy on April 30, 1798. The Department of the Navy needed places to make ships, which are called shipyards. So it paid slaveowners to borrow their slaves, then forced the slaves to build and run the shipyards in Washington, D.C., Norfolk, Virginia, and Pensacola, Florida.\nSailors.\nToday, the US Navy has over 300,000 sailors and officers, and almost another 100,000 workers who are not official sailors.\nStrength.\nThe US Navy has about 300 warships, or ships designed for fighting. The largest warships are aircraft carriers, which have large and flat decks that act as small airports for planes carrying weapons. The US Navy has more of these aircraft carriers than any other navy in the world, and a large number of planes in Naval Aviation. Aircraft carriers are often protected by smaller ships, called cruisers or destroyers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States Armed Forces","offset":51},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":83},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":99},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"navy","offset":123},{"uri":"1775","surface_form":"1775","offset":197},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":208},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_the_Navy","surface_form":"Department of the Navy","offset":286},{"uri":"April_30","surface_form":"April 30","offset":312},{"uri":"1798","surface_form":"1798","offset":322},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slaveowners","offset":423},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":516},{"uri":"Norfolk%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Norfolk, Virginia","offset":534},{"uri":"Pensacola%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Pensacola, Florida","offset":557},{"uri":"Sailor","surface_form":"sailors","offset":622},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officers","offset":634},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warships","offset":745},{"uri":"Aircraft_carrier","surface_form":"aircraft carriers","offset":812},{"uri":"Naval_Aviation","surface_form":"Naval Aviation","offset":1033},{"uri":"Destroyer","surface_form":"destroyers","offset":1124}]}
