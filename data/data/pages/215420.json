{"id":215420,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council","text":"The President of the European Council is a position that was created by the Treaty of Lisbon. The President is the chairman of the European Council, which is the meeting of the leaders of all the member states.\nBackground.\nIt's a very diplomatic figure, and it's not like a head of state: the President does not have any power to make decisions about the European Union. The Union has several other presidents, such as the president of the European Parliament and the president of the European Commission.\nBut the President of the European Council, casually but wrongly known as The President of Europe, is the face by which the European Union is known to the rest of the world. The more practical aspects of this task are the responsibility of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Commissioner responsible for external affairs.\nOn 2 July 2019, the European Council elected Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel as the successor to Donald Tusk as President of the European Council for the period from 1 December 2019 to 31 May 2022.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Treaty_of_Lisbon","surface_form":"Treaty of Lisbon","offset":76},{"uri":"European_Council","surface_form":"European Council","offset":131},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":440},{"uri":"European_Commission","surface_form":"European Commission","offset":485},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":629},{"uri":"High_Representative_for_Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy","surface_form":"High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy","offset":749},{"uri":"Charles_Michel","surface_form":"Charles Michel","offset":928}]}
