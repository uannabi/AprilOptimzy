{"id":21562,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh","text":"Arunachal Pradesh or South Tibet is a state between India and China. The country that owns this region is disputed. China says that they own it and call it South Tibet (Zangnan \u85CF\u5357). In 2017, China started renaming places in this territory. In 2019 China destroyed 30,000 \"incorrect\" world maps that showed South Tibet as part of India.\nHistory.\nThe territory's northern boundary is about 550 miles long. It is known as the McMahon Line.\nIt is part of the border dispute between India and China. There is another dispute to the northwest in Aksai Chin (also with Pakistan).\nIn 1962, the Sino-Indian War was fought here. The war was short and ended in India's defeat. However, China withdrew back to the modern borders voluntarily. They still say that they own the region.\nWho lives there?\nMost of the population look East Asian. The people look like their neighbors in Tibet and the Myanmar hill region.\nAs of 2001, there were 1,091,117 people living in South Tibet. The total area is 32,333 mi\u00B2 (83,743 km\u00B2).\nMost people speak Han\u2013Tibetan languages like Nyishi and Adi (over 50%). The rest speak Indo-Aryan languages like Nepali, Bengali, and Hindi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":52},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":62},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"China","offset":116},{"uri":"South_Tibet","surface_form":"South Tibet","offset":156},{"uri":"McMahon_Line","surface_form":"McMahon Line","offset":423},{"uri":"Sino%E2%80%93Indian_border_dispute","surface_form":"border dispute between India and China","offset":455},{"uri":"Aksai_Chin","surface_form":"Aksai Chin","offset":540},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":562},{"uri":"Sino-Indian_War","surface_form":"Sino-Indian War","offset":586},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asian","offset":816},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":868},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":882},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"mi\u00B2","offset":991},{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":1003},{"uri":"Han%E2%80%93Tibetan_languages","surface_form":"Han\u2013Tibetan languages","offset":1027},{"uri":"Nyishi","surface_form":"Nyishi","offset":1054},{"uri":"Adi","surface_form":"Adi","offset":1065},{"uri":"Indo-Aryan_languages","surface_form":"Indo-Aryan languages","offset":1096}]}
