{"id":21590,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language","text":"Punjabi is an Indo-Aryan language. It is the first language of about 130 million people, and is the 10th most spoken language in the world. Most of the people who speak this language live in the Punjab region of Pakistan and India. It is also widely spoken in Haryana, India Himachal Pradesh, India and Delhi, India, uttarpradesh rajasthan, Bihar, Jammu amd Kashmir and other states as well. It is spoken by the majority of the population of Pakistan.\nPunjabi developed from the ancient language of Prakrit developed simultaneously with Sanskrit. Punjabi is known to have been spoken by the Indus Valley civilization according to DR Jaspal Singh Mayell. \"Possibly, Punjabi is the only major South Asian language that has this kind of tonal character. There does seem to have been some speculation among scholars about the possible origin of Punjabi's tone-language character but without any final and convincing answer...\"\nPunjabi is written in two different scripts, called Gurmukh\u012B and Shahmukh\u012B. Punjabi is the main language spoken by the Sikhs. Most parts of the Guru Granth Sahib use the Punjabi language written in Gurmukh\u012B, though Punjabi is not the only language used in Sikh scriptures. The \"Janamsakhis\", stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak (1469\u20131539), are early examples of Punjabi literature.\nDialects.\nPunjabi has many dialects. The dialects are similar enough to each other that speakers can understand most of the dialects that are related to theirs. In India, the main dialects of Punjabi are: Majhi, Doabi, Malwi and Pwadhi. In Pakistan, the main dialects are Majhi, \"Shahpuri\", \"Jhangvi\", \"Dhanni\", Pothohari and Hindko.\nMajhi is Punjabi's standard dialect because it forms the standard for writing in Punjabi. It is spoken in the centre of Punjab, including the districts of Lahore, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Okara, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujrat, Pakpattan, Hafizabad and Mandi Bahauddin. In India it is spoken in Amritsar, Tarn Taran Sahib and Gurdaspur districts.\nOther dialects of Punjabi include Pahari, Rachnavi, Chenavari, Chhachi, Jandali, Ghebi. The Saraiki, spoken in southern Punjab, and Dogri, spoken in Kashmir, are closely related to Punjabi. The relation of several dialects to languages other than Punjabi creates problems in assigning them to one or another \"language\".\nDistribution.\nOver 93% of people who speak Punjabi as their first language live in Pakistan and India. It is the most widely spoken native language in Pakistan. It is spoken as a first language by over 44% of Pakistanis. There were 76 million Punjabi speakers in Pakistan in 2008. In India, Punjabi is spoken as a native language by 3% of the population. This was about 33 million in 2011. It is the official language of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana.\nPunjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several other countries where large numbers of Punjabis have emigrated.In the United Kingdom, it is the second-most-commonly used language. In Canada, it is the fourth-most-spoken language. There were 2.2 million Punjabi speakers in the US in 2017. and 1.3 million in the UK in 2000.\nWriting system.\nThere are three ways to write Punjabi: Gurmukh\u012B, Shahmukh\u012B, and Devan\u0101gar\u012B. In the Punjab province of Pakistan, the script that is most used is Shahmukh\u012B. The Majhi dialect is the written standard for Punjabi in both parts of Punjab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indo-Aryan_languages","surface_form":"Indo-Aryan","offset":14},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":25},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":45},{"uri":"Punjab_region","surface_form":"Punjab region","offset":195},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":212},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":225},{"uri":"Haryana","surface_form":"Haryana","offset":260},{"uri":"Himachal_Pradesh","surface_form":"Himachal Pradesh","offset":275},{"uri":"Delhi","surface_form":"Delhi","offset":303},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"script","offset":959},{"uri":"Sikhs","surface_form":"Sikhs","offset":1042},{"uri":"Guru_Granth_Sahib","surface_form":"Guru Granth Sahib","offset":1067},{"uri":"Scriptures","surface_form":"scriptures","offset":1184},{"uri":"Janamsakhis","surface_form":"Janamsakhis","offset":1201},{"uri":"Guru_Nanak","surface_form":"Guru Nanak","offset":1249},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1342},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":1706},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":1804},{"uri":"Sheikhupura_District","surface_form":"Sheikhupura","offset":1812},{"uri":"Kasur","surface_form":"Kasur","offset":1825},{"uri":"Okara_Tehsil","surface_form":"Okara","offset":1832},{"uri":"Nankana_Sahib","surface_form":"Nankana Sahib","offset":1839},{"uri":"Faisalabad","surface_form":"Faisalabad","offset":1854},{"uri":"Gujranwala","surface_form":"Gujranwala","offset":1866},{"uri":"Sialkot_District","surface_form":"Sialkot","offset":1878},{"uri":"Narowal_Tehsil","surface_form":"Narowal","offset":1887},{"uri":"Gujrat_Tehsil","surface_form":"Gujrat","offset":1896},{"uri":"Pakpattan","surface_form":"Pakpattan","offset":1904},{"uri":"Hafizabad_District","surface_form":"Hafizabad","offset":1915},{"uri":"Mandi_Bahauddin","surface_form":"Mandi Bahauddin","offset":1929},{"uri":"Amritsar","surface_form":"Amritsar","offset":1971},{"uri":"Tarn_Taran_Sahib","surface_form":"Tarn Taran Sahib","offset":1981},{"uri":"Gurdaspur_district","surface_form":"Gurdaspur","offset":2002},{"uri":"Saraiki_language","surface_form":"Saraiki","offset":2115},{"uri":"Dogri_language","surface_form":"Dogri","offset":2155},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":2172},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":2403},{"uri":"Punjab_(India)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":2785},{"uri":"Haryana","surface_form":"Haryana","offset":2796},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":2833},{"uri":"Punjabis","surface_form":"Punjabis","offset":2901},{"uri":"Gurmukh%C4%AB","surface_form":"Gurmukh\u012B","offset":3193},{"uri":"Shahmukh%C4%AB","surface_form":"Shahmukh\u012B","offset":3203},{"uri":"Devanagari","surface_form":"Devan\u0101gar\u012B","offset":3218},{"uri":"Punjab_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"province of Pakistan","offset":3244}]}
