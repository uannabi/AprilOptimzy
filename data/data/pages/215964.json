{"id":215964,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography","text":"Typography is the practical art of arranging how the printed word appears on the page. Typography was born when print was born. Early types were based on the letterforms of scribes, and the letters cut into Trajan's Column (\"monumental inscriptions\"). Later, gradually, type designs were based on the special needs of books, pamphlets, newspapers and advertisements.\nTypography includes not only letters, but all the set of symbols in a font, and it includes the overall design of a page or document. It applies to any medium which may be read; therefore it includes text on computer screens. A typographer may design type, select fonts, and design the layout of pages and books. The term does not cover the act of printing itself, though many of the early printers were themselves typographers.\nA traditional aim of the typographer would be to produce a page which is, above all, \"legible\" and \"attractive\" to read, without its being obtrusive. For display typography, such as advertising, the display must be \"noticed\" before it is read. This had led to the development of many display typefaces which are highly visible, and which are available in large sizes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":28},{"uri":"Print","surface_form":"print","offset":53},{"uri":"Page","surface_form":"page","offset":81},{"uri":"Scribe","surface_form":"scribe","offset":173},{"uri":"Trajan%27s_Column","surface_form":"Trajan's Column","offset":207},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":437},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":471},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":491},{"uri":"Type","surface_form":"type","offset":618},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":631},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":642},{"uri":"Page_layout","surface_form":"layout","offset":653},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":673},{"uri":"Printing","surface_form":"printing","offset":715},{"uri":"Legibility","surface_form":"legible","offset":882}]}
