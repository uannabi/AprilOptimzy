{"id":215998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_name","text":"e=\"preserve\">Korean names today have different rules than they had in the past. This article mainly covers South Korea's. The North Korean one could be different\nNumber of parts of a name.\nKorean names have two parts. One is the family name and the other is the given name.\n\"Park Chan-Ho\" is a name of a Korean person. Park is the family name, and Chan-Ho is the given name. In the Korean language, the family name comes first, and the given name comes second. (It is like writing Smith John, instead of John Smith.) Most Koreans feel uneasy when they are called in the reverse way or by only family name.\nMarriage and children.\nMarried men and women usually keep their full personal names, and children take the father's family name. So, a son of Ha Hi-Ra (female) and Choi Su-Jong (male) will be Choi something.\nNicknames.\nAlthough Koreans have nicknames, these usually come from their personal characteristics like appearance, a physical defect, or a word with a similar pronunciation to their names. They are different from the nicknames in the Western sense such as Bob, Bill, Liz and Kate. Unfavorable nicknames are more common than favorable ones. It is very rare for an adult to be called by a nickname.\nFor the very first time or in a formal situation.\nKoreans call someone with Si (\u6C0F means Mr., Mrs. or Miss, the most universal), Yang (\u5B43 means Miss, used when the person is younger than the speaker), Goon (it means Mr., used when the person is younger than the speaker) after the family name, the given name or the full name.\nSpeaking to a younger person.\nKoreans call someone by only the given name itself or with the vocative postpositional word (Ya - In case the last syllable is open, or A - In case the last syllable is closed)\nSpeaking to an older person.\nMale Koreans often call older males \uD615 (Hyeong) and older females \uB204\uB098 (Nu-na). Female Koreans call older males \uC624\uBE60 (O-ppa) and older females \uC5B8\uB2C8 (Eon-ni) after the given name.\nSpeaking to a younger person.\nKoreans call someone by only the given name itself or with the vocative postpositional word (Ya - In case the last syllable is open, or A - In case the last syllable is closed).\nSpeaking to an older person.\nKoreans call someone using the word that indicates their blood relation instead of their name.\nExamples: \uC544\uBC84\uC9C0 (A-beo-ji, means father), \uC544\uBE60 (A-ppa, means dad in a casual way), \uC5B4\uBA38\uB2C8 (Eo-meo-ni, means mother), \uC5C4\uB9C8 (eom-ma, means mom), \uD615 (hyeong, means male's elder brother), \uB204\uB098 (Nu-na, male's elder sister), \uC624\uBE60 (O-ppa, means female's elder brother), \uC5B8\uB2C8 (Eon-ni, female's elder sister), \uB0A8\uB3D9\uC0DD (Nam-Dong-Saeng, means the younger brother of a person regardless of the person's gender), \uC5EC\uB3D9\uC0DD (Yeo-Dong-Saeng, means the younger sister of a person regardless of the person's gender)\nAt work.\nKoreans may speak to someone using the job title instead of their name.\nFor example, \uC0AC\uC7A5 (Sa-Jang, means the president of a company) and \uACFC\uC7A5 (Gua-Jang, the head of a department).\nSpeaking to a person in a lower rank.\nKoreans call someone with the job title after his family name, for example \uBC15\uACFC\uC7A5 (Park Gua-Jang).\nSpeaking to a higher-ranking person.\nKoreans add \uB2D8 (Nim, the suffix showing respect) after the job title or by the combination like the family name + the job title + Nim.\nFor example, \uC0AC\uC7A5\uB2D8 (Sa-Jang Nim), \uACFC\uC7A5\uB2D8 (Gua-Jang Nim) or \uBC15\uACFC\uC7A5\uB2D8 (Park Gua-Jang Nim)\nLengths, pronunciations, etc..\nThe family name is typically a single syllable, and the given name two syllables. There is no middle name in the Western sense. Each syllable in Korean name (including family names) usually has its Chinese character. But its pronunciation is considerably different from the one in China. In case of the given name, Koreans place great importance on the meaning of each Chinese character. Often naming centers take charge of naming a new baby.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rules","offset":47},{"uri":"Past","surface_form":"past","offset":74},{"uri":"Article","surface_form":"article","offset":85},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":107},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":126},{"uri":"Part","surface_form":"parts","offset":211},{"uri":"Family_name","surface_form":"family name","offset":229},{"uri":"Given_name","surface_form":"given name","offset":262},{"uri":"Park_Chan-Ho","surface_form":"Park Chan-Ho","offset":275},{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":294},{"uri":"Korean_people","surface_form":"Korean","offset":304},{"uri":"Family_name","surface_form":"family name","offset":331},{"uri":"Given_name","surface_form":"given name","offset":363},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean language","offset":382},{"uri":"Korean_people","surface_form":"Koreans","offset":522},{"uri":"Personal_name","surface_form":"personal name","offset":675},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":758},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":784},{"uri":"Nicknames","surface_form":"nicknames","offset":847},{"uri":"Personal_characteristic","surface_form":"personal characteristics","offset":888},{"uri":"Appearance","surface_form":"appearance","offset":918},{"uri":"Physical_defect","surface_form":"physical defect","offset":932},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":954},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":974},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":1178},{"uri":"Full_name","surface_form":"full name","offset":1526},{"uri":"Vocative","surface_form":"vocative","offset":1630},{"uri":"Postpositional","surface_form":"postpositional","offset":1639},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":1682},{"uri":"Blood_relation","surface_form":"blood relation","offset":2239},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father","offset":2308},{"uri":"Dad","surface_form":"dad","offset":2334},{"uri":"Casual","surface_form":"casual","offset":2343},{"uri":"Mother","surface_form":"mother","offset":2378},{"uri":"Mom","surface_form":"mom","offset":2405},{"uri":"Elder_brother","surface_form":"elder brother","offset":2435},{"uri":"Elder_sister","surface_form":"elder sister","offset":2469},{"uri":"Younger_brother","surface_form":"younger brother","offset":2593},{"uri":"Younger_sister","surface_form":"younger sister","offset":2688},{"uri":"Job_title","surface_form":"job title","offset":2798},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":2867},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":2882},{"uri":"Department","surface_form":"department","offset":2923},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":3131},{"uri":"Job_title","surface_form":"job title","offset":3165},{"uri":"Combination","surface_form":"combination","offset":3185},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":3389},{"uri":"Middle_name","surface_form":"middle name","offset":3445},{"uri":"Chinese_character","surface_form":"Chinese character","offset":3549},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":3576},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":3632},{"uri":"Naming_centers","surface_form":"naming centers","offset":3745}]}
