{"id":216,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe","text":"Europe is the western part of the continent of Eurasia, sometimes thought of as its own continent. It is separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains in Russia and the Bosporus strait in Turkey.\nEurope is bordered by water on three sides. On the west is the Atlantic Ocean. To the north is the Arctic Ocean. The Mediterranean Sea separates Southeastern Europe from Africa. On the eastern border of Europe are the Ural River and Ural Mountains.\nThere are at least 43 countries in Europe (the European identities of 5 transcontinental countries:Cyprus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey are disputed). Most of these countries are members of the European Union.\nEurope covers about 10,180,000 square kilometers (3,930,000 square miles). This is 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of its land area).\nAs of 2017, about 510 million people lived in Europe.\nEurope makes 44% of the world's wine.\nEurope contains the world's second most-active volcano, which is Mount Etna that is currently the most-active volcano in the continent.\nEurope is a major tourist attraction. People come from all over the world to see its many World Heritage Sites and other attractions.\nOrigin of name.\nEurope is named after a princess in Greek mythology called \"Europa.\" The myth says that Zeus kidnapped Europa and took her to Crete, where she became the mother of King Minos (from whom Europe\u2019s first civilization gets its name, the Minoans).\nThe name \"Europa\" was later used to describe Greece. Then, as the rest of modern-day Europe started to have cities and empires, the entire area West of the Ural Mountains came to be called \"Europa\".\nHistory.\nThe history of Europe is long and has many turns. Many great countries originated from Europe. Greek mythology and the beginning of western civilization came from European nations.\nRegions and countries.\nAndreas M. Kaplan describes modern Europe as a continent where many different cultures live closely together, \"embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances\".\nWithin these regions, there are up to 48 independent European countries (with the identities of 5 transcontinental countries being disputed). The largest is the Russian Federation, which covers 39% of Europe.\nThe European city with the largest population is Istanbul. The country with the largest population is the Russian Federation. About 15% of Europeans live in Russia.\nTwo European countries, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, are on islands called the British Isles.\nClimate.\nMost of Europe lies in temperate\u00A0climate zones.\nHowever, there are many different climates throughout Europe. For example, during the winter, it may be snowing and -30 degrees Celsius for 4\u20135 months in Finland. Yet it may be much warmer, with no snow at all except on high mountains, in Spain.\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union is a confederation\u00A0of 27 European countries. These countries agree to follow common laws so that their citizens can move and trade in EU countries almost the same as they do in their own. Nineteen of these countries also share the same type of\u00A0money: the\u00A0euro.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":47},{"uri":"Ural_Mountains","surface_form":"Ural Mountains","offset":132},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":150},{"uri":"Bosporus","surface_form":"Bosporus","offset":165},{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":174},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":184},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":255},{"uri":"Arctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Arctic Ocean","offset":291},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":309},{"uri":"Southeastern_Europe","surface_form":"Southeastern Europe","offset":337},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":362},{"uri":"Ural_River","surface_form":"Ural River","offset":410},{"uri":"Ural_Mountains","surface_form":"Ural Mountains","offset":425},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":645},{"uri":"Square_kilometre","surface_form":"square kilometers","offset":692},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"square miles","offset":721},{"uri":"Mount_Etna","surface_form":"Mount Etna","offset":952},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist","offset":1041},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Sites","offset":1113},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":1209},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"myth","offset":1246},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":1261},{"uri":"Kidnapping","surface_form":"kidnapped","offset":1266},{"uri":"Crete","surface_form":"Crete","offset":1299},{"uri":"Minos","surface_form":"Minos","offset":1342},{"uri":"Minoa","surface_form":"Minoans","offset":1406},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":1461},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empires","offset":1535},{"uri":"Ural_Mountains","surface_form":"Ural Mountains","offset":1572},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":1719},{"uri":"Western_civilization","surface_form":"western civilization","offset":1756},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1906},{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"independent European countries","offset":2053},{"uri":"Russian_Federation","surface_form":"Russian Federation","offset":2173},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":2256},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":2270},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":2414},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":2437},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":2465},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":2484},{"uri":"Temperate_zone","surface_form":"temperate\u00A0climate zones","offset":2531},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":2590},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":2684},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":2710},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":2795},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":2822},{"uri":"Confederation","surface_form":"confederation","offset":2842},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":3081},{"uri":"Euro","surface_form":"euro","offset":3092}]}
