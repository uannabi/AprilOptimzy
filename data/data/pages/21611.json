{"id":21611,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup","text":"A soup is a kind of food. People make soups by boiling things in water. Then they put the things they boiled into a bowl and eat them. Vegetables are in most soups. You can also put meat in soups. Soups that are thicker than normal, with more meat or vegetables, are stews. The liquid in soup is broth.\nTraditionally, soups are classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups. The traditional French types of clear soups are bouillon and consomm\u00E9. Thick soups are classified by the type of thickening agent used. Pur\u00E9es are vegetable soups thickened with starch. Bisques are made from pur\u00E9ed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream. Cream soups may be thickened with b\u00E9chamel sauce; and velout\u00E9s are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include egg, rice, lentils, flour, and grains. Many popular soups also include carrots and potatoes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":20},{"uri":"Boiling","surface_form":"boiling","offset":47},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":65},{"uri":"Bowl","surface_form":"bowl","offset":116},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"Vegetable","offset":135},{"uri":"Stew","surface_form":"stew","offset":267},{"uri":"Broth","surface_form":"broth","offset":296},{"uri":"Bouillon","surface_form":"bouillon","offset":438},{"uri":"Consomm%C3%A9","surface_form":"consomm\u00E9","offset":451},{"uri":"Pur%C3%A9e","surface_form":"Pur\u00E9e","offset":526},{"uri":"Vegetable_soup","surface_form":"vegetable soup","offset":537},{"uri":"Starch","surface_form":"starch","offset":568},{"uri":"Bisque","surface_form":"Bisque","offset":576},{"uri":"Shellfish","surface_form":"shellfish","offset":605},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":644},{"uri":"B%C3%A9chamel_sauce","surface_form":"b\u00E9chamel sauce","offset":685},{"uri":"Velout%C3%A9","surface_form":"velout\u00E9","offset":705},{"uri":"Broth","surface_form":"broth","offset":811},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":826},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":831},{"uri":"Lentils","surface_form":"lentils","offset":837},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":846},{"uri":"Grains","surface_form":"grains","offset":857},{"uri":"Carrots","surface_form":"carrots","offset":897},{"uri":"Potatoes","surface_form":"potatoes","offset":909}]}
