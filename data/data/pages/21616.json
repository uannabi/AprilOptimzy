{"id":21616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64","text":"The Nintendo 64 (commonly abbreviated \"N64\") was the third home video game console released by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan in June 1996 and was meant to compete against the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The Nintendo 64 was Nintendo's first console made for 3D graphics. It uses plastic cartridges instead of CDs or disks, making load times faster. Because of this, the games cost more to make. The controller for the Nintendo 64 was shaped like an \"M\" and had 10 buttons and a joystick. Sony used the N64 joystick design to make their DualShock PlayStation controller. Out of the box, the Nintendo 64 had 4 MB of RAM, and it could be upgraded to 8 MB with the expansion pak.\nBecause making games for the Nintendo 64 was more expensive than making games for the PlayStation, many video game companies chose develop for the Playstation instead. Nintendo also did not like games that had a lot of blood or violence in them. Companies who made these kinds of games made them for the PlayStation instead. However, some game makers did make some violent games for the Nintendo 64, such as Rare's first-person shooter \"Perfect Dark\". Nintendo lost its lead over Sega and Sony because of these two things. Production for the system ceased in Japan in 2002 and in 2003 worldwide.\nReception.\nIn 2015, IGN named the Nintendo 64 the ninth-greatest video game console of all time.\nSales.\n5.54\u00A0million Nintendo 64 units were sold in Japan, 20.63\u00A0million in the Americas, and 6.75\u00A0million in other regions, a total of 32.93\u00A0million units.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Home_video_game_console","surface_form":"home video game console","offset":59},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":95},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":130},{"uri":"Sony","surface_form":"Sony","offset":186},{"uri":"PlayStation","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":191},{"uri":"Sega_Saturn","surface_form":"Sega Saturn","offset":211},{"uri":"3-D","surface_form":"3D graphics","offset":278},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":299},{"uri":"Cartridge_(electronics)","surface_form":"cartridges","offset":307},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CDs","offset":329},{"uri":"Joystick","surface_form":"joystick","offset":498},{"uri":"Sony","surface_form":"Sony","offset":508},{"uri":"DualShock","surface_form":"DualShock","offset":556},{"uri":"Random_access_memory","surface_form":"RAM","offset":634},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":915},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":924},{"uri":"Rare","surface_form":"Rare","offset":1104},{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"first-person shooter","offset":1111},{"uri":"Perfect_Dark","surface_form":"Perfect Dark","offset":1133},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":1176},{"uri":"Sony","surface_form":"Sony","offset":1185},{"uri":"IGN","surface_form":"IGN","offset":1312},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1440},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":1468}]}
