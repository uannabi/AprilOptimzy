{"id":21629,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakatoa","text":"Krakatoa (Indonesian name: \"Krakatau\") is an active volcano in the Sunda Strait, Indonesia. There are many different ways the name has been spelled. The volcano has erupted repeatedly in known history. The best known of these events occurred in late August 1883.\nOn 22 December 2018 the central cone collapsed and caused a tsunami in the Sunda Strait. More than 400 people were killed.\nThe 1883 eruption.\nThe 1883 eruption ejected more than six cubic miles (25 cubic kilometers) of rock, ash, and pumice, and made the loudest sound ever recorded by human beings. The sound was heard as far away as Perth in Australia (3,500\u00A0km; 2,200\u00A0miles), and the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius (4,800\u00A0km; 3,000\u00A0miles). Many thousands of people were killed and injured by the eruption, mostly in the tsunami (giant wave) which followed the explosion.\nThe pressure wave from the final explosion was recorded on barographs around the world, which continued to register it up to 5\u00A0days after the explosion. The recordings show that the shock wave from the final explosion reverberated around the globe seven times.\nThe eruption destroyed two-thirds of what was then the island of Krakatoa. New eruptions at the volcano since 1927 have built a new island, called \"Anak Krakatau\" (child of Krakatoa).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indonesian_language","surface_form":"Indonesian","offset":10},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":45},{"uri":"Sunda_Strait","surface_form":"Sunda Strait","offset":67},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":81},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":153},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"erupted","offset":165},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":323},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":451},{"uri":"Cubic_kilometer","surface_form":"cubic kilometer","offset":461},{"uri":"Volcanic_ash","surface_form":"ash","offset":488},{"uri":"Pumice","surface_form":"pumice","offset":497},{"uri":"Recording","surface_form":"recorded","offset":537},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":549},{"uri":"Perth%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Perth","offset":598},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":607},{"uri":"Rodrigues_(island)","surface_form":"Rodrigues","offset":660},{"uri":"Mauritius","surface_form":"Mauritius","offset":675},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":790},{"uri":"Barograph","surface_form":"barograph","offset":900}]}
