{"id":21639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch","text":"A witch is a person who practices witchcraft or magic. Traditionally, the word was used to accuse someone of bewitching someone, or casting a spell on them to gain control over them by magic. It is now also used by some to refer to those who practice various wise crafts such as Hedge witch. Witches usually used spells for personal gain.\nHistory.\nAlthough most indigenous peoples throughout history have had some beliefs about spirits and people believed to have power through herbs or spirits, these were not called 'witches' until contact with western ideas. Neither did they always have negative connotations.\nIn Europe, the panic over witchcraft was supported by the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", published in 1487 by Heinrich Kramer, a German Catholic clergyman. It taught the prosecution of witches and was greatly promoted by the new technology of the printing press. It saw 29 printings before 1669, second only to the Bible. The book says that three elements are necessary for witchcraft. These are the evil intentions of the witch, the help of the Devil, and the permission of God.\nMany women in South America and throughout Europe were killed by witch hunts. The exact number is debated because of a lack of record keeping and different opinions on the time frames and regions that ought to be included. Since the entire persecuting legal system, \"judges, ministers, priests, constables, jailers, judges, doctors, prickers, torturers, jurors, executioners\" were nearly all male and the victims were overwhelmingly female, the witch hunts are considered by many to be a \"gynocide\". In the documentary \"The Burning Times\", Thea Jensen calls this period in history a \"Women's Holocaust\".\nModern understanding.\nIn the 20th century, a new attempt has been made at understanding witchcraft. Many people say that witches were in fact wise women who were hunted down by the church (mostly for their knowledge of herbs to treat certain diseases). This has led to a new movement. Some of it is known as Wicca.\nHeather Marsh has tied the persecution of witches to the fight of church and industry to control \"the power of life and death\" at a time when industry needed more workers. She also argues the persecution of witches was a fight for centralized power over the peasant rebellions and the ownership of knowledge by medicine and science which forbade the earlier teaching or practices by women and indigenous cultures. She writes that the persecution of witches has colored misogyny since the 1400s.\nSilvia Federici tied the witch hunts to a\u00A0history of the female body in the transition to capitalism.\nWitchcraft and accusations of witchcraft are still very common in some parts of West Africa.\nWitch crimes in the \"Malleus Maleficarum\".\n\"Concerning Witches who copulate with Devils.
