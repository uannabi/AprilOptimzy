{"id":21646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank","text":"The West Bank is a piece of land in the Middle East. It touches the Dead Sea and the River Jordan. The landscape is mostly hills or desert. The weather in the summer is hot and dry. It is cooler and rainy in the winter.\nRight now, the area is under the control of Israel. Some Israelis and other nations disagree on whose it really is.\nSince 1990 there are talks between the Israeli government and the Palestinians about what will happen in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the future. Most people on the West Bank are Palestinians but there are also many Jewish settlers in settlements. There has been some controversy about these settlements.\nThe State of Palestine claims the West Bank with East Jerusalem included.\nThe West Bank is called \"Judea and Samaria Area\" by the Israeli government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":40},{"uri":"Dead_Sea","surface_form":"Dead Sea","offset":68},{"uri":"River_Jordan","surface_form":"River Jordan","offset":85},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":264},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":342},{"uri":"Palestinian","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":402},{"uri":"Gaza_Strip","surface_form":"Gaza Strip","offset":463},{"uri":"Palestinians","surface_form":"Palestinians","offset":522},{"uri":"State_of_Palestine","surface_form":"State of Palestine","offset":652},{"uri":"East_Jerusalem","surface_form":"East Jerusalem","offset":697}]}
