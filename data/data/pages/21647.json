{"id":21647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus","text":"Jan Hus, or John Huss (c.1370 - 6 July 1415) was born in Husinec, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). He was a Bohemian religious thinker and reformer. He started a religious movement that was strongly influenced by the beliefs of British scholar, John Wycliffe.\nHus studied at the University of Prague. In about 1400, he became a Catholic priest, and was soon accepted a position of preaching in Czech, the language spoken in Bohemia. While preaching, he studied Wycliffe\u2019s writings, and came to like them, especially because of how authentic and real they were.\nIn 1403, Hus asked the church to undo the ban on Wycliffe's writings, and translated them into Czech. The church, led by archbishop Zbynek Zaj\u00EDc, had different beliefs. In 1410, Zaj\u00EDc ordered that Hus\u2019 writings be burned and Hus and his followers, the Hussites be forced out of the church. Hus was excommunicated in 1411, condemned by the Council of Constance, and burned at the stake on 6 July 1415, in Konstanz, Germany.\nWhen Hus was killed his followers revolted and fought against the Catholics until they were defeated in 1431.\nHus' teachings.\nMany of his teachings were later taken up by Martin Luther.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Husinec","surface_form":"Husinec","offset":57},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":66},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":79},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":105},{"uri":"John_Wycliffe","surface_form":"John Wycliffe","offset":242},{"uri":"University_of_Prague","surface_form":"University of Prague","offset":276},{"uri":"Catholic_priest","surface_form":"Catholic priest","offset":325},{"uri":"Czech_language","surface_form":"Czech","offset":391},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"archbishop","offset":679},{"uri":"Excommunication","surface_form":"excommunicated","offset":856},{"uri":"Council_of_Constance","surface_form":"Council of Constance","offset":897},{"uri":"Burned_at_the_stake","surface_form":"burned at the stake","offset":923},{"uri":"Konstanz","surface_form":"Konstanz","offset":962},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":972},{"uri":"Martin_Luther","surface_form":"Martin Luther","offset":1152}]}
