{"id":216544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Off","text":"e=\"preserve\">Book Off () is Japan\u2019s biggest chain of second hand bookstores. It is operated by Book Off Corporation Limited. The first Book Off store opened in May, 1990. The first franchisee Book Off store opened in Nov, 1991. The success of the business expanded to 917 stores in Japan and 14 stores abroad (8 in US, 3 in France, 2 in Korea, and 1 in Canada). Book Off sells books including comic books, magazines, and novels, and also sells CDs, DVDs, and Game software. Books are grouped by genres, writers, and prices. The overseas Book Off stores sell second hand books from Japan and also from its own country. Book Off not only sells the second hand books, but also buys the books from customers. For that reason Book Off\u2019s theme copy is \u201C\u304A\u58F2\u308A\u304F\u3060\u3055\u3044\u201D which means \u201CPlease, sell us your book\u201D. The company uses this copy rather than \u201DWe buy your book\u201D to show respect to customers.\nSome Book Off chains, especially ones abroad, have various signboard designs, but still they share the symbol colors of Book Off which are yellow, blue, and red. Book Off has its mascot \"Yomuyomukun (Mr. Yomu-yomu)\" holding a book in his hands. \"Yomu (\u8AAD\u3080)\" in Japanese means \"read\". Another uniqueness of Book Off is the employees\u2019 loud greeting. Employees shout \u201C\u3044\u3089\u3063\u3057\u3083\u3044\u307E\u305B! (irashaimase!: welcome!)\u201D when customers enter, and \"\u3042\u308A\u304C\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307E\u3057\u305F! (arigatou gozaimasita!: thank you!)\u201D when customers leave the shop. Book Off chain stores abroad also greet customers with Japanese.\nFrom 1999 Book Off Corporation Limited started to expand the business into other second hand stores. B-Kids, B-Sports, B-Style, B-Life and B-Select cover second hand baby goods, children wear, sports goods, ladies\u2019 and men\u2019s wear, interior goods, and accessories respectively. After the first B-Kid store opened in Apr, 1999, now there are 26 B-Kids, 32 B-Style, 24 B-Sports stores in Japan. Book Off charges about 81% of the business and the other type of stores charge 19% of the entire sales.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":28},{"uri":"Chain_store","surface_form":"chain","offset":44},{"uri":"Franchising","surface_form":"franchisee","offset":181},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":393},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":406},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":421},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CDs","offset":444},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":449},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"Game software","offset":459},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":495},{"uri":"Signboard","surface_form":"signboard","offset":944},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":988},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":1064},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":1206},{"uri":"Greeting","surface_form":"greeting","offset":1222},{"uri":"Sales","surface_form":"sales","offset":1947}]}
