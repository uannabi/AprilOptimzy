{"id":216867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_(novel)","text":"\"Cecilia\", subtitled \"Memoirs of an Heiress\", is an 18th century novel by Frances Burney. It is a comical, satirical love story. It was admired by people like Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Choderlos de Laclos.\nBackground.\n\"Cecilia\" was published in July 1782. Frances Burney started work on it in 1780. Her father, Dr. Charles Burney and her mentor, Samuel Crisp stopped her from writing a play for the stage, to be titled \"The Witlings\". Frances Burney tried to change their minds, but Dr. Burney insisted she stop and continue writing the more ladylike novels instead. \u201CIn the Novel way, there is no danger,\u201D he said. The stress of this made Burney unhappy. Critics believe this may be why \"Cecilia\" is sadder than her first novel.\nPlot.\nCecilia Beverley is a young heroine, who leaves her country home to travel to London. She will live with a guardian, Mr. Harrel. Cecelia is an orphan heiress. To inherit her money, when she marries, her husband must take her surname and become \"Mr. Beverley\". In London, she is invited to a friend's house (Mr. Monckton), for breakfast, who has married for money. But he loves Cecilia and hopes to marry her when his wife dies. He is afraid Cecilia might fall in love with someone else. At his house she meets Mr. Morrice, a young lawyer; Captain Aresby and Mr. Belfield, who can\u2019t seem to settle down. Mr. Monckton\u2019s wife, Lady Margaret and her servant, Miss Bennet, are also there. Cecilia notices Albany, an old man sitting quietly in the corner, who behaves strangely. She also notices that Lady Margaret dislikes her.\nMr. Harrel is married to Cecelia's childhood friend, Priscilla. So, Priscilla gives parties to introduce Cecelia to new friends: Sir Robert Floyer, Mrs. Harrel\u2019s shy brother Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, silly Miss Larolles; and proud, silent Miss Leeson. Mr. Monckton visits her and she greets him happily. At an opera, Cecelia sees Albany, the strange old man again. He shouts a warning that she is in danger from the people around her and that she should help the poor. The next morning, she sees a poor woman, Mrs. Hill, who comes to beg for her starving family. Mr. Harrel has refused to pay them. Cecilia tries to make him pay, but he will not. Finally, Mr. Arnott, feeling sorry for the Hills, lends him the money to pay them. Cecilia, shocked at how mean Mr. Harrel is, wants to go stay with another guardian. But, they seem just as bad. While Mr. Harrel spends and gambles his money; Mr. Briggs is a selfish miser and Mr. Delvile is a vain man.\nMrs. Harrel has a masquerade ball. Mr. Monckton is in disguise as a black demon and fights anyone who comes near Cecelia.. A person dressed like a white domino tries to help her, as do Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, and Mr. Belfield. Cecilia is surprised at how well the domino knows the faults of her guardians. She wonders who he could be. Later, Cecelia goes to the opera again with Mrs. Harrel. There, she meets Mr. Belfield, who is courteous; but Sir Floyer acts rudely. The two men get angry and have an argument that leads to a duel. Afraid, Cecilia hurries to her house, and worries over the duel.\nThe next morning, Cecelia is told that Mr. Belfield is a little injured, but Sir Floyer is well. Cecilia finds out that the white domino she saw at the masquerade party is Mortimer, Mr. Delvile\u2019s son. Soon after, she meets Mrs. Delvile, who she likes. Now she wants to stay with them, instead of with the Harrels. But, she discovers that Mortimer thinks that she is in love with Mr. Belfield. Or perhaps, that she is engaged to Sir Floyer, who has asked her to marry him. Even though she has refused him, Mr. Harrel tells everyone they will be married soon. Later, she meets Mr. Albany again, who introduces her to Belfield's sister, Henrietta, and asks Cecilia to help her. Cecilia finds out that Mr. Belfield\u2019s wound is serious, but because he does not have enough money he could not call a doctor. She helps the Belfields, begins a friendship with Henrietta, and finds out that Mortimer Delvile, too, is helping them.

Mortimer happily says that they can marry with just her personal fortune. Cecilia, horrified, tells him that she has none of her personal fortune left. She has lent most of it to Mr. Harrel, and used the rest for other things, such as helping the Hills. Cecilia also finds out that somebody has told this to Mr. Delvile already, but with lots of lies. She begins to suspect Mr. Monckton. Mrs. Delvile says yes and Cecilia and Mortimer marry quietly and happily.\nLater, Mrs. Matt, one of the poor people she has helped, tells her who stopped her first wedding\u2014Miss Bennet!

Shortly after, a servant comes and tells her that Mr. Monckton is dead. Soon after, Mortimer comes and says he too had found out Mr. Monckton\u2019s meanness, and he had angrily told Mr. Monckton to tell Mr. Delvile the truth about Cecilia. Mr. Monckton angrily said no, and they shot each other in a furious fight. Mortimer was safe, but Mr. Monckton was badly hurt. Cecilia tells him to leave England with his mother before she can hear about the fight, and agreeing, he goes. However, her marriage has been discovered, so her fortune is taken away from her while Mortimer is gone.

'Oh! It is only a novel!' replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. 'It is only \"Cecilia\", or \"Camilla\", or \"Belinda; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough (complete) knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed (shown) to the world in the best\u2013chosen language.\"\nThe title of Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" is probably from Dr Lyster\u2019s speech at the end of \"Cecilia\": \u201Cremember: if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination.\u201D\nIn her last novel, \"Persuasion\", Anne Elliot talks about \"the inimitable Miss Larolles.\"\nIn Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair\", Rebecca Sharp writes to Amelia Sedley and says they \"used to read \"Cecilia\" at Chiswick.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":52},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":65},{"uri":"Frances_Burney","surface_form":"Frances Burney","offset":74},{"uri":"Edmund_Burke","surface_form":"Edmund Burke","offset":159},{"uri":"Mary_Wollstonecraft","surface_form":"Mary Wollstonecraft","offset":173},{"uri":"Choderlos_de_Laclos","surface_form":"Choderlos de Laclos","offset":198},{"uri":"Sorrow","surface_form":"unhappy","offset":660},{"uri":"Heroine","surface_form":"heroine","offset":777},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":827},{"uri":"Orphan","surface_form":"orphan","offset":892},{"uri":"Heiress","surface_form":"heiress","offset":899},{"uri":"Inheritance","surface_form":"inherit","offset":911},{"uri":"Surname","surface_form":"surname","offset":974},{"uri":"Invite","surface_form":"invited","offset":1027},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":1881},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"gambles","offset":2441},{"uri":"Vain","surface_form":"vain","offset":2511},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demon","offset":2595},{"uri":"Dominoes","surface_form":"domino","offset":2674},{"uri":"Duel","surface_form":"duel","offset":3050},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":4438},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":6352},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":7292},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":9511},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":9683},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":10266},{"uri":"Jane_Austen","surface_form":"Jane Austen","offset":10373},{"uri":"Northanger_Abbey","surface_form":"Northanger Abbey","offset":10441},{"uri":"Pride_and_Prejudice","surface_form":"Pride and Prejudice","offset":10998},{"uri":"Persuasion_(novel)","surface_form":"Persuasion","offset":11268},{"uri":"Vanity_Fair_(novel)","surface_form":"Vanity Fair","offset":11353}]}
