{"id":216891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia","text":"Westphalia () is a region in Germany. The cities of Arnsberg, Bielefeld, Bochum, Detmold, Dortmund, Gelsenkirchen, Hagen, Minden and M\u00FCnster are in its centre. In 1946, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia was created, which includes part of the historical region.\nWestphalia is roughly the region between the rivers Rhine and Weser, north and south of the Ruhr River. During the course of history, different places and regions were called \"Westphalia\", the borders of the region can therefore not be defined exactly, as they depend on the entity and time talked about. For the same reason, there are different specifications of its area and number of people. They range between in land area, and between 4.3 million and 8 million people. There is a consensus that M\u00FCnster, Bielefeld and Dortmund are part of Westphalia.\nA linguistic definition of Westphalia (see Westphalian language) includes the former Prussian Province of Westphalia (except Siegen-Wittgenstein), Lippe, the region around Osnabr\u00FCck and the greater area of the Emsland. Present-day common use, however, often restricts the notion to the present part of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nWestphalia is known for the 1648 Peace of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years' War, as the two treaties were signed in M\u00FCnster and Osnabr\u00FCck.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":29},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":42},{"uri":"Arnsberg","surface_form":"Arnsberg","offset":52},{"uri":"Bielefeld","surface_form":"Bielefeld","offset":62},{"uri":"Bochum","surface_form":"Bochum","offset":73},{"uri":"Detmold","surface_form":"Detmold","offset":81},{"uri":"Dortmund","surface_form":"Dortmund","offset":90},{"uri":"Gelsenkirchen","surface_form":"Gelsenkirchen","offset":100},{"uri":"Hagen","surface_form":"Hagen","offset":115},{"uri":"Minden","surface_form":"Minden","offset":122},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":133},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":182},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":316},{"uri":"Weser","surface_form":"Weser","offset":326},{"uri":"Ruhr_(river)","surface_form":"Ruhr","offset":356},{"uri":"Westphalian_language","surface_form":"Westphalian language","offset":863},{"uri":"Province_of_Westphalia","surface_form":"Province of Westphalia","offset":914},{"uri":"Siegen-Wittgenstein","surface_form":"Siegen-Wittgenstein","offset":945},{"uri":"Lippe","surface_form":"Lippe","offset":967},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":992},{"uri":"Emsland","surface_form":"Emsland","offset":1030},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":1122},{"uri":"Peace_of_Westphalia","surface_form":"Peace of Westphalia","offset":1179},{"uri":"Thirty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Thirty Years' War","offset":1215},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":1269},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":1281}]}
