{"id":21690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom","text":"e=\"preserve\">An axiom is a concept in logic. It is a statement which is assumed to be true without question, and which does not require proof. It is also known as a postulate (as in the parallel postulate). The axiom is to be used as the premise or starting point for further reasoning or arguments, usually in logic or in mathematics.\nThis means it cannot be proved within the discussion of a problem. So inside some discussion, it is thought to be true. There are many reasons why it has no proof. For example,\nLogic can be used to find theorems from the axioms. Then those theorems can be used to make more theorems. This is often how math works. Axioms are important because logical arguments start with them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":27},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":38},{"uri":"Statement","surface_form":"statement","offset":53},{"uri":"Proof","surface_form":"proof","offset":136},{"uri":"Postulate","surface_form":"postulate","offset":165},{"uri":"Parallel_postulate","surface_form":"parallel postulate","offset":186},{"uri":"Premise","surface_form":"premise","offset":238},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":323},{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":539}]}
