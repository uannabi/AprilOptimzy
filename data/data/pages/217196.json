{"id":217196,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance","text":"In physics, resonance is the tendency of a system to vibrate with increasing amplitudes at some frequencies of excitation. These are known as the system's \"resonant frequencies\" (or \"resonance frequencies\"). The resonator may have a \"fundamental frequency\" and any number of \"harmonics\".\nAn example of useful effect of resonant frequency is a guitar string which makes a characteristic noise when it is touched. The noise depends on how thick or slack the string is.\nAnother example can be seen in a playground swing. There is one specific rate at which you must push away a person on a swing to cause the swing to go high. This rate is the resonant frequency.\nIn earthquake engineering, on contrary, any possibility of a resonance is detrimental for the building structure.\nThe Kirkwood gap and other connections among orbits are caused by orbital resonance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":3},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":43},{"uri":"Vibration","surface_form":"vibrate","offset":53},{"uri":"Amplitude","surface_form":"amplitude","offset":77},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequencies","offset":96},{"uri":"Harmonic","surface_form":"harmonic","offset":276},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":343},{"uri":"Noise","surface_form":"noise","offset":386},{"uri":"Swing_(seat)","surface_form":"playground swing","offset":500},{"uri":"Earthquake_engineering","surface_form":"earthquake engineering","offset":664},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building structure","offset":755},{"uri":"Kirkwood_gap","surface_form":"Kirkwood gap","offset":779},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":820},{"uri":"Orbital_resonance","surface_form":"orbital resonance","offset":841}]}
