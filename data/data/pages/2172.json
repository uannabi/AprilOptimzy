{"id":2172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOL","text":"LOL, or lol, is an internet slang term that means \"laugh(ing) out loud\". It is commonly mistaken for \"lots of love.\" LOL is often used in messages meaning \"That is really funny.\"\nIt also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which means \"fun\" (\"lollig\" means \"funny\"). In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say \"utter nonsense\" in Welsh, they would say \"rwtsh lol\". LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet_slang","surface_form":"internet slang","offset":19},{"uri":"Laugh","surface_form":"laugh","offset":51},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":110},{"uri":"Message","surface_form":"messages","offset":138},{"uri":"Humour","surface_form":"funny","offset":171},{"uri":"Mute","surface_form":"mute","offset":193},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":201},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":225},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":244},{"uri":"Lollig","surface_form":"lollig","offset":273},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":300},{"uri":"Nonsense","surface_form":"nonsense","offset":317}]}
