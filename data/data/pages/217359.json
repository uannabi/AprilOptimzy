{"id":217359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_number","text":"=\"preserve\">In number theory a Carmichael number is a composite positive integer formula_1, which satisfies the congruence formula_1 for all integers formula_1 which are relatively prime to formula_1. Being relatively prime means that they do not have common divisors, other than 1. Such numbers are named after Robert Carmichael.\nAll prime numbers formula_1 satisfy formula_1 for all integers formula_1 which are relatively prime to formula_1. This has been proven by the famous mathematician Pierre de Fermat. In most cases if a number formula_1 is composite, it does not satisfy this congruence equation. So, there exist not so many Carmichael numbers. We can say that Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that behave a little bit like they would be a prime number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":15},{"uri":"Composite_number","surface_form":"composite","offset":54},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":73},{"uri":"Congruence","surface_form":"congruence","offset":112},{"uri":"Coprime","surface_form":"relatively prime","offset":170},{"uri":"Robert_Daniel_Carmichael","surface_form":"Robert Carmichael","offset":312},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":335},{"uri":"Pierre_de_Fermat","surface_form":"Pierre de Fermat","offset":494}]}
