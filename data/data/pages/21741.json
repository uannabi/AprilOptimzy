It usually lists the various things that are to be done, and how much to spend on each. It may also list estimated revenue<nowiki/>s. When spending is less than revenues, it is a surplus budget. When spending is more than revenues, it is a deficit budget. When they are the same, it's a balanced budget.\nAn organization's budget is usually for a fiscal year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Account","surface_form":"account","offset":27},{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":65},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":92},{"uri":"Revenue","surface_form":"revenue","offset":238},{"uri":"Economic_deficit","surface_form":"deficit budget","offset":363},{"uri":"Fiscal_year","surface_form":"fiscal year","offset":469}]}
