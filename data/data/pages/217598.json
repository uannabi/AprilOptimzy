{"id":217598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lexeme is a term in linguistics. They are units of meaning, independent of any inflectional endings, or whether it is one word or several. \"Come in\" is a lexeme; so is \"raining cats and dogs\". The largest English dictionaries have about half a million lexemes. \"The true figure is undoubtedly a great deal higher\".\nIn the English language, \"run\", \"runs\", \"ran\" and \"running\" are forms of the same lexeme, conventionally written as RUN.\nA similar concept is the lemma (or citation form). It is the form of a lexeme which is chosen to represent the lexeme, for example, RUN instead of the other forms. Lemmas are used in dictionaries as the headwords. Other forms of a lexeme are usually listed later in the entry. So all headwords in a dictionary are lexemes.\nA \"lexicon\" is made of lexemes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistics","offset":33},{"uri":"Meaning","surface_form":"meaning","offset":64},{"uri":"Inflection","surface_form":"inflection","offset":92},{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionaries","offset":226},{"uri":"Lemma_(linguistics)","surface_form":"lemma","offset":474}]}
