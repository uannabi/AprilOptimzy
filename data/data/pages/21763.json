{"id":21763,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas","text":"Hamas (, acronym of Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya, literally \"Islamic Resistance Movement\") is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist paramilitary organisation. It was started in 1987 during the First Intifada by Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi as the Gaza branch of the Muslim Brotherhood organization in Egypt. In the 2006 Palestinian election, Hamas got 74 of 132 seats in parliament and controls the Gaza Strip. The group wants to build a Palestinian state based on Islamic values in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip. Hamas does not recognize the State of Israel.\nName.\n\"Hamas\" is an acronym of the Arabic phrase, or Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya or \"Islamic Resistance Movement\".\nViolence.\nHamas is known for its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which plans and carries out attacks on Israel. Because of its policy of suicide bombings and rocket attacks on civilians in Israel, the United States, European Union and other countries call it a terrorist organisation. The country of Jordan has made the group illegal. However, many of the international press, including the English-language edition of the Israeli daily newspaper \"Haaretz\", refer to Hamas members by the more neutral term \"militants.\"\nPopularity.\nIn early 2006, Hamas won a clear victory in the vote for the Palestinian parliament. Voters saw Hamas as an alternative to exchange the long-ruling Fatah party, the main part of the PLO. Fatah had not improved the Palestinian people's conditions and reached statehood, and was thought to be corrupt.\nCharitable work.\nHamas has shown its organizational ability by building health, education, and social services to help the population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where there is much poverty. Such efforts have increased its support. In the first half of 2007, Hamas gained political control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah keeps its headquarters in the West Bank.\nHamas is also associated in some way with Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine headed by Ahmed Jibril.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":9},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":100},{"uri":"Sunni_Islam","surface_form":"Sunni","offset":112},{"uri":"Islamism","surface_form":"Islamist","offset":118},{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":127},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":172},{"uri":"First_Intifada","surface_form":"First Intifada","offset":188},{"uri":"Ahmed_Yassin","surface_form":"Ahmed Yassin","offset":206},{"uri":"Abdel_Aziz_al-Rantissi","surface_form":"Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi","offset":223},{"uri":"Gaza","surface_form":"Gaza","offset":253},{"uri":"Muslim_Brotherhood","surface_form":"Muslim Brotherhood","offset":272},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":307},{"uri":"2006_Palestinian_legislative_election","surface_form":"2006 Palestinian election","offset":321},{"uri":"Gaza_Strip","surface_form":"Gaza Strip","offset":405},{"uri":"Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state","surface_form":"Palestinian state","offset":444},{"uri":"Sharia_law","surface_form":"Islamic values","offset":471},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":510},{"uri":"West_Bank","surface_form":"West Bank","offset":522},{"uri":"Gaza_Strip","surface_form":"Gaza Strip","offset":537},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":615},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":630},{"uri":"Suicide_bombing","surface_form":"suicide bombing","offset":870},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":934},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":949},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":994},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":1033},{"uri":"Journalism","surface_form":"international press","offset":1089},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English-language","offset":1124},{"uri":"Haaretz","surface_form":"Haaretz","offset":1181},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1273},{"uri":"Palestinian_parliament","surface_form":"Palestinian parliament","offset":1325},{"uri":"Fatah","surface_form":"Fatah","offset":1412},{"uri":"Palestine_Liberation_Organization","surface_form":"PLO","offset":1446},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":1755},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":1826},{"uri":"Ahmed_Jibril","surface_form":"Ahmed Jibril","offset":2033}]}
