{"id":217813,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid","text":"A cuboid is a 3D shape. Cuboids have six faces, which form a convex polyhedron. Broadly, the faces of the cuboid can be any quadrilateral. More narrowly, rectangular cuboids are made from 6 rectangles, which are placed at right angles. A cuboid that uses all square faces is a cube.\nThe basic difference between a rectangle and a cuboid is that one is a 2D shape and the other is a 3D shape.\nThe basic difference between a cube and cuboid is that a cube has equal length, height and breadth whereas in cuboids these three may or may not be the same.\nThe cuboid can also be called a right rectangular prism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":14},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":17},{"uri":"Convex","surface_form":"convex","offset":61},{"uri":"Polyhedron","surface_form":"polyhedron","offset":68},{"uri":"Quadrilateral","surface_form":"quadrilateral","offset":124},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":259},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":277}]}
