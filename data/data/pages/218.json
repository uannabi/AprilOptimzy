{"id":218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science","text":"Earth science is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. Earth science may also be called geoscience.\nIt is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science, which is part of astronomy. The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to understand the Earth, and how it evolved to its current state.\nIf there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this; the Earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation. The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think.\nFields of study.\nname=\"smith 5\">Smith, Gary A. & Pun, Aurora 2006. How does the Earth work?.
