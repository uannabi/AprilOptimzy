{"id":218052,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Mesozoic was the geological era in which dinosaurs lived, as well as the first birds and mammals. It lasted about 186 million years, starting 252.2 mya (million years ago) with the Tr extinction and ending 66 mya with the T extinction (the one that killed dinosaurs).\nDinosaurs appeared around 231 mya (21 million years after the beginning of the Mesozoic). They evolved from early reptiles called the archosaurs (a group of which modern birds and crocodiles are still part).\nThe Mesozoic is the middle of the three eras that make up the Phanerozoic eon. Before the Mesozoic was the Palaeozoic era. The K/T extinction in 66 mya also marks the beginning of the Cenozoic era, the one we live in.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"geological era","offset":34},{"uri":"Dinosaurs","surface_form":"dinosaurs","offset":58},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":96},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":106},{"uri":"Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event","surface_form":"Tr extinction","offset":198},{"uri":"K/T_extinction_event","surface_form":"T extinction","offset":239},{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":380},{"uri":"Archosaur","surface_form":"archosaur","offset":419},{"uri":"Crocodiles","surface_form":"crocodiles","offset":465},{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic eon","offset":555},{"uri":"Palaeozoic","surface_form":"Palaeozoic","offset":600},{"uri":"Cenozoic","surface_form":"Cenozoic era","offset":677}]}
