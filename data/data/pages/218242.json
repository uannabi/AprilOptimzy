L9/10 will be the deepest line in the network, and the longest line in Europe. Originally expected to be ready by 2008, ongoing problems with its construction are going to delay its completion until as late as 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Barcelona_metro","surface_form":"Barcelona metro","offset":94},{"uri":"Barcelona_Metro_line_9","surface_form":"line 9","offset":120},{"uri":"Transports_Metropolitans_de_Barcelona","surface_form":"TMB","offset":179},{"uri":"Badalona","surface_form":"Badalona","offset":224},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":242},{"uri":"Barcelona_metro_line_9","surface_form":"L9","offset":303},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":378}]}
