{"id":218517,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Quaternary is the current geological period. It is the most recent of the three periods of the Cainozoic era and the most recent of the twelve periods of the current eon, the Phanerozoic. The Quaternary follows the Neogene, which is the second period of the Cainozoic.\nThe Quaternary began about 2.6 million years ago, and continues today. A great deal of information is considered when geologists discuss the timing of periods. The status of the Quaternary as a period is confirmed by the \"International Commission on Stratigraphy\" (ICS).\nIn the Quarternary were the glaciations known as the Ice Age. Also, anatomically modern humans evolved. During the Quaternary, many large mammalian species became extinct. This was due to climate change and hunting by humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":43},{"uri":"Period_(geology)","surface_form":"period","offset":54},{"uri":"Cainozoic","surface_form":"Cainozoic","offset":112},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":122},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":183},{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic","offset":192},{"uri":"Neogene","surface_form":"Neogene","offset":232},{"uri":"Glaciation","surface_form":"glaciation","offset":585},{"uri":"Ice_Age","surface_form":"Ice Age","offset":610},{"uri":"Homo_sapiens","surface_form":"anatomically modern humans","offset":625},{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":652},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":695},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":705},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":720},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":745},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":764}]}
