{"id":218527,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Eocene was the second geological epoch in the Palaeogene. It began 56 million years ago, and ended 33.9 million years ago. Before it was the Palaeocene and, after it, the Oligocene.\nThe Eocene, like the Palaeocene before it, had a climate much warmer than today. At the start of the Eocene the \"Palaeocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum\" was reached. This lasted for 100,000 years, and caused a large extinction event. The land was heavily forested, with temperate forests into arctic and antarctic regions, and the many herbivorous mammals were browsers, not grazers.\nThe end of the Eocene was the beginning of the Oligocene (33.9 million years ago). Many plant and animal species went extinct. This was the Eocene\u2013Oligocene extinction event. The extinction event was probably caused by meteorite strikes in Siberia and Chesapeake Bay.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":39},{"uri":"Epoch_(geology)","surface_form":"epoch","offset":50},{"uri":"Palaeogene","surface_form":"Palaeogene","offset":63},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":87},{"uri":"Palaeocene","surface_form":"Palaeocene","offset":158},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":188},{"uri":"Palaeocene","surface_form":"Palaeocene","offset":220},{"uri":"List_of_extinction_events","surface_form":"extinction event","offset":410},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":449},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"arctic","offset":487},{"uri":"Antarctic","surface_form":"antarctic","offset":498},{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":530},{"uri":"Browser","surface_form":"browser","offset":555},{"uri":"Grazer","surface_form":"grazer","offset":569},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":593},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":625},{"uri":"Eocene%E2%80%93Oligocene_extinction_event","surface_form":"Eocene\u2013Oligocene extinction event","offset":718},{"uri":"Meteorite","surface_form":"meteorite","offset":797},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":818},{"uri":"Chesapeake_Bay","surface_form":"Chesapeake Bay","offset":830}]}
