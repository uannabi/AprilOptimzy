{"id":218556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Permian/Triassic extinction event (P/Tr for short and also popularly referred to as the Great Dying) was the largest extinction event in the Phanerozoic eon. 57% of all biological families, 83% of all genera, 96% of all marine species (including many kinds of fish and the last surviving trilobites) and 70% of all terrestrial vertebrates (including many of the large amphibians, primitive reptiles and synapsids) became extinct. It is the only known extinction event of insects. It ended the Palaeozoic era, and began the Mesozoic era.\nThe event forms the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods, at about 252 million years ago. Because so much biodiversity was lost, the recovery of life on earth took much longer than after other extinction events. This event has been described as the \"mother of all mass extinctions\".\nThe pattern of extinction is still unclear, as different studies suggest one to three different pulses.\nThere are several proposed mechanisms for the extinctions. These include: large or multiple meteorite impacts, increased volcanism, sudden release of methane hydrates from the sea floor. Gradual changes include sea level change, oceanic anoxic events, increasing aridity, and a shift in ocean circulation driven by climate change.\nOne thing is probably significant. One of the largest ever flood basalt eruptions took place across the P/Tr junction. These eruptions, from 251 to 250 million years ago, produced the Siberian Traps, a huge volcanic province in Siberia. This would certainly have made the world's climate much worse, and is now thought to be the main cause of this great extinction.\nAnother factor is that global sea levels were at an historic low point at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinction_event","surface_form":"extinction event","offset":134},{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic","offset":158},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":170},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"biological families","offset":186},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":218},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":438},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":488},{"uri":"Palaeozoic","surface_form":"Palaeozoic","offset":510},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":521},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":540},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":595},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":607},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":673},{"uri":"Meteorite","surface_form":"meteorite","offset":1046},{"uri":"Volcanoes","surface_form":"volcanism","offset":1075},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":1104},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1165},{"uri":"Oceanic_anoxic_event","surface_form":"oceanic anoxic event","offset":1183},{"uri":"Arid","surface_form":"arid","offset":1217},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":1269},{"uri":"Flood_basalt","surface_form":"flood basalt","offset":1344},{"uri":"Siberian_Traps","surface_form":"Siberian Traps","offset":1469},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":1513},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1681}]}
