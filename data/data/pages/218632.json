{"id":218632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jathera","text":"=\"preserve\">A Jathera is a shrine constructed to commemorate common clan ancestors. Each village in the Punjab has a Jathera which can be visited by members of different surnames. Many villages have a Jathera for each clan/surname.\nWhen members of a clan form a new village, they continue to visit the Jathera in the ancestral village. If this is not possible, a link is brought from the old Jathera to construct a new Jathera in the new village.\nPeople visit the Jathera when getting married, on the 15th day of the Indian month, and sometimes on the first Sunday of an Indian month.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punjab_region","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":104}]}
