{"id":21875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab","text":"Kabab (kebap in Turkish, kabab in Iran, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, also spelled kebob, kabob;) means \"grilled (or broiled) meat\" in Persian and Turkish. Kabab is usually made of lamb and beef. Sometimes chicken and fish are used for some styles. Pork is never used by Muslims but is sometimes used by non-Muslim sellers. Muslims are not allowed to eat pork, for religious reasons.\nThere are many varieties of kabab and the term means different things in different countries. The generic term kabab usually refers to doner kebab or \"d\u00F6ner kebap\" in Europe and to shish kabab in the United States, though its meaning can vary. In South Asia the term can refer to a whole range of items such as Chappali kabab, Shami kabab, Bihari kabab and so on.\nVariations.\nThere are many types of kebab. Below are just a few.\nShish.\nShish kababs are cooked or grilled on skewers, over hot coals or wood. These kababs originated in Iran and Afghanistan and then spread out to Turkey, Pakistan, India and various parts of Arabia. They are also very popular now in Europe and the United States.\nD\u00F6ner.\nD\u00F6ner kabab (which means \"rotating kebab\" in Turkish) is sliced lamb, beef, or chicken, that is slowly roasted on a vertical rotating spit.\nChappali.\nChappali kabab or chappal kabab or chapli kabab is a type of fried kabab. It started in the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) of present Pakistan and in Afghanistan. The name comes from the Pashto (and also Urdu) word for 'slipper' or 'shoe'. The kebab is actually called a 'slipper/shoe kebab'. Its shape is like that of a slipper or shoe.\nThis kebab is basically made from ground or minced beef or mutton mixed with tomatoes, onions and chillies, and a variety of herbs and spices. It is given its unique shape. It is fried in a special big pan. It is eaten with big \"roti\" bread typical of the Pathan region. Often \"Qahwa\" or green tea, is drunk with it or after it, to help digestion.\n\"Chappali kabab\" is very popular throughout Pakistan. It has spread to major cities of the country such as Lahore and Karachi. According to gourmets, the best ones are still found in Peshawar city and Mardan. Today, the popularity of these kebabs is also gradually spreading to other parts of the world, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":16},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":34},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":40},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":53},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":63},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":138},{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":150},{"uri":"Lamb","surface_form":"lamb","offset":184},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":193},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":209},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":221},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"Pork","offset":252},{"uri":"Halal","surface_form":"religious reasons","offset":368},{"uri":"Doner_kebab","surface_form":"doner kebab","offset":522},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":634},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":921},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":930},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":965},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":973},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":983},{"uri":"Arabia","surface_form":"Arabia","offset":1010},{"uri":"Roasting","surface_form":"roasted","offset":1192},{"uri":"Kebab","surface_form":"kabab","offset":1306},{"uri":"Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","surface_form":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","offset":1365},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":1396},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":1412},{"uri":"Pashto_language","surface_form":"Pashto","offset":1449},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":1466},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":1651},{"uri":"Mutton","surface_form":"mutton","offset":1659},{"uri":"Pathan","surface_form":"Pathan","offset":1856},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":2055},{"uri":"Karachi","surface_form":"Karachi","offset":2066},{"uri":"Gourmets","surface_form":"gourmets","offset":2088},{"uri":"Peshawar","surface_form":"Peshawar","offset":2131},{"uri":"Mardan","surface_form":"Mardan","offset":2149},{"uri":"United_Arab_Emirates","surface_form":"United Arab Emirates","offset":2266},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":2288},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":2306},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":2322},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":2330}]}
