{"id":218762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VY_Canis_Majoris","text":"VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star in the constellation Canis Major. It is about distant from Earth. It is one of the Largest known Stars in the universe, and one of the most luminous of its type.\nVY Canis Majoris is 1,420 times wider than the Sun. If placed at the center of the Solar System, VY Canis Majoris's surface would extend beyond Jupiter's orbit. However, there is still some variation in the size estimates as other estimates of the radius make it larger than the orbit of Saturn.\nVY CMa is a single star, a \"semiregular\" variable with a period of about 2,001\u00A0days. It has an average density of 5 to 10\u00A0mg/m3.\nWhen it dies it is expected to explode to a Supernova and then turn into a Black hole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hypergiant","surface_form":"hypergiant","offset":35},{"uri":"Canis_Major","surface_form":"Canis Major","offset":72},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"luminous","offset":191},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":260},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":296},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":357},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":461},{"uri":"Saturn","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":501},{"uri":"Variable_star","surface_form":"variable","offset":550},{"uri":"Supernova","surface_form":"Supernova","offset":682},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"Black hole","offset":713}]}
