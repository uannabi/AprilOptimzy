{"id":218771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","text":"The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademin\" (\"KVA\") is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. The Academy is an independent, scientific, non-governmental organization, set up to support the sciences, mainly the natural sciences and mathematics.\nThe Academy was started on 2 June 1739 by naturalist Carl Linnaeus, economist Jonas Alstr\u00F6mer, mechanical engineer M\u00E5rten Triewald, civil servants Sten Carl Bielke and Carl Wilhelm Cederhielm, and politician Anders Johan von H\u00F6pken.\nThe academy was set up to find useful knowledge, and to write about it in Swedish. The academy was meant to be different from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, which had been started in 1719 and published in Latin. It was built near the main business centre in Stockholm, (which unlike Uppsala did not have a university at this time). The Swedish scientists wanted it to be like the Royal Society in London and Academie Royale des Sciences in Paris, France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swedish_Royal_Academies","surface_form":"Royal Academies","offset":93},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":112},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":138},{"uri":"Scientific","surface_form":"scientific","offset":151},{"uri":"Non-governmental_organization","surface_form":"non-governmental organization","offset":163},{"uri":"Natural_sciences","surface_form":"natural sciences","offset":237},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":258},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":313},{"uri":"Carl_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Carl Linnaeus","offset":324},{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":339},{"uri":"Jonas_Alstr%C3%B6mer","surface_form":"Jonas Alstr\u00F6mer","offset":349},{"uri":"Mechanical_engineering","surface_form":"mechanical engineer","offset":366},{"uri":"M%C3%A5rten_Triewald","surface_form":"M\u00E5rten Triewald","offset":386},{"uri":"Civil_servant","surface_form":"civil servant","offset":403},{"uri":"Sten_Carl_Bielke","surface_form":"Sten Carl Bielke","offset":418},{"uri":"Carl_Wilhelm_Cederhielm","surface_form":"Carl Wilhelm Cederhielm","offset":439},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":468},{"uri":"Anders_Johan_von_H%C3%B6pken","surface_form":"Anders Johan von H\u00F6pken","offset":479},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":578},{"uri":"Royal_Society_of_Sciences_in_Uppsala","surface_form":"Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala","offset":634},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":720},{"uri":"Uppsala","surface_form":"Uppsala","offset":798},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":895},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":912},{"uri":"Academie_Royale_des_Sciences","surface_form":"Academie Royale des Sciences","offset":923},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":955},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":962}]}
