{"id":218889,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazer","text":"A grazer is an animal, usually a herbivorous mammal, which eats grass. It is contrasted with browsers, which eat trees & shrubs.\nThe life-style, dentition (teeth), and digestive system of grazers is different from browsers, to handle the problems of eating and digesting grass. This is well illustrated in the evolution of such groups as horses. Ruminants are the largest group of grazers, though many other animals such as giant panda<nowiki/>s also graze.\nWhen grazers keep eating grass in an area without giving the plants time to grow back, that is called overgrazing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":33},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":45},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":64},{"uri":"Browser","surface_form":"browser","offset":93},{"uri":"Dentition","surface_form":"dentition","offset":145},{"uri":"Digestive_system","surface_form":"digestive system","offset":168},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":310},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":338},{"uri":"Ruminant","surface_form":"Ruminant","offset":346},{"uri":"Giant_panda","surface_form":"giant panda","offset":424}]}
