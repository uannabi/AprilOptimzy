{"id":218974,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strata","text":"Strata are layers of rock, or sometimes soil. In nature, strata come in many layers. It is a term in sedimentary and historical geology; the singular is \"stratum\". The study of strata is called stratigraphy.\nThese layers are laid down as sediment, often in the sea, and are slowly changed by pressure, heat and chemical action into rocks.\nThe strata are often typical of a particular time and place, and allow geologists to relate rocks in different places. For instance, chalk was laid down in the Upper Cretaceous period, and consists mainly of the remains of microscopic algae called coccoliths.\nIn normal strata, the later strata are laid down on earlier strata in horizontal layers. In the long passage of time, sedimentary rocks may get \"deformed\" by huge forces in the Earth: volcanism, orogeny (mountain building) or other causes. Then it requires research to work out what has happened to the strata.\nWhen strata rise above sea level they get worn down by erosion, such as weather. This causes gaps in the sequence of strata, which may have risen and sunk many times in Earth history. These gaps are called unconformities in geological jargon.\nCycles.\nIn many formations of strata there are repeating patterns. For example, clay layers alternate with sandstone layers; or carbonate layers alternate with shales. This is usually caused by repeating cycles of climate. In warmer times the sea rises, and carbonate rocks are deposited in shallow subtropical seas. Later, ice builds up at the poles and the sea level drops. Then the same area is close to shore, and gets sand and mud washed down by rivers.\nRocks showing repeat patterns of strata are called rhythmites. Sometimes the patterns are caused by annual climate changes. Geologists call those varves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":21},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":40},{"uri":"Sedimentary_rock","surface_form":"sedimentary","offset":101},{"uri":"Historical_geology","surface_form":"historical geology","offset":117},{"uri":"Stratigraphy","surface_form":"stratigraphy","offset":194},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":238},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":292},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":311},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":472},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":499},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":574},{"uri":"Coccolith","surface_form":"coccolith","offset":587},{"uri":"Volcanism","surface_form":"volcanism","offset":783},{"uri":"Orogeny","surface_form":"orogeny","offset":794},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":933},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":965},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":982},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":1015},{"uri":"Unconformity","surface_form":"unconformities","offset":1116},{"uri":"Jargon","surface_form":"jargon","offset":1145},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":1233},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":1260},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":1281},{"uri":"Shale","surface_form":"shale","offset":1313},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":1452},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":1477},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1512},{"uri":"Rhythmite","surface_form":"rhythmite","offset":1663},{"uri":"Varve","surface_form":"varve","offset":1758}]}
