{"id":219026,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Morrison","text":"Holmes Sterling Morrison Jr. (born August 28, 1942, died August 30, 1995) was an American musician (guitar), known as a founding member of the Velvet Underground.\nMorrison met Lou Reed, who also played guitar, at college. They met again later in New York City, where Reed was with John Cale. Morrison joined Reed and Cale in, and the three formed a band. The band gained the name \"The Velvet Underground\" when another college friend, Jim Tucker, brought them a book with that title. Tucker's sister Maureen became the band's drummer.\nMorrison played lead guitar, and also rhythm and bass guitars, and sang backing vocals. When Doug Yule replaced John Cale, Morrison played lead guitar full-time. Yule sometimes pushed for the lead guitar role, and Morrison and Yule did not get along well.\nEven though the Velvets were well known, their financial success was limited, and Morrison became unsure about the band's future. He quit college before the Velvets formed, with only a few credits to go, but went back to City College of New York during 1970. He completed his Bachelor's degree in English, while the band played Max's Kansas City, a restaurant and bar in New York.\nAfter Lou Reed left the band late in 1970, Morrison continued to tour with them. He had sent his to different schools, hoping to get a job as a teacher or professor. When the band visited Texas, he phoned Texas A&M University, and learned they wanted him for a teaching job. He quit the band, and taught college through the 1970s and 1980s.\nMorrison later returned to New York, and became a captain. He reunited with the Velvets during the 1990s, playing shows with them in Europe and America. He became ill in 1995, saw a doctor, and found out he had, a kind of cancer. He died only a few weeks later, and not long before the Velvet Underground were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":81},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":90},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":100},{"uri":"Founder","surface_form":"founding member","offset":120},{"uri":"Velvet_Underground","surface_form":"Velvet Underground","offset":143},{"uri":"Lou_Reed","surface_form":"Lou Reed","offset":176},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":213},{"uri":"New_York%2C_New_York","surface_form":"New York City","offset":246},{"uri":"John_Cale","surface_form":"John Cale","offset":281},{"uri":"Maureen_Tucker","surface_form":"Maureen","offset":499},{"uri":"Drummer","surface_form":"drummer","offset":525},{"uri":"Lead_guitar","surface_form":"lead guitar","offset":550},{"uri":"Rhythm_guitar","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":572},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":583},{"uri":"Vocalist","surface_form":"vocal","offset":614},{"uri":"Doug_Yule","surface_form":"Doug Yule","offset":627},{"uri":"City_College_of_New_York","surface_form":"City College of New York","offset":1011},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":1043},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"Bachelor's degree","offset":1066},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1087},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":1139},{"uri":"Tour","surface_form":"tour","offset":1236},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":1315},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":1326},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":1359},{"uri":"Texas_A%26amp%3BM_University","surface_form":"Texas A&M University","offset":1376},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":1495},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":1505},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":1539},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":1562},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":1611},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1645},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1734},{"uri":"Induction","surface_form":"inducted","offset":1822},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame","offset":1840}]}
