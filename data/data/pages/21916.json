{"id":21916,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp_forest","text":"Kelp forests are a type of marine ecosystem that is present around colonies of kelp; they contain rich biodiversity. Kelp can stretch 2-30 meters or more (up to 60 m in \"Macrocystis pyrifera\") from their anchors on the sea floor to the surface. It provides a vertical infrastructure that is home to many fish and invertebrate species. Kelp forests also often attract mammalian visitors, including whales, sea lions, sea otters, and SCUBA-diving humans.\nKelp forests draw their name from an analogy to forests on land.\nIn some places, sea urchins eat so many kelp plants that the kelp forest becomes an urchin barren.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":27},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":34},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":67},{"uri":"Kelp","surface_form":"kelp","offset":79},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":103},{"uri":"Anchor","surface_form":"anchor","offset":204},{"uri":"Sea_floor","surface_form":"sea floor","offset":219},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":236},{"uri":"Vertical","surface_form":"vertical","offset":259},{"uri":"Infrastructure","surface_form":"infrastructure","offset":268},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":304},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":313},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":326},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":367},{"uri":"Whale","surface_form":"whale","offset":397},{"uri":"Sea_lion","surface_form":"sea lion","offset":405},{"uri":"Otter","surface_form":"sea otter","offset":416},{"uri":"SCUBA","surface_form":"SCUBA","offset":432},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":445},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":501},{"uri":"Sea_urchins","surface_form":"sea urchins","offset":534},{"uri":"Urchin_barren","surface_form":"urchin barren","offset":602}]}
