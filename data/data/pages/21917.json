{"id":21917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis","text":"Symbiosis (pl. symbioses) means living together. It describes close and long-term relationships between different species. The term was\nused by Anton de Bary in 1879, as \"the living together of unlike organisms\".\nA symbiont is an organism living in a relationship with another species in which one or both get benefits. When one species lives inside another species, or a microscopic symbiont lives inside the cells of a host, it is called an endosymbiont.\nThe relevance of symbiosis is its frequency and its evolutionary significance. There appear to be no higher plants or animals without symbionts. Those symbionts are of great importance to the larger organisms, who in most cases would be unable to live as they do without their symbionts. Mycorrhiza in higher plants, and gut flora in insects and vertebrates are examples. Humans are no exception.\nFurthermore, most of these associations are between organisms not just from different species, but from different kingdoms. And lastly, the cells of all eukaryotes contain organelles which are descendants of symbiotic relationships which began at least a billion years ago. Mitochondria and plastids are examples. The conclusion must be that symbiosis has been highly significant in the evolution of life.\nDefinition.\nThe definition of symbiosis has been controversial. Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others believe it should apply to all kinds of lon-term biological interactions.\nAfter 130 years of debate, current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter \"de Bary\" definition or an even broader definition (where symbiosis means all species interactions). The restrictive definition (where symbiosis means mutualism only) is no longer used.\nThe widest definition includes parasitism (in which one organism is helped and the other organism is hurt), mutualism (in which both organisms are helped), commensalism (in which one organism is helped and the other is not affected), and competition (in which both organisms are hurt).\nType 2: Partners live as one organism.\nAlmost for certain, this happened to form the eukaryote cell. That's the type of cell all animals and plants are made of. The organelles inside the cell, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain some DNA. This DNA is the remnant of a once separate bacterium. The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or archaea organisms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":114},{"uri":"Anton_de_Bary","surface_form":"Anton de Bary","offset":144},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscopic","offset":372},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":410},{"uri":"Endosymbiont","surface_form":"endosymbiont","offset":443},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":509},{"uri":"Mycorrhiza","surface_form":"Mycorrhiza","offset":745},{"uri":"Gut_flora","surface_form":"gut flora","offset":778},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":791},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":803},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdoms","offset":968},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":1007},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":1026},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":1109},{"uri":"Mitochondria","surface_form":"Mitochondria","offset":1128},{"uri":"Plastid","surface_form":"plastid","offset":1145},{"uri":"Mutualism","surface_form":"mutualism","offset":1379},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":1513},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":1525},{"uri":"Parasitism","surface_form":"parasitism","offset":1779},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":1804},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":1837},{"uri":"Mutualism","surface_form":"mutualism","offset":1856},{"uri":"Organisms","surface_form":"organisms","offset":1881},{"uri":"Commensalism","surface_form":"commensalism","offset":1904},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":1931},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competition","offset":1986},{"uri":"Organisms","surface_form":"organisms","offset":2013},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":2119},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":2129},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":2199},{"uri":"Mitochondria","surface_form":"mitochondria","offset":2235},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplast","offset":2252},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":2327},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":2421}]}
