{"id":219208,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_6","text":"e=\"preserve\">Line 6, coloured navy blue, (currently known as Pla\u00E7a Catalunya - Reina Elisenda) is the name of a metro-like commuter train service in Barcelona operated by FGC, and part of the ATM fare-integrated transport system. It links Pla\u00E7a Catalunya, the city centre, with Sarri\u00E0-Sant Gervasi. This Barcelona Metro and Metro del Vall\u00E8s line shares three stations with FGC L7.\nOverview.\nPrior to the \"integration\" with the TMB network, L6 covered as an underground commuter train line the distance from downtown Barcelona to Sarri\u00E0, pretty much the same as nowadays. It has its origins in 1876, with the Barcelona-Sarri\u00E0 train. It's going to be extended towards Sant Boi, through Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00E9u.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Barcelona_metro","surface_form":"metro","offset":112},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":149},{"uri":"Ferrocarrils_de_la_Generalitat_de_Catalunya","surface_form":"FGC","offset":171},{"uri":"Autoritat_del_Transport_Metropolit%C3%A0","surface_form":"ATM","offset":192},{"uri":"Pla%C3%A7a_Catalunya","surface_form":"Pla\u00E7a Catalunya","offset":239},{"uri":"City_centre","surface_form":"city centre","offset":260},{"uri":"Sarri%C3%A0-Sant_Gervasi","surface_form":"Sarri\u00E0-Sant Gervasi","offset":278},{"uri":"Barcelona_Metro","surface_form":"Barcelona Metro","offset":304},{"uri":"Metro_del_Vall%C3%A8s","surface_form":"Metro del Vall\u00E8s","offset":324},{"uri":"Transports_Metropolitans_de_Barcelona","surface_form":"TMB","offset":427},{"uri":"Sarri%C3%A0","surface_form":"Sarri\u00E0","offset":529},{"uri":"1876","surface_form":"1876","offset":593},{"uri":"Sant_Boi","surface_form":"Sant Boi","offset":666},{"uri":"Hospital_Sant_Joan_de_D%C3%A9u","surface_form":"Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00E9u","offset":684}]}
