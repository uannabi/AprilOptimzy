{"id":219214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptophyte","text":"Haptophytes are a phylum of algae, sometimes called the Prymnesiophyta. All or most of them are single-celled photosynthetic phytoplankton.\nThe cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella and a unique organelle called a haptonema. This is superficially similar to a flagellum, but differs in its arrangement of microtubules, and in its use. The name comes from the Greek \"hapsis\" = touch, and \"nema\" = thread.\nClassification.\nMolecular and morphological evidence places them in five orders; coccolithophores make up the \"Isochrysidales\" and \"Coccolithales\". Other groups include phytoplankton which produce the toxic algal blooms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":18},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":28},{"uri":"Photosynthetic","surface_form":"photosynthetic","offset":110},{"uri":"Phytoplankton","surface_form":"phytoplankton","offset":125},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":186},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":208},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":372},{"uri":"Molecular_evolution","surface_form":"Molecular","offset":433},{"uri":"Morphology_(biology)","surface_form":"morphological","offset":447},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":461},{"uri":"Coccolith","surface_form":"coccolith","offset":498},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":618},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algal blooms","offset":624}]}
