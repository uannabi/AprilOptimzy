{"id":219233,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene","text":"The Holocene is the present geological epoch. It started around 11,000 years ago after the last ice age. We are currently going through a non-ice age warm stage in Earth's history.\nHolocene climatic optimum.\nThe Holocene climatic optimum (HCO) was a warm period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years BP. The interesting thing about this is, despite recent global warming, we are still below this warm period (see diagram).\nThis warm period was followed by a gradual decline until about two millennia ago.\nMore details.\nThe Holocene is also called the Recent epoch. It is the second stage in the Quaternary period.\nThe Holocene marks the end of the previous series of ice ages in the Pleistocene. It started about 11,700 years ago when the temperatures rose quickly from the previous level.\nDuring the early Holocene, there were many extinctions amongst larger mammals. This is because of human hunting and climate change.\nAt this time the Bering bridge connecting Russia and Alaska melted. Also the land bridge between China and Japan melted (starting the J\u014Dmon period), as well as many land bridges between islands in Southeast Asia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":28},{"uri":"Before_present","surface_form":"BP","offset":294},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":350},{"uri":"Millennia","surface_form":"millennia","offset":484},{"uri":"Quaternary","surface_form":"Quaternary","offset":589},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":661},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":677},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":854},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":888},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":900},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":958},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":969},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1013},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1023},{"uri":"J%C5%8Dmon_period","surface_form":"J\u014Dmon period","offset":1050},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":1113}]}
