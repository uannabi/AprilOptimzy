These people used to live in the city of \"Moudania\" (Turkish: Mudanya) and started being farmers or fishers. They were forced to leave their homes after the Treaty of Lausanne. They first came in 1923 and they developed their town quickly and became a big turistic place.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":58},{"uri":"Macedonia_(Greece)","surface_form":"Macedonia","offset":86},{"uri":"Chalcidice","surface_form":"Chalcidice","offset":107},{"uri":"Nea_Moudania_Municipality","surface_form":"Nea Moudania Municipality","offset":148},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":296},{"uri":"Nea_Michaniona","surface_form":"Nea Michaniona","offset":394},{"uri":"Central_Macedonia","surface_form":"Central Macedonia","offset":412},{"uri":"1922","surface_form":"1922","offset":466},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":490},{"uri":"Anatolia","surface_form":"Anatolia","offset":502},{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":566},{"uri":"Mudanya","surface_form":"Mudanya","offset":575},{"uri":"1923","surface_form":"1923","offset":709}]}
