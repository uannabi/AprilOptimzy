{"id":21942,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_town","text":"A new town, planned community, or planned city is a kind of city that is designed by architects and engineers before it is built. Most cities and towns just develop over the years, without a clear plan. Urban planning is only used for later expansion.\nPlanned communities are designed with separate districts of the city for parks, stores, homes, and offices. Many planned communities have a transportation system for commuters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":60},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":85},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineer","offset":100},{"uri":"Urban_planning","surface_form":"Urban planning","offset":203},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":299},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":325},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"stores","offset":332},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"home","offset":340},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":351},{"uri":"Transportation","surface_form":"transportation","offset":392},{"uri":"Commuter","surface_form":"commuter","offset":418}]}
