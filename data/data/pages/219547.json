{"id":219547,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrerasaurus","text":"\"Herrerasaurus\" was one of the earliest dinosaurs. All known fossils of this carnivore have been discovered in Upper Triassic strata dated to 231.4\u00A0million years ago (mya) in northwestern Argentina.\nIt is a member of the Herrerasauridae, a family of similar genera that were among the earliest dinosaurs.\nDescription.\n\"Herrerasaurus\" was a lightly built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. Its length is estimated at 3 to 6\u00A0meters (10 to 20\u00A0ft), and its hip height at more than 1.1\u00A0meters (3.3\u00A0ft). It may have weighed around 210\u2013350\u00A0kilograms (463\u2013772\u00A0lb).\nIn a large specimen the skull measured 56\u00A0centimeters (1.8\u00A0ft) in length. Smaller specimens had skulls about 30\u00A0centimeters (1\u00A0ft) long.\nThe tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed.\nPalaeoenvironment.\nThe paleoenvironment of the Ischigualasto Formation (where it was found) was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests with strong seasonal rainfall. The climate was moist and warm, with seasonal variations. Vegetation consisted of ferns (\"Cladophlebis\"), horsetails, and giant conifers (\"Protojuniperoxylon\"). These plants formed lowland forests along the banks of rivers. \"Herrerasaurus\" remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation.\n\"Herrerasaurus\" lived in these jungles alongside a smaller dinosaur, the one metre long \"Eoraptor\", as well as \"Saurosuchus\", a huge quadrupedal Archosaur. There were also a number of therapsid and reptilian herbivores. The dinosaurs had not yet taken control of the land environments as they did later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":40},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":111},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":126},{"uri":"Bipedal","surface_form":"bipedal","offset":354},{"uri":"Natural_environment","surface_form":"paleoenvironment","offset":870},{"uri":"Volcanic","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":945},{"uri":"Floodplain","surface_form":"floodplain","offset":965},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":987},{"uri":"Fern","surface_form":"fern","offset":1108},{"uri":"Cladophlebis","surface_form":"Cladophlebis","offset":1116},{"uri":"Horsetail","surface_form":"horsetail","offset":1132},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":1154},{"uri":"Eoraptor","surface_form":"Eoraptor","offset":1452},{"uri":"Saurosuchus","surface_form":"Saurosuchus","offset":1475},{"uri":"Archosaur","surface_form":"Archosaur","offset":1508},{"uri":"Therapsid","surface_form":"therapsid","offset":1547}]}
