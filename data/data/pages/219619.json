{"id":219619,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon","text":"A lagoon is a body of salt water partly separated from the sea. There is usually some sort of barrier which separates and protects the lagoon. This may be a pebble or shingle beach, sand bank, or perhaps a coral reef surrounding an atoll. An atoll is an oceanic island formed by a volcano.\n\"Lagoon\" refers both to coastal lagoons, and the lagoons in atolls, formed by the growth of coral reefs on slowly eroding central islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pebble","surface_form":"pebble","offset":157},{"uri":"Shingle_beach","surface_form":"shingle beach","offset":167},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":182},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":206},{"uri":"Atoll","surface_form":"atoll","offset":232},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":281},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"eroding","offset":404}]}
