{"id":21963,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose","text":"Goose (plural geese, genus \"Anser\") is a genus containing 11 species within the swan subfamily.\nThis family also includes the swans, which are mostly larger than geese, and the ducks, which are smaller and have short necks.\nGeese are famously gregarious: they like to stick together. They can be moved in large herds because of this feature of their behaviour. Both as chicks and as adults, geese show collective animal behaviour. Geese migrate in groups in the spring and fall, flying together in a V-shape.\nA male goose is called a \"gander\" and a baby goose is called a \"gosling\". A group of geese is called a \"gaggle\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swan","surface_form":"swan","offset":126},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":177},{"uri":"Gregarious","surface_form":"gregarious","offset":243},{"uri":"Herd","surface_form":"herd","offset":311},{"uri":"Collective_animal_behaviour","surface_form":"collective animal behaviour","offset":402},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migrate","offset":437}]}
