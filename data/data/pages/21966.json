{"id":21966,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary","text":"Ovaries (Singular: Ovary) are organs found in female organisms. Ovaries are part of the reproductive system needed to reproduce sexually.\nMost vertebrates have ovaries. Usually animals have two ovaries. Birds usually have only one working ovary; snakes have one ovary in front of the other. The ovaries are similar to testicles in men.\nAnatomy.\nOvaries are shaped like eggs and are around 3 cm by 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm. The ovary is found in the side walls of the pelvis.\nEach ovary is attached to the Fallopian tube. Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every month.\nMenstruation.\nDuring menstruation, an ovum is released from the ovary and enters one of the Fallopian tubes. There, the ovum can be fertilised. Ovaries have a certain number of eggs in them, so when eggs stop being released, this is the start of the menopause. During this time, female hormones stop being produced.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["anatomy"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Singular","surface_form":"Singular","offset":9},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":30},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":46},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":53},{"uri":"Reproductive_system","surface_form":"reproductive system","offset":88},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"reproduce sexually","offset":118},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":143},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"Bird","offset":203},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":246},{"uri":"Testicle","surface_form":"testicle","offset":318},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":369},{"uri":"Centimeter","surface_form":"cm","offset":391},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":459},{"uri":"Fallopian_tube","surface_form":"Fallopian tube","offset":497},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":565},{"uri":"Menopause","surface_form":"menopause","offset":822}]}
