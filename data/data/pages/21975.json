{"id":21975,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros","text":"A rhinoceros (rhino for short) is any animal in the family Rhinocerotidae. They are in the order Perissodactyla, or odd-toed ungulates. There are five living species. Two of these species are native to Africa. Three of these species are also native to Southern parts of Asia.\nHabitat.\nAll five rhinoceros species are native to Africa or Asia. The two species in Africa are the White rhinoceros and the Black rhinoceros. The three species in Asia (including islands of Indonesia) are the Javan rhinoceros, Sumatran rhinoceros, and Indian rhinoceros.\nLife.\nThe rhinoceros is a herbivore. Its favourite food is plants, branches and bushes (if it is a browser species), or grass (if it is a grazer species).\nRhinoceroses have a large horn on the nose. Their horns are not like those of other horned mammals: the rhinoceros' horn is made of keratin packed together very tightly.\nThe rhinoceroses can weigh up to and be up to tall.\nRhinoceros and humans.\nOnly the white rhinoceros is not in critical danger of becoming extinct. They are protected, but hunted mainly by poachers, for their horns. The horns are used in Asian medicine, similar to elephants and tigers, and for dagger handles in Yemen and Oman. Loss of habitat is also a danger to rhinos. Governments have made logging their habitat and poaching illegal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":38},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":52},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":91},{"uri":"Perissodactyla","surface_form":"Perissodactyla","offset":97},{"uri":"Odd-toed_ungulates","surface_form":"odd-toed ungulates","offset":116},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":158},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":202},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":270},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":327},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":337},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":468},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":575},{"uri":"Browser","surface_form":"browser","offset":648},{"uri":"Grazer","surface_form":"grazer","offset":687},{"uri":"Keratin","surface_form":"keratin","offset":836},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":1013},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":1187},{"uri":"Oman","surface_form":"Oman","offset":1197},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":1211},{"uri":"Logging","surface_form":"logging","offset":1269},{"uri":"Poaching","surface_form":"poaching","offset":1295},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":1304}]}
