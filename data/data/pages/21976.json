{"id":21976,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_proof","text":"e=\"preserve\">Alcoholic proof is a measure of how much ethanol there is in an alcoholic drink. It is commonly used the world over, on the basis that 100 degrees proof is the equivalent of 50 % alcohol by volume (ABV or Alc/Vol). In the United States, it is double the percentage of ABV.\nWhere it comes from.\nThis system was introduced in the 18th century. The British claim that this term has a nautical background. Every evening, sailors would line up for their daily quota of grog/rum. This had to first be proved to be as strong as promised and not watered down. The spirit was tested with gunpowder: a mixture of water and alcohol \"proved\" itself when it could be poured on a small amount of gunpowder and still light up the wet powder. If the powder did not ignite, the mixture had too much water in it and the grog was considered below proof. It might have happened earlier, as the Americans claim that this definition came about in the 17th century when European traders began making a large quantity of distilled spirits and wine available to American Indians. The very same process led to the nickname \"firewater\", this time given by Native Americans. There is no record of the finite strength of the distilled spirits in the context of its sale to or consumption by Native Americans.\nA \"proven\" solution was defined as 100 degrees proof (100\u00B0). People have found out that this takes 57.15% ethanol. This value is still used as the British definition. A simpler ratio to remember is \"seven to four\": 70\u00B0 proof is 40% alcohol by volume.\nA hydrometer can be used to measure the precise proof of a spirit. This test has gone through many formal changes.\nEU.\nThe European Union member nations have broadly adopted the recommendation of the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) which measures percentage of alcohol by volume at 20\u00A0\u00B0C.\nBritish proof spirits.\nPreviously, Clarke's hydrometer had been used since the 1740s when Customs and Excise and London brewers and distillers began to use Clarke's hydrometer.\nUnited States.\nIn the definition of the United States, the proof number is twice the percentage of the alcohol content measured by volume at a temperature of 60\u00B0F (15.5\u00B0C). Therefore, \"80 proof\" is 40% alcohol by volume (most of the other 60% is water). If a 150 proof beverage is mixed half-and-half with water, the drink is 75 proof.\nUS Federal regulation (CFR 27 5.37 Alcohol Content) requires that liquor labels state the percentage alcohol by volume (sometimes abbreviated ABV). The regulations permit (but do not require) a statement of the degrees proof as long as it is right next to the percentage alcohol by volume.\nAlcohol during production.\nAlcohol is produced by yeast during the process of fermentation. The other product of fermentation is carbon dioxide, which is the gas that can make beer bottles explode or blow their tops off. The amount of alcohol in the finished liquid depends on how much sugar there was at the beginning for the yeast to convert into alcohol. In beer, the alcohol is generally 3% to 12% (6 to 24 proof) and usually about 4% to 6% (8 to 12 proof). Depending on the strain of yeast, wines top out at about 14% to 16% (28 to 32 proof), because that is the point in the fermentation process where the alcohol concentration denatures the yeast. Since the 1990s, a few alcohol-tolerant 'superyeast' strains have become commercially available, which can ferment up to 20%.\nVery few microorganisms can live in alcoholic solutions. The main three are yeast, \"Brettanomyces\", and \"Acetobacter\". In what is essentially disinfection, yeast keeps multiplying as long as there is sugar to \"eat\", gradually increasing the alcoholic content of the solution and killing off all other microorganisms, and eventually themselves. There are \"fortified\" wines with a higher alcohol concentration than that because stronger alcohol has been mixed with them.\nStronger liquors are distilled after fermentation is complete to separate the alcoholic liquid from the remains of the grain, fruit, or whatever it was made from. The idea of distillation is that a mixture of liquids is heated, the one with the lowest boiling point will evaporate (or \"boil off\") first, and then the one with the next lowest boiling point, and so on. The catch is that water and alcohol form a mixture (called an azeotrope) that has a lower boiling point than either one of them, so what distills off first is that mixture of 95% alcohol and 5% water. Thus a distilled liquor cannot be stronger than 95% (190 proof); there are other techniques for separating liquids that can produce 100% ethanol (or \"absolute alcohol\"), but they are used only for scientific or industrial purposes. 100% ethanol does not stay 100% for very long, because it is hygroscopic and absorbs water out of the atmosphere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":54},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":77},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":87},{"uri":"Alcohol_by_volume","surface_form":"alcohol by volume","offset":192},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":235},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":341},{"uri":"Liquor","surface_form":"spirit","offset":569},{"uri":"Gunpowder","surface_form":"gunpowder","offset":592},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":616},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":1142},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"People","offset":1354},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":1399},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":1440},{"uri":"Hydrometer","surface_form":"hydrometer","offset":1546},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":1667},{"uri":"International_Organization_of_Legal_Metrology","surface_form":"International Organization of Legal Metrology","offset":1744},{"uri":"Clarke%27s_hydrometer","surface_form":"Clarke's hydrometer","offset":1889},{"uri":"1740s","surface_form":"1740s","offset":1933},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1967},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2071},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":2162},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"\u00B0F","offset":2191},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":2199},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":2277},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":2707},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":2735},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":2786},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":2815},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":3322},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":3447},{"uri":"Brettanomyces","surface_form":"Brettanomyces","offset":3522},{"uri":"Acetobacter","surface_form":"Acetobacter","offset":3543},{"uri":"Fortified_wine","surface_form":"\"fortified\" wines","offset":3792},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distilled","offset":3928},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":4116},{"uri":"Boiling_point","surface_form":"boiling point","offset":4159},{"uri":"Azeotrope","surface_form":"azeotrope","offset":4337},{"uri":"Hygroscopic","surface_form":"hygroscopic","offset":4769}]}
