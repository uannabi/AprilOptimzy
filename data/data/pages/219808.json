{"id":219808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verismo","text":"e=\"preserve\">Verismo is a word which refers to a type of literature and a type of opera that was popular towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The Italian word \"verismo\" means \"realism\".\nIn literature the main verismo writers were the Frenchman \u00C9mile Zola, the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the Italian writer Giovanni Verga. The composer Pietro Mascagni used a story by Verga for his opera Cavalleria rusticana. This was a short, one-act opera which became extremely popular. Several composers were inspired by it and wrote similar works. The only one of these which is still regularly performed is \"Pagliacci\" by Ruggero Leoncavallo. These two short operas are often performed on the same evening. They are known together as \"Cav and Pag\".\nVerismo operas are generally based on stories about ordinary people from the working classes rather than about kings or gods or aristocrats. There is often a lot of violence in the stories as people love one another with great passions, which often leads to murder. Bizet's opera \"Carmen\" is typical of that kind of story, although it was composed before the verismo tradition was really popular.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":57},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":82},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":128},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":166},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":184},{"uri":"Realism","surface_form":"realism","offset":214},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"Frenchman","offset":272},{"uri":"%C3%89mile_Zola","surface_form":"\u00C9mile Zola","offset":282},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":298},{"uri":"Henrik_Ibsen","surface_form":"Henrik Ibsen","offset":318},{"uri":"Giovanni_Verga","surface_form":"Giovanni Verga","offset":354},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":374},{"uri":"Pietro_Mascagni","surface_form":"Pietro Mascagni","offset":383},{"uri":"Cavalleria_rusticana","surface_form":"Cavalleria rusticana","offset":435},{"uri":"Pagliacci","surface_form":"Pagliacci","offset":645},{"uri":"Ruggero_Leoncavallo","surface_form":"Ruggero Leoncavallo","offset":659},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":897},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":906},{"uri":"Aristocrat","surface_form":"aristocrat","offset":914},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":951},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":1044},{"uri":"Bizet","surface_form":"Bizet","offset":1052},{"uri":"Carmen","surface_form":"Carmen","offset":1067}]}
