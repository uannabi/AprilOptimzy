{"id":219817,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats%2C_Shoots_%26_Leaves","text":"\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\" is a book written by Lynne Truss. It explains how careful writing and punctuation helps writers communicate clearly. One example is the difference between the statements \"eats, shoots and leaves\" and \"eats shoots and leaves.\" It explains by the example of a panda who walks into a restaurant, eats, draws a gun and shoots at the other patrons, and then leaves, blaming the incident on the instruction of a badly punctuated wildlife manual. The purpose of the book is to explain the importance of proper punctuation.\nThe book was interesting to read and a great commercial success it was a best-seller. However, it had its own punctuation errors and inconsistencies, as a review in the New Yorker magazine pointed out.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lynne_Truss","surface_form":"Lynne Truss","offset":45},{"uri":"Panda","surface_form":"panda","offset":282},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":331},{"uri":"Patron","surface_form":"patron","offset":359},{"uri":"Punctuated","surface_form":"punctuated","offset":436},{"uri":"New_Yorker","surface_form":"New Yorker","offset":709}]}
