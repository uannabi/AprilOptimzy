{"id":219838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid","text":"Rubeus Hagrid is a character in the J.K. Rowling \"Harry Potter\" book series. A teacher and groundskeeper at Hogwarts, the school that Harry Potter attends, Hagrid is a friend of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Hagrid is also a \"half-giant.\" His father was not a giant, whereas his mother, Fridwulfa, who died whilst he was young, was a giantess. He has a half-brother named Grawp. In the \"Harry Potter\" movies, Hagrid is played by Robbie Coltrane. Martin Playfield appears as a young Hagrid in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\".\nOver the course of the \"Harry Potter\" books, Hagrid is expelled from Hogwarts after The Ministry of Magic thought he had opened the Chamber of Secrets. But the truth that he had been framed by Tom Riddle is exposed and Hagrid is allowed to remain at the school as gamekeeper. The government broke his wand and banned him from doing magic when he was expelled, but he keeps pieces of the wand in his pink umbrella.\nHagrid, who keeps several pets, is also a friend of Madame Maxime, although it is not known if they were together in a romantic way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hogwarts","surface_form":"Hogwarts","offset":108},{"uri":"Harry_Potter_(character)","surface_form":"Harry","offset":178},{"uri":"Ron_Weasley","surface_form":"Ron","offset":185},{"uri":"Hermione_Granger","surface_form":"Hermione","offset":194},{"uri":"Grawp","surface_form":"Grawp","offset":368},{"uri":"Robbie_Coltrane","surface_form":"Robbie Coltrane","offset":425},{"uri":"Martin_Playfield","surface_form":"Martin Playfield","offset":442},{"uri":"The_Ministry_of_Magic","surface_form":"The Ministry of Magic","offset":615},{"uri":"Chamber_of_Secrets","surface_form":"Chamber of Secrets","offset":663},{"uri":"Tom_Riddle_(character)","surface_form":"Tom Riddle","offset":724}]}
