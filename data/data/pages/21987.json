{"id":21987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm. It can be used to find the biggest number that divides two other numbers (the greatest common divisor of two numbers).\nWhat the algorithm looks like in words.\nEuclid solved the problem graphically. He said\nThe algorithm as an enumerated list.\nStart out with two positive integers \"m\" and \"n\".\nThe algorithm in pseudocode.\nNote: This pseudocode uses modular arithmetic instead of subtraction. It does the same thing as above, but gets the answer faster.\nPrecondition: two positive integers \"m\" and \"n\"\nPostcondition: the greatest common integer divisor of \"m\" and \"n\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":43},{"uri":"Euclid","surface_form":"Euclid","offset":213},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":325},{"uri":"Pseudocode","surface_form":"pseudocode","offset":364},{"uri":"Pseudocode","surface_form":"pseudocode","offset":387},{"uri":"Modular_arithmetic","surface_form":"modular arithmetic","offset":403},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtraction","offset":433},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":534},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":590}]}
