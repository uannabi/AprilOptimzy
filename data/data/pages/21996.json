{"id":21996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexahedron","text":"e=\"preserve\">A hexahedron (plural: hexahedra) is any polyhedron with six faces. A cube, for example, is a regular hexahedron with all its faces square, and three squares around each vertex.\nThere are seven topologically distinct \"convex\" hexahedra, one of which exists in two mirror image forms. (Two polyhedra are \"topologically distinct\" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polyhedron","surface_form":"polyhedron","offset":53},{"uri":"Face_(geometry)","surface_form":"faces","offset":73},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":82},{"uri":"Regular_polyhedron","surface_form":"regular","offset":106},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":144},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"vertex","offset":182}]}
