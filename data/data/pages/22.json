{"id":22,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition","text":"In mathematics, addition, represented by the symbol formula_1, is an operation which combines two mathematical objects together into another mathematical object of the same type, called the sum. Addition can occur with simple objects such as numbers, and more complex objects such as vectors and matrices.\nArithmetic.\nIn arithmetic, addition is finding the total of two or more numbers. The sign for addition is \"+\", and the name for the sign \"+\" is \"plus\". Another name for the total is the sum.\nCounting examples.\nFor example, there are objects in two groups. The objects are small circles: \"o\". One group has five of these objects. The other group has three of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.\nAdding.\nIn another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children, and now have five children.\nThe animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds (place value).\nFirst, the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, with the 3 written below and the 1 ten carried to the tens column. Next, in the tens column, the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, with the 5 written below and the 1 hundred carried to the hundreds column. Finally, in the hundreds column, 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, with the 2 written below and the 1 thousand carried to the thousand column. The final answer is thus one thousand two hundred and fifty three.\nA measurement example.\nThe distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house, added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house, is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.\nHence Sally's house is 420 meters to the east of Tom's house.\nAddition as increase.\nAddition can also mean to make bigger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Sum","surface_form":"sum","offset":190},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"numbers","offset":242},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vectors","offset":284},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrices","offset":296},{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":321},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":378},{"uri":"Sum","surface_form":"sum","offset":492},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"objects","offset":539},{"uri":"Group","surface_form":"group","offset":554},{"uri":"Place_value","surface_form":"place value","offset":1233}]}
