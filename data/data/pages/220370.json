{"id":220370,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_77","text":"Interstate 77 is an Interstate Highway in the eastern United States. It goes from Columbia, South Carolina north to Cleveland, Ohio. The route is long. It traverses diverse terrain, from the mountainous state of West Virginia to the rolling farmlands of North Carolina and Ohio. It largely supplants the old U.S. Route 21 between Cleveland, Ohio, and Columbia, South Carolina, as an important north\u2013south corridor through the middle Appalachians. The southern terminus of Interstate 77 is in Columbia at the junction with Interstate 26. The northern terminus is in Cleveland at the junction with Interstate 90.\nThe East River Mountain Tunnel, connecting Virginia and West Virginia, is one of only two instances in the United States where a mountain \"road\" tunnel crosses a state line. The other is the Cumberland Gap Tunnel, connecting Tennessee and Kentucky.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interstate_Highway","surface_form":"Interstate Highway","offset":20},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":54},{"uri":"Columbia%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Columbia, South Carolina","offset":82},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cleveland, Ohio","offset":116},{"uri":"West_Virginia","surface_form":"West Virginia","offset":212},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":254},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":273},{"uri":"U.S._Route_21","surface_form":"U.S. Route 21","offset":308},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cleveland, Ohio","offset":330},{"uri":"Columbia%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Columbia, South Carolina","offset":351},{"uri":"Appalachian_Mountains","surface_form":"Appalachians","offset":433},{"uri":"Interstate_26","surface_form":"Interstate 26","offset":522},{"uri":"Interstate_90","surface_form":"Interstate 90","offset":596},{"uri":"East_River_Mountain_Tunnel","surface_form":"East River Mountain Tunnel","offset":615},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":654},{"uri":"Cumberland_Gap_Tunnel","surface_form":"Cumberland Gap Tunnel","offset":802},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":836},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":850}]}
