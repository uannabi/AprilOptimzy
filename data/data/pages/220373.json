{"id":220373,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_80","text":"Interstate 80 is an Interstate Highway in the United States. It goes from San Francisco, California east to Teaneck, New Jersey (just outside of New York City). The route is long and goes through 11 states. I-80 crosses the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.\nI-80 is the Interstate Highway that most closely follows the route of the historic Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. The highway roughly traces other historically significant travel routes in the Western United States: the Oregon Trail across Wyoming and Nebraska, the California Trail across most of Nevada and California, and except in the Great Salt Lake area, the entire route of the First Transcontinental Railroad.\nFrom near Chicago, Illinois, east to near Youngstown, Ohio, Interstate 80 is a toll road, containing the majority of both the Indiana Toll Road and the Ohio Turnpike. It also has a small part of the Illinois Tollway. I-80 and Interstate 90 share the same road from near Portage, Indiana to Elyria, Ohio. I-80 becomes the Keystone Shortway (a freeway built across rural northern Pennsylvania.) The eastern end of I-80 is its junction with the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 95 just west of the George Washington Bridge entering New York City.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interstate_Highway","surface_form":"Interstate Highway","offset":20},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":46},{"uri":"San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"San Francisco, California","offset":74},{"uri":"Teaneck%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Teaneck, New Jersey","offset":108},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":145},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":234},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":246},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":254},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":260},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":269},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":279},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":285},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":295},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":304},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":310},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":328},{"uri":"Lincoln_Highway","surface_form":"Lincoln Highway","offset":423},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":462},{"uri":"Western_United_States","surface_form":"Western United States","offset":550},{"uri":"Oregon_Trail","surface_form":"Oregon Trail","offset":577},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":597},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":609},{"uri":"California_Trail","surface_form":"California Trail","offset":623},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":655},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":666},{"uri":"Great_Salt_Lake","surface_form":"Great Salt Lake","offset":696},{"uri":"First_Transcontinental_Railroad","surface_form":"First Transcontinental Railroad","offset":742},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":785},{"uri":"Youngstown%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Youngstown, Ohio","offset":817},{"uri":"Toll_road","surface_form":"toll road","offset":854},{"uri":"Indiana_Toll_Road","surface_form":"Indiana Toll Road","offset":901},{"uri":"Ohio_Turnpike","surface_form":"Ohio Turnpike","offset":927},{"uri":"Illinois_Tollway","surface_form":"Illinois Tollway","offset":974},{"uri":"Interstate_90","surface_form":"Interstate 90","offset":1001},{"uri":"Portage%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Portage, Indiana","offset":1045},{"uri":"Elyria%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Elyria, Ohio","offset":1065},{"uri":"Keystone_Shortway","surface_form":"Keystone Shortway","offset":1096},{"uri":"New_Jersey_Turnpike","surface_form":"New Jersey Turnpike","offset":1217},{"uri":"Interstate_95","surface_form":"Interstate 95","offset":1241},{"uri":"George_Washington_Bridge","surface_form":"George Washington Bridge","offset":1272},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1306}]}
