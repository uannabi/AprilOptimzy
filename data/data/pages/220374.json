{"id":220374,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_83","text":"Interstate 83 is an Interstate Highway in the United States. It goes from Baltimore, Maryland north to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The route is long. Most of the route south of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania is a direct replacement of US 111, a former spur of US 11.\nThe Jones Falls Expressway, known to local residents as the JFX, is a long freeway. It is the part of Interstate 83 from downtown Baltimore to the northern suburbs. I-83 then joins I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) for 1.4 miles. After separating from the Beltway, I-83 is now known as the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway. Running due north away from the Beltway, I-83 goes next to Maryland Route 45 York Road, the former route of US 111. I-83 goes to the west of Timonium and Cockeysville.\nI-83 enters Pennsylvania southeast of New Freedom, passing to the east of Shrewsbury and goes due north towards York. The route goes around the boroughs of Loganville and Jacobus before entering the city of York. North of Pennsylvania Route 295, I-83 is known as the Susquehanna Expressway. I-83 has this name as it passes to the south and west of Valley Green. I-83 then goes north towards Harrisburg. South of Harrisburg, I-83 interchanges with Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike. North of I-76, I-83 continues due north, passing through New Cumberland, before merging with Pennsylvania Route 581 in Lemoyne.\nAfter merging with PA 581, I-83 is known as the Harrisburg Expressway. The highway turns due east within the merge and crosses the Susquehanna River over the John Harris Bridge, south of Harrisburg's central business district. It ends at an interchange with Interstate 81.\nAuxiliary routes.\nI-83 has only one spur route: Interstate 283, a connector to Interstate 76 and PA 283 southeast of Harrisburg.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interstate_Highway","surface_form":"Interstate Highway","offset":20},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":46},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore, Maryland","offset":74},{"uri":"Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","offset":103},{"uri":"Lemoyne%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Lemoyne, Pennsylvania","offset":175},{"uri":"U.S._Route_111","surface_form":"US 111","offset":224},{"uri":"U.S._Route_11","surface_form":"US 11","offset":249},{"uri":"Freeway","surface_form":"freeway","offset":331},{"uri":"Interstate_83_in_Maryland","surface_form":"Interstate 83","offset":358},{"uri":"Downtown_Baltimore","surface_form":"downtown","offset":377},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":386},{"uri":"Maryland_Route_45","surface_form":"Maryland Route 45","offset":630},{"uri":"U.S._Route_111","surface_form":"US 111","offset":679},{"uri":"Timonium%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Timonium","offset":712},{"uri":"Cockeysville%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Cockeysville","offset":725},{"uri":"New_Freedom%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"New Freedom","offset":777},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_Township%2C_York_County%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":813},{"uri":"York%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"York","offset":851},{"uri":"Loganville%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Loganville","offset":895},{"uri":"Jacobus%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Jacobus","offset":910},{"uri":"York%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"York","offset":946},{"uri":"Pennsylvania_Route_295","surface_form":"Pennsylvania Route 295","offset":961},{"uri":"Valley_Green_Township%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Valley Green","offset":1087},{"uri":"Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Harrisburg","offset":1130},{"uri":"Interstate_76_(east)","surface_form":"Interstate 76","offset":1186},{"uri":"Pennsylvania_Turnpike","surface_form":"Pennsylvania Turnpike","offset":1205},{"uri":"New_Cumberland_Township%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"New Cumberland","offset":1285},{"uri":"Pennsylvania_Route_581","surface_form":"Pennsylvania Route 581","offset":1321},{"uri":"Lemoyne%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Lemoyne","offset":1347},{"uri":"Susquehanna_River","surface_form":"Susquehanna River","offset":1487},{"uri":"John_Harris_Bridge","surface_form":"John Harris Bridge","offset":1514},{"uri":"Downtown_Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"central business district","offset":1556},{"uri":"Interstate_81","surface_form":"Interstate 81","offset":1614},{"uri":"Interstate_283_(Pennsylvania)","surface_form":"Interstate 283","offset":1677},{"uri":"Interstate_76_(east)","surface_form":"Interstate 76","offset":1708},{"uri":"Pennsylvania_Route_283","surface_form":"PA 283","offset":1726},{"uri":"Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Harrisburg","offset":1746}]}
