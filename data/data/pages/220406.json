One website has been known to help people learn Na'vi.\nHistory.\nThe first Na'vi words were made by the professor Paul Frommer in 2005 for the film. When they released the movie in 2009, the vocabulary increased to a thousand words despite the understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator.\nMany people are learning the language. Websites like \"Learn Na'vi\" have many learning materials and a forum to learn with others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":24},{"uri":"Na%27vi","surface_form":"Na'vi","offset":55},{"uri":"Avatar","surface_form":"Avatar","offset":79},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":333},{"uri":"Paul_Frommer","surface_form":"Paul Frommer","offset":343},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":401}]}
