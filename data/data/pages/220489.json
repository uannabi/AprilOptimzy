{"id":220489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Doom 3\" (or \"Doom III\" in roman numerals), is a sequel to the first-person shooter game \"Doom 2\". It was created by iD Software, and came out in 2004. It was the first to not be based on the same game engine as \"Doom\" and \"Doom 2\", and had 40 levels. Even though the game is named \"Doom 3\", the game is not a direct sequel, which means the story does not take place after \"Doom\" or \"Doom 2\". In fact, it is a reboot of the first \"Doom\", which means it is a new start to the Doom story. \"Doom 3\" has a very dark environment, and the player carries a flashlight to light the way, although the flashlight can't be used at the same time as the weapons. However, this feature changed the BFG Edition, where the player does not carry the flashlight like a weapon, but the player can use at any time during gameplay. That being said, the player must be careful not to use the flashlight too long, because the flashlight will automatically turn off after it runs after battery, and the player must wait for the battery to recharge before using the flashlight again. The game had two expansions, Resurrection of Evil and Lost Mission.\nOther websites.\n[http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_3 Doom 3 on the Doom Wiki]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_numerals","surface_form":"roman numerals","offset":40},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":62},{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"first-person shooter","offset":76},{"uri":"Doom_2","surface_form":"Doom 2","offset":103},{"uri":"ID_Software","surface_form":"iD Software","offset":130},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":159},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"direct sequel","offset":323},{"uri":"Reboot_(fiction)","surface_form":"reboot","offset":423},{"uri":"Flashlight","surface_form":"flashlight","offset":563},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapons","offset":654},{"uri":"Automation","surface_form":"automatically","offset":932}]}
