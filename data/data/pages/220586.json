{"id":220586,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornitholestes","text":"\"Ornitholestes\" was a carnivorous dinosaur which lived in the Upper Jurassic period about 156145 million years ago. It was about 2 metres long (6.6 feet), half of which was its long tail. Only one specimen of it has ever been found.\nIt is one of a group of small, fast-running dinosaurs which are classified as early Coelurosaurs. It is known from a partial skeleton found near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1900. It was described by paleontologist Henry F. Osborn in 1903.\nDescription.\n\"Ornitholestes\" was a bipedal runner. Its small head suggests it ate small mammals, lizards, frogs, and hatchling dinosaurs. It could grasp prey with both hands. It is likely that all coelurosaurs had feathers.\nSimilar dinosaurs.\n\"Coelurus\", \"Compsognathus\", \"Tanycolagreus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":22},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":34},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"Upper Jurassic","offset":62},{"uri":"Coelurosaur","surface_form":"Coelurosaur","offset":317},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":358},{"uri":"Medicine_Bow","surface_form":"Medicine Bow","offset":378},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":392},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":430},{"uri":"Henry_Fairfield_Osborn","surface_form":"Henry F.
