{"id":220624,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length","text":"=\"preserve\">The Planck length () is a very small unit of length. It is calculated from three physical constants: the speed of light, the Planck constant, and the gravitational constant.\nIt is about or about 10\u221220 times the size of a proton. It is one of the Planck units, defined by Max Planck. It is an important length for quantum gravity because it may be the size of the smallest black holes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physical_constant","surface_form":"physical constant","offset":93},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":117},{"uri":"Planck_constant","surface_form":"Planck constant","offset":137},{"uri":"Gravitational_constant","surface_form":"gravitational constant","offset":162},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":233},{"uri":"Planck_units","surface_form":"Planck units","offset":258},{"uri":"Max_Planck","surface_form":"Max Planck","offset":283},{"uri":"Quantum_gravity","surface_form":"quantum gravity","offset":325},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black holes","offset":384}]}
