{"id":220671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea","text":"The Ionian Sea is an arm of the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Adriatic Sea. It is bordered by southern Italy like Calabria, Sicily and the Salento peninsula to the west, and by southwestern Albania. Most of the islands are Greek, including Corfu, Zante, Kephalonia, Ithaka, and Lefkas to the east. The islands are most of the time referred to as the Ionian Islands. The sea is one of the most seismically active areas in the world.\nThere are ferry routes between Patras, Greece and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":32},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":64},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":105},{"uri":"Albania","surface_form":"Albania","offset":192},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":225},{"uri":"Corfu","surface_form":"Corfu","offset":242},{"uri":"Zante","surface_form":"Zante","offset":249},{"uri":"Kephalonia","surface_form":"Kephalonia","offset":256},{"uri":"Ithaka","surface_form":"Ithaka","offset":268},{"uri":"Lefkas","surface_form":"Lefkas","offset":280},{"uri":"Seismically_active","surface_form":"seismically active","offset":395}]}
