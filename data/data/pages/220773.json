{"id":220773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_the_Genius","text":"\"Bart the Genius\" is the second episode of the first season of \"The Simpsons\", which was first shown on the Fox network on January 14, 1990. It was the first episode written by Jon Vitti. It was also the first ever episode to use the signature title sequence, as well as the first normal episode. The episode has Bart Simpson's experiences of life as a smarty-pants after he cheats on an intelligence test. It is the first episode that uses Bart's catchphrase \"Eat my shorts.\" As the second episode was made, right after the bad animation of \"Some Enchanted Evening,\" the future of the series relied on how the animation turned out on this episode. The animation proved to be more acceptable and production continued.\nThe episode starts with the Simpson family playing Scrabble. Bart plays the word \"kwyjibo\", which is not a real word.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Simpsons_(season_1)","surface_form":"first season","offset":47},{"uri":"The_Simpsons","surface_form":"The Simpsons","offset":64},{"uri":"Experience","surface_form":"experiences","offset":328},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"intelligence","offset":388},{"uri":"Scrabble","surface_form":"Scrabble","offset":769}]}
