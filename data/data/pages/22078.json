{"id":22078,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory","text":"=\"preserve\">Computability theory is part of computer science. Scientists want to know what can be computed, and what can not.\nThere is a model of a computer that is used for this. It is called the Turing machine. A Turing machine basically is a special typewriter with an endless ribbon. The machine is named after the mathematician Alan Turing.\nA problem is \"computable\" if it can be expressed in such a way that a Turing machine can solve it.\nOne of the best known examples is the Halting problem. The task is to write a program which says for all programs whether they will finally stop. This is impossible to decide. Mathematicians say the problem is undecidable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":44},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"Scientist","offset":62},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":148},{"uri":"Turing_machine","surface_form":"Turing machine","offset":197},{"uri":"Typewriter","surface_form":"typewriter","offset":253},{"uri":"Ribbon","surface_form":"ribbon","offset":280},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":319},{"uri":"Alan_Turing","surface_form":"Alan Turing","offset":333},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":348},{"uri":"Halting_problem","surface_form":"Halting problem","offset":483},{"uri":"Undecidable","surface_form":"undecidable","offset":655}]}
