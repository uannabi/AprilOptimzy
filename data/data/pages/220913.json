{"id":220913,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa","text":"Anthozoa are a class in the phylum Cnidaria. It includes the sea anemones and the corals. It is a monophyletic clade, one of two in the Cnidaria. The other is the Medusozoa.\nThe class does not have a medusa larval stage in its development, unlike the rest of the phylum. Like all Cnidaria, their food-catching and defense are done by nematocysts, which are extremely effective stinging cells. Over 6,100 species have been described.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":15},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":28},{"uri":"Cnidaria","surface_form":"Cnidaria","offset":35},{"uri":"Sea_anemone","surface_form":"sea anemone","offset":61},{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":82},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":98},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":111},{"uri":"Medusozoa","surface_form":"Medusozoa","offset":163},{"uri":"Medusa_(animal)","surface_form":"medusa","offset":200},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":207},{"uri":"Nematocyst","surface_form":"nematocyst","offset":334},{"uri":"Sting","surface_form":"sting","offset":377}]}
