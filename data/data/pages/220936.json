{"id":220936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos","text":"Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 \u2013 September 28, 1989) was a Filipino politician and lawyer. He was President (1965-1986) and Prime Minister (1978-1981) of the Republic of the Philippines. He is a polarizing historical figure in both Philippines and the world. Marcos established an authoritarian regime that came under criticism for corruption and for its suppression of democratic processes and dictatorial nature. On the other hand, he achieved accomplishments most notably in infrastructure.\nEarly life.\nFerdinand Edralin Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. His parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin, were both teachers from important families. He studied law at the University of the Philippines and later on top the bar examinations for lawyers., during which he was accused of assassinating his father's political rival. He represented himself as his own lawyer and he was later acquitted by the Supreme Court.\nDuring World War II, Marcos claimed that he had been the leader of \"Ang Maharlika\", guerrilla force in northern Luzon. After the war, he was Ilocos Norte Representative (1949-1959) and as Senator of the Philippines (1958-1965). He was also Senate President (1963-1965) and then went on to become the President of the Philippines. However, in other side, he may be the one of the most corrupt leaders such as Suharto or Kim Il-Sung or Kim Jong Il due to atrocities. A few years later, national problems like the insurgency by the communist movement and rebellion arose during his presidency: He declared Martial Law in September 1972 to institute peace and order and discipline. His style of leadership soon became dictatorial. Government greed, government bullying, despotism, nepotism, and violation of human rights abuses were abundant. The nation's masses who went against the government were sent to prison, tortured, raped or killed. People could not express themselves freely unless it was in favor of the Marcos family.\nIn 1983, he was accused in the assassination of his main rival and challenger, politician Benigno Aquino, Jr. but until today the killer remain unknown. The death of Benigno Aquino, Jr. caused many events, like a wrongful president vote. People became angry after and kicked him out with the help of the US during the peaceful EDSA revolution in February 1986.\nHe and his wife Imelda Marcos were accused to have stolen billions of dollars of government funds and had it secretly sent to bank accounts in the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into fake companies under his name. However, until today Imelda Marcos was never sent to prison nor found guilty of stealing billions of dollars of government money and she remains free and was even elected in congress representing her home province of Leyte. Her son Ferdinand Marcos was back into politics and became a senator of the Philippines while her daughter Imee Marcos is currently the governor of Ilocos Norte.\nBy 1983 Marcos\u2019s health was beginning to fail, and opposition to his rule was growing. Hoping to present an alternative to both Marcos and the increasingly powerful New People\u2019s Army, Benigno Aquino, Jr., returned to Manila on August 21, 1983, only to be shot dead as he stepped off the airplane. The assassination was seen as the work of the government and touched off massive antigovernment protests. An independent commission appointed by Marcos concluded in 1984 that high military officers were responsible for Aquino\u2019s assassination. To reassert his mandate, Marcos called for presidential elections to be held in 1986. But a formidable political opponent soon emerged in Aquino\u2019s widow, Corazon Aquino, who became the presidential candidate of the opposition. It was widely asserted that Marcos managed to defeat Aquino and retain the presidency in the election of February 7, 1986, only through massive voting fraud on the part of Marcos' supporters. Deeply discredited at home and abroad by his dubious electoral victory, Marcos held fast to his presidency as the Philippine military split between supporters of his and of Aquino\u2019s legitimate right to the presidency. A tense standoff that ensued between the two sides ended only when Marcos fled the country on February 25, 1986, at U.S. urging. He went into exile in Hawaii, where he remained until his death.\nEvidence emerged that during his years in power Marcos, his family, and his close associates had looted the Philippines\u2019 economy of billions of dollars through embezzlements and other corrupt practices. Marcos and his wife were subsequently indicted by the U.S. government on racketeering charges, but in 1990 (after Marcos\u2019s death) Imelda was acquitted of all charges by a federal court. She was allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991, and in 1993 a Philippine court found her guilty of corruption (the conviction was overturned in 1998).\nWorse than death: Torture methods during martial law.\nDuring the Marcos regime, San Juanico Bridge did not just refer to the longest bridge in the country. It had a far more sinister meaning.\nLiliosa Hilao, or Lilli to friends, was a consistent honor student and scholar of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM). The communication arts student, an active member of different student organizations, was due to graduate \"cum laude.\"\nHer weak health did not stop her from being an active student leader. She was editor-in-chief of HASIK, PLM\u2019s student publication that openly criticized the Marcos administration. Lilli was too sickly to rally on the streets and channeled her strength through her pen, writing thoughtful essays against the dictator\u2019s regime.\nAt 23, Lilli made it to history books and publications, but not because of her academic excellence nor her writing talent. She was the first female and student activist to die in detention during martial rule.\nLilli suffered a fate worse than death.\nDrunken soldiers from the Constabulary Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU) beat up Lilli and took her to Camp Crame. She was eventually found dead in the detention center. CANU reported she committed suicide by drinking muriatic acid, but her body showed signs of torture: her lips bore cigarette burns, her arms had injection marks, and her body was full of bruises. According to her sister, her internal organs were removed to cover signs of torture and possible sexual abuse.\nLilli\u2019s tragedy is just one of the many stories of torture during the Marcos regime.\nWorse than death.\nAmnesty International (AI) has estimated that during martial law, 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed. The AI mission, which visited the Philippines from November to December 1975, found that 71 of the 107 prisoners interviewed alleged that they had been tortured.\nHistorian Michael Charleston Chua published a study entitled, \"TORTYUR: Human Rights Violations During The Marcos Regime,\" that detailed the different kinds of torture used by authorities during this dark chapter in Philippine history, as recounted by victims and published in different reports.\nOther forms of torture.\nTorture during martial law also came in non-physical forms. Chua noted that the regime also inflicted psychological and emotional torture to \"shake one\u2019s principle.\" This is done through solitary confinement and isolation. Some reported mental torture by threats of imminent death, rape, and harm to their families.\nStories of sexual abuse were also prevalent inside detention centers. Women were stripped naked, made to sit on ice blocks, stand in cold rooms, and raped and sexually assaulted using objects such as eggplants smeared with chili peppers.\nFinal years and death.\nDuring the people Power EDSA revolution he was flown to Hawaii by a US plane instead of going to his hometown Paoay, Ilocos Norte. President Marcos died in Hawaii of heart, kidney and lung diseases. He was brought back to the Philippines and his remains still lie in a refrigerated crypt in Batac, Ilocos Norte until today because the current administration refuses to grant the former president a burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani where other former presidents of the Philippines who died are buried.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":121},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":147},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Republic of the Philippines.","offset":181},{"uri":"Ilocos_Norte","surface_form":"Ilocos Norte","offset":597},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":611},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":991},{"uri":"Guerilla","surface_form":"guerrilla force","offset":1068},{"uri":"Suharto","surface_form":"Suharto","offset":1392},{"uri":"Kim_Il-Sung","surface_form":"Kim Il-Sung","offset":1403},{"uri":"Kim_Jong_Il","surface_form":"Kim Jong Il","offset":1418},{"uri":"Greed","surface_form":"greed","offset":1722},{"uri":"Despotism","surface_form":"despotism","offset":1750},{"uri":"Nepotism","surface_form":"nepotism","offset":1761},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":1788},{"uri":"Imelda_Marcos","surface_form":"Imelda Marcos","offset":2388},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2519},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":2534},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":7760}]}
