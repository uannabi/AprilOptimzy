A documentary may be a video or audio recording, such as a movie or radio program.\nThe purpose of a documentary is to tell the story behind the news. News programs tell what has happened, documentaries explain why and how something happened.

Or, between the result of a sporting event and a discussion of how and why the result happened.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Non-fiction","surface_form":"non-fiction","offset":48},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":133},{"uri":"Audio","surface_form":"audio","offset":142},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":169},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":178}]}
