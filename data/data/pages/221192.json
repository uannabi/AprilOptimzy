It lived during the Upper Cretaceous period, 69.5-68.5\u00A0million years ago, toward the end of the Mesozoic Era.\n\"Saurolophus\" had a 5 inch (13 cm) long bony spike extending up from its forehead. There is speculation that this spike was attached to a flap of skin that covered the nostrils and could be blown up for displays and noise-making. Many \"Saurolophus\" fossils have been found, including one with fossilized skin impressions, in Alberta, Canada and Mongolia, China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":20},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":32},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":62},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic Era","offset":138},{"uri":"Forehead","surface_form":"forehead","offset":225},{"uri":"Noise","surface_form":"noise","offset":368},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":477},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":486},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":497},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":507}]}
