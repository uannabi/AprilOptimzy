About 538,544 people live in the city of Portland, and about 1,927,881 people live in the city's metropolitan area. It is found in the north part of the state, where the Willamette River meets the Columbia River. Portland has the second most people of any city in the Northwest United States, after the city of Seattle.\nPortland has many nicknames. One of these is \"The City of Roses,\" because roses grow well there. Some other nicknames of Portland are \"Stumptown\" (from the fact that Portland was built over a forest), and \"Puddletown\" (from the fact that it often rains in Portland).\nMany things are from Portland. Some of these things are Powell's Books, Beverly Cleary (and some of her most popular fictional characters, Henry Huggins and Ramona Quimby, which also have statues in the city's \"Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children\"), and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":36},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":50},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":68},{"uri":"Multnomah_County","surface_form":"Multnomah County","offset":83},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":134},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":198},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":236},{"uri":"Willamette_River","surface_form":"Willamette River","offset":271},{"uri":"Columbia_River","surface_form":"Columbia River","offset":298},{"uri":"Northwest","surface_form":"Northwest","offset":369},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":379},{"uri":"Seattle%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":412},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":439},{"uri":"Rose","surface_form":"rose","offset":495},{"uri":"Powell%27s_Books","surface_form":"Powell's Books","offset":744},{"uri":"Beverly_Cleary","surface_form":"Beverly Cleary","offset":760},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":805},{"uri":"Portland_Trail_Blazers","surface_form":"Portland Trail Blazers","offset":955}]}
