A runner is a stolon which runs on the ground; a rhizome is the same thing, but running underground. Rhizome can be found in Ginger,Turmeric,Banana,Dryopteris\nPlants with stolons or stolon-like rhizomes are called \"stoloniferous\". A stolon is a plant propagation strategy. At nodes, rootlets are put down and new stems are put up. All these plant forms are clones from a single genetic individual.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":31},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":54},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":65},{"uri":"Plant_propagation","surface_form":"plant propagation","offset":356},{"uri":"Node","surface_form":"node","offset":387},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":394},{"uri":"Clone","surface_form":"clone","offset":468},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genetic","offset":489}]}
