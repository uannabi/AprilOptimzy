They are New World monkeys, and are found in forests along the Amazon River, and in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Unlike other monkeys, woolly monkeys are most likely to be found on the ground. They move much more slowly than other monkeys do, too.\nFood and habits.\nWoolly monkeys eat fruit, flowers, and leaves. They are quite tame, and they live in groups or bands of 10 to 30 monkeys. When frightened, woolly monkeys tend to swing through tree branches and hide. They are friendly and are often seen in the company of other kind of monkeys. When they walk on the ground, they stand straight up, and use their tails for support. They are quite harmless creatures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_World_monkeys","surface_form":"New World monkeys","offset":64},{"uri":"Amazon_River","surface_form":"Amazon River","offset":118},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":139},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":149},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":161},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":338},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":345},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":358},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":665}]}
