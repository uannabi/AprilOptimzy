The colorful puffleg population is estimated as about 250\u2013999 adult birds.\nThese colorful birds were first found in 1967 by photographer John Dunning who was below Cerro Munchique when he caught the colorful puffleg. He described it as a \"miraculous bird\".\nThe male has a shining green head, chest, and upper belly. He has brighter patches of green on his forehead. Both sexes has a bright blue belly, a red and yellow tail, and white feet. The feet have a light cinnamon brown color on them.\nIn 2005, Swarovski donated funds which allowed the American Bird Conservancy and Fundaci\u00F3n ProAves to create a reserve for this species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":62},{"uri":"Hummingbird","surface_form":"hummingbird","offset":73},{"uri":"Endemic","surface_form":"endemic","offset":85},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":96},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":196},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":230},{"uri":"Swarovski","surface_form":"Swarovski","offset":608},{"uri":"American_Bird_Conservancy","surface_form":"American Bird Conservancy","offset":650},{"uri":"Fundaci%C3%B3n_ProAves","surface_form":"Fundaci\u00F3n ProAves","offset":680}]}
