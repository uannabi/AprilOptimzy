A village was begun, called \"Nuestra Se\u00F1ora del Rosario de Nacozari\" ('Our Lady of the Rosary of Nacozari').\nThe mines were owned by the Anglo American U.B. Teader mining company in 1867. They later sold them to the Moctezuma Copper Co., which part of the Phelps Dodge company. American-style houses were built. A library and a small hospital were also built. When the mines were opened, copper was carried by mules. In 1904 the railroad was built, so the copper was moved by train. By 1907, Nacozari had become the metropolis of far northeastern Sonora. The population was 5,000 people, mostly Mexicans and Americans, with some Chinese people. Phelps kept the mines until 1948 when the copper had all been taken out.\nA large mine, La Caridad, was found about southeast of Nacozari in 1968. By 1979, the population of Nacozari was about 3,000 again. The federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop La Caridad (which was also called Mexicana de Cobre). They also re-opened other mines in the area. Nacozari was estimated to have a population of 18,600 people in 1986, and 30,000 in 1989. La Caridad is ranked the third largest copper mine in the world.\nThe town was first called Placeritos de Nacozari but changed its name to Nacozari de Garc\u00EDa. The town was named after the railroad engineer Jes\u00FAs Garc\u00EDa, who saved the town from a dynamite explosion on 7 November 1907. There are monuments to Jes\u00FAs Garc\u00EDa in many other Mexican cities and towns. November 7 is the Day of the Railroader in Mexico. Everybody who works on the railroad has a day off from work, apart from essential employees of the National Railways of Mexico. Many streets in Mexico are named Jes\u00FAs Garc\u00EDa or the \"H\u00E9roe de Nacozari\". Poems and songs have been written about him and about the accident.\nThe name Nacozari is an word from the language of the Opata people who used to live in the area. It means \"a lot of nopal (the fruit of the Prickly pear)\".\nHow the town earns money.\nThe main source of income is from the copper mine of Mina Mexicana de Cobre, S.A de C.V, which employs most of the labor force (3,012 workers in 2000).\nCattle raising is also important with 16,375 cattle counted in the 2000 census. Calves are exported to the United States of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":43},{"uri":"Nacozari_de_Garc%C3%ADa_(municipality)","surface_form":"municipal area","offset":73},{"uri":"Mexican_state","surface_form":"Mexican state","offset":112},{"uri":"Sonora","surface_form":"Sonora","offset":129},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":174},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":316},{"uri":"Mexican_Federal_Highway_17","surface_form":"Federal Highway 17","offset":375},{"uri":"Agua_Prieta","surface_form":"Agua Prieta","offset":410},{"uri":"Hermosillo","surface_form":"Hermosillo","offset":427},{"uri":"Aguq_Prieta","surface_form":"Aguq Prieta","offset":497},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":514},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":592},{"uri":"Sierra_Madre_Occidental","surface_form":"Sierra Madre Occidental","offset":623},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":669},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":702},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_Bavispe","surface_form":"R\u00EDo Bavispe","offset":714},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":765},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mines","offset":799},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":821},{"uri":"Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","surface_form":"Our Lady","offset":890},{"uri":"Rosary","surface_form":"Rosary","offset":906},{"uri":"Mule","surface_form":"mule","offset":1229},{"uri":"Metropolis","surface_form":"metropolis","offset":1335},{"uri":"Sonora","surface_form":"Sonora","offset":1366},{"uri":"Federal_republic","surface_form":"federal government","offset":1673},{"uri":"Jes%C3%BAs_Garc%C3%ADa","surface_form":"Jes\u00FAs Garc\u00EDa","offset":2135},{"uri":"National_Railways_of_Mexico","surface_form":"National Railways of Mexico","offset":2440},{"uri":"Nopal","surface_form":"nopal","offset":2727},{"uri":"Prickly_pear","surface_form":"Prickly pear","offset":2751},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":2812},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":3052}]}
