{"id":221660,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Max","text":"Big Max is a type of squash that can grow to be more than 100 pounds. They can also be in diameter if they are grown properly. They are commonly called pumpkins, but this is not entirely correct; Big Max are instead \"squash-type pumpkins\". They have a bright orange color, with fine-grained, yellow-orange flesh. The skin has deep lines in it and is slightly roughened, and can be up to thick. This makes Big Max squash good for keeping. The flesh is good for being canned and frozen.\nHowever, because they are so big, cooking with these squash is hard. They are said to not be as flavorful as smaller pumpkin varieties. The variety was hybridized, or created, for its large size. They have been grown as big as 300 pounds. Individual fruits are round to slightly flattened.\nGrowing.\nThese squash are best planted between two and four weeks after the average last frost, and they become ripe 110 to 120 days after being planted. The plants need lots of room to grow well, and to get them very big, only one fruit should be grown on one vine. They are harvested before the first light frost, when the plant's leaves die. Although recommendations are different, seeds are often planted at deep, spaced apart.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Squash_(plant)","surface_form":"squash","offset":21},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":90},{"uri":"Pumpkin","surface_form":"pumpkin","offset":152},{"uri":"Can","surface_form":"can","offset":466},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybridized","offset":637},{"uri":"Frost","surface_form":"frost","offset":864},{"uri":"Recommendation","surface_form":"recommendations","offset":1129}]}
