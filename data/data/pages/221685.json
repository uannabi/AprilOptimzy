{"id":221685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_dormouse","text":"The edible dormouse or fat dormouse (\"Glis glis\") is a small dormouse and the only species in the genus \"Glis\".\nFat dormice are the largest dormice in Europe. The ancient Romans used to breed them to be eaten (usually as a snack). This is the reason for the word \"edible\" in its name. The dormice were kept in large pits or in terra cotta containers (which were called \"gliraria\"), which were like modern hamster cages.\nWild edible dormice are still eaten in Slovenia, and trapping dormice is a Slovenian tradition. Using dormice for food and fur is mentioned in documents which were written in the 13th century. They also mention the use of dormouse fat as a medicine. Poor and hungry peasants would eat dormice during winter because it is a good protein source.\nThe edible dormouse lives in Europe. It was accidentally introduced to the town of Tring in England after some dormice escaped from the private collection of Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1902. The British edible dormouse population is about 10,000 and is found in a triangle between Beaconsfield, Aylesbury and Luton.\nThis animal is seen as a pest by some people. In the United Kingdom the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 does not allow some ways of killing them, and to remove the dormice from the area may require a license.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dormouse","surface_form":"dormouse","offset":61},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":83},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":98},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Romans","offset":163},{"uri":"Snack","surface_form":"snack","offset":223},{"uri":"Pit","surface_form":"pit","offset":316},{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"terra cotta","offset":327},{"uri":"Glirarium","surface_form":"gliraria","offset":370},{"uri":"Hamster","surface_form":"hamster","offset":405},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":459},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":505},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":543},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":599},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":660},{"uri":"Peasant","surface_form":"peasant","offset":686},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":748},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":793},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":808},{"uri":"Introduced_species","surface_form":"introduced","offset":821},{"uri":"Tring","surface_form":"Tring","offset":847},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":856},{"uri":"Private","surface_form":"private","offset":900},{"uri":"Collection","surface_form":"collection","offset":908},{"uri":"Lionel_Walter_Rothschild","surface_form":"Lionel Walter Rothschild","offset":922},{"uri":"Beaconsfield","surface_form":"Beaconsfield","offset":1046},{"uri":"Aylesbury","surface_form":"Aylesbury","offset":1060},{"uri":"Luton","surface_form":"Luton","offset":1074},{"uri":"Pest_(organism)","surface_form":"pest","offset":1106},{"uri":"Wildlife_and_Countryside_Act_1981","surface_form":"Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981","offset":1153},{"uri":"License","surface_form":"license","offset":1283}]}
