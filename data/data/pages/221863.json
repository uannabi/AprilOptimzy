This holds the record of being the world's largest octopus: direct measurements were made of a live 71\u00A0kg (156.5\u00A0lb) individual. This octopus had a total length near to 4\u00A0m (13\u00A0ft).\nThe remaining members of the genus are much smaller. \"E. megalocyathus\" has an average weight of 4\u00A0kg and a total length of 1 m. \"E. magnificus\" has a total length of around 1.5 m.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"octopus","offset":75},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":99},{"uri":"Enteroctopus_dofleini","surface_form":"Enteroctopus dofleini","offset":345}]}
