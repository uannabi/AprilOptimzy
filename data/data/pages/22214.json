It means \"strength\", \"authority\", or \"rulership\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain Muslim rulers who claimed full sovereignty. They did not have to take orders from any higher monarch, without claiming the overall caliphate.\nThe dynasty and lands ruled by the Sultan is called a sultanate.
