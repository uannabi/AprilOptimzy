{"id":222195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Dollman","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Captain John Guy Dollman BA, FLS (1886-1942) (who was known as Guy Dollman) was a British zoologist and taxonomist. Dollman's Tree Mouse and Dollman's Vlei Rat are named after him.\nLife and work.\nGuy Dollman was the eldest son of the artist John Charles Dollman. He was born on 4 September 1886 and went to St Paul's School. He later went to St John's College Cambridge. In February 1907, when he was still a student, he was employed by the Department of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History). He spent most of his working life there as Assistant Keeper of Mammals.\nIn 1912, on an expedition to Vietnam, he discovered and named the Tonkin Snub-nosed Langur. He joined the British Army in 1915, and obtained a commission in the 19th London Regiment. He was injured in a bomb accident so he did not fight in the First World War.\nIn 1919, he returned to the museum. He was an adviser to the British group at the 1933 International Conference for the Preservation of the Flora and Fauna of Africa. This was the most important meeting about protecting nature before the Second World War. Dollman helped to decide which animal species needed protecting.\nHe travelled and wrote a lot with Walter Rothschild. Some of their writing included \"New mammals from Dutch New Guinea\" (which was published in 1932) and a book about tree kangaroos which was called \"The Genus Dendrolagus\" (which was published in 1936). He was also a very good artist, showing pictures at the Royal Academy. He also drew pictures for his own scientific writings.\nDollman died on 21 March 1942 when he was 65 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linnean_Society_of_London","surface_form":"FLS","offset":43},{"uri":"Zoologist","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":104},{"uri":"Linnaean_taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomist","offset":118},{"uri":"Dollman%27s_Tree_Mouse","surface_form":"Dollman's Tree Mouse","offset":130},{"uri":"Dollman%27s_Vlei_Rat","surface_form":"Dollman's Vlei Rat","offset":155},{"uri":"John_Charles_Dollman","surface_form":"John Charles Dollman","offset":255},{"uri":"St_Paul%27s_School_(London)","surface_form":"St Paul's School","offset":321},{"uri":"St_John%27s_College_Cambridge","surface_form":"St John's College Cambridge","offset":356},{"uri":"British_Museum_(Natural_History)","surface_form":"British Museum (Natural History)","offset":484},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":619},{"uri":"Tonkin_Snub-nosed_Langur","surface_form":"Tonkin Snub-nosed Langur","offset":656},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":696},{"uri":"Commission","surface_form":"commission","offset":733},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":834},{"uri":"Adviser","surface_form":"adviser","offset":897},{"uri":"Walter_Rothschild","surface_form":"Walter Rothschild","offset":1206},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":1450},{"uri":"Royal_Academy","surface_form":"Royal Academy","offset":1482}]}
