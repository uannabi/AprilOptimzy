{"id":222225,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole","text":"The centriole is a cytoplasmic structure in most eukaryote cells. It is involved in cell division and in the formation of cilia and flagella. Centrioles are not found in vascular plants and in most fungi.\nMost centrioles are nine sets of microtubule triplets, arranged in a cylinder. A pair of centrioles, arranged perpendicularly and surrounded by a mass of dense material makes up the centrosome.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cytoplasm","surface_form":"cytoplasm","offset":19},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":49},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":59},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":84},{"uri":"Cilia","surface_form":"cilia","offset":122},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":132},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":170},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":198},{"uri":"Perpendicual","surface_form":"perpendicularly","offset":315},{"uri":"Centrosome","surface_form":"centrosome","offset":387}]}
