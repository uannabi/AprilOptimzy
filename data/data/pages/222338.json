{"id":222338,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizobia","text":"Rhizobia are soil bacteria which become established inside root nodules of legumes (the pea family: Fabaceae).\nThey fix nitrogen in a form the plant can use. Rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. The relationship is a classic example of symbiosis and mutualism.\nThe word rhizobia comes from the English root for root (rhizo) and the Ancient Greek for life (bios).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":13},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":18},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":59},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":88},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Fabaceae","offset":100},{"uri":"Nitrogen_fixation","surface_form":"fix","offset":116},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":120},{"uri":"Symbiosis","surface_form":"symbiosis","offset":270},{"uri":"Mutualism","surface_form":"mutualism","offset":284}]}
