He was born in Bluefield, West Virginia.

He studied at Princeton University and at Carnegie Institute of Technology.\nCareer.\nThis work led to \"Nash embedding theorem\": \"Two real algebraic manifolds are equivalent if and only if they are analytically homeomorphic.\" [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NashsEmbeddingTheorem.html]\nPersonal life.\nHe is best known in popular culture as the subject of the Hollywood movie, \"A Beautiful Mind\", about his mathematical genius and his struggles with schizophrenia, with which he was diagnosed.\nNash married Alicia Lopez-Harrison de Lard\u00E9 in 1957.
