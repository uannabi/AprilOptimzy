IGN stated that without the anime, the character would not have been as famous, further describing it as \"probably the funniest part of the show\". However, another editor stated it was also popular amongst people who have never seen the anime due to being a feline. IGN also said that Meowth would make a good choice as a playable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" \"if Brawl's developers really wanted much more representation for Pok\u00E9mon as a franchise\" also stating \"it would be fun to face him in battle as a real fighter, just to be able to send him \"blasting off again,\" referencing Team Rocket's Meowth GamesRadar described Meowth as \"not all that useful\", and questioned if the Pok\u00E9mon would have stood out if it were not for its portrayal in the anime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":24},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":36},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue","surface_form":"\"Pok\u00E9mon Red\" and \"Blue\"","offset":91},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)","surface_form":"\"Pok\u00E9mon\" anime","offset":206},{"uri":"Team_Rocket","surface_form":"Team Rocket","offset":252},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Mystery Dungeon","offset":1052},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":1110},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Snap","offset":1127},{"uri":"Nintendo_GameCube","surface_form":"Nintendo GameCube","offset":1145},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Channel","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Channel","offset":1169},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._(series)","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros. series","offset":1226},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9_Ball","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9 Ball","offset":1276},{"uri":"Team_Rocket","surface_form":"Team Rocket","offset":1454},{"uri":"Ash_Ketchum","surface_form":"Ash","offset":1951},{"uri":"Pikachu","surface_form":"Pikachu","offset":1957},{"uri":"Puss_in_Boots","surface_form":"Puss in Boots","offset":2025},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Adventures","offset":2063},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Trading Card Game","offset":2242},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Trading Card Video Game","offset":2344},{"uri":"IGN","surface_form":"IGN","offset":2845},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.
