{"id":222644,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night","text":"Night or nighttime is the time when the Sun is not in the sky. Night happens after dusk and before dawn. The opposite of night is day. The start and end times of night are different in different geographic locations. It varies on season, latitude, longitude and timezone.\nIn other time zones, the night occurs at different times. This is because the Sun shines on different parts of the Earth at different times. During a solar eclipse it is also partially night because the Sun is blocked out by the Moon.\nIn popular culture, night is often thought of as a symbol of evil, possibly because of the fear of the dark or possibly because of the lack of visibility.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":26},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":40},{"uri":"Dusk","surface_form":"dusk","offset":83},{"uri":"Dawn","surface_form":"dawn","offset":99},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":130},{"uri":"Vary","surface_form":"varies","offset":220},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":230},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":238},{"uri":"Longitude","surface_form":"longitude","offset":248},{"uri":"Timezone","surface_form":"timezone","offset":262},{"uri":"Time_zone","surface_form":"time zone","offset":281},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":350},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":387},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":406},{"uri":"Solar_eclipse","surface_form":"solar eclipse","offset":422},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":475},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":501},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":558}]}
