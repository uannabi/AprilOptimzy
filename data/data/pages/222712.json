{"id":222712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English","text":"Basic English (Business Academic Scientific International Commercial) is a controlled language used to explain complex thoughts. It has 850 basic English words chosen by Charles Kay Ogden. Some articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use only Basic English.\nIn 1936, Ogden hired Otto and Marie Neurath to make \"International Picture Language\" as one of a group of eight books in Basic English.\nRules of word use.\nThe word use of Basic English is simpler and more regular than the word use of normal English. In normal English, words often have a number of different meanings. To make Basic English easier, not all the meanings of a word are used.\nBasic English uses Ogden's rules of grammar. Ogden's rules of grammar let people use the 850 words to talk about things and events simply.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Controlled_language","surface_form":"controlled language","offset":75},{"uri":"Basic_English_ordered_wordlist","surface_form":"850 basic English words","offset":136},{"uri":"Charles_Kay_Ogden","surface_form":"Charles Kay Ogden","offset":170},{"uri":"Simple_English_Wikipedia","surface_form":"Simple English Wikipedia","offset":210},{"uri":"Otto_Neurath","surface_form":"Otto","offset":280},{"uri":"Marie_Neurath","surface_form":"Marie Neurath","offset":289},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"word use","offset":418},{"uri":"Regular","surface_form":"regular","offset":464},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":500},{"uri":"Meaning","surface_form":"meaning","offset":567},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":684},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":710}]}
