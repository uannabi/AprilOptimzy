{"id":222841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heusenstamm","text":"Heusenstamm is a city in the Offenbach Rural District in the state of Hesse, Germany.\nGeography.\nHeusenstamm is in the \"rhein main region\" 20\u00A0km southeast of Frankfurt. The whole area of the town is 19,03\u00A0km2 large and is 130 m above sea level. It is a plain area with no hills.\nAbout 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.\nThe city consists out of 2 urban districts, the town of Heusenstamm and the former independent village, \"Rembr\u00FCcken\", which became on 1th of January 1977 part of Heusenstamm.\nThe climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.\nThe local people are speaking a regional type (dialect) of the German language with a certain tone and special words. It is spoken in the south of Hesse, named \"hessisch\". This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation.\nHistory.\nIn the 13th century the names of Heusenstamm and Rembr\u00FCcken were written down in documents for the first time.\nFormerly the people in the Heusenstamm area were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the rhein main region got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing, also chemical processing. Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Offenbach_Rural_District","surface_form":"Offenbach Rural District","offset":29},{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse","offset":70},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":77},{"uri":"Frankfurt","surface_form":"Frankfurt","offset":158},{"uri":"Tertiary","surface_form":"tertiary","offset":326},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":461},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":889},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":912},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":1251},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":1376},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":1567},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":1579},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":1597},{"uri":"Industrial_revolution","surface_form":"industrial revolution","offset":1808},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":1904},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":1922},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":1930},{"uri":"Work","surface_form":"work","offset":1984}]}
