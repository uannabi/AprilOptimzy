{"id":222842,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Alexandria","text":"Saint Catherine of Alexandria, also known as Saint Catherine of the Wheel and The Great Martyr Saint Catherine (Greek ') is a Christian saint and martyr. She is believed to have been a well-known scholar in the 4th century. In the 15th century it was claimed she had spoken to Joan of Arc. The Orthodox Church venerates her as a \"great martyr\", and in the Catholic Church she is traditionally revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.\nCatherine was the daughter of Costus, a pagan governor of Alexandria. She announced to her parents that she would only marry someone who was more beautiful, intelligent and rich than herself. In addition, that person needed to have a better social status than she had. Eventually, she discovered Christ. \"His beauty was more radiant than the shining of the sun, His wisdom governed all creation, His riches were spread throughout all the world.\"\nShe was a martyr, because she died for her beliefs in God. According to legend, she was supposed to die on a breaking wheel, but the wheel broke as soon as she touched it, so her head was cut off instead. Because of this, her main symbol is the spiked wheel, which is known as a Catherine wheel. The Catholic Church of St. Catherine, one of the first Catholic churches built in Russia, was named after her.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":112},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":126},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":136},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":146},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":196},{"uri":"4th_century","surface_form":"4th century","offset":211},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th century","offset":231},{"uri":"Joan_of_Arc","surface_form":"Joan of Arc","offset":277},{"uri":"Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Orthodox Church","offset":294},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":336},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":356},{"uri":"Fourteen_Holy_Helpers","surface_form":"Fourteen Holy Helpers","offset":415},{"uri":"Paganism","surface_form":"pagan","offset":478},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":496},{"uri":"Christ","surface_form":"Christ","offset":734},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":894},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":938},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1115},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1262}]}
