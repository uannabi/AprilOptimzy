It is the capital of the Province of Cardenal Caro.\nThe beach of Pichilemu is called one of the best beaches in the world for surfing. The most famous beach in Pichilemu is Punta de Lobos, where competitions are often held. The city has become a beach resort.\nHistory.\nPromoucaes were the first people that populated Pichilemu. They were hunter gatherers and fishermen.\nIn 1887, President Jos\u00E9 Manuel Balmaceda decreed Pichilemu as a minor dock.\nJos\u00E9 Toribio Medina did his first archeological investigations in Pichilemu, and he published in 1908 \"Los Restos Ind\u00EDgenas de Pichilemu\". He said there that Pedro de Valdivia gave land in what is now central Chile to Juan G\u00F3mez de Almagro on February 24, 1544. Pichilemu was between the areas of the Palloquierbico, Topocalma, and Gulaquien.\nThe name Pichilemu comes from the Mapudung\u00FAn words ' (little) and ' (forest).\nSome of the first land owners of Pichilemu were the Ort\u00FAzar family. Daniel Ort\u00FAzar is known as one of the founders of the original village of Pichilemu. The family of Ort\u00FAzar Cuevas, from the San Antonio de Petrel Hacienda, made a mid-century maritime dock which was as a fishing port for some years. They also built homes along the dock on what is now Ort\u00FAzar Avenue. More recently, other large land owners are Pedro Pavez Polanco and the Hacienda of San Antonio de Petrel. In 1891, during the Chilean Civil War, Daniel Ort\u00FAzar and the priest of Alcones were taken prisoners from Pichilemu through the dock. During the war, the dock was burned down. After the civil war, Pichilemu got its formal name and status. President Jorge Montt and his Minister, Manuel Jos\u00E9 Irarr\u00E1zabal, the city was officially established on December 22, 1891.\nPichilemu has become the historic capital of the province called Cardenal Caro which is named for the first Chilean Catholic Church Cardinal. His father was the first mayor in the city.\nAgust\u00EDn Ross Edwards was a Chilean writer, Member of Parliament, minister and politician.\nRoss was very rich and based on his European background, he bought a 300-hectare piece of land and named it \"La Posada\" (), or Petren Fund, in 1885. Ross designed an urban place of high environmental value and landscape, turning \"La Posada\" into a hotel (\"Great Hotel Pichilemu\", later \"Hotel Ross\", or \"Ross Hotel\"), and building a casino, embankments, stone walls, a balcony facing the beach. Additionally, he built a park and a forest of more than 10 hectares. Agust\u00EDn Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for the people from Santiago. Some of his buildings were named National Monuments.\nGeography and climate.\nPichilemu is located west of San Fernando, Chile and just east of the Pacific Ocean.
