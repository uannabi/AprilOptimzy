{"id":22324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum","text":"A phylum (plural: phyla) is the third highest rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. The second rank is kingdom and the highest is domain. Usually biologists count about 32 phyla of animal<nowiki/>s, about 14 of plant<nowiki/>s, and about 8 phyla of fungus, but definitions vary.\nWith genome analysis, groups of phyla have been put together based on evolutionary relationships. These are informal, not part of the standard classification.\nBotanists usually prefer the word \"division\" instead of \"phylum\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":10},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":63},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":74},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":90},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":120},{"uri":"Domain_(biology)","surface_form":"domain","offset":147},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":198},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":228},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungus","offset":266},{"uri":"Genome_analysis","surface_form":"genome analysis","offset":301},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":366},{"uri":"Biological_classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":439},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"Botanist","offset":455},{"uri":"Division_(botany)","surface_form":"division","offset":490}]}
