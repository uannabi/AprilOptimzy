{"id":223510,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model","text":"In a Hierarchical database model is a data model where the data is organised like a tree. The structure allows repeating information using parent/child relationships: each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent. All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type.\nIn a database, an entity type is the equivalent of a table; each individual record is represented as a row and an attribute as a column. Entity types are related to each other using \"1:\u00A0N\" mapping, also known as one-to-many relationships.\nThe most recognized and used hierarchical databases are IMS developed by IBM and Windows Registry by Microsoft.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Data_model","surface_form":"data model","offset":38},{"uri":"Tree_(computing)","surface_form":"tree","offset":84},{"uri":"Entity_type","surface_form":"entity type","offset":294},{"uri":"One-to-many","surface_form":"one-to-many","offset":519},{"uri":"Information_Management_System","surface_form":"IMS","offset":602},{"uri":"International_Business_Machines","surface_form":"IBM","offset":619},{"uri":"Windows_Registry","surface_form":"Windows Registry","offset":627},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":647}]}
