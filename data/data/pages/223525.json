{"id":223525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine","text":"Saint Valentine is the name of many martyred saints that lived in Ancient Rome. At least three different people named Valentine are said to have died on the 14th of February. Even though nobody knows who exactly Valentine was and where he came from, it has been confirmed that he existed because archaeologists discovered a church dedicated to Valentine.\nIn the Catholic church, Valentine was the patron of love, young people, and happy marriages.\nValentine's Day.\nThere are many guesses about how Valentine's Day, a celebration of love, started. One legend says that Valentine, being a priest, performed secret wedding ceremonies when they were outlawed by Emperor Claudius II. When someone discovered that Valentine was breaking the law, he was ordered to be executed.\nAnother theory is that Valentine helped captive Christians to break out of prison. When he himself was in prison, Valentine may have sent the first love letter to a young girl who liked to visit him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":36},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":45},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":66},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":296},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":324},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":362},{"uri":"Patron","surface_form":"patron","offset":397},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":407},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":437},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":551},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":587},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":612},{"uri":"Emperor_Claudius_II","surface_form":"Emperor Claudius II","offset":658},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":735},{"uri":"Executed","surface_form":"executed","offset":761},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":779},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":819},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":846}]}
