It brings these problems to public attention, sets programs to make changes, and provides help in major disasters, also promotes sustainable development and fair trade.\nOxfam began in Oxford in 1942 as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief. It was started by a group of Quakers (which included Marcus Tite), social activists, and Oxford academics. This is now Oxfam Great Britain, still based in Oxford, UK. It was one of several local committees formed to support the National Famine Relief Committee. Their job was to get the British government to allow food through the Allied blockade for the starving people of Axis occupied Greece.\nThe first overseas Oxfam began in Canada in 1963. The committee changed its name to its telegraph address, OXFAM, in 1965.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":137},{"uri":"Injustice","surface_form":"injustice","offset":149},{"uri":"Humanitarian_aid","surface_form":"help","offset":250},{"uri":"Disaster","surface_form":"disaster","offset":264},{"uri":"Sustainable_development","surface_form":"sustainable development","offset":289},{"uri":"Fair_trade","surface_form":"fair trade","offset":317},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":344},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"Famine","offset":387},{"uri":"Quaker","surface_form":"Quaker","offset":431},{"uri":"Activism","surface_form":"social activists","offset":469},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":565},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":689},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allied","offset":734},{"uri":"Blockade","surface_form":"blockade","offset":741},{"uri":"Starvation","surface_form":"starving","offset":758},{"uri":"Axis_countries","surface_form":"Axis","offset":777},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":791},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":833},{"uri":"Telegraph","surface_form":"telegraph","offset":887}]}
