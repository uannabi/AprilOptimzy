{"id":22366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puducherry","text":"Puducherry, which used to be called Pondicherry is a Union territory of India. Pondicherry is divided into four separate parts: Puducherry district, Karaikal district, Yanam district, and Mahe district. These four areas are under one name because they were all once ruled by the French. Chandranagore, the fifth former French colony 30 kilometers north of Kolkata, in West Bengal, India, is now outside this unconnected territory.\nWhen India took control of them, they took them in as one territory. Pondicherry is going through a name change to Puducherry, which means \"new village\" in the local language. It covers an area of 183 mi\u00B2 or 474 km\u00B2; it is bigger than Andorra but smaller than Saint Lucia.\nIts a very nice tourist attraction. Its has many heritage buildings with old French architecture. The Boulevard is ellipse-shaped with two clock towers of the Small Market and the Big Market. The area of boulevards close to the Beach is called White Town. This was the area where initial French settlements were made. That's why it is called White town area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Union_territory","surface_form":"Union territory","offset":53},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":72},{"uri":"Puducherry_district","surface_form":"Puducherry district","offset":128},{"uri":"Karaikal_district","surface_form":"Karaikal district","offset":149},{"uri":"Yanam_district","surface_form":"Yanam district","offset":168},{"uri":"Mahe_district","surface_form":"Mahe district","offset":188},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":279},{"uri":"Chandannagar","surface_form":"Chandranagore","offset":287},{"uri":"Kolkata","surface_form":"Kolkata","offset":356},{"uri":"West_Bengal","surface_form":"West Bengal","offset":368},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":381},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"mi\u00B2","offset":632},{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":643},{"uri":"Andorra","surface_form":"Andorra","offset":666},{"uri":"Saint_Lucia","surface_form":"Saint Lucia","offset":691},{"uri":"Tourist_attraction","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":720},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"ellipse","offset":819},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"Beach","offset":932}]}
