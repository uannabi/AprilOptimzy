{"id":22368,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees","text":"The New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in New York City, New York in the Bronx. They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as part of the American League (AL) east division. They are one of two MLB teams based in New York City, the other being the National League's (NL) New York Mets. They won 27 World Series championships to date, more than any other team in the Major Leagues. From 1923 to 2008, the Yankees home stadium had been Yankee Stadium. Currently, they are playing at their new Yankee Stadium.\nThe word \"Yankee\" (slang for \"American\") and the \"Uncle Sam\" top hat, make up part of what they are all about. As with the more common use of the term \"Yankee\", the team name is more often called \"the Yanks\". Their most commonly used \"unofficial\" nickname is \"the Bronx Bombers\", or simply \"the Bombers\". This nickname was given to them by the press a long time ago. It refers to their ability to hit home runs a lot (a home run is sometimes called a \"bomb\"). A less used nickname is \"the Pinstripers\", for their well-known uniform style.\nThe Yankees currently don't have a team captain. Derek Jeter retired after the 2014 season\nThe Yankees' current team ace is Geritt Cole.\nThe New York Yankees' main rival is the Boston Red Sox.\nThe Yankees' current team manager is Aaron Boone.\nThe Yankees' current General Manager is Brian Cashman.\nThe official fight song for the Yankees is \"Here Come the Yankees\".\nAfter the game, they play Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\".\nThey have 18 retired numbers, more than any other teams in MLB. The number 42 was retired not only in the Yankees but also throughout Major League Baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson who broke the color barrier.\nThe Yankees were also the last team to repeat as World Series champions. They won three straight titles from 1998 to 2000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":63},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":78},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"the Bronx","offset":90},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":117},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":160},{"uri":"American_League_East","surface_form":"east division","offset":181},{"uri":"National_League","surface_form":"National League","offset":270},{"uri":"New_York_Mets","surface_form":"New York Mets","offset":293},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":320},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major Leagues","offset":388},{"uri":"Yankee_Stadium_(1923)","surface_form":"Yankee Stadium","offset":456},{"uri":"Yankee_Stadium","surface_form":"Yankee Stadium","offset":513},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":548},{"uri":"Uncle_Sam","surface_form":"Uncle Sam","offset":579},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"press","offset":873},{"uri":"Home_run","surface_form":"home run","offset":930},{"uri":"Baseball_uniform","surface_form":"uniform","offset":1053},{"uri":"Boston_Red_Sox","surface_form":"Boston Red Sox","offset":1245},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":1632},{"uri":"Jackie_Robinson","surface_form":"Jackie Robinson","offset":1666},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":1760}]}
