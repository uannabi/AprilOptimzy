Among the sauropods were the largest land animals ever known: \"Seismosaurus\", \"Diplodocus\", \"Apatosaurus\" (popularly known as \"Brontosaurus\"), and others.\nDescription.\nOnly the modern blue whale is larger than these creatures; no land animal comes close. \"Argentinosaurus\", with a vertebra over 1.59 metres long, is the largest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":35},{"uri":"Prosauropod","surface_form":"prosauropod","offset":152},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":169},{"uri":"Seismosaurus","surface_form":"Seismosaurus","offset":243},{"uri":"Diplodocus","surface_form":"Diplodocus","offset":259},{"uri":"Apatosaurus","surface_form":"Apatosaurus","offset":273},{"uri":"Blue_whale","surface_form":"blue whale","offset":364},{"uri":"Argentinosaurus","surface_form":"Argentinosaurus","offset":436},{"uri":"Vertebra","surface_form":"vertebra","offset":461}]}
