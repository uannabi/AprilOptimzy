{"id":223927,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography","text":"=\"preserve\">Photolithography is the combination of photography and lithography. Its uses include the mass printing of photographs. Microphototolithography is the use of photolithography to transfer geometric shapes on a photomask to the surface of a semiconductor wafer for making integrated circuits.\nManufacturing.\nPhotolithography makes integrated circuits such as memory and central processing units.\nA special light-and-shadow pattern is shone through a photomask, onto a sheet or wafer of silicon that had been covered with a material called a photoresist. The light hardens the photoresist. When the board is dipped into a special acid, the parts that had no light on them are dissolved away.\nMemory chips have thousands or millions of identical cells. Because is much easier to make than a CPU, (a large die with a non-repetitive structure), RAM chips are far less expensive than processors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":51},{"uri":"Lithography","surface_form":"lithography","offset":67},{"uri":"Printing","surface_form":"printing","offset":106},{"uri":"Microphototolithography","surface_form":"Microphototolithography","offset":131},{"uri":"Photomask","surface_form":"photomask","offset":220},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":281},{"uri":"Integrated_circuits","surface_form":"integrated circuits","offset":340},{"uri":"Central_processing_unit","surface_form":"central processing unit","offset":379},{"uri":"Photomask","surface_form":"photomask","offset":459},{"uri":"Photoresist","surface_form":"photoresist","offset":550},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":638}]}
