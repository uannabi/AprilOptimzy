{"id":22401,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_helmet","text":"A riding helmet, sometimes called a horse riding helmet, is a type of helmet made for people who ride horses. It is important to wear a riding helmet when riding. It is easy for a person to fall off a horse and hit his or her head. Riding helmets keep the rider of a horse from being hurt. Horses can accidentally step on a person who has fallen to the ground.\nHelmets should be worn by all riders, but are most often worn by English style riders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Helmet","surface_form":"helmet","offset":70},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":102},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":226}]}
