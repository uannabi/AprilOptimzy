{"id":224082,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_stereo","text":"A car stereo is a device that can be in a car to listen to the radio, play cassettes or CDs. More modern car stereos can also play music from memory sticks.\nCar stereos typically can not produce much power without circuit which makes the car's battery voltage higher. Often car speakers have lower impedance. Then it is easier to get more audiopower without having higher voltage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":42},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":63},{"uri":"Audio_cassette","surface_form":"cassettes","offset":75},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CDs","offset":88},{"uri":"USB_flash_drive","surface_form":"memory sticks","offset":142},{"uri":"Electric_power","surface_form":"power","offset":200}]}
