Her book, \"The Optimist's Daughter\", won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 and Welty was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among numerous awards. She was the first living author to have her works published by the Library of America. Her house in Jackson, Mississippi, is a National Historic Landmark and open to the public as a museum.\nWelty worked as a publicity agent for the work progress administration. She had to travel around Mississippi for her job. In her own time, she took memorable photographs. These mostly show how different people from all economic and social classes coped with the Great Depression. Collections of her photograph were published as \"One time, One place\" (1971) and \"Photograph\" (1989).\nVery often, a photograph was the basis of one of her short stories, including \"Why I live at the P.O.\", which was inspired by a woman she photographed ironing in the back of a small post office.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Writer &lt;!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox Writer/doc]] --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":82},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"American South","offset":134},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize","offset":195},{"uri":"Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom","surface_form":"Presidential Medal of Freedom","offset":244},{"uri":"Library_of_America","surface_form":"Library of America","offset":365},{"uri":"Jackson%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Jackson, Mississippi","offset":398},{"uri":"National_Historic_Landmark","surface_form":"National Historic Landmark","offset":425},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":585},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":750}]}
