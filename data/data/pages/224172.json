{"id":224172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelicerata","text":"The Chelicerata are a sub-phylum of the Arthropods. The sub-phylum consists of only two classes: the Arachnids and the Merostomata.\nThe Merostomata are the extinct Eurypterids and the horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura). The horseshoe crabs are a small, ancient group which has survived relatively unchanged for millions of years. Groups like this are often called living fossils. The Arachnida is the huge and successful terrestrial (air-breathing) group of spiders and their relatives.\nThe chelicerates originated as marine animals. The first confirmed chelicerate fossils, the eurypterids, date from 445 million years ago in the late Ordovician period. Although only four marine species survive, all of them horseshoe crabs, there are over 77,000 species of air-breathing chelicerates, and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species.\nThe pycnogonids may or may not be Chelicerates. This is in dispute, as genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods. There are 1,300 species of these 'sea spiders'.\nThe life-style of chelicerates is largely carnivorous, or other kinds of heterotroph.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":26},{"uri":"Arthropods","surface_form":"Arthropods","offset":40},{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"classes","offset":88},{"uri":"Arachnid","surface_form":"Arachnid","offset":101},{"uri":"Merostomata","surface_form":"Merostomata","offset":119},{"uri":"Eurypterids","surface_form":"Eurypterids","offset":164},{"uri":"Horseshoe_crabs","surface_form":"horseshoe crabs","offset":184},{"uri":"Xiphosura","surface_form":"Xiphosura","offset":201},{"uri":"Living_fossil","surface_form":"living fossil","offset":357},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":451},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":511},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":559},{"uri":"Eurypterid","surface_form":"eurypterid","offset":572},{"uri":"Ordovician","surface_form":"Ordovician","offset":629},{"uri":"Horseshoe_crab","surface_form":"horseshoe crab","offset":703},{"uri":"Pycnogonids","surface_form":"pycnogonids","offset":838},{"uri":"Genetic","surface_form":"genetic","offset":905},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1015},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":1089},{"uri":"Heterotroph","surface_form":"heterotroph","offset":1120}]}
