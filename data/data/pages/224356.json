{"id":224356,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation","text":"The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit foundation. Their main headquarters is in San Francisco in the United States. The Wikimedia Foundation runs many projects using the wiki idea and the MediaWiki software. These projects include Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, Wikimedia Commons, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, and Meta-Wiki.\nThere are many other wikis related to the foundation, but these are mostly smaller projects. They include the Wikimedia Foundation wiki, the MediaWiki wiki, the Test Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Incubator, Bugzilla, and the Wikimania wiki.\nThe foundation's creation was officially announced by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who was running Wikipedia within his company Bomis, on June 20, 2003.\nThe foundation gets most of its funds from donations, as it is nonprofit. It also looks for grants. Some companies have helped Wikimedia by giving free computer hardware, and by hosting servers. Since people can write the wikis, Wikimedia projects are free to use. Funds are used to run computer servers and to pay staff. The Foundation had 160 employees in 2013.\nIn 2013, Sue Gardner was the executive director.\nIn 2015, Patricio Lorente was the Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board.\nIn 2016, Katherine Maher became the executive director.\nIn 2018, Mar\u00EDa Sefidari is chair of the board.\nAdvisory Board.\nThe Foundation also has an Advisory Board, an international network of experts who have agreed to give the foundation meaningful help on a regular basis in many different areas, including law, organizational development, technology, policy, and outreach.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Non-profit","surface_form":"non-profit","offset":30},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":64},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":83},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":104},{"uri":"Wiki","surface_form":"wiki","offset":173},{"uri":"MediaWiki","surface_form":"MediaWiki","offset":191},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":234},{"uri":"Wiktionary","surface_form":"Wiktionary","offset":245},{"uri":"Wikiquote","surface_form":"Wikiquote","offset":257},{"uri":"Wikisource","surface_form":"Wikisource","offset":268},{"uri":"Wikinews","surface_form":"Wikinews","offset":280},{"uri":"Wikibooks","surface_form":"Wikibooks","offset":290},{"uri":"Wikiversity","surface_form":"Wikiversity","offset":301},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Commons","surface_form":"Wikimedia Commons","offset":314},{"uri":"Wikidata","surface_form":"Wikidata","offset":333},{"uri":"Wikivoyage","surface_form":"Wikivoyage","offset":343},{"uri":"Meta-Wiki","surface_form":"Meta-Wiki","offset":359},{"uri":"Test_Wikipedia","surface_form":"Test Wikipedia","offset":531},{"uri":"Bugzilla","surface_form":"Bugzilla","offset":572},{"uri":"Wikimania","surface_form":"Wikimania","offset":590},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":660},{"uri":"Jimmy_Wales","surface_form":"Jimmy Wales","offset":681},{"uri":"Bomis","surface_form":"Bomis","offset":739},{"uri":"June_20","surface_form":"June 20","offset":749},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":758},{"uri":"Fundraising","surface_form":"donations","offset":807},{"uri":"Computer_hardware","surface_form":"computer hardware","offset":916},{"uri":"Servers","surface_form":"servers","offset":1060},{"uri":"Sue_Gardner","surface_form":"Sue Gardner","offset":1137},{"uri":"Executive_director","surface_form":"executive director","offset":1157},{"uri":"Patricio_Lorente","surface_form":"Patricio Lorente","offset":1186},{"uri":"Katherine_Maher","surface_form":"Katherine Maher","offset":1261},{"uri":"Executive_director","surface_form":"executive director","offset":1288},{"uri":"Mar%C3%ADa_Sefidari","surface_form":"Mar\u00EDa Sefidari","offset":1317},{"uri":"Chairman","surface_form":"chair","offset":1335},{"uri":"Board_of_trustees","surface_form":"board","offset":1348},{"uri":"Advisory_Board","surface_form":"Advisory Board","offset":1398}]}
