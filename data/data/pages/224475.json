{"id":224475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raje","text":"=\"preserve\">Raje () is the honorary title for a king or nobleman (i.e. \"your Majesty\") in India. In India, south Indian states were ruled by the royal Indian dynasties. The rulers were addressed by the people as \"Raje\".\nSome clans of the Maratha community put the name Raje before their original clan name. Examples of these include RajeBhosale, RajeShirke, RajeMahadik, RajeNimbalkar and RajeMane.\nIn states like Rajasthan, Rajput community chiefs are known by the titles that include Maharawal, Rana and Maharana. These mean the same thing as Raje or Maharaja.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Honor","surface_form":"honor","offset":27},{"uri":"Styles_and_titles","surface_form":"title","offset":36},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":48},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":56},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":90},{"uri":"States_of_India","surface_form":"states","offset":120},{"uri":"Dynasties_of_India","surface_form":"dynasties","offset":158},{"uri":"Clan","surface_form":"clan","offset":225},{"uri":"Maratha","surface_form":"Maratha","offset":238},{"uri":"Rajasthan","surface_form":"Rajasthan","offset":414},{"uri":"Rajput","surface_form":"Rajput","offset":425}]}
