{"id":224476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Colorado","text":"The Flag of the State of Colorado has three horizontal stripes of the same width; the top and bottom stripes are blue, and the middle stripe white. On top of these stripes sits a circular red \"C\", filled with a golden disk. The blue is meant to represent the skies, the gold stands for the sunshine enjoyed by the state, the white represents the snowcapped mountains and the red represents the earth.\nHistory.\nThe flag was thought up by Andrew Carlisle Johnson in 1911 and adopted by the state's General Assembly on June 5 of the same year.\nHowever, the legislature did not specify the size of the \"C\" or the exact shade of blue or red. Because of this, some flags were in slightly different colors and had the \"C\" wholly within the center stripe. On February 28, 1929, the General Assembly added to the statement that the flag would be the same color blue and red as the flag of the United States. On March 31, 1964, the legislature further dictated the diameter of the gold disc to be equal to the center stripe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":44},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":113},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":141},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circular","offset":179},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":188},{"uri":"Golden","surface_form":"golden","offset":211},{"uri":"Represent","surface_form":"represent","offset":245},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"skies","offset":259},{"uri":"Mountains","surface_form":"mountains","offset":357},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":394},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":414},{"uri":"Andrew_Carlisle_Johnson","surface_form":"Andrew Carlisle Johnson","offset":437},{"uri":"Adopt","surface_form":"adopt","offset":473},{"uri":"Colorado_General_Assembly","surface_form":"General Assembly","offset":496},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":554},{"uri":"Specify","surface_form":"specify","offset":574},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":884}]}
