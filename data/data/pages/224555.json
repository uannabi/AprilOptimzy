{"id":224555,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thomas_Humberstone","text":"James Thomas Humberstone (July 8, 1850 - June 12, 1939) was an English chemical engineer. In 1872, he founded the Peru Nitrate Company in the Tarapac\u00E1 Province of Peru (now part of the Tarapac\u00E1 Region of Chile). He introduced the Schanks System and other innovations to the industry.\nLife.\nHumberstone was born in Dover, England. His grandfather had been director of the band of the Scottish Guard. His father worked in a post office.\nHis family moved to London when he was young. Humberstone worked for the London and North Western railway when he was 17. While he worked there, he learned about mechanics and chemistry. Later, he joined the Royal School of Mines in London. He was a very good student.\nWhen he was 25, he was hired by The Tarapaca Nitrate Company and moved to South America. Humberstone arrived at the Peruvian port of Pisagua on January 6, 1875, where he commenced working as a chemist and engineer.\nIn 1878 he implemented the Shanks system to make sodium carbonate. He also made other changes such as the transfer of waste water to avoid losing the materials in the gravel.\nIn 1879 the Chilean army landed in Pisagua, and consequently, many office workers went to the Pampa for safety. Humberstone, his wife, his mother and his two daughters went with them.\nWhen they got to Tarapaca, the governor said they should go to Arica because the military was coming. They crossed the desert because they did not want to be near the coast. It took them twenty days to get get to Arica. When the war ended, and Tarapaca became part of Chile, Humberstone continued working in the Agua Santa office.\nIn 1936, King George VI made him a member of the Order of the British Empire. Humberstone died in Iquique on June 12, 1939 and is buried in the British Cemetery, Tiliviche, Chile.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":63},{"uri":"Chemical_engineer","surface_form":"chemical engineer","offset":71},{"uri":"Tarapac%C3%A1_Province_(Peru)","surface_form":"Tarapac\u00E1 Province","offset":142},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":163},{"uri":"Tarapac%C3%A1_Region","surface_form":"Tarapac\u00E1 Region","offset":185},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":204},{"uri":"Schanks_System","surface_form":"Schanks System","offset":230},{"uri":"Dover%2C_Kent","surface_form":"Dover","offset":314},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":321},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":371},{"uri":"Scottish_Guard","surface_form":"Scottish Guard","offset":383},{"uri":"Post_office","surface_form":"post office","offset":422},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":455},{"uri":"London_and_North_Western","surface_form":"London and North Western","offset":508},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":533},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanics","offset":597},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":611},{"uri":"Royal_School_of_Mines","surface_form":"Royal School of Mines","offset":643},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":668},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":778},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":820},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":829},{"uri":"Pisagua","surface_form":"Pisagua","offset":837},{"uri":"Sodium_carbonate","surface_form":"sodium carbonate","offset":968},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":1069},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"gravel","offset":1086},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":1114},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":1309},{"uri":"Arica","surface_form":"Arica","offset":1341},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1359},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1397},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":1445},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":1507},{"uri":"British_monarchs","surface_form":"King","offset":1618},{"uri":"George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George VI","offset":1623},{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"Order of the British Empire","offset":1658},{"uri":"Iquique","surface_form":"Iquique","offset":1707}]}
