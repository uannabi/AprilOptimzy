{"id":224615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Wininger","text":"Salomon Wininger (13 December 1877, Gura Humora, Bukovina \u2013 December 1968, in Ramat Gan, Israel) was an Austrian-Jewish biographer.\nBefore World War I, Wininger lived in Chernivtsi and moved to Vienna during the war years, where he decided to write biographies of famous Jewish persons. This idea was pushed in order to counter the self-hating mood of Jewish youth in the city, created under the influence of Otto Weininger's works.\nAfter his return to Chernivtsi in 1921, Shlomo Wininger wrote about 13,000 biographies and published them in seven volumes between 1925 and 1936. He survived the time of World War II in Chernivtsi and emigrated in 1951 to Israel.\nWininger is considered as one of the greatest Jewish biographers of all time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gura_Humorului","surface_form":"Gura Humora","offset":36},{"uri":"Bukovina","surface_form":"Bukovina","offset":49},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":89},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":104},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":113},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":139}]}
