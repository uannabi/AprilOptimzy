{"id":224621,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Canadians","text":"Indo-Canadians are Canadians whose family can trace back to India. The names \"East Indian\" and \"South Asian\" are used for people who originate from India, to tell them apart from the First Nations peoples of Canada who are often called Indian, and from the people of the Caribbean, who are sometimes called West Indian. Most Indo-Canadians call themselves \"Indian\", instead of \"East Indian\". This is because Christopher Columbus thought the Americas were India, and that Native Americans were Indian.\nMost Indo-Canadians come from India, but some come from the Caribbean, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. They usually live in cities like Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, and Vancouver. They are one of the fastest growing races in Canada, because of immigration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadians","offset":19},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":60},{"uri":"East_Indian","surface_form":"East Indian","offset":78},{"uri":"South_Asian","surface_form":"South Asian","offset":96},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":236},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":271},{"uri":"West_Indian","surface_form":"West Indian","offset":307},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":408},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":561},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":572},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":587},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":603}]}
