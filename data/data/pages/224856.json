{"id":224856,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Barbthroat","text":"The sooty barbthroat (\"Threnetes niger\") is a species of hummingbird. It is found in French Guiana and far north-eastern Brazil. Its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest. Though normally restricted in range, it is common enough to be thought a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.\nThe taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion. Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a \"melanistic variant\" of the pale-tailed barbthroat (\"T. leucurus\").\nNot only that, but some suggest that the bronze-tailed barbthroat (\"T. n. loehkeni\") should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina's barbthroat (\"T. n. christinae\") as a subspecies. Freire's Sooty barbthroat (T. n. freirei) is average between the sooty and bronze-tailed barbthroats however, and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":46},{"uri":"Hummingbird","surface_form":"hummingbird","offset":57},{"uri":"French_Guiana","surface_form":"French Guiana","offset":85},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":121},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":133},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":150},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":167},{"uri":"Restricted","surface_form":"restricted","offset":191},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":290},{"uri":"Systematics","surface_form":"systematics","offset":303},{"uri":"Complex","surface_form":"complex","offset":339},{"uri":"Confusion","surface_form":"confusion","offset":361},{"uri":"Pale-tailed_barbthroat","surface_form":"pale-tailed barbthroat","offset":450},{"uri":"Bronze-tailed_barbthroat","surface_form":"bronze-tailed barbthroat","offset":531},{"uri":"Christina%27s_barbthroat","surface_form":"Christina's barbthroat","offset":636},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":685},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":742},{"uri":"Status","surface_form":"status","offset":820}]}
