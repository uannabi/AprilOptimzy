{"id":22490,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy","text":"Blasphemy is a word that means \"speaking badly about a religion\", or \"insulting a god\". Some religions see blasphemy as a religious crime. Many countries witha state religion have laws that make blasphemy a crime. For example, blasphemy can be punished with the death penalty in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. In other countries, the punishment for the crime is a fine, or imprisonment.\nSome countries do not have laws against blasphemy. For example, after the French Revolution, France made blasphemy legal to make sure people would have freedom of religion and the freedom of the press.\nThe United States, Canada, and many European countries, have laws to protect people who speak badly about religion. Sometimes people do this in a satirical way, like with a movie that makes fun of a religion. In these countries, profanity is often protected by freedom of speech as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":55},{"uri":"Insult","surface_form":"insult","offset":70},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":82},{"uri":"State_religion","surface_form":"state religion","offset":160},{"uri":"Laws","surface_form":"laws","offset":180},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":207},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":262},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":279},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":295},{"uri":"Fine","surface_form":"fine","offset":359},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"imprisonment","offset":368},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":456},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":475},{"uri":"Freedom_of_religion","surface_form":"freedom of religion","offset":534},{"uri":"Freedom_of_the_press","surface_form":"freedom of the press","offset":562},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":588},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":603},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":620},{"uri":"Satirical","surface_form":"satirical","offset":730},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":757},{"uri":"Profanity","surface_form":"profanity","offset":813},{"uri":"Freedom_of_speech","surface_form":"freedom of speech","offset":845}]}
