{"id":224913,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel","text":"Rigel is a hot supergiant star in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is classified as a blue supergiant. It is located in the constellation Orion. Many scientists believe that Rigel is the youngest star in the constellation. Rigel is much bigger than our star here in the solar system, the Sun at 78 times its radius and a diameter more than 100 million kilometers. Rigel lies 778 light-years from Earth in Orion. Because it is near the equator, Rigel is visible from Earth as a small, bluish circle on clear nights from both hemispheres.\nFate.\nThe color of this star is bluish-white, hotter than a star with a yellow color, meaning it will use more energy quickly. The Sun runs off the same gases as Rigel; hydrogen and helium that makes it shine. When Rigel loses its fuel inside the very hot core, it will blow up into the red supergiant stage of its life and explode in a supernova. A black hole or a pulsar could be left.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":26},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":38},{"uri":"Supergiant","surface_form":"supergiant","offset":83},{"uri":"Orion_(constellation)","surface_form":"Orion","offset":130},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":280},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":427},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":682},{"uri":"Supernova","surface_form":"supernova","offset":866},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":879},{"uri":"Pulsar","surface_form":"pulsar","offset":895}]}
