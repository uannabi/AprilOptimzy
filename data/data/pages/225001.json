{"id":225001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_State_Opera","text":"The Berlin State Opera, known in Germany as Staatsoper Unter den Linden is a world famous German opera company. Its permanent home is the Opera House on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin.\nEarly history.\nThe opera house was opened on 7 December 1742. It was the beginning of a 250-year co-operation between the Staatsoper and the orchestra called Berlin Staatskapelle. Famous conductors and composers associated with the opera house include Gaspare Spontini, Giacomo Meyerbeer and Richard Strauss.\nOn 18 August 1843 the Linden Opera was destroyed by fire. The new building was built a year later. It was called K\u00F6nigliches Opernhaus (Royal Opera House), and it opened with a performance of Meyerbeer's \"Ein Feldlager in Schlesien\".\nIn 1821, the Berlin Opera gave the first performance of Weber's \"Der Freisch\u00FCtz\". In 1849, it gave the first performance of Otto Nicolai's \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", conducted by the composer himself.\n20th century.\nAt the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Royal Court Opera, Berlin, had many famous conductors. They included Felix von Weingartner, Karl Muck, Richard Strauss, and Leo Blech.\nAfter the collapse of the German Empire in 1918, the Opera was renamed \"Staatsoper unter den Linden\" and the \"K\u00F6nigliche Kapelle\" became \"Kapelle der Staatsoper\".\nIn the 1920s, Wilhelm Furtw\u00E4ngler, Erich Kleiber, Otto Klemperer, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Bruno Walter\nconducted. In 1925, Alban Berg's \"Wozzeck\", was given its first performance conducted by Erich Kleiber with the composer in the audience.\nAfter having had many repairs and improvements, the Linden Opera reopened in April 1928 with a new production of \"Die Zauberfl\u00F6te\". In the same year, the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin and Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes with conductor Ernest Ansermet were guest performers. In 1930 Erich Kleiber conducted the first performance of Darius Milhaud's \"Christoph Columbus\".\nIn 1934, when symphonic pieces from Alban Berg's \"Lulu\" were performed by Kleiber, the Nazis created a scandal and Kleiber had to go into exile.\nWhen Hitler came to power all the Jews in the orchestra had to leave. Many went into exile, including the conductors Otto Klemperer and Fritz Busch. During the Third Reich, Robert Heger, Herbert von Karajan (1939-1945) and Johannes Sch\u00FCler were the \"Staatskapellmeister\".\nIn 1945 The Lindenoper was once again destroyed on 3 February. The second rebuilding took a long time. From 1945, the opera company played in the former \"Admiralspalast\" (today's Metropoltheater). From 1949, the company served as state opera of the GDR. It moved back to its original home after the rebuilding in 1955. The newly rebuilt opera house was opened, again, with Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00FCrnberg\".\nAfter the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Opera continued to perform music from the classical and romantic periods together with contemporary ballet and operas.\nAfter the Germany Reunification, the Linden Opera had links again with the operatic world. In the 1990s, the opera was officially renamed \"Staatsoper Unter den Linden\".\nIn 1992, the Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim was appointed Music Director. In 2000, the orchestra (according to its official website) gave Barenboim the title \"conductor for life.\" During the 2002 \"Festtage\", he led a Wagner cycle in ten parts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":33},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":90},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":97},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":187},{"uri":"Berlin_Staatskapelle","surface_form":"Berlin Staatskapelle","offset":353},{"uri":"Conductor_(music)","surface_form":"conductors","offset":382},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":397},{"uri":"Gaspare_Spontini","surface_form":"Gaspare Spontini","offset":447},{"uri":"Giacomo_Meyerbeer","surface_form":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","offset":465},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":487},{"uri":"Der_Freisch%C3%BCtz","surface_form":"Der Freisch\u00FCtz","offset":803},{"uri":"Otto_Nicolai","surface_form":"Otto Nicolai","offset":862},{"uri":"Die_lustigen_Weiber_von_Windsor","surface_form":"The Merry Wives of Windsor","offset":878},{"uri":"Felix_von_Weingartner","surface_form":"Felix von Weingartner","offset":1099},{"uri":"Karl_Muck","surface_form":"Karl Muck","offset":1122},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":1133},{"uri":"Leo_Blech","surface_form":"Leo Blech","offset":1154},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":1191},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Furtw%C3%A4ngler","surface_form":"Wilhelm Furtw\u00E4ngler","offset":1342},{"uri":"Erich_Kleiber","surface_form":"Erich Kleiber","offset":1363},{"uri":"Otto_Klemperer","surface_form":"Otto Klemperer","offset":1378},{"uri":"Alexander_von_Zemlinsky","surface_form":"Alexander von Zemlinsky","offset":1394},{"uri":"Bruno_Walter","surface_form":"Bruno Walter","offset":1419},{"uri":"Alban_Berg","surface_form":"Alban Berg","offset":1452},{"uri":"Wozzeck","surface_form":"Wozzeck","offset":1466},{"uri":"Die_Zauberfl%C3%B6te","surface_form":"Die Zauberfl\u00F6te","offset":1684},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1731},{"uri":"Feodor_Chaliapin","surface_form":"Feodor Chaliapin","offset":1744},{"uri":"Serge_Diaghilev","surface_form":"Serge Diaghilev","offset":1765},{"uri":"Ballets_Russes","surface_form":"Ballets Russes","offset":1783},{"uri":"Ernest_Ansermet","surface_form":"Ernest Ansermet","offset":1813},{"uri":"Darius_Milhaud","surface_form":"Darius Milhaud","offset":1909},{"uri":"Alban_Berg","surface_form":"Alban Berg","offset":1984},{"uri":"Lulu_(opera)","surface_form":"Lulu","offset":1998},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":2035},{"uri":"Scandal","surface_form":"scandal","offset":2051},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":2086},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":2098},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":2127},{"uri":"Otto_Klemperer","surface_form":"Otto Klemperer","offset":2210},{"uri":"Fritz_Busch","surface_form":"Fritz Busch","offset":2229},{"uri":"Third_Reich","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":2253},{"uri":"Robert_Heger","surface_form":"Robert Heger","offset":2266},{"uri":"Herbert_von_Karajan","surface_form":"Herbert von Karajan","offset":2280},{"uri":"Admiralspalast","surface_form":"Admiralspalast","offset":2519},{"uri":"GDR","surface_form":"GDR","offset":2614},{"uri":"Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg","surface_form":"Die Meistersinger von N\u00FCrnberg","offset":2748},{"uri":"Berlin_Wall","surface_form":"Berlin Wall","offset":2791},{"uri":"Classical_music_period","surface_form":"classical","offset":2868},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"romantic","offset":2882},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentine","offset":3127},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":3137},{"uri":"Daniel_Barenboim","surface_form":"Daniel Barenboim","offset":3155}]}
