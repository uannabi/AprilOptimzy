{"id":225027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_dementia","text":"=\"preserve\">Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. It is a type of dementia caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain.\nBrain cells need a good supply of blood to stay healthy and function properly. The blood is delivered through a network of blood vessels called the vascular system. If the vascular system within the brain becomes damaged and blood cannot reach the brain cells, the cells will eventually die. This can lead to the onset of vascular dementia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dementia","surface_form":"dementia","offset":64},{"uri":"Alzheimer%27s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer's disease","offset":79},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":161},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":174},{"uri":"Brain_cell","surface_form":"brain cell","offset":429}]}
