{"id":225035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_room","text":"e=\"preserve\">Resource room is a place where special education students attend daily classes. These students are usually included in the general classroom and just need more support. Students are taught individually and in small groups. The number of students in a resource room is at most five students per teacher. Mainstreaming in education typically includes this service. Students in separate classes generally do not need the resource room because all the support they need is in the self-contained classroom.\nSpecial education teachers in resource rooms focus on the goals set by an Individualized Education Program. These goals are based on the individual student's need to develop executive skills, complete their homework and behave. The programs can help students with language-based learning disabilities like dyslexia. Visuo-motor perception, arithmetic, spelling and overall self-perception improve after time in the resource room classroom. The small-group instructional model leads to achievement in students with a multitude of educational disabilities.\nTheir peers also benefit when the concepts they learned in general education are reinforced in resource rooms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Special_education","surface_form":"special education","offset":44},{"uri":"Mainstreaming_in_education","surface_form":"Mainstreaming in education","offset":316},{"uri":"Individualized_Education_Program","surface_form":"Individualized Education Program","offset":589},{"uri":"Homework","surface_form":"homework","offset":722},{"uri":"Dyslexia","surface_form":"dyslexia","offset":821}]}
