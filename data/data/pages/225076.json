{"id":225076,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End%E2%80%93Ordovician_extinction_event","text":"e=\"preserve\">The End\u2013Ordovician extinction event is the third-largest extinction event of the Phanerozoic eon. The Ordovician period followed the Cambrian and was followed by the Silurian. There were no living things on the land except for bacteria and perhaps some single-celled algae. The biota was almost entirely marine.\nThe extinction came in two steps, at the start and the finish of the \"Hirnantian\" stage, which was the last stage of the Ordovician.\nBasic mechanism: climate changes from very warm to very cold and back to very warm. Changes in ocean circulation were the results of the climate changes. Both benthic (ocean bottom) and pelagic fauna were faced with conditions they were unable to cope with.\nMore than 100 invertebrate families becam extinct in the End\u2013Ordovician extinction event, and a total of almost half the genera. The brachiopods and bryozoans were decimated, along with many of the trilobite, conodont and graptolite families.\nThe cause was probably the rise and erosion of the Appalachian Mountains. The rise put much CO2 into the atmosphere, and the erosion took it out.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic","offset":94},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":106},{"uri":"Cambrian","surface_form":"Cambrian","offset":146},{"uri":"Silurian","surface_form":"Silurian","offset":179},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":240},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":280},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":317},{"uri":"Benthic","surface_form":"benthic","offset":617},{"uri":"Pelagic","surface_form":"pelagic","offset":644},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":730},{"uri":"Brachiopod","surface_form":"brachiopod","offset":849},{"uri":"Bryozoa","surface_form":"bryozoa","offset":865},{"uri":"Trilobite","surface_form":"trilobite","offset":914},{"uri":"Conodont","surface_form":"conodont","offset":925},{"uri":"Graptolite","surface_form":"graptolite","offset":938},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":995},{"uri":"Appalachian_Mountains","surface_form":"Appalachian Mountains","offset":1010},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"CO2","offset":1051},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":1064}]}
