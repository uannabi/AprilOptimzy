{"id":22511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult","text":"e=\"preserve\">A cult is a group of people who have a religion or a set of beliefs. In modern times the term \"cult\" usually does not mean a mainstream religion, but a group set up \"in opposition to a centre of established authority\". New Age religions were often called cults because they were thought to be deviant social movements.\nThe word cult originally meant a system of ritual practices. It was first used in the early 17th century to mean homage paid to a divinity. It came from an ancient Latin word \"cultus\" meaning \"worship\".\nA cult is often a small, newly started religious movement. Cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd, or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice. More than that, cults have often been led by people who are not elected, and control the group according to their own wishes. Some cult leaders have been dangerous criminals (Charles Manson; Peoples Temple) or even lunatics. Killings and mass suicides have occurred in cults (Order of the Solar Temple; Heaven's Gate). Of course, a \"suicide\" enforced by armed guards carrying sub-machine guns (Peoples Temple; Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God) is not a simple suicide as generally understood. It is at least an assisted and coerced suicide.\nWhether a religious group is or is not a cult can be a hard question to answer. What is at one point in time considered a cult may later be accepted as a religion and what at one point of time is considered an accepted religion may later become a cult.\nMind control.\nSome form of persuasion or mind control can be used to recruit and maintain members. The objective is to prevent the faithful from thinking critically, and making choices in their own best interest.\nThis view is disputed by some. \"Society for the Scientific Study of Religion\" stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient research for a consensus, and that \"one should not automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control\".\nUse of violence.\nOwnership of weapons and violence has occurred in some cults. The Branch Davidians under the direction of David Koresh used violence against Federal agencies, with tragic results for both sides. The later FBI report reveals the extent of their arms stockpile.\nThe People's Temple included guards armed with submachine guns. These guards killed the visiting U.S. Congressman Ryan, and stood around the believers as they committed suicide. Members of the Manson Family were convicted of several murders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":52},{"uri":"New_Age","surface_form":"New Age","offset":232},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":375},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":496},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":525},{"uri":"Charles_Manson","surface_form":"Charles Manson","offset":911},{"uri":"Peoples_Temple","surface_form":"Peoples Temple","offset":927},{"uri":"Mass_suicide","surface_form":"mass suicide","offset":974},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Solar_Temple","surface_form":"Order of the Solar Temple","offset":1012},{"uri":"Heaven%27s_Gate","surface_form":"Heaven's Gate","offset":1039},{"uri":"Sub-machine_gun","surface_form":"sub-machine gun","offset":1112},{"uri":"Movement_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Ten_Commandments_of_God","surface_form":"Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God","offset":1146},{"uri":"Mind_control","surface_form":"mind control","offset":1598},{"uri":"Branch_Davidians","surface_form":"Branch Davidians","offset":2169},{"uri":"People%27s_Temple","surface_form":"People's Temple","offset":2367},{"uri":"Submachine_gun","surface_form":"submachine gun","offset":2410},{"uri":"Congressman","surface_form":"Congressman","offset":2465}]}
