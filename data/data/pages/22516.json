{"id":22516,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Michener","text":"James Albert Michener (February 3, 1907 - October 16, 1997) was an American writer. His books include \"Tales of the South Pacific\", \"Hawaii\", \"The Drifters\", \"Texas\", and \"Poland\". Most of his 40 books are very large sagas. They are about the lives of many generations in a particular place. His non-fiction writings include the 1992 book \"The World is My Home\" and \"Sports in America\".\nMichener wrote that he did not know who his parents were or exactly when and where he was born. He was raised by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Some have argued that Mabel was his birth mother. He graduated from Swarthmore College, where he played basketball, in 1929. He later studied at the Colorado State Teachers College. He taught there for several years. He also taught at Harvard University.\nHis writing career began during World War II. He was assigned to the South Pacific Ocean as a naval historian. He used his time there as the basis for \"Tales of the South Pacific\", his first book. This book was the basis for the musical \"South Pacific\".\nMichener met his wife Mari while in Japan. His novel \"Sayonara\" is autobiographical.\nOn January 10, 1977, he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald R. Ford.\nIn his final years, he lived in Austin, Texas, where he died of kidney failure on October 16, 1997 at the age of 90.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":67},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":76},{"uri":"Tales_of_the_South_Pacific","surface_form":"Tales of the South Pacific","offset":103},{"uri":"Hawaii_(novel)","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":133},{"uri":"The_Drifters_(novel)","surface_form":"The Drifters","offset":143},{"uri":"Texas_(novel)","surface_form":"Texas","offset":159},{"uri":"Poland_(novel)","surface_form":"Poland","offset":172},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"sagas","offset":217},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":257},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":300},{"uri":"The_World_is_My_Home","surface_form":"The World is My Home","offset":340},{"uri":"Sports_in_America","surface_form":"Sports in America","offset":367},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adoptive","offset":503},{"uri":"Doylestown%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Doylestown","offset":539},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":551},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":618},{"uri":"Swarthmore_College","surface_form":"Swarthmore College","offset":633},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":669},{"uri":"University_of_Northern_Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado State Teachers College","offset":714},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":800},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":832},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":852},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"South Pacific Ocean","offset":889},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"naval","offset":914},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":920},{"uri":"Tales_of_the_South_Pacific","surface_form":"Tales of the South Pacific","offset":972},{"uri":"Musical","surface_form":"musical","offset":1049},{"uri":"South_Pacific_(musical)","surface_form":"South Pacific","offset":1058},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1110},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiographical","offset":1141},{"uri":"Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom","surface_form":"Presidential Medal of Freedom","offset":1197},{"uri":"Gerald_R._Ford","surface_form":"Gerald R.
