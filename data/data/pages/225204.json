{"id":225204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_worm","text":"The velvet worms (Onychophora \u2014 literally \"claw bearers\") are a minor panarthropod phylum.\nThere are two families and about 200 species. All living species live on land, in moist or wet tropical areas.\nThe two living families are the Peripatidae and the Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being mainly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found in what used to be Gondwana.\nThe segmented worm-like organisms have tiny eyes, \"fur\", antennae, multiple pairs of legs, and, slime glands. The group is thought to be related to arthropods. They prey on smaller animals such as insects, which they catch by squirting a sticky slime.\nPossible fossil history.\nFossils from the early Cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms. These fossils, known as the lobopods, were marine. They were a clade from which arthropods, tardigrades, and Onychophora arose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Panarthropoda","surface_form":"panarthropod","offset":70},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":83},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":105},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":128},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":164},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":186},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":338},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":420},{"uri":"Worm","surface_form":"worm","offset":444},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":578},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":627},{"uri":"Slime","surface_form":"slime","offset":675},{"uri":"Lobopodia","surface_form":"lobopod","offset":816},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":831},{"uri":"Arthropods","surface_form":"arthropods","offset":868},{"uri":"Tardigrades","surface_form":"tardigrades","offset":880}]}
