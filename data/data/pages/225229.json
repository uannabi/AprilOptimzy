{"id":225229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)","text":"=\"preserve\">A bond is a contract between two companies.\nCompanies or governments issue bonds because they need to borrow large amounts of money. They issue bonds and investors buy them (thereby giving the people who issued the bond money).\nBonds have a maturity date. This means that at some point, the bond issuer has to pay back the money to the investors. They also have to pay the investors a little bit more than they paid for the bond.\nBonds are usually traded through brokers and are part of a financial instrument group called Fixed Income.\nBanks and financial institutions offer loans on different terms against the security of assets.\nSimply put, a bond is a receipt given by a government or organization as an agreement to borrow money from another organization which will be returned at a later date with certain amount of interest or increment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":24},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"Companies","offset":56},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":69},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":138},{"uri":"Investment","surface_form":"investors","offset":166},{"uri":"Maturity","surface_form":"maturity","offset":253},{"uri":"Broker","surface_form":"broker","offset":475},{"uri":"Fixed_Income","surface_form":"Fixed Income","offset":535},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"Bank","offset":549},{"uri":"Finance","surface_form":"financial institutions","offset":559},{"uri":"Loan","surface_form":"loan","offset":588},{"uri":"Security","surface_form":"security","offset":625},{"uri":"Asset","surface_form":"asset","offset":637}]}
