{"id":22531,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipmunk","text":"A chipmunk is a small squirrel-like rodent. It is in the Sciuridae family. About twenty-three species fall under this title, with one species in North America.\nThe name may have originally been spelled \"chitmunk\" (perhaps from a Native American word meaning \"red squirrel\"). However, the earliest form comes from the Oxford English Dictionary (in 1842) as \"chipmonk\". Other early forms include \"chipmuck\" and \"chipminck\".\nChipmunks are hoarders, meaning they store food for winter.\nPopular culture.\nChip 'n Dale, two Disney cartoon characters, are famous chipmunks in pop culture. Another such trio is Alvin, Simon and Theodore (created by Ross Bagdasarian).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":22},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":36},{"uri":"Sciuridae","surface_form":"Sciuridae","offset":57},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":94},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":145},{"uri":"Oxford_English_Dictionary","surface_form":"Oxford English Dictionary","offset":317},{"uri":"Chip_%27n_Dale","surface_form":"Chip 'n Dale","offset":499},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":517},{"uri":"Pop_culture","surface_form":"pop culture","offset":568},{"uri":"Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks","surface_form":"Alvin, Simon and Theodore","offset":602},{"uri":"Ross_Bagdasarian","surface_form":"Ross Bagdasarian","offset":640}]}
