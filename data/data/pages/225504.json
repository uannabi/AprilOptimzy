{"id":225504,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory","text":"=\"preserve\">In astrodynamics, a hyperbolic trajectory (which is also an escape trajectory) refers to an object (such as an asteroid) which follows a path similar to a hyperbola around a central object. This motion follows Kepler's Laws. A hyperbolic trajectory occurs when the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 1.\nOther types of motion in astronomy include circular orbit, elliptical orbit, and parabolic trajectory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astrodynamics","surface_form":"astrodynamics","offset":15},{"uri":"Escape_velocity","surface_form":"escape trajectory","offset":72},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":123},{"uri":"Hyperbola","surface_form":"hyperbola","offset":167},{"uri":"Kepler%27s_Laws","surface_form":"Kepler's Laws","offset":222},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":277},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":297},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":347},{"uri":"Circular_orbit","surface_form":"circular orbit","offset":365},{"uri":"Elliptical_orbit","surface_form":"elliptical orbit","offset":381},{"uri":"Parabolic_trajectory","surface_form":"parabolic trajectory","offset":403}]}
