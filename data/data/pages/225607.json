{"id":225607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah","text":"Hezekiah (meaning God will strengthen) or \u1E24izqiyy\u0101hu (Hebrew), also translated as \u1E24izkiyyahu (and sometimes as Ezekias (Greek), Khizkiyahu, Y\u0259\u1E25izqiyy\u0101hu, Y'khizkiyahu), was a king of Judah that appears in the book of 2 Chronicles, chapters 18 to 32, and the book of 2 Kings chapters 18 to 20. He was one of the few kings who is compared favorably with David, and is unique for his trust in the Lord: \"There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him. He held fast to the LORD and did not cease (stop) to follow him\" (NIV).\nHezekiah was the son of Judah's King Ahaz, and is best known for turning his people away from the sins of his father Ahaz, restoring worship in the temple, and having his life made 15 years longer. The Book of 2 Chronicles tells more about Hezekiah than any other king after Solomon, and suggests that he is a \"second Solomon\" in his celebration of the Passover, his wealth, his honor, and his land.\nToward the end of his reign, he became very sick and close to death. He prayed to the Lord, who healed him miraculously. The king of Babylon heard about it and sent men with a letter and gift to Hezekiah. Because Hezekiah was proud of his riches, he showed all of his treasures to the visitors. The prophet Isaiah predicted that it all would later be taken by the Babylonians. His prediction came true.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":54},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translated","offset":68},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":120},{"uri":"Judah","surface_form":"Judah","offset":183},{"uri":"Books_of_Chronicles","surface_form":"2 Chronicles","offset":217},{"uri":"Books_of_Kings","surface_form":"2 Kings","offset":266},{"uri":"Favorable","surface_form":"favorably","offset":337},{"uri":"David","surface_form":"David","offset":352},{"uri":"Ahaz","surface_form":"Ahaz","offset":598},{"uri":"Restore","surface_form":"restoring","offset":684},{"uri":"Solomon","surface_form":"Solomon","offset":836},{"uri":"Passover","surface_form":"Passover","offset":914},{"uri":"Wealth","surface_form":"wealth","offset":928},{"uri":"Honor","surface_form":"honor","offset":940},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":983},{"uri":"Babylon","surface_form":"Babylon","offset":1094},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":1260},{"uri":"Isaiah","surface_form":"Isaiah","offset":1268},{"uri":"Prediction","surface_form":"predicted","offset":1275}]}
