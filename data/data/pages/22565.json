{"id":22565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books","text":"Deuterocanonical books means \"second canon\" in Greek. It usually means the parts of the Bible that are only used by some Christian churches (mostly Roman Catholic and Orthodox). The books were originally written in Greek language and they were written between 250 and 50 BC.\nThe \"Book of Daniel\" and the \"Book of Esther\" are longer in Catholic Bibles than in Protestant Bibles because they have more stories.\nMost Protestant Christian churches do not think that the deuterocanonical books were inspired by God. They call these books Apocrypha. Martin Luther considered these books good to read while John Calvin read and studied them but did not think they should be part of the Bible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canon","surface_form":"canon","offset":37},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":47},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":88},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":121},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":148},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":167},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek language","offset":215},{"uri":"Book_of_Daniel","surface_form":"Book of Daniel","offset":280},{"uri":"Book_of_Esther","surface_form":"Book of Esther","offset":305},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":414},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":506},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"Apocrypha","offset":533},{"uri":"Martin_Luther","surface_form":"Martin Luther","offset":544},{"uri":"John_Calvin","surface_form":"John Calvin","offset":600}]}
