{"id":225820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviparous_animals","text":"=\"preserve\">Oviparous animals are animals that reproduce by laying eggs. This is how most fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and arachnids reproduce. All birds and monotremes also reproduce like this.\nThe eggs that of most animals that live on land are protected by hard shells. They fertilize their eggs internally. Water-dwelling animals like fish and amphibians lay eggs that have not been fertilized yet. Then the males lay sperm on top of the eggs, which is called external fertilization.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":67},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":90},{"uri":"Amphibians","surface_form":"amphibians","offset":96},{"uri":"Reptiles","surface_form":"reptiles","offset":108},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":118},{"uri":"Arachnid","surface_form":"arachnids","offset":131},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":156},{"uri":"Monotremes","surface_form":"monotremes","offset":166},{"uri":"Fertilization","surface_form":"fertilize","offset":286},{"uri":"External_fertilization","surface_form":"external fertilization","offset":472}]}
