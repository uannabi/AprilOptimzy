{"id":22587,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan","text":"Kazan (;) is the capital city of Tatarstan and one of Russia's largest cities. It is a major industrial, commercial and cultural center, and remains the most important center of Tatar culture. Kazan lies at the confluence of the Volga (\u0130del) and Kazanka (Qazansu) rivers in central European Russia.\nName.\nThe origin of the name is unclear. The literal translation of Tatar qazan is a boiler or cauldron. Alternately, it may have been derived from qaz\u011Fan, Tatar for \"dug [ditch]\".\n\"Qazan\" is originally a name for a special cooking pan, a variant of a wok, but more solid and heavier. It was believed that the city of Kazan is named after this object because of its geographical similarity with a \"qazan\"-pan; namely the city is situated in a U - shape lowland.\nAnother, more romantic legend tells a story of a Tatar princess S\u00F6yembik\u00E4, who dropped a golden dish (golden qazan) into the river on which the city is located while washing it.\nNevertheless, Chuvash legends refer to Bulgarian prince \"Khusan\" (Chuvash rendering of Muslim name Hassan) and Chuvashes call this city \u0425\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043D after the name of this prince.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tatarstan","surface_form":"Tatarstan","offset":33},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":54},{"uri":"Tatars","surface_form":"Tatar","offset":178},{"uri":"Volga_River","surface_form":"Volga","offset":229},{"uri":"Kazanka_River","surface_form":"Kazanka","offset":246},{"uri":"Wok","surface_form":"wok","offset":551},{"uri":"S%C3%B6yembik%C3%A4","surface_form":"S\u00F6yembik\u00E4","offset":825},{"uri":"Chuvash","surface_form":"Chuvash","offset":953}]}
