{"id":225870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender_loris","text":"The slender loris is a nocturnal hunter. It moves slowly through trees and grips branches tightly with its opposable thumbs and toes. When it attacks prey it goes closer and then snatches it with both hands.\nDescription.\nThe slender loris is about the size of a squirrel, and has small finger nails. It has two brown eyes, and has white fur on its chest.\nHabits.\nThe slender loris usually spends its time on trees. They like to groom and wrestle with each other.\nFood.\nThese animals eat insects, lizards, birds, but will also eat things like slugs, flowers, shoots, young leaves, and sometimes even eggs. They would also like termites and roaches for a tasty treat.\nHistory.\nNative people thought that the slender lorises had magical powers. It is not clear how many slender lorises survive in the wild.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":23},{"uri":"Hunter","surface_form":"hunter","offset":33},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":150},{"uri":"Hand","surface_form":"hand","offset":201},{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":262},{"uri":"Finger","surface_form":"finger","offset":286},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":331},{"uri":"Wrestle","surface_form":"wrestle","offset":438},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":487},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":496},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":505},{"uri":"Slug","surface_form":"slug","offset":542},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":549},{"uri":"Termite","surface_form":"termite","offset":626},{"uri":"Native","surface_form":"Native","offset":675},{"uri":"Wild","surface_form":"wild","offset":798}]}
