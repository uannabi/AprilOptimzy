It was created when the government started killing and hurting people who protested against apartheid. Mandela first wanted to free South Africa without violence, but the government created laws to prevent that. Mandela then decided that if black people did not use violence, they would never regain their rights. They carried out many attacks, including bombings. The most deadly of these was the Church Street bombing in Pretoria.\nUmkhonto we Sizwe stopped being active in 1990, before the end of apartheid, in 1991.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":28},{"uri":"Guerilla","surface_form":"guerilla","offset":42},{"uri":"Nelson_Mandela","surface_form":"Nelson Mandela","offset":79},{"uri":"Walter_Sisulu","surface_form":"Walter Sisulu","offset":95},{"uri":"African_National_Congress","surface_form":"African National Congress","offset":135},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":186},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":236},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"apartheid","offset":254},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":403},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":517},{"uri":"Church_Street%2C_Pretoria_bombing","surface_form":"Church Street bombing","offset":560},{"uri":"Pretoria","surface_form":"Pretoria","offset":585}]}
