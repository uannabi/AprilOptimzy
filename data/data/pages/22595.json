{"id":22595,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-product","text":"=\"preserve\">A by-product is something that is made or produced while a product is manufactured in a factory. Usually, the by-product is not used, and it becomes waste that is put in a landfill or garbage dump. Sometimes by-products are toxic materials which are dangerous to humans, animals, and plants.\nSome companies are trying to find ways to reuse or recycle the by-products, instead of putting them into landfill or garbage dumps as waste.\nAnimal \"by-products\" are produced by slaughterhouses (places designed to kill animals for food). Animal by-products are the parts of the animals that cannot be eaten by humans. Animal by-products are sometimes included in non-human foods, such as pet food or animal feed (for farm animals).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manufacture","surface_form":"manufacture","offset":82},{"uri":"Waste","surface_form":"waste","offset":161},{"uri":"Landfill","surface_form":"landfill","offset":184},{"uri":"Garbage_dump","surface_form":"garbage dump","offset":196},{"uri":"Toxic_waste","surface_form":"toxic","offset":236},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"Animal","offset":445},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":671},{"uri":"Pet_food","surface_form":"pet food","offset":692}]}
