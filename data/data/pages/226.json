{"id":226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics","text":"Ideas about ethics.\n\"Morality\" is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad.\nThere are many different moralities, but they share some things.\nFor example, most people think that murder (killing somebody) is wrong.(compare Exodus 20:13)\nSome philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share.\nThey think that ethics should use the scientific method to study\nthings that people think are good or bad. Their work can be used\nto test the fairness of a situation, such as how people should treat\neach other. An example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative.\nMany countries have laws based on this idea of fairness.\nWhat is ethics used for?\nUnderstanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices. Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics.\nAlong with aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology, the philosophy of what people like.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Exodus","surface_form":"Exodus","offset":224},{"uri":"Scientific_method","surface_form":"scientific method","offset":347},{"uri":"Categorical_imperative","surface_form":"categorical imperative","offset":563},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosophers","offset":753},{"uri":"Aesthetics","surface_form":"aesthetics","offset":845},{"uri":"Axiology","surface_form":"axiology","offset":877}]}
