{"id":226262,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_Sylph","text":"The Venezuelan sylph (\"Aglaiocercus berlepschi\") is a species of hummingbird. It is restricted to a small area of north-eastern Venezuela and is classed as an endangered species by BirdLife International. It is sometimes thought to be a subspecies of the Long-tailed Sylph (A. kingi).\nThe male is 22 centimeters in length with the elongated outer tail-feathers accounting for 14-15 centimeters. Its color is mostly green. The throat is blue and the outer tail-feathers are violet, becoming blue towards the tips. The female is 9.5-11 centimeters long. The tail is shorter than that of the male but still fairly long and slightly forked. Females have a blue crown and white throat, breast and belly.\nThe Long-tailed Sylph is almost the same in color but does not overlap in range. Males of the subspecies \"caudatus\" have a mostly blue tail and no blue throat patch, while males of the subspecies \"margarethae\" have green tips to the tail-feathers. Females have a rufous breast and belly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":54},{"uri":"Hummingbird","surface_form":"hummingbird","offset":65},{"uri":"Restricted","surface_form":"restricted","offset":84},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":128},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":289},{"uri":"Centimeter","surface_form":"centimeter","offset":300},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":347},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":415},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":426},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":436},{"uri":"Violet_(color)","surface_form":"violet","offset":473},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":517},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":667},{"uri":"Breast","surface_form":"breast","offset":681},{"uri":"Belly","surface_form":"belly","offset":692},{"uri":"Rufous","surface_form":"rufous","offset":962}]}
