This means that all the properties of a vector space are satisfied.\nIf formula_1 and formula_1 are subspaces of a vector space formula_1, then the sum and the direct sum of formula_1 and formula_1, denoted respectively by formula_1 and formula_1, are subspaces as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vector_space","surface_form":"vector space","offset":36},{"uri":"Subset","surface_form":"subset","offset":59}]}
