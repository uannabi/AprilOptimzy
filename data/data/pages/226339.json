{"id":226339,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse","text":"An apocalypse is a revelation: seeing something which has been hidden. It comes from the Greek word, \"Apok\u00E1lypsis\", which means \"lifting of the veil\", or finding out something secret. Often this secret is discovered in a dream or a vision.\nIn religion, the word describes Armageddon or the end of the world. This might have come from the words, \"apokalupsis eschaton\", meaning all the secrets will be discovered \"at the end of the \u00E6on, or age\". In Christianity \"The Apocalypse of John\" is the Book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible. It describes the end of the world, and the second coming of Jesus Christ.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Revelation","surface_form":"revelation","offset":19},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":89},{"uri":"Armageddon","surface_form":"Armageddon","offset":272},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":448},{"uri":"Book_of_Revelation","surface_form":"Book of Revelation","offset":493},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":534},{"uri":"Second_coming","surface_form":"second coming","offset":584},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":601}]}
