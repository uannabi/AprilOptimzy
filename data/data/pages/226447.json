{"id":226447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer","text":"Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer (May 21, 1960 \u2013 November 28, 1994) was an American serial killer. He was born in Wisconsin and moved to Ohio in 1966. He murdered young males in Wisconsin and Ohio from 1978-1991. In 1992, he was convicted of 15 murders. Dahmer later confessed to 17 murders in all, dating back to his first victim in 1978. The jury rejected Dahmer's insanity defense, and he was sentenced to 15 life terms (life imprisonment is the maximum penalty that Wisconsin has, but not Ohio, which has the death penalty). He was beaten to death with workout equipment by another inmate, Christopher Scarver, who had been jailed for murder, on the morning of November 28, 1994. Scarver also killed another inmate, Jesse Anderson, at the same time with the workout equipment. Anderson had been jailed for murder as well. They had all been working out together.\nDahmer was diagnosed with three personality disorders: antisocial, borderline and schizotypal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":64},{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":73},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":103},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":126},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":143},{"uri":"Confess","surface_form":"confess","offset":256},{"uri":"Insanity_defense","surface_form":"insanity defense","offset":356},{"uri":"Life_term","surface_form":"life term","offset":401},{"uri":"Inmate","surface_form":"inmate","offset":575},{"uri":"Christopher_Scarver","surface_form":"Christopher Scarver","offset":583},{"uri":"Jesse_Anderson","surface_form":"Jesse Anderson","offset":709},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":799},{"uri":"Personality_disorder","surface_form":"personality disorder","offset":887},{"uri":"Antisocial_personality_disorder","surface_form":"antisocial","offset":910},{"uri":"Borderline_personality_disorder","surface_form":"borderline","offset":922},{"uri":"Schizotypal_personality_disorder","surface_form":"schizotypal","offset":937}]}
