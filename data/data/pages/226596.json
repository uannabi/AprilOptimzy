{"id":226596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reduction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Linguistic reductions are lost sounds in words, which happens in spoken English. For instance, \"going to\" changes to \"gonna\". The most common reductions are contractions. Most contractions are reductions of 'not'. For instance, \"cannot\" becomes \"can't\". Many contractions are reductions between a subject and a verb. For instance, \"He is...\" becomes \"He's...\"\nSome reductions are known to language learners, such as the reduction of a verb and \"to\". Examples are \"going to\" becoming \"gonna\" and \"want to\" becoming \"wanna\".\nLinguistic reductions are part of natural English and should not be considered slang or improper.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phone_(phonetics)","surface_form":"sounds","offset":44},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":85},{"uri":"Contraction","surface_form":"contraction","offset":170},{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":310},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":324},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":615}]}
