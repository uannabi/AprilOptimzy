{"id":226693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Senator","text":"=\"preserve\">A state senator is a member of a state's Senate, the upper house in the bicameral legislature of 49 U.S. states, or a legislator in Nebraska's one house State Legislature.\nThere are usually fewer state senators than there are members in a state's lower house. In the past, this meant that senators represented different regions within a state, not according to the population of the region. This was a way of balancing the power of the lower house, where the numbers for each state were related to the state's population. In 1963, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must give seats in both houses depending on the population of the state.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":53},{"uri":"Upper_house","surface_form":"upper house","offset":65},{"uri":"Bicameral","surface_form":"bicameral","offset":84},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":94},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":112},{"uri":"Legislator","surface_form":"legislator","offset":130},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":144},{"uri":"Unicameral","surface_form":"one house","offset":155},{"uri":"Nebraska_Legislature","surface_form":"State Legislature","offset":165},{"uri":"Lower_house","surface_form":"lower house","offset":259},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Supreme Court of the United States","offset":547}]}
