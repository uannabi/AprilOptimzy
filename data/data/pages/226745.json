{"id":226745,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_cake","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"Not to be confused with Chai tow kway, a type of local dish found in Singapore and Malaysia\"\nCarrot cake is a sweet and moist spice cake, full of cut carrots and toasted nuts, and covered in cream cheese icing. One part of the cake is that the orange flakes of cut carrot give the cake color and texture, along with sweetness and moisture.\nBaking and ingredients.\nTo make carrot cake, all the wet ingredients, such as the typical eggs, vegetable oil, yogurt, melted butter and, are mixed together. Then, all the dry ingredients; such as flour, grated carrots, baking powder, baking soda, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, sugar, brown sugar are typically then mixed together, and the wet are then added to the dry. Many carrot cake recipes have optional ingredients, such as nuts, raisins, pineapple, or coconut.\nPresentation.\nCarrot cake may be eaten plain, but it is commonly either glazed or covered with white icing or cream cheese icing and walnuts, often cut. Often they are decorated with frosting or marzipan made to look like carrots. They are popular in loaf, sheet cake and cupcake form, and (in the United Kingdom as well as North America) can be found pre-packaged at grocery stores, and fresh at bakeries. Some carrot cakes are even layered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chai_tow_kway","surface_form":"Chai tow kway","offset":39},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":84},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":98},{"uri":"Moisture","surface_form":"moist","offset":135},{"uri":"Spice_cake","surface_form":"spice cake","offset":141},{"uri":"Carrot","surface_form":"carrot","offset":165},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nut","offset":185},{"uri":"Cream_cheese","surface_form":"cream cheese","offset":206},{"uri":"Icing","surface_form":"icing","offset":219},{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":259},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":301},{"uri":"Texture","surface_form":"texture","offset":311},{"uri":"Wet","surface_form":"wet","offset":408},{"uri":"Ingredient","surface_form":"ingredients","offset":412},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":445},{"uri":"Mix","surface_form":"mix","offset":497},{"uri":"Recipe","surface_form":"recipe","offset":747},{"uri":"Optional","surface_form":"optional","offset":760},{"uri":"Raisin","surface_form":"raisin","offset":796},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":805},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":819},{"uri":"Glaze","surface_form":"glazed","offset":900},{"uri":"Walnut","surface_form":"walnut","offset":961},{"uri":"Decorate","surface_form":"decorated","offset":996},{"uri":"Marzipan","surface_form":"marzipan","offset":1023},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1126},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1152},{"uri":"Grocery_store","surface_form":"grocery store","offset":1196},{"uri":"Bakery","surface_form":"bakeries","offset":1225},{"uri":"Layer_cake","surface_form":"layered","offset":1262}]}
