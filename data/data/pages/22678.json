{"id":22678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huascar%C3%A1n","text":"Huascar\u00E1n is the highest mountain in Peru, and the fourth-highest mountain in South America. The top of it is 22,205 feet (6,768 meters) high.\nThe mountain is located in the Ancash Region of Peru. Huascar\u00E1n has turned into a tourist attraction for mountain climbers.\nHuascar\u00E1n is all that is left of an extinct volcano. It has been getting smaller and smaller. As recently as 1970, the Ancash Earthquake caused a big part of the mountain to crumble and fall off. That part of the mountain was all rock and ice, and it killed almost 17,000 people in small towns around the mountain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":25},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":37},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":78},{"uri":"Ancash_Region","surface_form":"Ancash Region","offset":174},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist","offset":225},{"uri":"Extinct_volcano","surface_form":"extinct volcano","offset":303},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":376},{"uri":"1970_Ancash_Earthquake","surface_form":"Ancash Earthquake","offset":386},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":497},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":506},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":539},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":555}]}
