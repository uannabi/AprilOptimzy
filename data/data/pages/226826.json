For example \".com\", \".net\" and \".org\" are the most commonly used domain name extensions. The most popular domain extension is.com with more than 100 million domains registered. The.com extension stands for \"commercial\".org for organization and.net for network.\nThere are also country-specific domain name extensions. For example, the United Kingdom has the \".uk\" domain extension and Japan has \".jp\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"URL","surface_form":"web address","offset":47},{"uri":"IP_address","surface_form":"IP address","offset":97},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":610},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":660}]}
