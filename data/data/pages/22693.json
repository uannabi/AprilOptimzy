{"id":22693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu","text":"Armand Jean du Plessis, better known as Cardinal Richelieu (9 September 1585\u20134 December 1642) was a French clergyman, noble, and statesman. His full name was \"Armand Jean du Plessis\". He was later created the Duke of Richelieu and duke of Fronsac.\nIn order to keep the diocese of Lu\u00E7on, Armand Jean needed to become a monk. He joined the Grande Chartreuse, the main monastery of the Carthusian order. This monastery is in the Is\u00E8re d\u00E9partement, near Grenoble. As a comparison, Lu\u00E7on is near La Roche-sur-Yon.\nHe was consecrated as a bishop in 1607. For this he obtained a dispensation of the pope; at age 21, he was too young to become a bishop. He later entered politics and became a Secretary of State in 1616. Richelieu soon rose in both the Church and the state. He became a cardinal in 1622. He became King Louis XIII's chief minister in 1624. He remained in office until his death in 1642; then Jules Cardinal Mazarin became chief minister.\nThe Cardinal de Richelieu was often known by the title of the King's \"Chief Minister\". As a result, he is sometimes said to be the world's first Prime Minister. He sought to consolidate royal power and crush domestic factions. By restraining the power of the nobility, he transformed France into a strongly centralized state. His chief foreign policy objective was to check the power of the Austro-Spanish Habsburg dynasty; although a Roman Catholic cardinal, he did not hesitate to make alliances with Protestant rulers. With these alliances, he tried to achieve this goal. His tenure was marked by the Thirty Years' War that engulfed Europe.\nAs an advocate for Samuel de Champlain and of the keeping of Quebec, he founded the Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00E9s and saw the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye return Quebec to French rule under de Champlain, after the settlement had been captured by the Kirkes in 1629. This in part allowed the colony to eventually develop into the heartland of French-speaking culture in North America.\nRichelieu was also famous for his patronage of the arts; most notably, he founded the Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise, the learned society responsible for matters of the French language. Richelieu is also known by the sobriquet \"l'\u00C9minence rouge\" (\"the Red Eminence\"), from the red shade of a cardinal's vestments and the style \"eminence\" as a cardinal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":100},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clergy","offset":107},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"noble","offset":118},{"uri":"Statesman","surface_form":"statesman","offset":129},{"uri":"Lu%C3%A7on","surface_form":"Lu\u00E7on","offset":280},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":318},{"uri":"Grande_Chartreuse","surface_form":"Grande Chartreuse","offset":338},{"uri":"Carthusian","surface_form":"Carthusian","offset":383},{"uri":"Is%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Is\u00E8re","offset":426},{"uri":"Grenoble","surface_form":"Grenoble","offset":450},{"uri":"La_Roche-sur-Yon","surface_form":"La Roche-sur-Yon","offset":491},{"uri":"Consecrate","surface_form":"consecrate","offset":516},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":533},{"uri":"Dispensation_(Catholic_Church)","surface_form":"dispensation","offset":572},{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"pope","offset":592},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":663},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":685},{"uri":"Cardinal_(Catholicism)","surface_form":"cardinal","offset":779},{"uri":"Louis_XIII_of_France","surface_form":"King Louis XIII's","offset":807},{"uri":"Jules_Cardinal_Mazarin","surface_form":"Jules Cardinal Mazarin","offset":901},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":1092},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"royal power","offset":1133},{"uri":"Centralized_state","surface_form":"centralized state","offset":1254},{"uri":"Foreign_policy","surface_form":"foreign policy","offset":1283},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austro","offset":1338},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1345},{"uri":"Habsburg","surface_form":"Habsburg","offset":1353},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1382},{"uri":"Hesitate","surface_form":"hesitate","offset":1418},{"uri":"Alliance","surface_form":"alliance","offset":1435},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":1450},{"uri":"Tenure","surface_form":"tenure","offset":1526},{"uri":"Thirty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Thirty Years' War","offset":1551},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1583},{"uri":"Advocate","surface_form":"advocate","offset":1597},{"uri":"Samuel_de_Champlain","surface_form":"Samuel de Champlain","offset":1610},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":1652},{"uri":"Compagnie_des_Cent-Associ%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00E9s","offset":1675},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Saint-Germain-en-Laye","surface_form":"Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye","offset":1715},{"uri":"David_Kirke","surface_form":"Kirkes","offset":1842},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":1883},{"uri":"Heartland","surface_form":"heartland","offset":1921},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1961},{"uri":"Patronage","surface_form":"patronage","offset":2010},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":2027},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise","offset":2062},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French language","offset":2133},{"uri":"Sobriquet","surface_form":"sobriquet","offset":2181},{"uri":"Shade","surface_form":"shade","offset":2245},{"uri":"Vestment","surface_form":"vestment","offset":2267},{"uri":"Style_(manner_of_address)","surface_form":"style","offset":2285}]}
