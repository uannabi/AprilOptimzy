{"id":226989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide","text":"An oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugars. Oligosacchardides are carbohydrates. When they are hydrolized, oligosaccharides give 2 to 9 monosaccharides.\nOligosacharides are formed when 2 to 9 monosaccharide units combine with each other by the loss of water molecules, resulting in the formation of a glycosidic linkage. Conversely hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 2 to 9 monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide. Oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides are called trisaccharides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":24},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":58},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":88},{"uri":"Hydrolysis","surface_form":"hydrolized","offset":117}]}
