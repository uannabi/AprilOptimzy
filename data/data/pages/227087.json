{"id":227087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partridge","text":"The partridge is a medium sized bird. They are known as game birds because they are hunted and eaten by humans. They are in the Pheasant family (Phasianidae).\nPartridges are in the song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". The line \"...and a Partridge in a pear tree\" is sung.\nColor and shape.\nMost partridges are brown, gray and white. They are camouflaged and difficult to see. They have short legs and short bills. Partridges are smaller than Pheasants but they are bigger than Quails.\nPartridges can not fly very well and they do not migrate. This means they always stay in the same area all year round.\nHabitat.\nPartridges live in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. They live in places such as moors, grassland and farmland. They feed mostly on seeds, and nest on the ground. This means their nests are not very safe from predators such as foxes. Partridges use their camouflage to make it difficult for predators to see them and their nests.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":32},{"uri":"Pheasant","surface_form":"Pheasant","offset":128},{"uri":"Phasianidae","surface_form":"Phasianidae","offset":145},{"uri":"The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)","surface_form":"\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\"","offset":186},{"uri":"Pear","surface_form":"pear","offset":252},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":257},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":309},{"uri":"Gray","surface_form":"gray","offset":316},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":325},{"uri":"Pheasant","surface_form":"Pheasant","offset":441},{"uri":"Quail","surface_form":"Quail","offset":476},{"uri":"Migrate","surface_form":"migrate","offset":533},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":631},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":639},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":645},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":660},{"uri":"Moor","surface_form":"moor","offset":701},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":708},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":722},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":763},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":829},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":847},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":911}]}
