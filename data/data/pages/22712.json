{"id":22712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people","text":"The Arabs (\u02BBarab) are an ethnic group widespread in the Middle East and North Africa. Arabic is one of the Semitic languages, which is also the name of the ethnic family which they belong to.\nWho is an Arab.\nThere are many people who can be called Arabs by these points, but who do not think of themselves as Arab. Examples include modern Egyptians (Coptics) and the Syriacs (Aramaics/Assyrians). Although they live in countries like Syria or Egypt which is part of the Arab League and speak the official language-Arabic, they are different cultural groups. They have their own languages, culture, identity and churches, such as the Coptic Church and the Syriac Catholic and Orthodox churches. Even though many have assimilated to Arab society, they have their own heritage that spans 3,000 years.\nTraditional genealogy.\nIn Islamic and Jewish tradition, Arabs are a Semitic people who trace their ancestry from Ishmael, a son of the ancient patriarch Abraham and Hagar. Medieval Arab genealogists separate the Arabs into two groups: the \"original Arabs\" of South Arabia, descending from Qahtan (identified with the biblical Joktan) and the \"Arabized Arabs\" (musta`ribah) of North Arabia, descending from Adnan who is descended from Ishmael.\nReligion.\nMost Arabs today follow the religion of Islam, whose greatest prophet is Muhammad. Christianity makes up the largest religious minority - most of the Christians that do consider themselves Arabs belong to the Greek Orthodox Church with smaller numbers of Roman Catholics.\nWhile Coptic and Maronite Catholic Christians are native Arabic-speakers, many reject the Arab pan-ethnicity, but are still considered Arab by outsider sources.\nThere are some small communities practicing Judaism and polytheism (the worship of many gods). Yazidis are sometimes counted as Arabs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":25},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":56},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":72},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":86},{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic languages","offset":107},{"uri":"Copt","surface_form":"Copt","offset":350},{"uri":"Assyrians","surface_form":"Assyrians","offset":385},{"uri":"Coptic_Church","surface_form":"Coptic Church","offset":633},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":836},{"uri":"Semitic_people","surface_form":"Semitic people","offset":866},{"uri":"Ishmael","surface_form":"Ishmael","offset":911},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":951},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":970},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogists","offset":984},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1291},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":1324},{"uri":"Arab_Christians","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":1334},{"uri":"Greek_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Greek Orthodox Church","offset":1460},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1506},{"uri":"Maronite_Church","surface_form":"Maronite","offset":1540},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":1728},{"uri":"Polytheism","surface_form":"polytheism","offset":1740},{"uri":"Yazidi","surface_form":"Yazidi","offset":1779}]}
