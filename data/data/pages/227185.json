{"id":227185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinto_horse","text":"A Pinto horse is a spotted horse. They are not a breed, but a coat color. In fact, any horse breed can be a Pinto as long as they have patches of white or another color. Pintos are often confused with Paints, a horse breed. They look very similar. The difference is that a Paint is a breed, and a Pinto is a coat color that can be on any breed, including Paints.\nHistory.\nPintos are so old that they were found in tombs in Ancient Egypt dating back to 4 B.C. In the 16th century Cortez brought thousands to the New World. Some of them were set free, and Native Americans caught them. The Native Americans liked them for their toughness and their color. Their color blended in with the environment and made a natural camouflage. They were known to make great war horses. Their name came from the Spanish word \"pintado\", which means \u201Cpainted\u201D.\nColor.\nPintos have pink skin, blue eyes, and white or multicolored hooves. They can be either a white horse with colored patches, or a colored horse with white patches. It has been said that no two Pintos are exactly alike.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":27},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":49},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":431},{"uri":"Cortez","surface_form":"Cortez","offset":479},{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":554},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"camouflage","offset":716}]}
