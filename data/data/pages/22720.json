{"id":22720,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte","text":"e=\"preserve\">A mebibyte is a unit of measure. It represents 1024 * 1024 bytes.\nA mebibyte (a contraction of mega binary byte) is a unit of information or computer storage, symbol MiB.\nThe mebibyte is closely related to the megabyte (MB). This can either be a synonym for mebibyte, or refer to 106 bytes = 1,000,000 bytes, depending on context (see binary prefix for background). The two numbers are relatively close together, but mistaking the two has nevertheless led to problems.\nThe unit MiB was defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in December 1998. Use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by IEEE and CIPM and is becoming more common.\nOne mebibyte equals 1024 (= 210) kibibytes, and 1024 mebibytes equal one gibibyte.\nMibibyte is a common misspelling, presumably from the \"i\" in the abbreviation or confusion about how the surrounding prefixes (i.e. \"kibi\" and \"gibi\") were actually formed. The \"i\" is actually from the end of the prefix. Tebi- and pebi- are similarly abbreviated Ti- and Pi-, but they are not usually misspelled, as storage sizes (and corresponding terms) currently are only this large in specialized situations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit of measure","offset":29},{"uri":"Byte","surface_form":"byte","offset":72},{"uri":"Contraction","surface_form":"contraction","offset":93},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":139},{"uri":"Computer_storage","surface_form":"computer storage","offset":154},{"uri":"Megabyte","surface_form":"megabyte","offset":223},{"uri":"Binary_prefix","surface_form":"binary prefix","offset":348},{"uri":"International_Electrotechnical_Commission","surface_form":"International Electrotechnical Commission","offset":514},{"uri":"Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers","surface_form":"IEEE","offset":638},{"uri":"International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","surface_form":"CIPM","offset":647},{"uri":"Kibibyte","surface_form":"kibibyte","offset":714},{"uri":"Gibibyte","surface_form":"gibibyte","offset":754}]}
