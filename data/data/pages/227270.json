{"id":227270,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riodinidae","text":"Riodinidae is a family of butterflies. They are commonly known as riodinids or metalmarks. Metalmarks get their name from the bright, metallic (looking like metal) markings found on the wings of most species. The family has nearly 2,000 species in it. The metalmarks are mostly found in the Neotropical region. Most metalmarks are small. Their wingspan ranges from 20mm to 65mm. Metalmarks vary greatly in wing shape, pattern, and color.\nRiodinidae was formerly known as the family Nemeobiidae and as the family Erycinidae. It was also once thought to be a subfamily of Lycaenidae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":16},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterflies","offset":26},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":186},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":200},{"uri":"Neotropic_ecozone","surface_form":"Neotropical region","offset":291},{"uri":"Wingspan","surface_form":"wingspan","offset":344},{"uri":"Subfamily","surface_form":"subfamily","offset":557},{"uri":"Lycaenidae","surface_form":"Lycaenidae","offset":570}]}
