{"id":22733,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar","text":"The Zimbabwe dollar was a currency for Zimbabwe from 1980 to 2009. Zimbabwe had the highest rate of inflation in the world. The rate of inflation grew to 231,150,888.87% in July 2008.\nBecause of hyperinflation, or inflation that is out of control, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had to print banknotes with higher values to cope with the rising cost of living. In January 2009, Zimbabwe released a banknote for one hundred trillion dollars, or $100,000,000,000,000.\nThe Zimbabwe dollar had to be revalued three times due to the rising cost of living: in August 2006, August 2008 and February 2009. In August 2006, the first revaluation dollar was violent and too quick, meaning that many people lost their savings because they were unable to convert it into the new currency without fear of violence and corruption.\nSince 12 April 2009, Zimbabwe stopped using the Zimbabwean dollar and adopted currencies from other countries, such as the United States Dollar and the Euro.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":39},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":100},{"uri":"Hyperinflation","surface_form":"hyperinflation","offset":195},{"uri":"Reserve_Bank_of_Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe","offset":252},{"uri":"Banknote","surface_form":"banknote","offset":290},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":802},{"uri":"United_States_Dollar","surface_form":"United States Dollar","offset":937},{"uri":"Euro","surface_form":"Euro","offset":966}]}
