{"id":227378,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_crested_grebe","text":"The great crested grebe is a water bird. It is a member of the grebe family. Its scientific name is \"Podiceps cristatus\".\nDescription.\nThe great crested grebe is a medium sized bird. It is 46\u201351\u00A0cm long. Its wingspan (both wings open) is 59\u201373\u00A0cm long.\nThe bird is white, brown and black, and it has orange crest feathers on its head. It has a long, sharp pink bill. Baby great crested grebe have black and white stripes on their heads.\nHabitat and behaviour.\nThe great crested grebe is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. It is the biggest grebe in Europe. It lives in freshwater lakes. It eats crustaceans (for example, crabs), insects and small frogs. It dives into the water to find food.\nThe bird has an interesting mating ritual. This means two birds (male and female) do a \"dance\" in the water before they mate. Grebes dance every time the pair meets, and the dance varies according to the circumstance. Returning to the nest is different from meeting out on the water, for instance. Most dances end in a bout of head-shaking.\nThe great crested grebe makes a nest from plants. The nest floats on top of the water. A pair of grebes will usually have two eggs. When the babies are born, they cannot swim. Their parents teach them to swim and dive. Sometimes the babies will sit on their parents backs while the parents swim in the water.\nConservation.\nThe bird nearly became extinct in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. This is because people wanted to use their orange head feathers. People wanted to put the feathers on their hats and clothes. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) stopped this. There are now many great crested grebe in the United Kingdom, where their conservation status is \"green\" (\"least concern\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":35},{"uri":"Grebe","surface_form":"grebe","offset":63},{"uri":"Scientific_name","surface_form":"scientific name","offset":81},{"uri":"Wingspan","surface_form":"wingspan","offset":208},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":265},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":272},{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":300},{"uri":"Crest_(feathers)","surface_form":"crest","offset":307},{"uri":"Feathers","surface_form":"feathers","offset":313},{"uri":"Stripe","surface_form":"stripes","offset":413},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":496},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":504},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":510},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":521},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":579},{"uri":"Lakes","surface_form":"lakes","offset":590},{"uri":"Crustaceans","surface_form":"crustaceans","offset":605},{"uri":"Crab","surface_form":"crab","offset":631},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":639},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":657},{"uri":"Mating_ritual","surface_form":"mating ritual","offset":730},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":767},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":776},{"uri":"Mate","surface_form":"mate","offset":822},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":1075},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":1389},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1404},{"uri":"Hat","surface_form":"hat","offset":1548},{"uri":"Clothes","surface_form":"clothes","offset":1557},{"uri":"RSPB","surface_form":"RSPB","offset":1570},{"uri":"Conservation_status","surface_form":"conservation status","offset":1707},{"uri":"Least_concern","surface_form":"least concern","offset":1740}]}
