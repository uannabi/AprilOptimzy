It is about from Melbourne along the Hume Highway. The city of Benalla is to the south west, and Albury and Wodonga to the north east. The Ovens and King Rivers which flow from the Victorian Alps meet at Wangaratta. It is in the local government area of the Rural City of Wangaratta.\nHistory.\nGold was found in the area during the 1850s. A Post Office opened on 1 February 1843, as Ovens, and moved to the town and was renamed Wangaratta in 1854. The Ovens office, and the Kilmore office which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District (Victoria). They were also the first two inland offices.\nThe small town of Glenrowan about 10\u00A0km away is known as the site of the final shootout that led to the capture of Australia's most famous bushranger, Ned Kelly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Victoria, Australia","offset":65},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":103},{"uri":"Hume_Highway","surface_form":"Hume Highway","offset":123},{"uri":"Benalla%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Benalla","offset":149},{"uri":"Albury%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Albury","offset":183},{"uri":"Wodonga%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Wodonga","offset":194},{"uri":"Ovens_River%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Ovens","offset":225},{"uri":"King_River_(Victoria)","surface_form":"King","offset":235},{"uri":"Victorian_Alps","surface_form":"Victorian Alps","offset":267},{"uri":"Rural_City_of_Wangaratta","surface_form":"Rural City of Wangaratta","offset":344},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"Gold","offset":379},{"uri":"Post_office","surface_form":"Post Office","offset":426},{"uri":"Kilmore%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Kilmore","offset":559},{"uri":"Glenrowan%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Glenrowan","offset":738},{"uri":"Bushranger","surface_form":"bushranger","offset":859},{"uri":"Ned_Kelly","surface_form":"Ned Kelly","offset":871}]}
