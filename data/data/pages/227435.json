It is the second-largest place in Yukon, after Whitehorse, and has 1,327 people.\nDawson was at its biggest during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, and served as a base for mining. Many people became rich not from finding gold, but from running boarding houses/general stores because of good business from all of the miners. It was the capital of Yukon from 1898 to 1952.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yukon_Territory","surface_form":"Yukon Territory","offset":30},{"uri":"Whitehorse%2C_Yukon","surface_form":"Whitehorse","offset":140},{"uri":"Klondike_Gold_Rush","surface_form":"Klondike Gold Rush","offset":211}]}
