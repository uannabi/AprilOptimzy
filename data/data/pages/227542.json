Its job is to support organ playing and choral music. People who learn the organ can go there to take professional organ examinations.\nThere is a large library with more than 60,000 books about organ playing and organ music.\nWhen the RCO started in 1864 by Richard Limpus it was called the \"College of Organists\". It was given a Royal Charter in 1893. In 1903 it was offered an extremely cheap 99-year lease on a beautiful building in Kensington, West London. The college was there until 1991 when it moved to a church in the City of London. In 2003 it moved again to Birmingham.\nExaminations.\nThe RCO offers five qualifications or diplomas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":71},{"uri":"Pipe_organ","surface_form":"organ","offset":144},{"uri":"Choir","surface_form":"choral","offset":162},{"uri":"Richard_Limpus","surface_form":"Richard Limpus","offset":379},{"uri":"Royal_Charter","surface_form":"Royal Charter","offset":451},{"uri":"Lease","surface_form":"lease","offset":524},{"uri":"Kensington","surface_form":"Kensington","offset":557},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":690},{"uri":"Diploma","surface_form":"diploma","offset":754}]}
