{"id":22765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge","text":"A sponge is a member of the phylum Porifera. It is a simple animal with many cells, but no mouth, muscles, heart or brain. It is sessile: it cannot move from place to place the way most animals can. A sponge is an animal that grows in one spot like most plants do. Nevertheless, sponges are quite successful.\nThe basic body plan is a jelly-like layer sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Their bodies are full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them. Most of them feed on bacteria and other microorganisms. A few of them eat tiny crustaceans.\nThere are more than 10,000 species of sponge. Most sponges live in the ocean. A few live in fresh water. All sponges take in water through pores (little holes) in their bodies. The water goes out through a big tube in the center. Most sponges filter (take out) little bits of food from the water going through their bodies. Animals that get food this way are called filter feeders.\nSponges are the oldest animals with fossil evidence (from ~635 million years ago).\nWhat makes them different.\nSponges are simple animals. A few things make them different from other animals.\nDifferent kinds of sponges.\nThere are four classes of sponges. The difference between these kinds is in how their skeleton is made.\nMovement.\nSponges are sessile, they live in one place, where they are \"fixed\" to the ground. A few sponges can change their position, they can move at speeds of between 1\u00A0mm and 4\u00A0mm a day. They do this like amoebae. A few species can contract their whole bodies. Many can close their openings/holes.\nCarnivorous sponges.\nA few species live in waters where there is very little food available. They have therefore changed, and became predators. They eat small crustaceans and other small animals. Most of these sponges belong to the family Cladorhizidae, but a few members of the Guitarridae and Esperiopsidae are also carnivores. In most cases little is known about how they actually capture prey. Some species are thought to use either sticky threads or hooked spicules. Most carnivorous sponges live in deep waters, up to, and the development of deep-ocean exploration techniques is expected to lead to the discovery of several more. However one species has been found in Mediterranean caves at depths of 17-23m alongside the more usual filter feeding sponges. The cave-dwelling predators capture crustaceans under long by entangling them with fine threads, digest them by enveloping them with further threads over the course of a few days, and then return to their normal shape; there is no evidence that they use venom.\nMost known carnivorous sponges have completely lost the water flow system and choanocytes. However the genus \"Chondrocladia\" uses a highly modified water flow system to inflate balloon-like structures that are used for capturing prey.\nAsexual reproduction.\nSponges usually reproduce when little pieces break off. If such a piece has the right types of cells it can grow to become a new sponge. A few sponges can also use budding. With budding a small sponge grows on the parent; when it is done growing, it simply \"falls off\". When the conditions are bad, some sponges can also grow lumps of unspecialised cells. These will not develop until the conditions improve again. They can then either make a new sponge, or they can use the skeleton of the parent sponge (that died).\nSexual reproduction.\nMost sponges reproduce sexually. They can make sperm cells that are released into the water. These are either captured by another sponge, and are then transported to the egg cells of the parent. This is known as \"viviparous\". Both cells are joined to form larvae, which can swim off to find a good place to settle.\nThe other way, known as \"oviparous\" is that both sperm cells and egg cells are released into the water. These then combine outside the sponges.\nBy dolphins.\nA report in 1997 described how bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay used sponges as tools: A dolphin may attach a marine sponge to its rostrum (snoutlike projection). It is thought the sponge is used to protect the rostrum when the dolphin is looking for food in the sandy sea bottom but scientists have not confirmed this. The behaviour, known as \"sponging\", has only been seen in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behaviour to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related. This suggests that it is a fairly recent innovation. Dolphins also use sponges as an exfoliator, rubbing their skin against the sponge attached to the rock to get rid of their old/dry skin.\nBy people.\nThe calcium carbonate or silica spicules of most sponges make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, \"Hippospongia\" and \"Spongia\", have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until synthetic sponges were invented, they were also used as cleaning tools, for painting, and as contraceptives. In the 20th century, overfishing is a problem. This has caused the animals, as well as the industry behind it to be close to extinction.\nMany objects with sponge-like textures are now made of substances that do not come from poriferans. Synthetic \"sponges\" include personal and household cleaning tools; breast implants; contraceptive sponges.\nThe luffa \"sponge\", also spelled \"loofah\", which is commonly sold for use in the kitchen or the bath, is not derived from an animal but from the fibrous \"skeleton\" of a gourd (Cucurbitaceae).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":28},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":60},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":91},{"uri":"Muscles","surface_form":"muscles","offset":98},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":107},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":116},{"uri":"Sessile","surface_form":"sessile","offset":129},{"uri":"Pore_(skin)","surface_form":"pores","offset":421},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":503},{"uri":"Microorganisms","surface_form":"microorganisms","offset":522},{"uri":"Crustacea","surface_form":"crustacea","offset":561},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":601},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":645},{"uri":"Filter_feeder","surface_form":"filter feeder","offset":940},{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"classes","offset":1190},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":1261},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"Movement","offset":1279},{"uri":"Sessile","surface_form":"sessile","offset":1301},{"uri":"Amoeba","surface_form":"amoeba","offset":1487},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":1713},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":1739},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":1812},{"uri":"Cladorhizidae","surface_form":"Cladorhizidae","offset":1819},{"uri":"Guitarridae","surface_form":"Guitarridae","offset":1859},{"uri":"Esperiopsidae","surface_form":"Esperiopsidae","offset":1875},{"uri":"Spicule","surface_form":"spicule","offset":2042},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":2254},{"uri":"Filter_feeding","surface_form":"filter feeding","offset":2319},{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venom","offset":2597},{"uri":"Choanocyte","surface_form":"choanocyte","offset":2682},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":2707},{"uri":"Chondrocladia","surface_form":"Chondrocladia","offset":2714},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproduce","offset":2877},{"uri":"Budding","surface_form":"budding","offset":3025},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":3336},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":3447},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"egg cells","offset":3570},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":3656},{"uri":"Bottlenose_dolphin","surface_form":"bottlenose dolphin","offset":3903},{"uri":"Shark_Bay","surface_form":"Shark Bay","offset":3926},{"uri":"Rostrum_(anatomy)","surface_form":"rostrum","offset":4003},{"uri":"Sea_floor","surface_form":"sea bottom","offset":4141},{"uri":"Calcium_carbonate","surface_form":"calcium carbonate","offset":4639},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":4660},{"uri":"Spicule","surface_form":"spicule","offset":4667},{"uri":"Hippospongia","surface_form":"Hippospongia","offset":4744},{"uri":"Fiber","surface_form":"fibrous","offset":4793},{"uri":"Contraceptive","surface_form":"contraceptive","offset":5050},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":5073},{"uri":"Overfishing","surface_form":"overfishing","offset":5087},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":5191},{"uri":"Sponge_(tool)","surface_form":"cleaning tools","offset":5354},{"uri":"Breast_implant","surface_form":"breast implant","offset":5370},{"uri":"Contraceptive_sponge","surface_form":"contraceptive sponge","offset":5387},{"uri":"Luffa","surface_form":"luffa","offset":5414},{"uri":"Gourd","surface_form":"gourd","offset":5579},{"uri":"Cucurbitaceae","surface_form":"Cucurbitaceae","offset":5586}]}
