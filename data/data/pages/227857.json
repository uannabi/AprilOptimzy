{"id":227857,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens","text":"A Fresnel lens is an optical lens, which was originally developed for Lighthouses. It is named after its inventor, French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The name is pronounced /fre\u026A\u02C8n\u025Bl/ (fray-NELL), the 's' is silent. Before Fresnel, Buffon and Condorcet proposed a similar design, as a way to make large burning lenses.\nThe design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material that would be required in conventional lens design. Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner. More light can pass through. Lighthouses that use these kind of lenses can be seen from farther away.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lens_(optics)","surface_form":"optical lens","offset":21},{"uri":"Lighthouse","surface_form":"Lighthouse","offset":70},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":115},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physicist","offset":122},{"uri":"Augustin-Jean_Fresnel","surface_form":"Augustin-Jean Fresnel","offset":132},{"uri":"Georges-Louis_Leclerc%2C_Comte_de_Buffon","surface_form":"Buffon","offset":237},{"uri":"Marquis_de_Condorcet","surface_form":"Condorcet","offset":248},{"uri":"Burning_lens","surface_form":"burning lens","offset":308},{"uri":"Aperture","surface_form":"aperture","offset":378},{"uri":"Focal_length","surface_form":"focal length","offset":397},{"uri":"Lens_(optics)","surface_form":"lens","offset":491}]}
