{"id":227881,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Feen","text":"\"Die Feen\" (\"The Fairies\") is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. The German libretto was written by the composer. He was adapting a story by Carlo Gozzi called \"La donna serpente\".\n\"Die Feen\" was the first opera that Wagner finished. However, it was never performed during his lifetime. It has never become popular, although the overture is sometimes played. The music shows the influence of Carl Maria von Weber and other composers of the time. It also shows some musical ideas that Wagner was to develop later in his life in his famous operas. The fairy tale atmosphere in the story is also an idea that he uses in his later operas which deal with fantasy stories. The idea of being saved (redemption) is also an important idea that he used in later operas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["opera"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":33},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":56},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":83},{"uri":"Overture","surface_form":"overture","offset":336},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":386},{"uri":"Carl_Maria_von_Weber","surface_form":"Carl Maria von Weber","offset":399}]}
