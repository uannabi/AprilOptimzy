He helps the people to get power. At first he is very popular, but then he has to use force against the nobles, and the Church turns against him. In the end the ordinary people burn the Capitol where Rienzi and his friends are sheltering.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["opera"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":24},{"uri":"Tribunes","surface_form":"Tribunes","offset":118},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":215},{"uri":"Semperoper","surface_form":"Hofoper","offset":356},{"uri":"Dresden","surface_form":"Dresden","offset":365},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":491},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":554},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":563},{"uri":"Campidoglio","surface_form":"Capitol","offset":826}]}
