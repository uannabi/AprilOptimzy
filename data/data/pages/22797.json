{"id":22797,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude","text":"The amplitude or peak amplitude of a wave is a measure of how big its oscillation is.\nAmplitudes are always measured as positive numbers (for example: 3.5, 1, 120) and are never negative (for example: -3.5, -1, -120). That's because distance can only be greater than zero or equal to zero; negative distance does not exist.\nThe distance from the top of one peak to the bottom of another is called \"peak-to-peak amplitude\". Another way to describe peak-to-peak amplitude is to say that it is the distance between the maximum positive value and the maximum negative value of a wave.is the maximum displacement of a wave from an equilibrium position","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":37},{"uri":"Oscillation","surface_form":"oscillation","offset":70},{"uri":"Positive_numbers","surface_form":"positive numbers","offset":120},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":178}]}
