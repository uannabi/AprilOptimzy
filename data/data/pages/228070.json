{"id":228070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Buckles","text":"Frank Buckles (1 February 1901 \u2013 27th February 2011) was the last living American veteran who fought in World War I.\nEarly life and career.\nBuckles was born in Bethany, Missouri. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at the beginning of America's involvement in World War I in April 1917. Only 16 years old at the time, Buckles was asked by his recruiter to show a birth certificate. Later Buckles said of that event, \"\u201CI was just 16 and didn\u2019t look a day older. I confess to you that I lied to more than one recruiter. I gave them my solemn word that I was 18, but I\u2019d left my birth certificate back home in the family Bible. They\u2019d take one look at me and laugh and tell me to go home before my mother noticed I was gone. Somehow I got the idea that telling an even bigger whopper was the way to go. So I told the next recruiter that I was 21 and darned if he didn\u2019t sign me up on the spot! I enlisted in the Army on the 14th of August 1917.\"\nBefore being accepted into the United States Army, he was turned down by the Marine Corps due to his slight weight.\nIn 1917, Buckles was sent to Europe on the RMS Carpathia, which had rescued RMS Titanic survivors five years earlier. During the war Buckles served in England and France, driving ambulances and motorcycles for the Army's 1st Fort Riley Casualty Detachment.\nAfter the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. Following his discharge in 1919, he attended the dedication of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of those Americans who died in World War I. While there, he met General John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, commander of all U.S. forces in France during the war.\nIn the 1940s Buckles worked for a shipping company in Manila, Philippines. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942 and spent the next three and a half years in the Los Ba\u00F1os prison camp.\nHe became malnourished, with a weight below 100\u00A0lb, and developed beriberi, yet led his fellow inmates in calisthenics. He was rescued on February 23, 1945.\nHe died on 27 February 2011 at 110 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":73},{"uri":"Veteran","surface_form":"veteran","offset":82},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":104},{"uri":"Bethany%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Bethany, Missouri","offset":160},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":253},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":967},{"uri":"United_States_Marines_Corps","surface_form":"Marine Corps","offset":1013},{"uri":"RMS_Carpathia","surface_form":"RMS Carpathia","offset":1095},{"uri":"RMS_Titanic","surface_form":"RMS Titanic","offset":1128},{"uri":"Ambulance","surface_form":"ambulance","offset":1231},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":1246},{"uri":"Fort_Riley","surface_form":"Fort Riley","offset":1277},{"uri":"Armistice_with_Germany_(Compi%C3%A8gne)","surface_form":"Armistice","offset":1319},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City, Missouri","offset":1476},{"uri":"General_of_the_Armies","surface_form":"General","offset":1572},{"uri":"John_J._Pershing","surface_form":"John \"Black Jack\" Pershing","offset":1580},{"uri":"Manila%2C_Philippines","surface_form":"Manila, Philippines","offset":1717},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1761},{"uri":"Beriberi","surface_form":"beriberi","offset":1916}]}
