{"id":228079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Campbell_Ross","text":"e=\"preserve\">John Campbell Ross (11 March 1899 - 3 June 2009) was the last living Australian World War I veteran.\nBorn in Newtown, Victoria, a suburb of Geelong, Ross served as a wireless operator in the First Australian Imperial Force, enlisting in January 1918, but never left Australia or saw active service. He later went on to serve in the Second World War as a corporal with the 20th Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps.\nHis wife, Irene (n\u00E9e Laird), had been deceased by several decades before Jack Ross's death. He is survived by a son, Robert, a daughter, Peggy Ashburn, four grandchildren- Janette, Heather, Kay, and John - and nine great-grand children.\nOn 11 November 1998, Jack Ross had been awarded the 80th Anniversary Armistice Medal to mark the end of World War I. Jack also had been awarded the Centenary Medal for doing his share to the Australian society in the 100 years since the federation.\nThe death of William Evan Allan in October 2005 left Ross as the last Australian digger from World War I. However Claude Choules, a World War I veteran who served for Britain, lived in Western Australia. Ross became Australia's oldest man at the age of 108, on 12 June 2007, upon the death of Frank Scarrabelotti. Following the death of 112 year old E. Beatrice Riley, he was verified as the oldest person in Australia.\nRoss celebrated his 110th birthday with chocolates and cake and a commemorative letter from the Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd.\nAs a civilian, Ross worked for Victorian Railways until he retired in 1964. Ross died peacefully in his sleep at approximately 4 am. at the Golden Oaks Nursing Home in Bendigo on 3\u00A0June 2009, aged 110.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Newtown%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Newtown, Victoria","offset":122},{"uri":"Geelong%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Geelong","offset":153},{"uri":"First_Australian_Imperial_Force","surface_form":"First Australian Imperial Force","offset":204},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":345},{"uri":"Volunteer_Defence_Corps_(Australia)","surface_form":"Volunteer Defence Corps","offset":401},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":767},{"uri":"Centenary_Medal","surface_form":"Centenary Medal","offset":811},{"uri":"William_Evan_Allan","surface_form":"William Evan Allan","offset":925},{"uri":"Digger_(soldier)","surface_form":"digger","offset":993},{"uri":"Claude_Choules","surface_form":"Claude Choules","offset":1026},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":1097},{"uri":"Frank_Scarrabelotti","surface_form":"Frank Scarrabelotti","offset":1205},{"uri":"E._Beatrice_Riley","surface_form":"E.
