{"id":228206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine","text":"A fire engine is a vehicle that is designed to help in fighting fires. A fire engine carries hoses, a pump, a water tank and breathing equipment. It will also have rescue equipment, such as ladders, ropes and cutting tools, and usually first aid kits as well. A fire engine brings firefighters to the scene from the fire station. It will also have sirens and flashing lights to warn traffic along the way.\nIn the Middle Ages, the only way to fight a fire was with buckets of water. In the 16th century, hand-powered pumps were invented. In the 19th century, the design of these pumps was improved, so that horses could wheel them to the scene. Later, steam power was used to turn both the pumps and the wheels. The first modern fire engine was invented in 1905 by Knox Automobile in Springfield, Massachusetts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":19},{"uri":"First_aid","surface_form":"first aid kits","offset":236},{"uri":"Firefighters","surface_form":"firefighters","offset":281},{"uri":"Fire_station","surface_form":"fire station","offset":316},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":413},{"uri":"Steam_power","surface_form":"steam power","offset":651},{"uri":"Springfield%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Springfield, Massachusetts","offset":783}]}
