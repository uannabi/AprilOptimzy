{"id":228244,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna","text":"Manna, sometimes spelled mana, is the name of a food which, according to the Pentateuch of the Bible, the Israelites ate while they were traveling 40 years in the desert after leaving Egypt, which God provided because they had nothing to eat. Every morning they would gather the white flakes that covered the ground. It is said to have a sweet taste. When they got tired of manna, God gave them quail (bird).\nWhere did they come from?\nManna was called the \"bread of heaven\" because it seemed to come from Heaven, according to the Bible. Some suggest that they were a type of locust; some say that it was the sap of a tree which is known to satisfy hunger. In the Mishna, it is said that it was made during twilight of the sixth day of Creation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pentateuch","surface_form":"Pentateuch","offset":77},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":95},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":106},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":163},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":184},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":197},{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":338},{"uri":"Quail","surface_form":"quail","offset":395},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"Heaven","offset":505},{"uri":"Locust","surface_form":"locust","offset":575},{"uri":"Sap","surface_form":"sap","offset":608},{"uri":"Satisfy","surface_form":"satisfy","offset":640},{"uri":"Mishna","surface_form":"Mishna","offset":663},{"uri":"Twilight","surface_form":"twilight","offset":706}]}
