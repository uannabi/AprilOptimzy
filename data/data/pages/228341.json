{"id":228341,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer","text":"Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a kind of cancer from any part of the stomach. Stomach cancer causes about 800,000 deaths worldwide per year. The odds of survival are 5 to 15%. The life span of someone with stomach cancer is five to fifteen years. This is because this type of cancer can spread faster than other cancers.\nMost stomach cancer is caused by \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection. Diet foods are not proven causes, but some foods, such as smoked foods, salted fish and meat, and pickled vegetables are associated with a higher risk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":48},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":76},{"uri":"Helicobacter_pylori","surface_form":"Helicobacter pylori","offset":362},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"Diet","offset":394}]}
