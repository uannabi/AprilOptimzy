David\nH. Jarvis, Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding; Second Lieut. Ellsworth\nP. Bertholf, Revenue-Cutter Service, and Dr. Samuel J. Call, surgeon of\nThey were materially aided by Mr. W.T. Lopp, agent of the American Missionary Society at Cape Prince of Wales, and Artisarlook, a native of that region, both of whom, at great personal sacrifice, left their families and accompanied the reindeer herd to Point Barrow.\nThe overland expedition, after a difficult and hazardous journey of\nnearly 2,000 miles through the storms and bitter cold of an Arctic\nwinter, reached Point Barrow with the herd on the 29th of March, 1898,\nthree months and twelve days from their landing from the \"Bear\" at\nCape Vancouver, Alaskan coast of Bering Sea.
