{"id":228472,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Strait","text":"=\"preserve\">Cook Strait is the body of water between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the west with the South Pacific Ocean on the east.\nThe strait is named after James Cook, who was the first European commander to sail through it. The strait has an average depth of 128 metres (420 feet). The weather and tide patterns are often very strange there. The most common way to get across is by ferry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_Island","surface_form":"North","offset":57},{"uri":"South_Island","surface_form":"South Island","offset":67},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":84},{"uri":"Tasman_Sea","surface_form":"Tasman Sea","offset":113},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":151},{"uri":"James_Cook","surface_form":"James Cook","offset":204},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":431}]}
