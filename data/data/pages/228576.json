{"id":228576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranni","text":"Tyranni is a suborder of passerine birds. They are also known as the suboscines. There are about 1,000 species in this suborder. Most of them live in South America.\nThese birds are different to the passeri (songbirds) because they have a different syrinx. This is part of the bird's voice box which makes bird song. Scientists have also done studies on DNA and fossils to show that the tyranni suborder is different to the passeri suborder.\nTaxonomy.\nThe tyranni suborder can be split into three infraorders: Acanthisittides, Eurylaimides, and Tyrannide.\nThe first group, the Acanthisittidae, are also known as the New Zealand \"wrens\". At the moment, scientists are unsure whether they should belong to the tyranni or not. Some scientists think they are too different and they should be in their own suborder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suborder","surface_form":"suborder","offset":13},{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"passerine","offset":25},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":35},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":103},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":150},{"uri":"Passeri","surface_form":"passeri","offset":198},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":353},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":361}]}
