{"id":228625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus_paper","text":"Litmus paper is a mixture which is made from different dyes which can be taken from lichens. It is water-soluble. It is used to tell whether a solution is an acid or an alkali.\nLitmus paper is put onto filter paper. The paper can then be used to give a rough indication of the pH value of a solution. Blue litmus paper will turn red, when acid is present; red litmus paper will turn blue when alkalines are present. At room temperature, this usually happens for PH values between 4.5 and 8.3.\nAlternatively, a solution can be prepared which works the same way, but does not need the paper.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mixture","surface_form":"mixture","offset":18},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":55},{"uri":"Lichen","surface_form":"lichen","offset":84},{"uri":"Water-soluble","surface_form":"water-soluble","offset":99},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":158},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"alkali","offset":169},{"uri":"Filter_paper","surface_form":"filter paper","offset":202},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":277},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":339},{"uri":"Alkaline","surface_form":"alkaline","offset":393}]}
