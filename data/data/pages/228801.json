{"id":228801,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value","text":"In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus of a real number\u00A0, written as or formula_1, is the non-negative value of\u00A0 when the sign is dropped. That is, for a positive\u00A0, for a negative\u00A0 (in which case is positive), and.\nSimilarly, the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number may be thought of as its distance from the origin. It is defined by the equation\nReal numbers.\nFor any real number\u00A0, the absolute value of\u00A0 is denoted by (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity), and is defined as\nThe absolute value of\u00A0 is always either positive or zero, but never negative.\nFrom an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line. The absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them.\nIn calculus, the absolute value function is differentiable except at 0. It is everywhere continuous.\nIn linear algebra, the norm of a vector is defined similarly as the distance from the tip of the vector to the origin. This is similar to the way the absolute value of a complex number is defined.\nThe square-root notation without sign represents the \"positive\" square root. So, it follows that\nwhich is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value.\nComplex numbers.\nFor a complex number formula_1, where x is the real part of z and y is the imaginary part of z,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":51},{"uri":"Non-negative","surface_form":"non-negative","offset":97},{"uri":"Sign_(mathematics)","surface_form":"sign","offset":129},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive","offset":161},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":178},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":270},{"uri":"Origin_(mathematics)","surface_form":"origin","offset":328},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":388},{"uri":"Vertical_bar","surface_form":"vertical bar","offset":442},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive","offset":544},{"uri":"0_(number)","surface_form":"zero","offset":556},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":572},{"uri":"Analytic_geometry","surface_form":"analytic geometry","offset":590},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":676},{"uri":"Real_number_line","surface_form":"real number line","offset":705},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":813},{"uri":"Differentiable","surface_form":"differentiable","offset":854},{"uri":"Continuous","surface_form":"continuous","offset":899},{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"linear algebra","offset":914},{"uri":"Norm_(mathematics)","surface_form":"norm","offset":934},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":944},{"uri":"Square-root","surface_form":"square-root","offset":1112},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":1287},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real","offset":1328},{"uri":"Imaginary_number","surface_form":"imaginary","offset":1356}]}
