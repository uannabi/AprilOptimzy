{"id":229090,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor","text":"The Holodomor (, which means \"murder by hunger\") was a man-made famine that happened in Ukraine in 1932 and in 1933. At that time, Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. About seven million people starved to death in the Holodomor.\nJoseph Stalin was the leader and dictator of the Soviet Union, which was a communist country. He made farmers in the Soviet Union change the way they farmed, then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the government-owned farms, for less money. Many people in the Ukraine did not want to go along with this. When the Ukraine had a famine, Stalin refused to help the people in the Ukraine. Instead, the government took food away from people. It became illegal (against the law) to pick up food from the ground of fields. The government also tried to stop people from moving around the country to look for food.\nScholars and politicians using the word Holodomor say the man-made aspects of the famine, was a genocide; some consider the huge loss of life comparable to the Holocaust. They argue that the Soviet policies were an attack on the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and therefore is a genocide.\nOther scholars say that the Holodomor was an unexpected consequence of the rapid and massive industrialization started by Stalin, that brought radical economic changes to the farmers and the country, and which was not done on purpose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":30},{"uri":"Hunger","surface_form":"hunger","offset":40},{"uri":"Man-made","surface_form":"man-made","offset":55},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":64},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":88},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":157},{"uri":"Starvation","surface_form":"starved","offset":198},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":233},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":255},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":266},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":308},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":335},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":445},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"owned","offset":456},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":462},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":478},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":642},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":658},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":691},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":712},{"uri":"Field","surface_form":"field","offset":752},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"Scholar","offset":850},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":863},{"uri":"Man-made","surface_form":"man-made","offset":908},{"uri":"Aspect","surface_form":"aspect","offset":917},{"uri":"Genocide","surface_form":"genocide","offset":946},{"uri":"Comparison","surface_form":"comparable","offset":992},{"uri":"Holocaust","surface_form":"Holocaust","offset":1010},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policies","offset":1048},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalism","offset":1097},{"uri":"Industrialization","surface_form":"industrialization","offset":1231},{"uri":"Radical","surface_form":"radical","offset":1281},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":1289}]}
