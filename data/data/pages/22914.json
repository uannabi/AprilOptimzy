It split off from Austria-Hungary in 1918 and split apart in 1993.\nIn mid-1938 Nazi Germany took over Czechoslovakia and split off Slovakia. After World War II the USSR annexed a part of eastern Czechoslovakia so that they could have a border with Hungary. The USSR also annexed parts of Poland and Romania. All four of these countries were in the USSR's sphere of influence. The USSR thought that this meant they could make sure the countries did what they wanted. In 1968 the USSR thought that the government of Alexander Dubcek was moving away from communism and leaving the Warsaw Pact, and invaded Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1989 Czechoslovakia peacefully removed the Communist dictatorship in the \"Velvet Revolution\".\nOn 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both countries separated in peace.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":51},{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":77},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":138},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":190},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":206},{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"USSR","offset":223},{"uri":"Carpatho-Ukraine","surface_form":"part","offset":238},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":307},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":347},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":358},{"uri":"Suzerainty","surface_form":"sphere of influence","offset":414},{"uri":"Alexander_Dub%C4%8Dek","surface_form":"Alexander Dubcek","offset":573},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communism","offset":611},{"uri":"Warsaw_Pact","surface_form":"Warsaw Pact","offset":637},{"uri":"Prague_Spring","surface_form":"invaded Czechoslovakia","offset":654},{"uri":"Velvet_Revolution","surface_form":"Velvet Revolution","offset":755},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":824},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":843}]}
