{"id":22924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod","text":"Arthropods (Greek language for \"joint-legged\") are a large group of invertebrate animals. Insects, spiders, crabs, shrimp, millipedes, and centipedes are all arthropods. In the scientific classification, all arthropods are members of the phylum Arthropoda. Arthropods have segmented body, an exoskeleton and legs with joints. Most arthropods live on land, but some live in water. Arthropods have by far the greatest number of species of any animal group. Arthropods are a source of food for many animals, including humans.\nDiversity.\nScientists know of more than 1 million species of arthropods. 80% of all known animal species are arthropods. Many more species have not yet been described.\nMost arthropod species are insects. \"Insects are the most diverse organisms in the history of life\".\nMost arthropods live on land. The phylum Arthropoda is the only phylum of invertebrates that mostly live on land. But crustaceans (crabs, shrimp and their relatives) mostly live in water.\nArthropods are also the first phylum to develop genuine flight.\nDescription.\nArthropods have a hard exoskeleton. The exoskeleton reduces the loss of water (dessication). This helps them to live on land without drying out.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek language","offset":12},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":68},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"Insect","offset":90},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":99},{"uri":"Crab","surface_form":"crab","offset":108},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":115},{"uri":"Millipede","surface_form":"millipede","offset":123},{"uri":"Centipede","surface_form":"centipede","offset":139},{"uri":"Biological_classification","surface_form":"scientific classification","offset":177},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":238},{"uri":"Arthropoda","surface_form":"Arthropoda","offset":245},{"uri":"Segmented","surface_form":"segmented","offset":273},{"uri":"Exoskeleton","surface_form":"exoskeleton","offset":292},{"uri":"Joint","surface_form":"joint","offset":318},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":426},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":482},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":573},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":718},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":785},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":826},{"uri":"Arthropoda","surface_form":"Arthropoda","offset":833},{"uri":"Crustacea","surface_form":"crustacea","offset":910},{"uri":"Flight","surface_form":"flight","offset":1036},{"uri":"Exoskeleton","surface_form":"exoskeleton","offset":1080},{"uri":"Dessication","surface_form":"dessication","offset":1136}]}
