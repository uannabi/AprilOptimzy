The University of Alabama is in the city of Tuscaloosa. People can usually just say \"Alabama\" or \"UA\" for short when they are talking about the University.\nUA opened in 1831 and now about 35,000 students study there. UA is one of the three largest universities in Alabama. Auburn University and University of Alabama at Birmingham are the other two main schools in Alabama. Students study many things at UA, such as liberal arts, science, engineering, communication, engineering, education, social work, nursing, human sciences (such as fashion design) and law. People study to get bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees and doctorates at Alabama. Also, graduates can get an Education Specialist degree.\nMany people have heard about the University of Alabama because it has many good sports teams. These sports teams are called the Crimson Tide. The football team from UA has won the national football championship 12 times in the past 83 years and play at Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium.\nIn 1963, Alabama Gov. George Wallace announced in his inaugural address, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" as his policy. He personally blocked the door to Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama to prevent the enrollment of two black students. He moved aside only when confronted by General Henry Graham of the Alabama National Guard, who was ordered by President John F. Kennedy to intervene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":36},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":54},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":68},{"uri":"Tuscaloosa%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Tuscaloosa","offset":121},{"uri":"Auburn_University","surface_form":"Auburn University","offset":350},{"uri":"University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham","surface_form":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","offset":372},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":925},{"uri":"Bryant%E2%80%93Denny_Stadium","surface_form":"Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium","offset":1032},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":1063},{"uri":"George_Wallace","surface_form":"George Wallace","offset":1076},{"uri":"Stand_in_the_Schoolhouse_Door","surface_form":"blocked","offset":1217},{"uri":"Foster_Auditorium","surface_form":"Foster Auditorium","offset":1237},{"uri":"Henry_V._Graham","surface_form":"General Henry Graham","offset":1372}]}
