{"id":22953,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer","text":"e=\"preserve\">Engineer is a person with a proper education in the field of engineering. The word \"engineer\" is derived from the Latin root \"ingenium\", meaning \"cleverness\". Engineers design materials, structures, machines and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, safety and cost. Much of the work is applied science, using information given by scientists to do their work. Apart from working with things, an engineer must also be good at working with people and money.\nWho are they?\nMany engineering projects are large and very complicated.\nOften different kinds of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to\nbuild a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an\nairplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":74},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":127},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":189},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":200},{"uri":"Machines","surface_form":"machines","offset":212},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":225},{"uri":"Safety","surface_form":"safety","offset":292},{"uri":"Price","surface_form":"cost","offset":303},{"uri":"Applied_science","surface_form":"applied science","offset":329},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientists","offset":373},{"uri":"Thing","surface_form":"things","offset":426},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":480},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":491},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":854}]}
