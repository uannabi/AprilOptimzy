The Army has only said that there will be lethal and non-lethal means to help with missions in both civilian and non-civilian places.\nThe Army would like the GCV to have good bomb protection and would like it to be able to destroy enemy missiles.\nVariants.\nThe U.S. Army wants a troop carrier and a \"secondary vehicle\". The Army will ask for more variants later.\nInfantry Fighting Vehicle.\nThe IFV will replace the M113 APC by 2018, the M2 Bradley and the Stryker ICV later. The IFV will hold a crew of three and a squad of nine people.\nSecondary vehicle.\nThe \"secondary vehicle\" is listed on the \"Work Breakdown Structure\" document.
