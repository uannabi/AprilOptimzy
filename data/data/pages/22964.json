It would work if formula_1 were 1 or if it were 1,000,000,000. 0/0 is said to be of \"indeterminate form\" for this reason, because it has no single value. Numbers of the form A/0, on the other hand, where formula_1 is not 0, are said to be \"undefined\", or \"undeterminated.\" This is because any attempt to define them will result in a value of infinity, which is itself undefined. Usually when two numbers are equal to the same thing, they are equal to each other. That is not true when the thing they are both equal to is 0/0. This means that the normal rules of maths do not work when the number is divided by zero.\nIncorrect proofs based on division by zero.\nThe fallacy is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with 0/0 = 1.\nThe \"proof\" above is incorrect because it divides by zero when it divides by \"x\"-\"x\", because any number minus itself is zero.\nCalculus.\nIn calculus, the above \"indeterminate forms\" also come as a result of direct substitution while evaluating limits.\nDivision by zero in computers.\nIf a computer program tries to divide an integer by zero, the operating system will usually detect this and stop the program. Usually it will print an \"error message,\" or give the programmer advice on how to improve the program. Division by zero is a common bug in computer programming. Dividing floating point numbers (decimals) by zero will usually result in either infinity or a special NaN (not a number) value, depending on what is being divided by zero.\nDivision by zero in geometry.\nIn geometry formula_1 This infinity (projective infinity) is neither a positive or a negative number, the same way that zero is neither a positive or negative number","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":432},{"uri":"Fallacy","surface_form":"fallacy","offset":754},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":979},{"uri":"Limit_(mathematics)","surface_form":"limits","offset":1083},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":1127},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":1163},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":1184},{"uri":"Error","surface_form":"error","offset":1274},{"uri":"Software_bug","surface_form":"bug","offset":1380},{"uri":"Floating_point_unit","surface_form":"floating point","offset":1418},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":1490},{"uri":"Projective_geometry","surface_form":"projective","offset":1649}]}
