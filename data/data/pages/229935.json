{"id":229935,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_boxer_contest","text":"e=\"preserve\">The wet boxer-short contest is a beauty contest between men in their underwear. It is a lot like a wet t-shirt contest that shows women. However, unlike a wet T-shirt contest the water used is warm instead of cold. Some feminists have questioned the comparison, claiming that the contests are degrading for women and not for men because of sexism.\nWet boxer contests are also held in gay bars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Underwear","surface_form":"underwear","offset":82},{"uri":"Wet_T-shirt_contest","surface_form":"wet t-shirt contest","offset":112},{"uri":"Feminism","surface_form":"feminists","offset":233},{"uri":"Gay_bar","surface_form":"gay bar","offset":397}]}
