He was a leader in the Yugoslav Wars. He also led his nation to defend itself against NATO aggression that took Kosovo from Serbia. NATO leaders charged him for war crimes and crimes against humanity during the bombing of Yugoslavia. He lost re-election in 2000.\nMilosevic did not retreat his army because of NATO's 77 days of bombing. His goal was to keep Kosovo within Serbian parallel structures. Once resolution was passed, he retreated but also managed (with other politicians) to hold on to North Kosovo whose area is 1200KM2 or 11%, where 96% of its population is Serbian whose religion is Christian.\nImprisonment and death.\nAfter his fall from power in 2001, he was taken to The Netherlands to stand trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, but died after five years in prison before the case could reach a conclusion. He did not recognize the tribunal calling it an American/UN puppet court and said he was being tried for standing up to NATO expansion. Many accusations against him regarding Kosovo proved to be false. It was said by the UN tribunal that Milosevic, who had chronic heart problems and a high blood pressure, died of a heart attack.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serbian_language","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":20},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"pronounced","offset":49},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":104},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslav","offset":113},{"uri":"President_of_Serbia","surface_form":"President of Serbia","offset":137},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia","offset":201},{"uri":"Socialist_Party_of_Serbia","surface_form":"Socialist Party","offset":295},{"uri":"Yugoslav_Wars","surface_form":"Yugoslav Wars","offset":335},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":398},{"uri":"Kosovo","surface_form":"Kosovo","offset":424},{"uri":"War_crimes","surface_form":"war crimes","offset":473},{"uri":"Crimes_against_humanity","surface_form":"crimes against humanity","offset":488},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":569},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":995},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"trial","offset":1020},{"uri":"International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia","offset":1033},{"uri":"The_Hague","surface_form":"The Hague","offset":1094},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":1134},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1500}]}
