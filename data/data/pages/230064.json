If you do not count the area of the Great Lakes, China is also bigger. Its geography varies a lot. The area is about 3,717,000 square miles, or about 9,629,000 square kilometers. The highest point is Mount McKinley, Alaska and the lowest point is Death Valley, California.\nThe geographic center is in Butte County, South Dakota. The geographic center of the 48 states is in Smith County, Kansas.\nClimate.\nThe climate varies along with the geography, from tropical (hot and wet in summer, warm and dry in winter) in Florida and Hawaii to tundra (cold all year) in Alaska. Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters. Most of the northern U.S. gets snow in winter. Some parts of the western United States, like parts of California, have a Mediterranean climate. The southeastern United States can get hurricanes. Parts of the southern United States are subtropical (hot in summer and cool in winter). Tornadoes happen a lot in the Midwest.\nThe highest recorded temperature is 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) and the lowest recorded temperature is -80 degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":4},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":49},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":76},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":87},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":142},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":155},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":209},{"uri":"Mount_McKinley","surface_form":"Mount McKinley","offset":306},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":322},{"uri":"Death_Valley","surface_form":"Death Valley","offset":353},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":367},{"uri":"Geographic_center","surface_form":"geographic center","offset":383},{"uri":"Butte_County%2C_South_Dakota","surface_form":"Butte County","offset":407},{"uri":"South_Dakota","surface_form":"South Dakota","offset":421},{"uri":"Smith_County%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Smith County","offset":480},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":494},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropical","offset":561},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":621},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":633},{"uri":"Tundra","surface_form":"tundra","offset":643},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":669},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":771},{"uri":"Mediterranean_climate","surface_form":"Mediterranean climate","offset":861},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":923},{"uri":"Subtropics","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":975},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"Tornado","offset":1023},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":1083},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Fahrenheit","offset":1110},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":1133}]}
