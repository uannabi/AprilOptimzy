His father was a manufacturer and dealer of cloth. His mother was of an old Lennep family which had settled in Amsterdam. R\u00F6ntgen was three when his family moved to Apeldoorn in The Netherlands.\nEducation.\nIn Apeldoorn, he attended the Institute of Martinus Herman van Doorn, a boarding school.
