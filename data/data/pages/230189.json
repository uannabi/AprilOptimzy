{"id":230189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleost","text":"Teleosts are the dominant fish of the present day. They arose in the Mesozoic era, and include 20,000 living species. The oldest teleost fossils date back to the late Triassic. They evolved from fish like bowfins in the clade Holostei. During the Mesozoic and Cainozoic they diversified. 96 percent of all known fish species are teleosts.\nThey are, in order of evolution, vertebrates, jawed fish (Gnathostomata), bony fish (Osteichthyes) and ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii).\nTeleosts have a movable jaw and changes in the jaw muscles. These changes make it possible for them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This adaptation improves their ability to grab fast-moving prey.\nDate of origin.\nThe date of origin of the teleosts is a difficult problem. Two kinds of evidence are available. There is evidence from the fossil record, in which the first teleost comes from the late Triassic period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":26},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":69},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":78},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":109},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":167},{"uri":"Bowfin","surface_form":"bowfin","offset":205},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":220},{"uri":"Holostei","surface_form":"Holostei","offset":226},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":247},{"uri":"Cainozoic","surface_form":"Cainozoic","offset":260},{"uri":"Adaptive_radiation","surface_form":"diversified","offset":275},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":361},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":372},{"uri":"Gnathostomata","surface_form":"Gnathostomata","offset":397},{"uri":"Osteichthyes","surface_form":"Osteichthyes","offset":424},{"uri":"Actinopterygii","surface_form":"Actinopterygii","offset":459},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":500},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":629},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":683}]}
