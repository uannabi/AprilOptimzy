{"id":230266,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XXVII","text":"WrestleMania XXVII was the twenty-seventh yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.\nProduction.\nIn September 2009, it was reported that the city of Atlanta was wanting to have WrestleMania XXVII at the Georgia Dome. A press conference was held on February 1, 2010 at the Georgia Dome to officially announced the event for Atlanta; this will be the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Georgia. Along with WrestleMania XXVII, a group of events known as \"WrestleMania Week\" will be held in the week before the event including WrestleMania's yearly \"WrestleMania Axxess\" fan convention, the 2011 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, the fourth yearly \"WrestleMania Art\" showing and auction, and a Celebrity Pro-Am Golf tournament. According to the president of the Atlanta Sports Council, Gary Stokan, \"WrestleMania Axxess\" is planned to be held at the Georgia World Congress Center, while the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony will take place either at the Fox Theatre or at Philips Arena.\nBetween 15 and 20 cities were thought of to host the event, with fewer than half of the people thought of invited to explain why they should hold the event at WWE's headquarters at Stamford, Connecticut. Atlanta's main rival to hosting the event was the city of Miami, Florida who wanted to host the event at Sun Life Stadium along with \"WrestleMania Axxess\" at the Convention Center and the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the American Airlines Arena. Miami was later given WrestleMania XXVIII.\nAttendance record controversy.\nDuring the pay-per-view, Justin Roberts announced a new Georgia Dome \"entertainment\" attendance record of 71,617. But a Billboard.com article claims a Backstreet Boys concert had 73,337 people in attendance. WWE says in their official press release that the Backstreet Boys concert only had 65,658 people in attendance. WWE's number was later confirmed by officials at the Georgia Dome.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":49},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":62},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":85},{"uri":"World_Wrestling_Entertainment","surface_form":"World Wrestling Entertainment","offset":118},{"uri":"Georgia_Dome","surface_form":"Georgia Dome","offset":176},{"uri":"Atlanta","surface_form":"Atlanta, Georgia","offset":192},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":248},{"uri":"Atlanta","surface_form":"Atlanta","offset":274},{"uri":"Georgia_Dome","surface_form":"Georgia Dome","offset":328},{"uri":"Press_conference","surface_form":"press conference","offset":344},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":413},{"uri":"Announce","surface_form":"announced","offset":424},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":520},{"uri":"Fan_convention","surface_form":"fan convention","offset":703},{"uri":"WWE_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"WWE Hall of Fame","offset":728},{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":841},{"uri":"Georgia_World_Congress_Center","surface_form":"Georgia World Congress Center","offset":975},{"uri":"Fox_Theatre_(Atlanta%2C_Georgia)","surface_form":"Fox Theatre","offset":1072},{"uri":"Philips_Arena","surface_form":"Philips Arena","offset":1090},{"uri":"Stamford%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Stamford, Connecticut","offset":1286},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami, Florida","offset":1367},{"uri":"Sun_Life_Stadium","surface_form":"Sun Life Stadium","offset":1414},{"uri":"American_Airlines_Arena","surface_form":"American Airlines Arena","offset":1530},{"uri":"WrestleMania_XXVIII","surface_form":"WrestleMania XXVIII","offset":1577},{"uri":"Justin_Roberts","surface_form":"Justin Roberts","offset":1654},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard.com","offset":1749},{"uri":"Backstreet_Boys","surface_form":"Backstreet Boys","offset":1780}]}
