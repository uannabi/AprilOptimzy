{"id":230436,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheism","text":"e=\"preserve\">'Nontheism' is a term that describes anyone who is not a theist. In other words, a nontheist is anyone who does not have a specific belief in a god or deity. It usually refers to anyone who does not have any religious belief. This is a lot like atheism, but the two terms are often used in different ways.\nOrigin of the term.\nThe term \"nontheism\" was first used by G. J. Holyoake in 1852. He used it because of the bad associations with the term atheism.\nNontheism in Society.\nToday, about 2.3% of the world's population describes itself as atheist. About 11.9% is described as 'nontheist'. Between 64% and 65% of Japanese describe themselves as atheists, agnostics, or non-believers, and up to 48% in Russia. The percentage of such people in European Union member states ranges between 6% (Italy) and 85% (Sweden).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theist","surface_form":"theist","offset":70},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":221},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":231},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheism","offset":258},{"uri":"George_Holyoake","surface_form":"G.
