{"id":230573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Savard","text":"Denis Joseph Savard (born February 4, 1961) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey centre. Savard played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, and the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nHe was drafted with the 3rd overall pick by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. He was known for his trademark move, the 'Savardian Spin-o-rama', a move where Savard whirled around with the puck in a full rotation which allowed him to beat defenders and goaltenders. The term was actually coined by Danny Gallivan, referencing the move performed by Serge Savard.\nOn June 29, 1990, the Chicago Blackhawks traded Savard to the Montreal Canadiens for star defenceman Chris Chelios and a second-round pick (Mike Pomichter). The trade was considered to be largely in the Blackhawks' favor as Chelios would produce some of his best seasons as a Blackhawk while Savard's career was on the decline. Savard won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens in 1993.\nIn the Summer of 1993, he signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he played 1\u00BD seasons. On April 6, 1995, he was traded back to the Blackhawks, for a 1996 sixth-round pick (Xavier Delisle). He retired from playing professional ice hockey on June 26, 1997. His jersey number #18 was retired by the Chicago Blackhawks on March 19, 1998 and he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 13, 2000.\nAfter he retired, he became the 36th head coach in Chicago Blackhawks history on November 27, 2006. He was fired in 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":49},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":79},{"uri":"Centre_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"centre","offset":90},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":130},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":178},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":198},{"uri":"Tampa_Bay_Lightning","surface_form":"Tampa Bay Lightning","offset":226},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":295},{"uri":"Danny_Gallivan","surface_form":"Danny Gallivan","offset":562},{"uri":"Serge_Savard","surface_form":"Serge Savard","offset":612},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":688},{"uri":"Defenceman","surface_form":"defenceman","offset":716},{"uri":"Chris_Chelios","surface_form":"Chris Chelios","offset":727},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":969},{"uri":"Hockey_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Hockey Hall of Fame","offset":1391}]}
