{"id":23061,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis_people","text":"The M\u00E9tis (pronounced 'may-TEE' in English and 'may-TEES' in French), also known as Bois Brule, mixed-bloods, or Countryborn (Anglo-M\u00E9tis), are one of the three divisions of Aboriginal peoples in Canada according to the Canadian government. Their home land is in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,Ontario,Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, as well as the Northwest Territories. The M\u00E9tis Homeland also includes parts of the northern United States (specifically Montana, North Dakota, and northwest Minnesota).\nThe M\u00E9tis Nation are descendants of marriages of Woodland Cree, Ojibway, Saulteaux,Mi'kmaq and Menominee Indians (Native Americans) with French Canadian and/or British settlers. Their history starts in the 18th century in the west and in the 17th century in the east. Historically, many western M\u00E9tis spoke a mixed language called Michif. \"Michif\" is the M\u00E9tis pronunciation of \"M\u00E9tis\". The M\u00E9tis today mostly speak English, with French as a strong second language, as well as many native language. The use of Michif is growing again thanks to the work of the provincial M\u00E9tis councils.\nThe word \"M\u00E9tis\" is French, and related to the Spanish word \"mestizo\". It means the same thing: \"mixed blood\"; both names come from the Latin word \"mixtus\", \"mixed\".\nHundreds of thousands of people in Canada are identified as M\u00E9tis. An unknown number of other people in Canada and the United States have M\u00E9tis ancestors.\nM\u00E9tis culture.\nM\u00E9tis culture is an mixture of cultures of the First Nations, French Canadian, English, and Orkney/Scottish. The M\u00E9tis are known for their love of fiddle playing, but traditional instruments also included the concertina, the harmonica, and the hand drum. This love for the fiddle has gone together with a kind of dancing called jigging. Traditionally, dancing included such moves as the Waltz Quadrille, the Square dance, Drops of Brandy, the Duck, La Double Gigue and the Red River Jig.\nMetis people were famous for their horsemanship and breeding of horses. The RCMP Musical Ride horses dance the Quadrille as begun by the Metis and their horses.\nAs the M\u00E9tis culture grew, a new language called Michif was spoken. This language was a result of the combining of French nouns and Cree verbs. Though a distinct language, it is spoken by few people. Some guess that the number of Michif speakers is about 1,000.\nThe sash, recognized as the symbol of the M\u00E9tis nation in Western Canada has long been a part of M\u00E9tis culture in the Maritimes. Originally made of vegetable fibres, Mi'kmaq women created colourful sashes using a finger-weaving technique. Later, the Assomption-style sashes were brought from Quebec and adopted by both M\u00E9tis and Mi'kmaq alike.\nThe clothing worn by M\u00E9tis in the 19th century included the sash or \"ceinture flech\u00E9e\". It is traditionally about three metres in length and is made by weaving yarn together with one's fingers. The sash is worn around the waist, tied in the middle, with the fringed ends hanging. Vests with M\u00E9tis beadwork are also popular. The Red River Coat came from the Metis culture.\nThe M\u00E9tis were important in Canada's past, as fur traders who came from the east coast, voyageurs (coureur de bois), frontiersmen, pioneers, and middlemen who communicated between the First Nations peoples and cultures, and the European settlers and colonists.\nProminent M\u00E9tis.\nThe most famous M\u00E9tis was Louis Riel, who led two rebellions which John A Mcdonald hated, the Red River Rebellion in 1869 in the area now known as Manitoba, and the North-West Rebellion in 1885 in the area now known as Saskatchewan. Some say these were not really rebellions. For example, in 1869 Riel was the leader of a government recognized by Canada as controlling territory that did not belong to Canada; Canada worked on the Manitoba Act with this government. After these \"rebellions\", land claimers and other non-M\u00E9tis took away the M\u00E9tis' land by taking advantage of a government program for buying it, with the government letting this happen. The province of Alberta gave some land to M\u00E9tis in 1938 to fix what it thought was not fair, but Saskatchewan and Manitoba have not done the same.\nTwo other famous M\u00E9tis leaders were Cuthbert Grant and Gabriel Dumont.\nActor August Schellenberg is of M\u00E9tis descent.\nBorn in 1940, in northern Saskatchewan, Metis writer and filmmaker Maria Campbell brought attention to the struggles of modern-day Metis and Aboriginal people with her book, \"Halfbreed\" (1973), and the play, \"Jessica\" (1982). She has shown the sound and song of traditional stories through her work in dialect, \"Stories of the Road Allowance People\" (1996).\nOn May 7, 2004, M\u00E9tis Todd Ducharme became a judge of the Ontario Supreme Court of Justice.\nOther well known Canadians of M\u00E9tis descent are Sharon Bruneau, a Canadian female bodybuilder and fitness model, and Kevin O'Toole, 1996 North American Lightheavyweight bodybuilding champion.\nBritish Columbia New Democratic Party Leader Carole James is of partly M\u00E9tis ancestry.\nNHL star defenceman Sheldon Souray is of M\u00E9tis ancestry.\nFormer Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin is of partly M\u00E9tis ancestry.\nArchitect Douglas Cardinal is of M\u00E9tis and Blackfoot ancestry.\nNovelist Sandra Birdsell is the daughter of a M\u00E9tis man and a Russian Mennonite woman and wrote her award-winning novel \"Children of the Day\" partly on her parents' experience in Manitoba in the 1920s-50s.\nCanadian Professional Wrestler Ben Saulnier, better known for his ring name Jake Benson, is a M\u00E9tis from Penetanguishene, Ontario, Canada.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anglo-M%C3%A9tis","surface_form":"Anglo-M\u00E9tis","offset":126},{"uri":"Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada","surface_form":"Aboriginal
