{"id":230613,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","text":"The Attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise attack by Japan against the neutral United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on the morning of December 7, 1941. It led the United States into World War II. Japan was planning a war in Southeast Asia, against Britain and the Netherlands, as well as the U.S. in the Philippines. All these countries refused to sell petroleum and other war supplies that Japan needed for the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japan attacked so that the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which was a collection of ships that the United States could use in a war, would not enter that war.\nThe attack was made up of two aerial attack waves (the third canceled) totaling 353 aircraft, launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers. Their commander was Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. 2,390 people died in the attack.\nAll the eight American battleships in the harbor were sunk, along with several other ships. USS Arizona (BB-39) exploded; the other battleships were later refloated. The three American aircraft carriers (, and) were elsewhere. Hundreds of aircraft were destroyed and shore installations were slightly damaged. Japan declared war on the United States the same day.\nAfter the attack.\nThe next day, United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a speech to Congress. In his speech, President Roosevelt said that December 7 was \"a date which will live in infamy\". Most Americans listened to the speech on the radio. A few minutes after the speech ended, Congress voted to declare war on Japan. Only one member of Congress, Jeanette Rankin, voted \"no\". Three days later, Germany and Italy also declared war on the United States.\nRumors started blaming Italian, German, and Japanese Americans for knowing about the attacks ahead of time and even helping. Many American citizens became afraid of Italian, German and Japanese Americans because Germany and Italy were allied to Japan. As a result, 110,000 Japanese Americans 31,000 German Americans and 3,000 Italian Americans were sent to internment camps starting in 1942. The government made the father of a famous baseball player, Joe di Maggio, move from the West coast because he was an Italian immigrant. Some Italian, German and Japanese Americans were interned as late as 1944. The government apologized for doing this to the Japanese Americans in 1988. German Americans and Italian Americans have never received an apology.\nAfter the war, Japanese leaders who ordered the attack were tried for a war crime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Surprise_attack","surface_form":"surprise attack","offset":33},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":52},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":78},{"uri":"Naval_base","surface_form":"naval base","offset":92},{"uri":"Pearl_Harbor","surface_form":"Pearl Harbor","offset":106},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":120},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":193},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":235},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Britain","offset":259},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":275},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":315},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Second Sino-Japanese War","offset":423},{"uri":"Aircraft_carrier","surface_form":"aircraft carrier","offset":718},{"uri":"Battleship","surface_form":"battleship","offset":839},{"uri":"USS_Arizona_(BB-39)","surface_form":"USS Arizona (BB-39)","offset":908},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
