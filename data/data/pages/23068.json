Some stadiums are paid to add a company name to the name of their stadium. For example, \"Comerica\" Park in Detroit, Michigan, or the ALLTEL Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. When people do this the company has the \"naming rights\" to the stadium. The given name of a stadium can change when another company buys the naming rights to that stadium.\nAn arena is a small indoor stadium. Arenas are often used for many different types of events. These include sports and music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":15},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":92},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"athletics","offset":105},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":148},{"uri":"Detroit%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":223},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":232},{"uri":"Jacksonville%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Jacksonville, Florida","offset":267},{"uri":"Naming_rights","surface_form":"naming rights","offset":331},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":465},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":581}]}
