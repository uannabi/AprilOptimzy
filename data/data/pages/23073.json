{"id":23073,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster","text":"e=\"preserve\">A disaster is something bad that happens to people and almost always changes their lives completely. Disasters can destroy homes and many kinds of work. Disasters can be of different kinds, but most are caused by forces of nature.\nNatural disasters.\nThese may include avalanches (where snow comes down a mountain), cold (where animals and people freeze), diseases (sicknesses), droughts (when there is no water), earthquakes (where the ground moves), famine (where there is not enough food), fire that burns things and people, flood (where rivers grow too big and invade land), hail (hard ice falls like rain), heat that lowers the water supply, hurricanes that break everything, the hyper nova of a star that kills life, an impact event where meteors hit the earth, a limnic eruption (where bad chemicals come from lakes and can kill people), landslides and mudslides (where the top of the ground moves because of extra water), sink holes (where a cave falls in), solar flares (where the sun reaches out at the earth and burns it), storm surge (where water piles up and then suddenly comes on land), thunderstorms (rain with lightning and thunder), tornadoes (currents of wind that break things), tsunami (where a wall of water comes on land), volcanoes (where lava from inside the earth comes out slowly or shoots into the air), a waterspout (like a tornado on water), or winter storms (where snow falls thick and you cannot see).\nHuman-caused disasters.\nDisasters caused by humans include aviation (flying) accidents, arson (lighting a fire to burn something), CBRNs (where a country has a powerful weapon), civil disorder (where people riot or do crimes), power outages (where electricity is interrupted), public relations crises where a company must tell bad news, radiation accidents, disasters in space, a telecommunications outage (not being able to communicate), terrorism (where a group attacks civilians or says they will attack to gain something), and war (fighting with weapons between large groups).\nLiving through a disaster.\nTo live through a disaster, it is important that your family and your city prepare in advance. This may be making a pack of things you need in an emergency, it may be a government sending soldiers to help, or it may be something in between. It is recommended to keep a disaster survival kit with canned goods, in the advent of such a disaster.\nConspiracy theories.\nTheories vary widely about the cause of world disasters, and while most are controversial, the number of followers that they attract show that there is perhaps some merit behind them. One notable theorist is named Fei Weixiang. Fei's theory centers around the idea that all world disasters stem from a single source. He believes he has tracked the source to Beijing, where he currently resides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Avalanche","surface_form":"avalanche","offset":281},{"uri":"Cold","surface_form":"cold","offset":328},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":368},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":391},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":426},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":464},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":505},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":540},{"uri":"Hail","surface_form":"hail","offset":591},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":624},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":659},{"uri":"Hyper_nova","surface_form":"hyper nova","offset":697},{"uri":"Impact_event","surface_form":"impact event","offset":738},{"uri":"Limnic_eruption","surface_form":"limnic eruption","offset":782},{"uri":"Landslide","surface_form":"landslide","offset":857},{"uri":"Mudslide","surface_form":"mudslide","offset":872},{"uri":"Sink_hole","surface_form":"sink hole","offset":942},{"uri":"Solar_flare","surface_form":"solar flare","offset":978},{"uri":"Storm_surge","surface_form":"storm surge","offset":1046},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":1114},{"uri":"Lightning","surface_form":"lightning","offset":1139},{"uri":"Thunder","surface_form":"thunder","offset":1153},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":1163},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":1211},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":1258},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":1275},{"uri":"Waterspout","surface_form":"waterspout","offset":1346},{"uri":"Winter_storm","surface_form":"winter storm","offset":1387},{"uri":"Aviation","surface_form":"aviation","offset":1505},{"uri":"Arson","surface_form":"arson","offset":1534},{"uri":"CBRN","surface_form":"CBRN","offset":1577},{"uri":"Civil_disorder","surface_form":"civil disorder","offset":1624},{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"riot","offset":1653},{"uri":"Power_outage","surface_form":"power outage","offset":1673},{"uri":"Public_relations_crisis","surface_form":"public relations crises","offset":1723},{"uri":"Radiation_accidents","surface_form":"radiation accidents","offset":1783},{"uri":"Space_disaster","surface_form":"disasters in space","offset":1804},{"uri":"Telecommunications_outage","surface_form":"telecommunications outage","offset":1826},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":1885},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":1977},{"uri":"Emergency","surface_form":"emergency","offset":2200},{"uri":"Fei_Weixiang","surface_form":"Fei Weixiang","offset":2633}]}
