{"id":230822,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meringue","text":"A meringue () is a type of dessert made from whipping egg whites and sugar. Some meringue recipes also ask for cream of tartar or cornstarch to hold it together. Meringues are often flavoured with vanilla and a small amount of almond or coconut extract. They are light, airy and sweet.\nHistory.\nPeople do not agree whether meringue was invented in the Swiss town of Meiringen by an Italian chef named Gasparini. They are more sure that the name \"meringue\" was first seen in 1692, in a cookbook by Fran\u00E7ois Massialot. The word \"meringue\" was first used in English in 1706 in an English translation of Massialot's book. There are two English recipe books that have a recipe for meringue, but it is called \"white biskit bread\" in the book of recipes started in 1604 by Lady Elinor Fettiplace, or called \"pets\" in the manuscript of collected recipes written by Lady Rachel Fane.\nType of meringue.\nThere are many types of meringue. The usual type is dry and crisp.\nOne type is the half-cooked type on queen of puddings, key lime pie, and lemon meringue pie. There are also uncooked meringues, and other types of meringues cooked in different ways.\nCooked meringue cannot be refrigerated or it will become soggy. They will keep for at least a week if stored in an airtight container.\nMeringue is also used as a topping on other desserts, such as angel food cake, pavlova, and baked Alaska.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":27},{"uri":"Whipping","surface_form":"whipping","offset":45},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":54},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":69},{"uri":"Cream_of_tartar","surface_form":"cream of tartar","offset":111},{"uri":"Cornstarch","surface_form":"cornstarch","offset":130},{"uri":"Flavour","surface_form":"flavour","offset":182},{"uri":"Vanilla","surface_form":"vanilla","offset":197},{"uri":"Almond","surface_form":"almond","offset":227},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":237},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":352},{"uri":"Meiringen","surface_form":"Meiringen","offset":366},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":382},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translation","offset":585},{"uri":"Queen_of_puddings","surface_form":"queen of puddings","offset":996},{"uri":"Key_lime_pie","surface_form":"key lime pie","offset":1015},{"uri":"Lemon_meringue_pie","surface_form":"lemon meringue pie","offset":1033},{"uri":"Refrigerate","surface_form":"refrigerate","offset":1169},{"uri":"Angel_food_cake","surface_form":"angel food cake","offset":1340},{"uri":"Pavlova_(food)","surface_form":"pavlova","offset":1357},{"uri":"Baked_Alaska","surface_form":"baked Alaska","offset":1370}]}
