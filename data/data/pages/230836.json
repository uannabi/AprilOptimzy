{"id":230836,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(slang)","text":"=\"preserve\">Faggot (or fag) is a derogatory term for a homosexual human. It is usually used to refer to gay men, but may also be used for lesbian women. Many people, especially homosexuals, see it as hate speech. Typically, they prefer the term gay, or sometimes queer; queer having been reclamed by the LGBTQ+ community despite the term's pre-existing negative connotation.\nYounger generations often use the term \"fag\" as an insult towards people that annoy them without actually linking the word to homosexuals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":55},{"uri":"Hate_speech","surface_form":"hate speech","offset":200},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":245},{"uri":"Queer","surface_form":"queer","offset":263},{"uri":"Queer","surface_form":"queer","offset":270},{"uri":"LGBTQ%2B","surface_form":"LGBTQ+","offset":304},{"uri":"Insult","surface_form":"insult","offset":426}]}
