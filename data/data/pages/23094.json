{"id":23094,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Java is the name of a programming language created by Sun Microsystems. This company was bought out by Oracle Corporation, which continues to keep it up to date. The latest version is Java 14, released in March 2020. In addition the only supported versions are, the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version Java 11, released on September 25, 2018; and Oracle released for the \"legacy\" Java 8 LTS the last free \"public update\". The next planned LTS version is Java 17 (LTS), planned for September 2021.\nJava, which was called \"Oak\" when it was still being developed, is object oriented, meaning it is based on objects that work together to make programs do their jobs. Java code looks like C, C++, or, but code written in those languages will not work in Java in most cases without being changed.\nJava runs on many different operating systems, including Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system (while Java continues to be used on Android, even by its maker Google, they no longer prefer Java; now Kotlin is their preferred language, that can also be used with all Java code). This makes Java platform independent. It does this by making the Java compiler turn code into Java bytecode instead of machine code. This means that when the program is executed, the Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code.\nJava platform.\nThe \"Java platform\" refers to a group of software products from Sun Microsystems. The platform is used to develop and run Java programs. The platform includes the execution engine (called a Java Virtual Machine) that allows Java programs to do the same thing on different computer systems.\nThis capability of being able to develop software on one platform and running it on other platforms is called \"cross-platform capability\".\nBenefits.\nJava is commonly used to teach students how to program as a first language, but is still also used by professionals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":35},{"uri":"Sun_Microsystems","surface_form":"Sun Microsystems","offset":67},{"uri":"Oracle_Corporation","surface_form":"Oracle Corporation","offset":116},{"uri":"Object-oriented_programming","surface_form":"object oriented","offset":580},{"uri":"Object_(computer_science)","surface_form":"objects","offset":620},{"uri":"C_(programming_language)","surface_form":"C","offset":700},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":703},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":835},{"uri":"Android_(operating_system)","surface_form":"Android,","offset":864},{"uri":"Mobile_operating_system","surface_form":"mobile operating system","offset":898},{"uri":"Kotlin_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Kotlin","offset":1025},{"uri":"Platform_independence","surface_form":"platform independent","offset":1120},{"uri":"Compiler","surface_form":"compiler","offset":1174},{"uri":"Bytecode","surface_form":"bytecode","offset":1203},{"uri":"Machine_code","surface_form":"machine code","offset":1223},{"uri":"Execution_(computing)","surface_form":"executed","offset":1273},{"uri":"Java_Virtual_Machine","surface_form":"Java Virtual Machine","offset":1287},{"uri":"Sun_Microsystems","surface_form":"Sun Microsystems","offset":1448},{"uri":"Java_Virtual_Machine","surface_form":"Java Virtual Machine","offset":1574},{"uri":"Cross-platform","surface_form":"cross-platform","offset":1785}]}
