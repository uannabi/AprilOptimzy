{"id":230990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Bunny","text":"The Easter Bunny (or Easter Hare) is a character depicted as an anthropomorphic rabbit. In old stories, the creature brings baskets filled with colored eggs, candy and toys to the homes of children on the night before Easter. The Easter Bunny will either put the baskets in a certain place or hide them somewhere in the house for the children to find when they wake up in the morning.\nThe Easter Bunny is similar to Christmas's Santa Claus, as they both bring gifts to good children on the night before the holidays they are related to.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anthropomorphic","surface_form":"anthropomorphic","offset":64},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":80},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":218},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":416},{"uri":"Santa_Claus","surface_form":"Santa Claus","offset":428}]}
