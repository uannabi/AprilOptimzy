{"id":23101,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita","text":"The Bhagavad Gita is one of the holy books of Hinduism. It was written about five thousand years ago as part of the Mahabharata. It has teachings said to be given by Lord Sri Krishna who is the Supreme God. In the book (Bhagvat Gita), Krishna is talking to Arjuna, an Archer, before the kurukshetra war begins. Krishna tells Arjuna that he must perform his duty (called dharma) and go to fight. Arjuna hesitates because he is fighting his family, but in the end he listens to Krishna. He will not be led into the underworld for ever for his sins because he will not be reincarnated through Moksha.\nIt is considered to be the manual on which a human should follow his life according to Sanatana Dharma.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bhagavad_Gita","surface_form":"Bhagavad Gita","offset":4},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":46},{"uri":"Mahabharata","surface_form":"Mahabharata","offset":116},{"uri":"Krishna","surface_form":"Lord Sri Krishna","offset":166},{"uri":"Arjuna","surface_form":"Arjuna","offset":257},{"uri":"Archer","surface_form":"Archer","offset":268},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":299},{"uri":"Dharma","surface_form":"dharma","offset":370},{"uri":"Underworld","surface_form":"underworld","offset":513},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":541},{"uri":"Reincarnation","surface_form":"reincarnated","offset":569},{"uri":"Moksha","surface_form":"Moksha","offset":590}]}
