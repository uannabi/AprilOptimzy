{"id":231010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_(song)","text":"\"Avalon\" is a popular song. It was written by Al Jolson, Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose in 1920. It was first recorded by Jolson and used in the musicals \"Sinbad\" and \"Bombo\". Jolson's version became #2 on the American singles chart. It is possible that Rose wrote the song alone, and that Jolson's name was used in the credits because he was a popular artist and helped make the song popular. At first only Rose and Jolson were marked as the writers, and DeSylva's name was added later.\nMany jazz artists have recorded the song, for example Cab Calloway (1934), Coleman Hawkins (1935) and Eddie Durham (1936). Benny Goodman played the song in his concert in Carnegie Hall in 1938. The song was also played in the films \"The Jolson Story\" (1946) and \"The Benny Goodman Story\" (1956).\nThe melody at the beginning of the song was taken from Giacomo Puccini's opera \"Tosca\", and Rose changed it only a little. Because of this, a court later decided that Jolson and Rose had to pay Puccini's publishers $25,000 and all later profits from the song.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Al_Jolson","surface_form":"Al Jolson","offset":46},{"uri":"Musical","surface_form":"musical","offset":145},{"uri":"Cab_Calloway","surface_form":"Cab Calloway","offset":542},{"uri":"Benny_Goodman","surface_form":"Benny Goodman","offset":611},{"uri":"Carnegie_Hall","surface_form":"Carnegie Hall","offset":659},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":788},{"uri":"Giacomo_Puccini","surface_form":"Giacomo Puccini","offset":839},{"uri":"Tosca","surface_form":"Tosca","offset":864}]}
