{"id":231089,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)","text":"In physics, intensity can usually be understood as the strength of something like a beam of light. To figure out (i.e., compute) the exact intensity of a beam of light or a fire hose spraying water, we need to know how many units of light or water are coming to some area in some period of time. A factory might have an \"intensity\" of 100 cars per day delivered to the loading dock. A fire hose might have an intensity of 100 buckets of water per minute per open window of a certain size in a burning building.\nUsually, when talking about intensity, we are talking about the amount of energy of particles or radiation per unit area. Since each particle spreads out from the source in a sphere, the area is measured as the surface area of this sphere, or formula_1, where formula_1 is the distance from the source to the observer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":92},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":298},{"uri":"Fire_hose","surface_form":"fire hose","offset":385}]}
