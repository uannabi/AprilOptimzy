{"id":231293,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora","text":"A fedora is a hat. The name of the hat comes from a play called Victorien Sardou, F\u00E9dora. Popular in the early 20th century, it has become a stereotype for gangsters or Private Investigators (PIs).\nThey mainly come in black, sometimes with a band of coloured fabric around the rim.\nSome people, such as Jack Abramoff and Richard W. Lariviere, become known for wearing fedoras.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hat","surface_form":"hat","offset":14},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":52},{"uri":"Victorien_Sardou","surface_form":"Victorien Sardou","offset":64},{"uri":"F%C3%A9dora","surface_form":"F\u00E9dora","offset":82},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":111},{"uri":"Stereotype","surface_form":"stereotype","offset":141},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":218},{"uri":"Fabric","surface_form":"fabric","offset":259},{"uri":"Jack_Abramoff","surface_form":"Jack Abramoff","offset":303},{"uri":"Richard_W._Lariviere","surface_form":"Richard W.
