{"id":231500,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biota","text":"=\"preserve\">A biota is a term used for all the living things at a certain time at a certain place. Examples of biota include Cambrian biota and Madagascan biota. Because it includes all the living members of a given environment, the term is used especially in ecology. A similar term is biome, which is used to refer to geographical regions and environments. Tundra, for example, is a biome.\nFlora, fauna and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively called biota.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cambrian","surface_form":"Cambrian","offset":125},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascan","offset":144},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":216},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":260},{"uri":"Biome","surface_form":"biome","offset":287},{"uri":"Geographical","surface_form":"geographical","offset":320},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":345},{"uri":"Tundra","surface_form":"Tundra","offset":359}]}
