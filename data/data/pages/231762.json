{"id":231762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach","text":"A head coach, senior coach or manager is a person who trains and develops men and women who play sports. They usually hold a more public profile and are paid more than other coaches on the team. In some sports such as soccer and baseball, the head coach is called a manager. In other sports, such as Australian rules football, they are called a senior coach. Some sports that use the phrase \"head coach\" include American football and basketball.\nThese head coaches sometimes have other coaches that report to them. These assistant coaches focus on one part of the team rather than the whole team. Assistant coaches often work in offensive positions or defensive positions. They can sometimes coach just one position on the team such as a coach just for the quarterbacks in American football.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"trains","offset":54},{"uri":"Develop","surface_form":"develops","offset":65},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":97},{"uri":"Coach_(sport)","surface_form":"coaches","offset":174},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":218},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":229},{"uri":"Manager_(baseball)","surface_form":"manager","offset":266},{"uri":"Australian_rules_football","surface_form":"Australian rules football","offset":300},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":412},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":434},{"uri":"Assistant","surface_form":"assistant","offset":521},{"uri":"Offense_(sports)","surface_form":"offensive","offset":629},{"uri":"Defense_(sport)","surface_form":"defensive","offset":652},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"position","offset":707},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":757}]}
