On his show, he was often critical of conservatives such as Bill O'Reilly and George W. Bush. Some compared him to O'Reilly, except that Olbermann was to the left and O'Reilly is to the right. Before being on political shows, Olbermann worked for ESPN as a sportscaster. He once hosted the ESPN sports news show SportsCenter.\nHe had his show on MSNBC, but was fired shortly after Comcast's takeover of NBC Universal in January 2011.
