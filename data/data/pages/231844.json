{"id":231844,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Bloods are a street gang. They were founded in 1972 in Los Angeles, California. They are rivals with the Crips, another street gang. Bloods members are known for wearing mostly red colors which is their gang color.\nDuring their rivalry with the Crips in the 1970s, a faction of the Crips called the Pirus street gang broke away from the Crips and joined other smaller gangs to make a gang which would later on become known as the Bloods. Some notable Bloods are rappers Game and Suge Knight.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gang","surface_form":"street gang","offset":30},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":72},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":85},{"uri":"Crips","surface_form":"Crips","offset":122},{"uri":"Rap_music","surface_form":"rappers","offset":479},{"uri":"The_Game_(rapper)","surface_form":"Game","offset":487},{"uri":"Suge_Knight","surface_form":"Suge Knight","offset":496}]}
