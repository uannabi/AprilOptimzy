{"id":23185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement","text":"A Rastafarian (often called a Rasta) is a member of the Rastafari movement. Most Rastafarians live in the Caribbean, most notably Jamaica.\nRastafarians say that Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, is Jah (shortened from Jehovah). They say that Jesus has returned again in the form of Haile Selassie I, or Jah, as he promised in the Bible, and he will deliver them to Zion, their name for paradise or Ethiopia.\nThere are several things that define a Rastafarian: they do not drink alcohol, they do not cut their hair, they spiritually smoke marijuana, they have a strict all-natural (often vegetarian) diet, and they believe in Jah and Zion.\nTheir diet is called \"I-tal\" derived from the word \"vital\", and is something like Jewish kosher, but sometimes with no meat at all.\nDreadlocks are a common hairstyle of Rastafarians. For them, dreadlocks are an expression of spirituality: the term \"dread\" refers to a \"fear of the Lord\".\nNaturality is an important part of the Rastafari way of life. They want to return to Africa and live naturally. They believe that smoking marijuana helps them to get in touch with Jah, and their way of life is improved when they practice meditation.\nRastafari movement in culture.\nMany reggae musicians are part of the Rastafari movement, including the famous musician Bob Marley, who died in 1981. Rapper Snoop Dogg became a Rastafarian in 2012. He has made an album of reggae music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":106},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":130},{"uri":"Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia","surface_form":"Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia","offset":161},{"uri":"Jehovah","surface_form":"Jehovah","offset":214},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":238},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":326},{"uri":"Zion","surface_form":"Zion","offset":361},{"uri":"Paradise","surface_form":"paradise","offset":382},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":394},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":474},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":505},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spiritually","offset":516},{"uri":"Cannabis","surface_form":"marijuana","offset":534},{"uri":"Vegetarianism","surface_form":"vegetarian","offset":583},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":595},{"uri":"Kosher","surface_form":"kosher","offset":724},{"uri":"Dreadlocks","surface_form":"Dreadlocks","offset":767},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1008},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"meditation","offset":1161},{"uri":"Reggae","surface_form":"reggae","offset":1209},{"uri":"Bob_Marley","surface_form":"Bob Marley","offset":1292},{"uri":"Snoop_Dogg","surface_form":"Snoop Dogg","offset":1329}]}
