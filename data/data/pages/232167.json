He wrote for various magazines including \"The Nation\", \"Free Inquiry\", \"Slate\", and others. He was a supporter of the philosophical movement humanism.\nHitchens was educated at Balliol College, Oxford. After graduation in 1970, he became a magazine writer. In 1982, he moved to Washington, D.C. In 1988, he learned from his grandmother that his mother was Jewish, but had kept her religion a secret. Hitchens remained an atheist and did not adopt any religious faith. He did not write about his religious views until his 2007 book \"God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.\"\nHitchens tried to write from first-hand experience. To write his essays, he braved gunfire in Sarajevo, he was jailed in Czechoslovakia, and in 2008, he was brutally beaten in Beirut, Lebanon. In 2009, Hitchens agreed to be waterboarded. He wrote in \"Vanity Fair\" magazine, \"If waterboarding does not constitute torture then there is no such thing as torture\".\nHitchens died of oesophageal cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"Anglo","offset":68},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":74},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":83},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":133},{"uri":"The_Nation","surface_form":"The Nation","offset":154},{"uri":"Free_Inquiry","surface_form":"Free Inquiry","offset":168},{"uri":"Slate_(magazine)","surface_form":"Slate","offset":184},{"uri":"Philosophical","surface_form":"philosophical","offset":230},{"uri":"Humanism","surface_form":"humanism","offset":253},{"uri":"Balliol_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Balliol College","offset":288},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":305},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduation","offset":319},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":389},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":467},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":492},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":532},{"uri":"Sarajevo","surface_form":"Sarajevo","offset":789},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":816},{"uri":"Beirut","surface_form":"Beirut","offset":871},{"uri":"Lebanon","surface_form":"Lebanon","offset":879},{"uri":"Waterboarding","surface_form":"waterboarded","offset":919},{"uri":"Vanity_Fair","surface_form":"Vanity Fair","offset":946},{"uri":"Oesophagus","surface_form":"oesophageal","offset":1073},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1085}]}
