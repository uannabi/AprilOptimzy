{"id":232349,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_powder","text":"Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent used to make baked foods lighter and less dense. Baking powder works by making a reaction between an acid and a base. This produces carbon dioxide bubbles to make the mixture light. Baking powder was invented by the English chemist Alfred Bird (1811 \u2013 15 December 1878) in 1843.\nIt is used when the food should not taste of yeast, or when the mixture is not elastic enough to hold bubbles for very long. Because carbon dioxide is made faster by baking powder than yeast, breads made with it are called quick breads.\nBird was quickly followed by Henry Jones (1812 \u2013 12 July 1891) who invented self-raising flour in 1845.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":23},{"uri":"Leavening_agent","surface_form":"leavening agent","offset":32},{"uri":"Baking","surface_form":"baked foods","offset":61},{"uri":"Dense","surface_form":"dense","offset":90},{"uri":"Reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":129},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":149},{"uri":"Base","surface_form":"base","offset":160},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":180},{"uri":"Alfred_Bird","surface_form":"Alfred Bird","offset":280},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":372},{"uri":"Elastic","surface_form":"elastic","offset":406},{"uri":"Quick_bread","surface_form":"quick bread","offset":550},{"uri":"Henry_Jones","surface_form":"Henry Jones","offset":593},{"uri":"Self-raising_flour","surface_form":"self-raising flour","offset":640}]}
