A tsunami warning was made by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center Pacific-wide, although they warned of the possibility of local tsunamis within 100\u00A0kilometers of the epicenter (between San Antonio and Concepci\u00F3n).\nAlthough news media first reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake, the initial geological summary given by the United States Geological Survey said it was a different earthquake. Though unchained by the regional stress caused by the February 27 earthquake, the March event was not a fast adjustment to February's thrust fault rupture between the Nazca and South American plates, but it was caused by normal faulting inside one of those plates. However, it has not been positively decided in which plate the earthquake occurred.\nWithin 6 hours, 10 aftershocks took place, of these 2 were of magnitude 6 or greater and 7 between magnitude 5 and 6.\nThe earthquake took place shortly before the new president, Sebasti\u00E1n Pi\u00F1era, was sworn in, at about 12:15\u00A0PM local time (15:15 UTC), at the Chilean congress in Valpara\u00EDso, where the shaking was clearly felt. The presidents of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Ecuador were present when the earthquake occurred, however, the television footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted.\nDamages reported by the Chilean news media include a collapsed pedestrian crossing over Chile Highway 5, north of Rancagua. The most affected place by the earthquake was Pichilemu, the epicentre of the earthquake. It destroyed the Ross Park, the most of the Agust\u00EDn Ross Cultural Centre and many houses in Espinillo and Rodeillo.\nMay 2, 2010 aftershock.\nThe May, 2 2010 Pichilemu earthquake was a magnitude 6.0 MW earthquake that struck off Pichilemu, Chile, at 10:52\u00A0AM on May 2, 2010 at the epicenter, at a depth of. USGS described that the epicenter was south-southwest of San Antonio, west Regional capital of Rancagua, northwest of Curic\u00F3 and southwest of the Chilean capital of Santiago.\nAfter almost exactly three hours later a second quake happens in the same area with an intensity of 4.8 MW\nMore than 10 aftershocks happened on May 2 and 3.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["earthquake"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pichilemu","surface_form":"Pichilemu","offset":72},{"uri":"O%27Higgins_Region","surface_form":"O'Higgins Region","offset":83},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":101},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":110},{"uri":"Pacific_Tsunami_Warning_Center","surface_form":"Pacific Tsunami Warning Center","offset":142},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":173},{"uri":"Epicenter","surface_form":"epicenter","offset":274},{"uri":"San_Antonio%2C_Chile","surface_form":"San Antonio","offset":293},{"uri":"Concepci%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Concepci\u00F3n","offset":309},{"uri":"United_States_Geological_Survey","surface_form":"United States Geological Survey","offset":461},{"uri":"February_2010_Chile_earthquake","surface_form":"February 27 earthquake","offset":583},{"uri":"Thrust_fault","surface_form":"thrust fault","offset":663},{"uri":"Nazca_plate","surface_form":"Nazca","offset":696},{"uri":"South_American_plate","surface_form":"South American plate","offset":706},{"uri":"Sebasti%C3%A1n_Pi%C3%B1era","surface_form":"Sebasti\u00E1n Pi\u00F1era","offset":1056},{"uri":"Valpara%C3%ADso","surface_form":"Valpara\u00EDso","offset":1157},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":1223},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":1232},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":1246},{"uri":"Chile_Highway_5","surface_form":"Chile Highway 5","offset":1467},{"uri":"Rancagua","surface_form":"Rancagua","offset":1493},{"uri":"Agust%C3%ADn_Ross_Cultural_Centre","surface_form":"Agust\u00EDn Ross Cultural Centre","offset":1637},{"uri":"Moment_magnitude_scale","surface_form":"MW","offset":1790},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1793},{"uri":"Pichilemu","surface_form":"Pichilemu","offset":1820},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1831},{"uri":"May_2","surface_form":"May 2","offset":1853},{"uri":"2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":1860},{"uri":"Epicenter","surface_form":"epicenter","offset":1872},{"uri":"San_Antonio%2C_Chile","surface_form":"San Antonio","offset":1955},{"uri":"Regions_of_Chile","surface_form":"Regional","offset":1973},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":1982},{"uri":"Rancagua","surface_form":"Rancagua","offset":1993},{"uri":"Curic%C3%B3","surface_form":"Curic\u00F3","offset":2016},{"uri":"Santiago%2C_Chile","surface_form":"Santiago","offset":2063},{"uri":"Moment_magnitude_scale","surface_form":"MW","offset":2177}]}
