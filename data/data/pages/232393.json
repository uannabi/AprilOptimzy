{"id":232393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man","text":"The term Renaissance man or woman or polymath is used for a very clever person who is good at many different things. The idea comes from a time of history called the Renaissance which lasted from about 1400 to about 1600. One of the most famous people alive during this time was Leonardo da Vinci. He was most famous as a painter, but he was also a scientist, engineer and mathematician. Leonardo is called a \"Renaissance man\". Another \"Renaissance man\" was Michelangelo, who was a sculptor, painter, architect and poet.\nWhen the term \"Renaissance man/woman\" is used, it does NOT mean that the man/woman really lived in the Renaissance. It can be used for anyone who is very clever at many different things, no matter when that person lived. Albert Schweitzer was a 20th century \"Renaissance man\" who was a theologian, musician, philosopher and doctor. Benjamin Franklin was a \"Renaissance man\" who lived in the 18th century (1700s) and was an author and printer, politician, scientist, inventor and soldier.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":147},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":166},{"uri":"Leonardo_da_Vinci","surface_form":"Leonardo da Vinci","offset":279},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":322},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":349},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":360},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":373},{"uri":"Michelangelo","surface_form":"Michelangelo","offset":458},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":482},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architect","offset":501},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poet","offset":515},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"clever","offset":675},{"uri":"Albert_Schweitzer","surface_form":"Albert Schweitzer","offset":742},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theologian","offset":807},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":819},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":829},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":845},{"uri":"Benjamin_Franklin","surface_form":"Benjamin Franklin","offset":853},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":944},{"uri":"Printing","surface_form":"printer","offset":955},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politician","offset":964}]}
