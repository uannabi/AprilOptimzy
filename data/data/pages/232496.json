{"id":232496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pseudocode (sometimes written as pseudo-code) is a description of the source code of a computer program or an algorithm in a language easily understood by humans.\nIt uses the general structure of a computer programming language, but omits details that are required by machines to execute the code. The primary purpose of writing pseudocode is to enable humans to understand the computer program or algorithm without having to understand the programming language.\nSyntax.\nPseudocode does not follow the syntax and grammar of any specific computer programming language. Variable declarations are generally omitted. Function calls and blocks of code, such as code for a loop, are often replaced by a one-line natural language sentence.\nExamples.\nReads the for loop and prints all the integers from 1 to 50.\nThis pseudocode outputs powers of two.\nThe above pseudocode sample computes a logical and function.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Source_code","surface_form":"source code","offset":83},{"uri":"For_loop","surface_form":"for loop","offset":766},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":794},{"uri":"Powers_of_two","surface_form":"powers of two","offset":841},{"uri":"Logical_and","surface_form":"logical and","offset":895}]}
