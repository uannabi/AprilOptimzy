During a battle game at the camp, Annabeth and Percy find an entrance into the Labyrinth. Percy soon learns that Luke had used the entrance and will lead his army through the Labyrinth straight in to the heart of Camp Half-Blood. To get into the Labyrinth, Percy has to find the Delta Symbol (\u0394) on a passageway, touch it, and then enter the Labyrinth.\nUsing the Labyrinth, Percy has to try to find Daedalus so Luke cannot get Ariadne's string, thereby foiling Luke's invasion.

After the battle, Daedalus sacrifices himself to close the labyrinth, which is tied to his life.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\" received generally positive reviews. \"Publishers Weekly\" praised Riordan saying, \"One of Riordan's strengths is the wry interplay between the real and the surreal.\" and adding that \"The wit, rousing swordplay and breakneck pace will once again keep kids hooked.\" \"Children's Literature\" said, \"Riordan creates a masterful weaving of Greek mythology and traditional fantasy in this latest book in \"The Olympians\" series.
