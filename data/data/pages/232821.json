Sarah Moore Grimke was born on November 26, 1792 and Angelina Emily Grimke was born on November 26, 1805. They traveled in the North, talking about their experiences with slavery on their father's plantation. They were often mocked and laughed at. They both saw that women needed more freedom to help change society. They began helping the women's rights movement.\nIn 1838, the sisters became the first women to speak at a meeting of the Massachusetts state legislature. They spoke about slavery and abolitionism. People were very shocked. They helped attract thousands of women in New England to the movement. Many came to hear Sarah and Angelina speak at public lectures.\nIn 1838, Sarah wrote a paper called \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women.\" It answered many questions which were asked in a letter by a group of ministers who did not like the sisters because they had stepped out of their \"woman's proper sphere\".\nWhen Sarah was 80, she tried to vote.\nThey lived to see the end to slavery, and the beginning of women's rights.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sarah_Grimk%C3%A9","surface_form":"Sarah Grimk\u00E9","offset":0},{"uri":"Angelina_Grimk%C3%A9","surface_form":"Angelina Grimk\u00E9 Weld","offset":29},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":110},{"uri":"Quaker","surface_form":"Quaker","offset":119},{"uri":"Abolitionism","surface_form":"abolitionism","offset":164},{"uri":"Women%27s_rights","surface_form":"women's rights","offset":181},{"uri":"Charleston%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Charleston","offset":229},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":241},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North","offset":389},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":433},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":459},{"uri":"Mock","surface_form":"mocked","offset":487},{"uri":"Women%27s_rights","surface_form":"women's rights movement","offset":602},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":700},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":720},{"uri":"Pastor","surface_form":"ministers","offset":1109},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":1202}]}
