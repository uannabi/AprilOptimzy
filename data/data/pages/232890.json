It was Apple's first server since the Apple Network Servers that they made in 1996. It first came with one or two PowerPC G4 processors. Later, new PowerPC G5 were added. Now, the server runs on two quad-core Intel Nehalem CPUs.\nThe Xserve can be used for many things, such as a file server and web server. It can even be used for high-performance computing applications using clustering\u2014a dedicated cluster Xserve, the Xserve Cluster Node. This means there are many Xserves linked together so they can combine their power. For this, it was available without a video card or optical drive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Server_(computing)","surface_form":"server","offset":16},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple Inc.","offset":31},{"uri":"2002","surface_form":"2002","offset":59},{"uri":"Apple_Network_Server","surface_form":"Apple Network Server","offset":103},{"uri":"PowerPC_G4","surface_form":"PowerPC G4","offset":179},{"uri":"CPU","surface_form":"processors","offset":190},{"uri":"PowerPC_G5","surface_form":"PowerPC G5","offset":213},{"uri":"Quad-core","surface_form":"quad-core","offset":264},{"uri":"Intel","surface_form":"Intel","offset":274},{"uri":"Intel_Nehalem_(microarchitecture)","surface_form":"Nehalem","offset":280},{"uri":"File_server","surface_form":"file server","offset":344},{"uri":"Web_server","surface_form":"web server","offset":360},{"uri":"High-performance_computing","surface_form":"high-performance computing","offset":396},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"application","offset":423},{"uri":"Cluster_(computing)","surface_form":"clustering","offset":442},{"uri":"Video_card","surface_form":"video card","offset":626},{"uri":"Optical_drive","surface_form":"optical drive","offset":640}]}
