{"id":233004,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerst%C3%A4tte","text":"Lagerst\u00E4tte (plural: \"Lagerst\u00E4tten\") is a German word for places (sites) of exceptional fossil preservation. Adolf Seilacher coined the term in 1970 to describe sites, like Solnhofen, which yielded the most exceptional fossils.\nExtra-special sites are called \"Konservat-Lagerst\u00E4tten\" (conservation Lagerst\u00E4tten). These are deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fine details. There skeletons are mostly articulated (bones together in life form), and the soft parts are preserved as impressions or casts.\nPreservation.\nIn Lagerst\u00E4tten the normal processses of decay after death were less active or halted as sediment was deposited. This allowed the preservation of soft parts and exceptional detail.\nIn these conditions, which are exceptional, scavengers, burrowers and bacteria are eliminated or reduced. Then the normal processes of deposition and fossilisation produces strata containing exceptional fossils.\nLessons learnt.\nMost of what we know about the details of extinct life comes from these exceptional sites. The soft-bodied Ediacaran biota, the fins of ichthyosaurs, the fur and wing structure of pterosaurs, the feathers on Mesozoic dinosaurs and birds, are all discoveries made on fossils from Lagerst\u00E4tten. These sites preserve much of the fauna and flora of the time and place. That permits reconstruction of its ecology.\nShort-list of Lagerst\u00E4tten.\nThere are about 50 sites which have been described as Lagerst\u00E4tten.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":42},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":88},{"uri":"Solnhofen_limestone","surface_form":"Solnhofen","offset":173},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":394},{"uri":"Casting","surface_form":"casts","offset":509},{"uri":"Decay","surface_form":"decay","offset":571},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":619},{"uri":"Scavenger","surface_form":"scavenger","offset":755},{"uri":"Burrower","surface_form":"burrower","offset":767},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":781},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":884},{"uri":"Ediacaran_biota","surface_form":"Ediacaran biota","offset":1046},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"ichthyosaur","offset":1075},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":1119},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":1147},{"uri":"Origin_of_birds","surface_form":"bird","offset":1170},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":1265},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":1275},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":1339}]}
