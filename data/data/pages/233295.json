{"id":233295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Chile","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chile is divided into 15 regions (in Spanish, \"regiones\"; singular \"regi\u00F3n\"), which are the first-level administrative division in the country. Each region is ruled by an intendant (\"intendente\"), designated by the President, and a body elected indirectly known as regional board (\"consejo regional\").\nRegions are divided into provinces (second-level administrative division), each of them ruled by a governor (\"gobernador\"), designated by the President too. There are 54 provinces, in total. Provinces are further divided into communes or \"comunas\" (third and lowest level administrative division), which are governed by municipalities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":13},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":38},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":50},{"uri":"Intendant","surface_form":"intendant","offset":184},{"uri":"President_of_Chile","surface_form":"President","offset":228},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Chile","surface_form":"province","offset":340},{"uri":"Communes_of_Chile","surface_form":"communes","offset":541},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":635}]}
