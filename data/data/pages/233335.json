People have long used gold for making jewelry or sacred objects used in religious worship.\nIn medieval Europe goldsmiths often acted as bankers.\nGoldsmiths use methods such as soldering, sawing, forging, casting, and polishing to make things out of gold. Goldsmiths traditionally teach their trade to apprentices. Today, jewelry arts schools teach goldsmithing and other similar skills.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":61},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":84},{"uri":"Sumer","surface_form":"Sumer","offset":117},{"uri":"Bowl","surface_form":"bowl","offset":132},{"uri":"Jewelry","surface_form":"jewelry","offset":189},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":223},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":245},{"uri":"Banker","surface_form":"banker","offset":287},{"uri":"Soldering","surface_form":"soldering","offset":327},{"uri":"Saw","surface_form":"saw","offset":338},{"uri":"Forging","surface_form":"forging","offset":346},{"uri":"Casting_(metalworking)","surface_form":"casting","offset":355},{"uri":"Polishing","surface_form":"polishing","offset":368},{"uri":"Apprentice","surface_form":"apprentice","offset":452}]}
