He was re-elected as Governing Mayor in 2006, and has carried on the coalition.\nHe supports Kurt Beck as \"Kanzlerkandidat\", the SPDs nominee for the Chancellorship of Germany.

He came out at a convention of the Berlin SPD just before the 2001 mayoral elections, when he said \" (\"I am gay, and it's good that way\".) This is now a famous quotation in Germany.
