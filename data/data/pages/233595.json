The show ran from 1995 to 1998. The show has random skits and songs with the characters Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak. Zorak and Brak are comic foils for Space Ghost. Moltar, a main character on Coast to Coast, does not appear on the show. In the credits everyone is credited by their first name only. The show has not been released on DVD, because of rights issues other than some segments being extras on The Brak Show Volume One. The show revived on Adult Swim briefly in 2005.\nIn 2012, the show has been revived but only Brak and Zorak host the show and the programming is Cartoon Network Original shows such as \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\", \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\", and others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adult_Swim","surface_form":"Adult Swim","offset":48},{"uri":"Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast","surface_form":"Space Ghost Coast to Coast","offset":68},{"uri":"Space_Ghost","surface_form":"Space Ghost","offset":185},{"uri":"Zorak","surface_form":"Zorak","offset":198},{"uri":"Brak","surface_form":"Brak","offset":209},{"uri":"Moltar","surface_form":"Moltar","offset":263},{"uri":"The_Brak_Show","surface_form":"The Brak Show","offset":503},{"uri":"Ed%2C_Edd_n_Eddy","surface_form":"Ed, Edd n Eddy","offset":713},{"uri":"Dexter%27s_Laboratory","surface_form":"Dexter's Laboratory","offset":731},{"uri":"The_Powerpuff_Girls","surface_form":"The Powerpuff Girls","offset":754}]}
