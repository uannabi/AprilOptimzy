{"id":233618,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_misspelled_words","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The term \"commonly misspelled words\" (or sometimes, \"common misspelled words\") is about words in English that are often spelled wrongly.\nIn writing, some words are often misspelled, such as the wrong spelling \"concensus\" for \"consensus\"\nfound in many webpages on the Internet. Other common misspellings include \"equiptment\" (for \"equipment\"),\nMispronunciation.\nMispronunciation is one of the most common causes of misspelling.\nTyping errors.\nSome spelling errors are because people's typing is not perfect, such as\nForeign words.\nA misspelling in English might be a legitimate spelling in another language; for example, the word \"address\" is spelled in German as \"adress\" (one letter \"d\"). \"immigrate\" can be written \"inmigrate\" by speakers of Spanish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mispronunciation","surface_form":"Mispronunciation","offset":375},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":667}]}
