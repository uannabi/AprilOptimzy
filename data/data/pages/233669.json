{"id":233669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Neyland","text":"Robert Reese Neyland (February 17, 1892 \u2013 March 28, 1962) was an American football coach. He also served in the United States Army and reached the rank of brigadier general. He is one of the few college football head coaches to coach the same school twice with a break in between the jobs. Neyland holds the record for most wins in University of Tennessee history with 173 wins in 216 games, six seasons without losing a game, nine regular seasons without losing a game, seven conference championships, and four national championships. At Tennessee, he has winning streaks of 33, 28, 23, 19, and 14 games.\nNeyland is often referred to as one of the best, if not the best, defensive football coaches ever. \"Sports Illustrated\" named Neyland as the defensive coordinator of its all-century college football team in its \"Best of the 20th Century\" edition. In 112 of his wins, the other team did not score a point. In 1938 and 1939, Neyland's team set NCAA records when they did not allow a point in 17 straight games. His 1939 team is the last NCAA team in history to hold every regular season opponent scoreless.\nNeyland Stadium at the University of Tennessee is not only named for \"The General\", but was designed by him. His plans included all expansions that have brought the stadium to its modern size with an over 100,000 seat capacity. Neyland was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1956.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":65},{"uri":"Coach_(sport)","surface_form":"coach","offset":83},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":112},{"uri":"Brigadier_general_(United_States)","surface_form":"brigadier general","offset":155},{"uri":"Record","surface_form":"record","offset":308},{"uri":"University_of_Tennessee","surface_form":"University of Tennessee","offset":332},{"uri":"League","surface_form":"conference","offset":477},{"uri":"Championship","surface_form":"championship","offset":488},{"uri":"Defense_(sports)","surface_form":"defensive","offset":672},{"uri":"Sports_Illustrated","surface_form":"Sports Illustrated","offset":706},{"uri":"Defensive_coordinator","surface_form":"defensive coordinator","offset":747},{"uri":"Century","surface_form":"century","offset":780},{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":948},{"uri":"Neyland_Stadium","surface_form":"Neyland Stadium","offset":1111},{"uri":"University_of_Tennessee","surface_form":"University of Tennessee","offset":1134},{"uri":"College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"College Football Hall of Fame","offset":1369}]}
