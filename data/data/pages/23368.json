{"id":23368,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awake","text":"=\"preserve\">Being Awake is a daily brain state. It is being in a state of consciousness where one is conscious about the surroundings. The person (or animal) can respond to these surroundings by communicating, walking, eating, and more.\nBeing awake is the opposite of being asleep. When you are asleep most responses to your surroundings are turned off, and you are unconscious of what is happening around you.\nAnimals are awake for some hours each day or night. Animals which are awake during the day are called diurnal. Animals which are awake during the night are called nocturnal.\nDiurnal animals include humans. They wake up in the morning and are awake during the day. When they are awake they can eat and move.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":35},{"uri":"State_of_consciousness","surface_form":"state of consciousness","offset":65},{"uri":"Conscious","surface_form":"conscious","offset":101},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communicating","offset":195},{"uri":"Walking","surface_form":"walking","offset":210},{"uri":"Eating","surface_form":"eating","offset":219},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"asleep","offset":274},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"Animal","offset":411},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":449},{"uri":"Night","surface_form":"night","offset":456},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":513},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":574},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":609},{"uri":"Morning","surface_form":"morning","offset":637}]}
