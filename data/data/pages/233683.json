{"id":233683,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zichy%C3%BAjfalu","text":"Zichy\u00FAjfalu is a village in Fej\u00E9r County, about 10\u00A0km from Lake Velencei, which is more or less easy to reach on road and on railway (Pusztaszabolcs-Sz\u00E9kesfeh\u00E9rv\u00E1r line). The settlement used to be a part of G\u00E1rdony but declared its independence in December 1997.\nThe settlement is first mentioned in writing in 1239, when villa Nowa (Nova) belonged to the V\u00E9rtes estates of the Cs\u00E1k clan. In 1447 it is mentioned as a noble name as Wyfalw (\u00DAjfalu).\nThe Family Zichy appeared as the landlord in \u00DAjfalu during Turkish occupation. After the Turkish rule the serfs of Sereg\u00E9lyes rented the land for some time. In 1784 the owner of the estate, J\u00E1nos Zichy, the son of Ferenc Zichy had a castle built in \u00DAjfalu and established a deer-park.\nThe paphrase Zichy in the name of the settlement refers to these earlier landlords, the members of the Zichy family. The hunting residence of de count is also in the village; currently the Mayor's Office functions in this building, therefore the building can only be observed from outside. The park and the forest of the castle offer active relaxation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":17},{"uri":"Fej%C3%A9r_County","surface_form":"Fej\u00E9r County","offset":28},{"uri":"Lake_Velencei","surface_form":"Lake Velencei","offset":59},{"uri":"Pusztaszabolcs-Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r_line","surface_form":"Pusztaszabolcs-Sz\u00E9kesfeh\u00E9rv\u00E1r line","offset":134},{"uri":"G%C3%A1rdony","surface_form":"G\u00E1rdony","offset":207},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":257},{"uri":"1239","surface_form":"1239","offset":311},{"uri":"1447","surface_form":"1447","offset":392},{"uri":"Family_Zichy","surface_form":"Family Zichy","offset":453},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":508},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":538},{"uri":"Sereg%C3%A9lyes","surface_form":"Sereg\u00E9lyes","offset":564},{"uri":"1784","surface_form":"1784","offset":609},{"uri":"J%C3%A1nos_Zichy","surface_form":"J\u00E1nos Zichy","offset":639},{"uri":"Ferenc_Zichy","surface_form":"Ferenc Zichy","offset":663},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":682},{"uri":"Zichy_family","surface_form":"Zichy family","offset":837},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":900}]}
