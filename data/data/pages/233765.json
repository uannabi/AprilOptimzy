{"id":233765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_major","text":"F major (or the key of F) is a musical major scale starting on F. Its key signature has one flat.\nIts relative minor is D minor and its parallel minor is F minor.\nF major is the home key of the English horn, the basset horn, the horn in F, the trumpet in F and the bass Wagner tuba. This means that if you want these instruments to sound in F major, you have to write in C major. Most of these sound a perfect fifth lower than written, except the trumpet in F which sounds a perfect fourth higher. (The basset horn also often sounds an octave and a fifth lower.)\nOf the six Overtures Francesco Maria Veracini wrote for Prince Friedrich Augustus in Dresden, most are in either F major or B-flat major because the prince's orchestra had a lot of wind instruments that played best in these keys.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":31},{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major scale","offset":39},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":70},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative minor","offset":102},{"uri":"D_minor","surface_form":"D minor","offset":120},{"uri":"Parallel_minor","surface_form":"parallel minor","offset":136},{"uri":"F_minor","surface_form":"F minor","offset":154},{"uri":"English_horn","surface_form":"English horn","offset":194},{"uri":"Basset_horn","surface_form":"basset horn","offset":212},{"uri":"Horn_(instrument)","surface_form":"horn","offset":229},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":244},{"uri":"Wagner_tuba","surface_form":"Wagner tuba","offset":270},{"uri":"C_major","surface_form":"C major","offset":371},{"uri":"Perfect_fift","surface_form":"perfect fift","offset":402},{"uri":"Perfect_fourth","surface_form":"perfect fourth","offset":475},{"uri":"Octave","surface_form":"octave","offset":536},{"uri":"Francesco_Maria_Veracini","surface_form":"Francesco Maria Veracini","offset":584},{"uri":"Augustus_III_of_Poland","surface_form":"Prince Friedrich Augustus","offset":619},{"uri":"B-flat_major","surface_form":"B-flat major","offset":687}]}
