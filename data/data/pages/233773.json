When written in jazz notation, its short form is Cm.\nIts relative major is E-flat major, and its parallel major is C major.\nUse in classical music.\nIn the Baroque period, music in C minor was usually written with a two-flat key signature. When this music is printed today, sometimes it is still printed in the same way.\nC minor has had the meaning of heroic struggle from Beethoven's time and the composer wrote many of his most emotional, dramatic works in this key. This has also been done by many others, following Beethoven's style.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_scale","surface_form":"minor scale","offset":13},{"uri":"Harmonic_minor","surface_form":"harmonic minor","offset":41},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":79},{"uri":"Jazz_notation","surface_form":"jazz notation","offset":126},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative major","offset":167},{"uri":"E-flat_major","surface_form":"E-flat major","offset":185},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel major","offset":207},{"uri":"C_major","surface_form":"C major","offset":225},{"uri":"Baroque_music","surface_form":"Baroque period","offset":265},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":461},{"uri":"Struggle","surface_form":"struggle","offset":468},{"uri":"Ludwig_van_Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":482}]}
