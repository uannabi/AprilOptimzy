{"id":233774,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_major","text":"A major (or the key of A) is a major scale with a base note of A. Its key signature has three sharps.\nIts relative minor is F-sharp minor. The key of A-major is the only key where a Neapolitan sixth chord on formula_1 needs both a flat and a natural accidental.\nThere are not as many symphonies in A major as in D major or G major, but more than other sharp keys. Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 and Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 4 are almost all the symphonies in this key in the Romantic era. Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major. Mozart used clarinets in A major often.\nIn chamber music, A major is used a lot. Johannes Brahms, C\u00E9sar Franck, and Gabriel Faur\u00E9 wrote violin sonatas in A major. Peter Cropper said that A major \"is the fullest sounding key for the violin.\", when he was talking about Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata.\nAccording to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, A major is a key that is good for \"declarations of innocent love... hope of seeing one's beloved again when parting; youthful cheerfulness and trust in God.\"\nWhen music for orchestra is in A major, the timpani are normally set to A and E a fifth apart. In most other keys, they are set a fourth apart.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major scale","offset":31},{"uri":"Tonic_(music)","surface_form":"base note","offset":50},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":70},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative minor","offset":106},{"uri":"F-sharp_minor","surface_form":"F-sharp minor","offset":124},{"uri":"Neapolitan_sixth","surface_form":"Neapolitan sixth","offset":182},{"uri":"D_major","surface_form":"D major","offset":312},{"uri":"G_major","surface_form":"G major","offset":323},{"uri":"Ludwig_van_Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":364},{"uri":"Symphony_No._7_(Beethoven)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 7","offset":376},{"uri":"Anton_Bruckner","surface_form":"Bruckner","offset":392},{"uri":"Symphony_No._6_(Bruckner)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 6","offset":403},{"uri":"Felix_Mendelssohn","surface_form":"Mendelssohn","offset":422},{"uri":"Symphony_No._4_(Mendelssohn)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 4","offset":436},{"uri":"Romantic_era","surface_form":"Romantic era","offset":500},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":514},{"uri":"Clarinet_Concerto_(Mozart)","surface_form":"Clarinet Concerto","offset":523},{"uri":"Clarinet_Quintet_(Mozart)","surface_form":"Clarinet Quintet","offset":545},{"uri":"Johannes_Brahms","surface_form":"Johannes Brahms","offset":664},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar_Franck","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar Franck","offset":681},{"uri":"Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9","surface_form":"Gabriel Faur\u00E9","offset":699},{"uri":"Violin_Sonata_No._9_(Beethoven)","surface_form":"Kreutzer Sonata","offset":863},{"uri":"Christian_Friedrich_Daniel_Schubart","surface_form":"Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart","offset":893},{"uri":"Timpani","surface_form":"timpani","offset":1132},{"uri":"Perfect_fifth","surface_form":"fifth","offset":1170},{"uri":"Perfect_fourth","surface_form":"fourth","offset":1218}]}
