Its key signature has four sharps.\nIts relative major is E major, and its parallel major is C-sharp major.\nClassical music in this key.\nThere are very few symphonies written in this key. One of them is by Joseph Martin Kraus, but he later rewrote it in C minor. Another two are Mahler's Symphony No. 5 (though only the first movement is in C-sharp minor, and the finale is actually in D major) and Prokofiev's Symphony No. 7. Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 2 is also in C-sharp minor.\nThis key occurs more often in piano music. Domenico Scarlatti wrotetwo keyboard sonatas in C-sharp minor, K. 246 and K. 247. But after Beethoven's famous \"Moonlight Sonata\", the key became more popular for piano. Beethoven used this key again in the outer movements of his String Quartet No. 14 (Op.\u00A0131, 1826). However, Johannes Brahms rewrote his C-sharp minor Piano Quartet to be published as Piano Quartet No. 3 in C minor, Op. 60. One of the most famous pieces in this key is Chopin's \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\". Other works include Chopin's Nocturnes No. 7 (Op. 27, No. 1) and No. 20 (Op. posth.), and his \"Raindrop\" Prelude in D-flat major (Op. 28, No. 15). Waltz in C sharp minor (op.64 No.2) is another well known musical piece from Chopin that uses this particular key (along with D flat minor key). Another very famous example of a work in C sharp minor is Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_scale","surface_form":"minor scale","offset":30},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":58},{"uri":"Sharp_(music)","surface_form":"sharps","offset":81},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative major","offset":93},{"uri":"E_major","surface_form":"E major","offset":111},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel major","offset":128},{"uri":"C-sharp_major","surface_form":"C-sharp major","offset":146},{"uri":"Joseph_Martin_Kraus","surface_form":"Joseph Martin Kraus","offset":259},{"uri":"C_minor","surface_form":"C minor","offset":307},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Mahler","offset":332},{"uri":"Symphony_No._5_(Mahler)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 5","offset":341},{"uri":"Movement_(music)","surface_form":"movement","offset":379},{"uri":"D_major","surface_form":"D major","offset":439},{"uri":"Sergei_Prokofiev","surface_form":"Prokofiev","offset":452},{"uri":"Symphony_No._7_(Prokofiev)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 7","offset":464},{"uri":"Dmitri_Shostakovich","surface_form":"Shostakovich","offset":480},{"uri":"Violin_Concerto_No._2_(Shostakovich)","surface_form":"Violin Concerto No. 2","offset":495},{"uri":"Domenico_Scarlatti","surface_form":"Domenico Scarlatti","offset":586},{"uri":"Ludwig_van_Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":678},{"uri":"Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)","surface_form":"Moonlight Sonata","offset":698},{"uri":"String_Quartet_No._14_(Beethoven)","surface_form":"String Quartet No. 14","offset":816},{"uri":"Johannes_Brahms","surface_form":"Johannes Brahms","offset":864},{"uri":"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin","surface_form":"Chopin's","offset":1024},{"uri":"Fantaisie-Impromptu","surface_form":"Fantaisie-Impromptu","offset":1034},{"uri":"Nocturnes_Op._27_(Chopin)","surface_form":"No. 7 (Op. 27, No. 1)","offset":1095},{"uri":"Nocturne_Op._Posth._in_C-sharp_minor_(Chopin)","surface_form":"No. 20 (Op. posth.)","offset":1121},{"uri":"Preludes_(Chopin)","surface_form":"\"Raindrop\" Prelude in D-flat major (Op. 28, No. 15)","offset":1150},{"uri":"Sergei_Rachmaninoff","surface_form":"Rachmaninoff","offset":1406},{"uri":"Prelude_in_C_sharp_minor_(Rachmaninoff)","surface_form":"Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2)","offset":1421}]}
