{"id":233781,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-flat_minor","text":"B minor or B-flat minor is a minor scale based on B-flat. Its key signature has five flats.\nIts relative major is D-flat major, and its parallel major is B-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is A-sharp minor.\nB-flat minor is often seen as a \"dark\" key.\" Tchaikovsky said that the oboe solo in B-flat minor in the second movement of his Symphony No. 4 was \"the feeling that you get when you are all alone\".\nThe old valveless horn could not play easily in B-flat minor. In fact, the only example found in 18th century music is a modulation in the first minuet of Franz Krommer's Concertino in D major, Opus 80.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_scale","surface_form":"minor scale","offset":29},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":62},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative major","offset":96},{"uri":"D-flat_major","surface_form":"D-flat major","offset":114},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel major","offset":136},{"uri":"B-flat_major","surface_form":"B-flat major","offset":154},{"uri":"A-sharp_minor","surface_form":"A-sharp minor","offset":197},{"uri":"Dark","surface_form":"dark","offset":245},{"uri":"Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Tchaikovsky","offset":257},{"uri":"Oboe","surface_form":"oboe","offset":283},{"uri":"Solo_(music)","surface_form":"solo","offset":288},{"uri":"Symphony_No._4_(Tchaikovsky)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 4","offset":339},{"uri":"Horn_(musical_instrument)","surface_form":"horn","offset":427},{"uri":"Modulation_(music)","surface_form":"modulation","offset":530},{"uri":"Franz_Krommer","surface_form":"Franz Krommer","offset":564}]}
