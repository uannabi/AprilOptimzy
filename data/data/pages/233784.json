{"id":233784,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major","text":"G-flat major is a major scale based on G-flat. Its key signature has six flats.\nIts relative minor is E-flat minor, and its parallel minor is G-flat minor. This is usually replaced by F\u266F minor because G\u266D minor's two double-flats make it generally impractical to use.\nIts enharmonic equivalent is F-sharp major, whose key signature also has six accidentals. In writing music in E major for B-flat instruments, it is preferable to use a G-flat rather an F-sharp key signature.\nG-flat major is sometimes used as a main key for piano works, such as the impromptus of Chopin and Schubert, but rarely for orchestra.\nAustrian composer Gustav Mahler liked to use G-flat major in his symphonies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major scale","offset":18},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":51},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative minor","offset":84},{"uri":"E-flat_minor","surface_form":"E-flat minor","offset":102},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel minor","offset":124},{"uri":"Enharmonic_equivalent","surface_form":"enharmonic equivalent","offset":271},{"uri":"F-sharp_major","surface_form":"F-sharp major","offset":296},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":317},{"uri":"B-flat","surface_form":"B-flat","offset":389},{"uri":"Impromptu","surface_form":"impromptu","offset":549},{"uri":"Chopin","surface_form":"Chopin","offset":563},{"uri":"Schubert","surface_form":"Schubert","offset":574},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":599},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austrian","offset":610},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Gustav Mahler","offset":628}]}
