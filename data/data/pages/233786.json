{"id":233786,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-flat_minor","text":"E minor or E-flat minor is a minor scale based on E-flat. Its key signature has six flats.\nIts relative major is G-flat major, and its parallel major is E-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is D-sharp minor.\nThis key is not used much in orchestral music, and usually only to modulate. It is used in some keyboard pieces and has been most popular in Russian pieces. If piano music in this key must be arranged for orchestra, some people recommend transposing it into D minor or E minor.\nIn book 1 of the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, Prelude No. 8 is written in E-flat minor while the following Fugue is written in D-sharp minor. In book 2, both movements are in D-sharp minor.\nOne of the few symphonies written in this key is Prokofiev's Symphony No. 6. A few other Soviet composers also wrote symphonies in this key, such as Eshpai, Janis Ivanovs (fourth symphony \"Atlantis\", 1941), Ovchinnikov and Myaskovsky. Rachmaninov's \"Elegie\", Op. 3 No. 1 is in E-flat minor, as is his \u00C9tudes-Tableaux Op. 39 #5. These pieces are noted for being dark and mysterious, a mood this key has. This mood is shown even in the later jazz music \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Take Five\", which are also in the key.\nThe second movement to Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony has a long orchestral and choral introduction in E-flat minor. The dark orchestral introduction to Beethoven's only oratorio, Christ on the Mount of Olives, is also in this key.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Scale"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_scale","surface_form":"minor scale","offset":29},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":62},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative major","offset":95},{"uri":"G-flat_major","surface_form":"G-flat major","offset":113},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel major","offset":135},{"uri":"E-flat_major","surface_form":"E-flat major","offset":153},{"uri":"D-sharp_minor","surface_form":"D-sharp minor","offset":196},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":240},{"uri":"Modulate","surface_form":"modulate","offset":278},{"uri":"Transposing","surface_form":"transposing","offset":449},{"uri":"Well-Tempered_Clavier","surface_form":"Well-Tempered Clavier","offset":507},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":533},{"uri":"Sergei_Prokofiev","surface_form":"Prokofiev","offset":749},{"uri":"Symphony_No._6_(Prokofiev)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 6","offset":761},{"uri":"Andrei_Eshpai","surface_form":"Eshpai","offset":849},{"uri":"Janis_Ivanovs","surface_form":"Janis Ivanovs","offset":857},{"uri":"Nikolai_Myaskovsky","surface_form":"Myaskovsky","offset":923},{"uri":"Rachmaninov","surface_form":"Rachmaninov","offset":935},{"uri":"%C3%89tudes-Tableaux","surface_form":"\u00C9tudes-Tableaux","offset":1001},{"uri":"Mysterious","surface_form":"mysterious","offset":1070},{"uri":"%27Round_Midnight_(song)","surface_form":"'Round Midnight","offset":1152},{"uri":"Take_Five","surface_form":"Take Five","offset":1174},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Gustav Mahler's","offset":1236},{"uri":"Symphony_No._8_(Mahler)","surface_form":"Eighth Symphony","offset":1252},{"uri":"Choral","surface_form":"choral","offset":1294},{"uri":"Oratorio","surface_form":"oratorio","offset":1384},{"uri":"Christ_on_the_Mount_of_Olives_(Beethoven)","surface_form":"Christ on the Mount of Olives","offset":1394}]}
