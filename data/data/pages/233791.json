{"id":233791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-flat_minor","text":"A-flat minor is a minor scale starting on A. Its key signature has seven flats.\nIts relative major is C-flat major, and its parallel major is A-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is G-sharp minor.\nA-flat minor is rarely used as the main key of a piece of music.\nMore often, pieces in a minor mode that have A as the tonic are written in the enharmonic key, G-sharp minor, because it has a simpler key signature. Because of this, there are few works in A-flat minor.\nIn some scores, the A minor key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top.\nIn popular music.\nA-flat minor is also used in Frederick Loewe's score to the 1956 musical play \"My Fair Lady\"; the Second Servants' Chorus is set in A-flat minor.\nAnother example of popular music in A-flat minor is Walkin' on the Sun by Smash Mouth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_scale","surface_form":"minor scale","offset":18},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative major","offset":84},{"uri":"C-flat_major","surface_form":"C-flat major","offset":102},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel major","offset":124},{"uri":"A-flat_major","surface_form":"A-flat major","offset":142},{"uri":"Enharmonic_equivalent","surface_form":"enharmonic equivalent","offset":160},{"uri":"G-sharp_minor","surface_form":"G-sharp minor","offset":185},{"uri":"Tonic_(music)","surface_form":"tonic","offset":319},{"uri":"Enharmonic","surface_form":"enharmonic","offset":344},{"uri":"G-sharp_minor","surface_form":"G-sharp minor","offset":360},{"uri":"Frederick_Loewe","surface_form":"Frederick Loewe","offset":643},{"uri":"My_Fair_Lady","surface_form":"My Fair Lady","offset":693},{"uri":"Walkin%27_on_the_Sun","surface_form":"Walkin' on the Sun","offset":812},{"uri":"Smash_Mouth","surface_form":"Smash Mouth","offset":834}]}
