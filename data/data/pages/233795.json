{"id":233795,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-flat_minor","text":"D-flat minor is a theoretical key based on the musical note D. Its key signature has seven flats and one double flat.\nBecause it has so many flats, D minor is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of C minor. For example, Mahler's thematic motif \"der kleine Appell\" (\"call to order\") from his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies is written in D minor in Symphony No.4, but in his Symphony No. 5 it is in C minor. In the \"Adagio\" of his Symphony No. 9 a solo bassoon theme appears first in D minor, but comes back two more times notated in C minor. The \"Adagio\" of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8, also has phrases that are tonally in D minor but written as C minor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theoretical_key","surface_form":"theoretical key","offset":18},{"uri":"D%E2%99%AD_(musical_note)","surface_form":"D","offset":60},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":67},{"uri":"Enharmonic_equivalent","surface_form":"enharmonic equivalent","offset":182},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Mahler","offset":229},{"uri":"Symphony_No._9_(Mahler)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 9","offset":435},{"uri":"Anton_Bruckner","surface_form":"Bruckner","offset":563},{"uri":"Symphony_No._8_(Bruckner)","surface_form":"Symphony No. 8","offset":574}]}
