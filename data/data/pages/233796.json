{"id":233796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-sharp_major","text":"G-sharp major is a major scale based on the musical note G sharp. Its key signature has six sharps and one double sharp.\nTo make reading easier, G-sharp major is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of A-flat major. However, it does appear as a secondary key area in several works in sharp keys, for example in the Prelude and Fugue in C sharp major from Bach's Well-Tempered Klavier, Book 1. The G sharp minor Prelude and Fugue from the same set end with a Picardy third in G sharp major.\nG sharp major is used for a short time in several of Chopin's nocturnes in C sharp minor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major scale","offset":19},{"uri":"Note_(music)","surface_form":"note","offset":52},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":70},{"uri":"Enharmonic_equivalent","surface_form":"enharmonic equivalent","offset":185},{"uri":"A-flat_major","surface_form":"A-flat major","offset":210},{"uri":"Picardy_third","surface_form":"Picardy third","offset":466},{"uri":"Chopin","surface_form":"Chopin","offset":551}]}
