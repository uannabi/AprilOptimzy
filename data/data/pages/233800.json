{"id":233800,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_(music)","text":"In music, sharp, or \"Diese\", means higher in pitch. In musical notation, sharp means \"higher in pitch by a semitone (half step),\" and looks like this:().\nUnder twelve-tone equal temperament, \"B sharp\", for instance, is enharmonically equivalent to (sounds the same as), \"C natural\", and \"G sharp\" is enharmonically equivalent to \"A flat\".\nDouble sharps also exist; these have the symbol and raise a note by two semitones, or a whole step. Less often there are half or three-quarter sharps.\nAlthough very rare and used only in modern classical music, a triple sharp () can sometimes be found. This raises a note by three semitones.\nThe Circle of fifths tells you how many sharps are in a key signature.\nIn tuning, sharp can also mean \"slightly higher in pitch\". If the same note is played on two instruments, and one is slightly higher, it is too sharp compared to the other.\nIn Unicode, the sharp symbol (\u266F) is at code point U+266F. Its HTML entity is &amp;#9839;. The double sharp symbol () is at U+1D12A. Some fonts do not show these symbols.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":3},{"uri":"Pitch","surface_form":"pitch","offset":45},{"uri":"Musical_notation","surface_form":"musical notation","offset":55},{"uri":"Pitch_(music)","surface_form":"pitch","offset":96},{"uri":"Semitone","surface_form":"semitone","offset":107},{"uri":"Equal_temperament","surface_form":"equal temperament","offset":172},{"uri":"Enharmonic","surface_form":"enharmonic","offset":219},{"uri":"Natural_sign","surface_form":"natural","offset":273},{"uri":"Flat_(music)","surface_form":"flat","offset":332},{"uri":"Semitones","surface_form":"semitones","offset":411},{"uri":"Circle_of_fifths","surface_form":"Circle of fifths","offset":635},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":878}]}
