{"id":233902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nimzovich","text":"e=\"preserve\">Aaron Nimzovich (7 November 1886 \u2013 16 March 1935) was a Jewish Latvian-born Danish chess grandmaster, and a very influential chess writer. He was the foremost figure amongst the \"hypermoderns\".\nHe wrote an important text on chess strategy called \"My system: a chess treatise\", which is still highly regarded. It is a foundation of modern positional chess, and has been read by most chess masters since then. In it he reacted against the more classical views of Siegbert Tarrasch. Later he wrote \"Chess praxis\" (1929), a collection of his games showing his ideas in practice.\nNimzovich was the subject of a chess biography by English grandmaster Ray Keene, which was translated into Russian in 1986.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":69},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":76},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":89},{"uri":"Grandmaster_(chess)","surface_form":"chess grandmaster","offset":96},{"uri":"Hypermodern","surface_form":"hypermodern","offset":192},{"uri":"List_of_chess_terms","surface_form":"positional","offset":351},{"uri":"Siegbert_Tarrasch","surface_form":"Siegbert Tarrasch","offset":474},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":695}]}
