{"id":23407,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_tree","text":"The olive tree is a small tree. Its scientific name is \"Olea europaea\". A long time ago, it came from the coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, from Syria and the maritime (next to the sea) parts of Asia Minor and northern Iran at the south end of the Caspian Sea. It has been farmed for a very long time. The Ancient Greeks were farming it. They spread the trees to the western part of the Mediterranean.\nOlive trees like soil with lots of chalk in it. They grow best on limestone slopes and crags in coastal climate.\nDescription of the tree.\nThe Wild Olive is a small tree or shrub that grows up to 8\u201315 m tall with thorny branches. The leaves are opposite, 4\u201310 cm long and 1\u20133\u00A0cm wide. The leaves have a dark greyish-green color above and are pale with whitish scales below. The small white flowers, with calyx and corolla divided into four parts, two stamens and bifid stigma, are mostly on the last year's wood, in racemes coming up from the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small drupe 1\u20132\u00A0cm long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars.\nCultural significance.\nVery probably, the first olive trees were grown in Syria. From there they spread rapidly. In Ancient Greece, the tree was considered to be holy. Some city states (polis) like Athens punished people for cutting down olive trees.\nThe branches in the flag of the United Nations are those of an olive tree.\nIn Christianity, the olive tree can be a sign of peace, because according to the Bible, a dove brought an olive branch to Noah to show that the flood was over.\nThe olive tree is the National tree of Palestine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":26},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":135},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":155},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":205},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":229},{"uri":"Caspian_Sea","surface_form":"Caspian Sea","offset":258},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":316},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":429},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":447},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":478},{"uri":"Crag","surface_form":"crag","offset":499},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":516},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":576},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":584},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":612},{"uri":"Spine_(botany)","surface_form":"thorny","offset":624},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":631},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":645},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"cm","offset":671},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":801},{"uri":"Sepal","surface_form":"calyx","offset":815},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"corolla","offset":825},{"uri":"Stamen","surface_form":"stamen","offset":862},{"uri":"Carpel","surface_form":"stigma","offset":880},{"uri":"Raceme","surface_form":"raceme","offset":927},{"uri":"Axil","surface_form":"axil","offset":954},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":979},{"uri":"Drupe","surface_form":"drupe","offset":996},{"uri":"Orchard","surface_form":"orchard","offset":1066},{"uri":"Cultivar","surface_form":"cultivar","offset":1074},{"uri":"Holy","surface_form":"holy","offset":1247},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":1283},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":1356},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":1414},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":1460},{"uri":"Dove","surface_form":"dove","offset":1501},{"uri":"Deluge_myth","surface_form":"flood","offset":1555},{"uri":"National_trees","surface_form":"National tree","offset":1593},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":1610}]}
