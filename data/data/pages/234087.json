{"id":234087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny","text":"e=\"preserve\">Neoteny is a type of heterochrony where bodily development is slowed, but sexual development goes on at the same rate. This results in a sexually mature juvenile or larval form. A classic example is the Axolotl.\nThese are some of the neotenous traits in humans: flattened face, broadened face, large brain, hairless body, hairless face, small nose, reduction of brow ridge, small teeth, small upper jaw (maxilla), small lower jaw (mandible), thinness of skull bones, limbs proportionately short compared to torso length, longer leg than arm length, larger eyes, and upright stance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heterochrony","surface_form":"heterochrony","offset":34},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":178},{"uri":"Axolotl","surface_form":"Axolotl","offset":216},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"traits","offset":257}]}
