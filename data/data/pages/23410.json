{"id":23410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello","text":"Hello is a greeting in the English language. It is common between two people in a non-formal (informal) setting, but can also be used in a formal setting. There are also many other ways of saying \"hello\", for example a wave of the hand, a salute or a bow (both very formal), a handshake (a little formal) or a high five (very informal). Saying \"hello\" is a sign of politeness, especially when it is said in a friendly way. \"Hello\" was first used in writing in about 1833.\nMany people say \"Hello\" when they answer a phone call.\nOther greetings like \"hello\" include; Hi, Hallo, Hiya, Howdy, Hey, Howya, 'Sup, Yo, 'Yello, Herro, hiwo, Greetings, Good day, what's poppin', G\u2019day mate, top of the mornin\u2019 to you, and many more.\nPeople then often say \u201Cgoodbye\u201D when they leave each other. \u201Cgoodbye\u201D is a shortened version of the religious farewell expression \u201Cgod be with ye\u201D, which indicates the user\u2019s religious belief, usually in a single god. Similar expressions exist in other languages such as: adieu, adieus, adieux, adios. These terms also possess religious undertones as they are derived from the Latin word \u201Cdeus\u201D, meaning \u201Cgod\u201D. This of course does not always mean they are religious.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greeting","surface_form":"greeting","offset":11},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":27},{"uri":"Formal","surface_form":"formal","offset":86},{"uri":"Informal","surface_form":"informal","offset":94},{"uri":"Wave_(gesture)","surface_form":"wave","offset":219},{"uri":"Bowing","surface_form":"bow","offset":251},{"uri":"Handshake","surface_form":"handshake","offset":277},{"uri":"High_five","surface_form":"high five","offset":310},{"uri":"Informal","surface_form":"informal","offset":326},{"uri":"Politeness","surface_form":"politeness","offset":365}]}
