{"id":23414,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria","text":"Manchuria (Northeast China) is the homeland of the Manchu people. To the Chinese, the region is simply known as the Northeast (Chinese: \u4E1C\u5317, D\u014Dngb\u0115i). Manchuria is made up of China's three northeastern most provinces: Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Parts of Manchuria were annexed by the Russian Empire in the past, and they are now ruled by Russia.\nThe name \u201CManchuria\u201D comes from a Japanese version of the Chinese word Manzhou ().\nHistory.\nIn the early history, Manchuria was under the control of many Chinese kingdoms. Later, the Manchu people formed their own empire called Jurchen. They eventually invaded China and founded the Manchu Qing Dynasty.\nAlthough the Manchus, who at the time ruled China, signed a treaty with Russia, the Russians took advantage of the weak Qing government and annexed the part that touches the Pacific Ocean, where the modern Chinese city of Dalian stands today. Japan then attacked the Russians to take this important piece of land. Later, Japan invaded the Chinese part of Manchuria too (see Manchukuo). This eventually led to World War II.\nAfter the war, Manchuria was handed over to China by the Soviet Union.\nGeography.\nManchuria is in north-east China and the Russian Far East. The land has rocks, grasslands, mountains, and deserts. The weather is very extreme. It is very hot and humid in the summer, and is very cold and dry in the winter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manchu","surface_form":"Manchu people","offset":51},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":127},{"uri":"Liaoning","surface_form":"Liaoning","offset":217},{"uri":"Jilin","surface_form":"Jilin","offset":227},{"uri":"Heilongjiang","surface_form":"Heilongjiang","offset":238},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexed","offset":276},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":291},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":345},{"uri":"Jin_Dynasty","surface_form":"Jurchen","offset":581},{"uri":"Qing_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qing Dynasty","offset":643},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Nerchinsk","surface_form":"treaty","offset":717},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":729},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexed","offset":797},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":831},{"uri":"Dalian","surface_form":"Dalian","offset":879},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":900},{"uri":"Manchukuo","surface_form":"Manchukuo","offset":1031},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1066},{"uri":"Russian_Far_East","surface_form":"Russian Far East","offset":1203},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1253},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1268},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":1281}]}
