{"id":234196,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadap","text":"The village of Nadap lies on the eastern slopes of Velencei Hills, it is a well oriented, self-contained settlement, with charming rural atmosphere. It is only two kilometers both from the recreation facilities of Lake Velencei and from the M7 motorway, therefore it is easily accessible from Budapest and from Sz\u00E9kesfeh\u00E9rv\u00E1r, too. Each house in the settlement has a great panorama.\nLocal sights.\nThe settlements around Lake Velencei are overwhelmed with the spirit of Mih\u00E1ly V\u00F6r\u00F6smarty. Nadap is not different either, the poet was baptised in the village on 3 December 1800. The baptistery is still in the church today. The inhabitants of the village expressed their admiration for the memory of the poet with a sculpture erected in the Millenium Park.\nNadap also hosts a key cartographical and architectural specialty; it is the home of the etalon for measuring heights in Hungary, called Nadapi szintez\u00E9si \u0151sjegy (Levelling mark of Nadap).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":4},{"uri":"Velencei_Hills","surface_form":"Velencei Hills","offset":51},{"uri":"Lake_Velencei","surface_form":"Lake Velencei","offset":214},{"uri":"Budapest","surface_form":"Budapest","offset":293},{"uri":"Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r","surface_form":"Sz\u00E9kesfeh\u00E9rv\u00E1r","offset":311},{"uri":"Lake_Velencei","surface_form":"Lake Velencei","offset":420},{"uri":"Mih%C3%A1ly_V%C3%B6r%C3%B6smarty","surface_form":"Mih\u00E1ly V\u00F6r\u00F6smarty","offset":469},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":548},{"uri":"3_December","surface_form":"3 December","offset":559},{"uri":"1800","surface_form":"1800","offset":570},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":875}]}
