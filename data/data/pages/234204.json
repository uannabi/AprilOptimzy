{"id":234204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1zm%C3%A1nd","text":"P\u00E1zm\u00E1nd is in the easternmost part of Velencei Hills, at the foot of Zsid\u00F3 Hill (202m).\nHistory.\nArchaeological artefacts prove that the village was already been populated the in Iron Age. The name of the village comes from the period when the State was founded; the area was probably awarded as a gift to Knight P\u00E1zm\u00E1ny to function as a summer residence.\nLittle is known about the history of the settlement in the Middle Ages. One thing is sure: when the Turks were expelled from Hungary the fleeing troops slaughtered the families living here, destroyed the Romanesque church and set the village on fire.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century T\u00F3t people (Slovakians) were settled in the area, the village was even called T\u00F3t-P\u00E1zm\u00E1nd for some time. The inhabitants of the village declared themselves Hungarians already in the 19th century but their Slovakian roots are still noticeable in their conventions (Sib\u00E1l\u00E1s - Easter lashing).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Velencei_Hills","surface_form":"Velencei Hills","offset":38},{"uri":"Zsid%C3%B3_Hill","surface_form":"Zsid\u00F3 Hill","offset":69},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":137},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":179},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":205},{"uri":"Knight_P%C3%A1zm%C3%A1ny","surface_form":"Knight P\u00E1zm\u00E1ny","offset":306},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":415},{"uri":"Turkish_people","surface_form":"Turks","offset":456},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":481},{"uri":"Romanesque","surface_form":"Romanesque","offset":560},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":590},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":631},{"uri":"Slovaks","surface_form":"Slovakians","offset":656},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":698},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":772},{"uri":"Hungarians","surface_form":"Hungarians","offset":800},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":826},{"uri":"Slovaks","surface_form":"Slovakian","offset":849}]}
