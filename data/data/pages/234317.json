{"id":234317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_railway_station","text":"Reading railway station (formerly Reading General) is a major rail junction and station in the English town of Reading. It is on the northern edge of the town centre, close to the main retail and commercial areas, and also the River Thames. Next to the railway station is a bus interchange, served by most of Reading's urban and rural bus services.\nReading was opened on 30 March 1840 by the Great Western Railway. It is a major junction point on the National Rail system, and as a consequence the railway station is a major transfer point as well as serving heavy local traffic. The station is sponsored by the bank ING Direct and the University of Reading. There are many local buses, regional buses and a coach to Heathrow Airport. South West Trains, First Great Western and CrossCountry serve the station.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":95},{"uri":"Reading%2C_Berkshire","surface_form":"Reading","offset":111},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":227},{"uri":"Bus_interchange","surface_form":"bus interchange","offset":274},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":392},{"uri":"National_Rail","surface_form":"National Rail","offset":451},{"uri":"ING_Direct","surface_form":"ING Direct","offset":617},{"uri":"University_of_Reading","surface_form":"University of Reading","offset":636},{"uri":"Heathrow_Airport","surface_form":"Heathrow Airport","offset":717},{"uri":"South_West_Trains","surface_form":"South West Trains","offset":735},{"uri":"First_Great_Western","surface_form":"First Great Western","offset":754},{"uri":"CrossCountry","surface_form":"CrossCountry","offset":778}]}
