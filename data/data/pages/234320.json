{"id":234320,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Left_Undone","text":"\"The Good Left Undone\" is the third single from the American punk rock band Rise Against's fourth album, \"The Sufferer & the Witness\". In June 2007, they said that they would be holding a contest to see who could make the best video for the song. They released a bulletin board over their MySpace account giving information about the contest.\nThe song got to number six on the \"Billboard\" alternative rock chart, making it the band's second top 10 single (the first being the last single \"Prayer of the Refugee\") and highest charting single from the album. The song has spent 30 weeks on the chart before its peak, making it the band's slowest climb to the chart's Top 10.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":52},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":61},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":71},{"uri":"Rise_Against","surface_form":"Rise Against","offset":76},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":98},{"uri":"The_Sufferer_%26amp%3B_the_Witness","surface_form":"The Sufferer & the Witness","offset":106},{"uri":"Contest","surface_form":"contest","offset":188},{"uri":"Bulletin_board","surface_form":"bulletin board","offset":263},{"uri":"MySpace","surface_form":"MySpace","offset":289},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":312},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":359},{"uri":"Six","surface_form":"six","offset":366},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":389},{"uri":"Prayer_of_the_Refugee","surface_form":"Prayer of the Refugee","offset":489}]}
