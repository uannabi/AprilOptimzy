{"id":234324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_Minute","text":"\"Revolutions per Minute\" is the second album by the American punk rock band Rise Against. It has the singles \"Heaven Knows\" and \"Like the Angel\" as well as a cover of Journey's single, \"Any Way You Want It.\"\nThe album had a limited release on vinyl (217 of which were on red vinyl) which is now out of print. It was the band's last release under Fat Wreck Chords before to their move to Geffen Records. This is where they released \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" in 2004. It is interesting to note that inside the album cover, there is a copyright to Transistor Revolt, the band's name before they changed it to Rise Against.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":39},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":52},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":61},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":71},{"uri":"Rise_Against","surface_form":"Rise Against","offset":76},{"uri":"Fat_Wreck_Chords","surface_form":"Fat Wreck Chords","offset":346},{"uri":"Geffen_Records","surface_form":"Geffen Records","offset":387},{"uri":"Siren_Song_of_the_Counter_Culture","surface_form":"Siren Song of the Counter Culture","offset":432},{"uri":"Cover","surface_form":"cover","offset":524}]}
