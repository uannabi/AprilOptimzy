The city is an independent municipality not part of any provinces, and its population as of 2008 is just over 1 million. Located in the north central part of the country, the city is at an elevation of about 1310 m in a valley on the Tuul River. The city is the country's center for culture, industry and finance, and since it is more than 13 times bigger than the second largest city in Mongolia, Erdenet, it is the country's primate city. Ulaanbaatar is connected by highway to all the major towns in Mongolia and by rail to the Trans-Siberian Railway and Chinese railroad network. The city was founded in 1639 as a Buddhist monastery center and, in the 20th century, grew into a major manufacturing center.\nNames.\nUlaanbaatar has had many names in its history.

When the city became the capital of the new Mongolian People's Republic in 1924, its name was changed to Ulaanbaatar, literally \"red hero\", in honour of Mongolia's national hero Damdin S\u00FCkhbaatar, that liberated Mongolia from Ungern von Sternberg's troops and Chinese occupation with the Soviet Red Army. In Europe and North America, Ulaanbaatar was generally known as Urga (from \"\u00D6rg\u00F6\u00F6\") or sometimes \"Kuren\" (from \"Kh\u00FCree\") or \"Kulun\" (from \u5EAB\u502B, the Chinese transcription of \"Kh\u00FCree\") before 1924.\nGeography.\nUlaanbaatar is at about 1350 meters (4430\u00A0ft) above sea level.
