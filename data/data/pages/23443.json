{"id":23443,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"Quake is also a short-form of the word earthquake.\"\n\"Quake\" is a first-person shooter video game that was released by id Software on July 22, 1996. It is the first game in the popular \"Quake\" series of video games. In the game, the player must fight demons and zombies in lots of different places.\n\"Quake\" was the first game that id Software released after they made \"Doom\" and \"Doom 2.\" It is a very similar game to \"Doom\", but \"Quake\" is on a new game engine and has much more advanced technology. For example, \"Quake\" lets the player look up and down, lets the player jump, it has fully 3D graphics, and has many more options for multiplayer than \"Doom\" had. \"Quake\" is famous for its multiplayer, and it was one of the first games where lots of people played multiplayer through the internet. \"Doom\" also had online multiplayer through a service called DWANGO, but \"Quake\" made playing online more popular than ever before. Tools like QuakeWorld and QuakeSpy made it very easy for players to find other people to play against over the internet.\nThe game's music and sound effects were done by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.\nGameplay.\nIn the single-player mode of \"Quake,\" the player has to get to the end of each level. The player will usually have to find keys or switches to open all the locked doors before they can get to the exit of a level. They will also have to fight lots of monsters that try to kill the player. There are also secret areas and secret levels that the player can find. Secret areas will usually have something that helps the player win the level, like extra health or ammo. The player always has two weapons: the axe and the shotgun. More weapons can be found in the levels, including the nailgun, super nailgun, super shotgun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and the thunderbolt.\nThe levels are grouped together into different episodes, and each episode has a different setting. Most levels look very Gothic or medieval, but others look more futuristic, like science fiction. There are 6 or 7 levels in each episode, but every episode also has one secret level. There is also one level that is not inside of an episode, which is the final boss level. There are four episodes in the game, and they can be finished in any order the player wants. The player can't get to the final boss without beating all four episodes, though.\nThe game has four difficulty settings: easy, medium, hard, and nightmare. Nightmare difficulty can only be found in a secret area which is on the episode selection level. This secret area can be found in the episode 4 selection room.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":54},{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"first-person shooter","offset":80},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":101},{"uri":"Id_Software","surface_form":"id Software","offset":133},{"uri":"July_22","surface_form":"July 22","offset":148},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":157},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":217},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demons","offset":265},{"uri":"Zombie","surface_form":"zombies","offset":276},{"uri":"Doom","surface_form":"Doom","offset":383},{"uri":"Doom_2","surface_form":"Doom 2","offset":394},{"uri":"Game_engine","surface_form":"game engine","offset":464},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":605},{"uri":"Multiplayer_video_game","surface_form":"multiplayer","offset":648},{"uri":"Multiplayer_online_game","surface_form":"multiplayer through the internet","offset":778},{"uri":"DWANGO","surface_form":"DWANGO","offset":872},{"uri":"QuakeWorld","surface_form":"QuakeWorld","offset":954},{"uri":"Gamespy","surface_form":"QuakeSpy","offset":969},{"uri":"Trent_Reznor","surface_form":"Trent Reznor","offset":1112},{"uri":"Nine_Inch_Nails","surface_form":"Nine Inch Nails","offset":1129},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammo","offset":1615},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic","offset":1952},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":1962},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":2010},{"uri":"Boss_(video_gaming)","surface_form":"boss","offset":2190}]}
