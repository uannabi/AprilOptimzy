{"id":234479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_isolation","text":"Base isolation is a collection of a building\u2019s units resting on its foundation to provide separation of the building from shaking ground thus improving seismic performance.\nBasic parts of base isolation system.\n1. \"Isolation units\" are the basic elements of \"base isolation system\" which provide the mentioned separation effect to a building structure.\n2. \"Isolation components\" are the connections between \"isolation units\" and other parts of the building having no separation effect of their own.\nHistory.\nFrom the very beginning, the theory of base isolation rested on two pillars: \"heavy damping\" and \"frequency separation\". Unfortunately, nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a \"substructure\" and \"superstructure\", and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good. Anyway, to virtually test-drive any design concept of base isolation, some online help is available now.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Foundation_(engineering)","surface_form":"foundation","offset":68},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"shaking ground","offset":122},{"uri":"Seismic_performance","surface_form":"seismic performance","offset":152}]}
