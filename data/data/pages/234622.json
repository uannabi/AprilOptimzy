{"id":234622,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ank%C5%8D","text":"was the 20th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Ank\u014D to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Ank\u014D\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nThe \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" record that Ank\u014D was the second son of Emperor Ingy\u014D.\nSome accounts report that Ank\u014D murdered his own father.\nEvents of Ank\u014D's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Ank\u014D's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nIt is believed that Ank\u014D was murdered in the third year of his reign.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ank\u014D.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":146},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":155},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":170},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":206},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":222},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":244},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":260},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":281},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":316},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":327},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":407},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":453},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":485},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":500},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":542},{"uri":"Nihon_Shoki","surface_form":"Nihon Shoki","offset":555},{"uri":"Emperor_Ingy%C5%8D","surface_form":"Emperor Ingy\u014D","offset":607},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":653},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":793},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":853},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1006},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1027},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1083},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1118},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1188},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1196},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1206},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1231},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1246},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1255},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1262}]}
