{"id":23470,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mathematical analysis is a part of mathematics. It is often shortened to analysis. It looks at functions, sequences and series. These have useful properties and characteristics that can be used in engineering. Mathematical analysis provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, which studies continuous functions, differentiation and integration. Mathematical analysis is a short version of its old name \"infinitesimal analysis\", with some of its key subfields including real analysis, complex analysis, differentiation equation and functional analysis.\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Isaac Newton developed most of the basis of mathematical analysis.\nLimits.\nA foundational concept in mathematical analysis is the concept of limit. Limits are used to see what happens very close to things. Limits can also be used to see what happens when things get very big. For example, formula_1 is never zero, but as \"n\" gets bigger, formula_1 gets closer and closer to zero. The limit of formula_1 as \"n\" gets bigger is zero. This is described by \"The limit of formula_1 as \"n\" goes to infinity is zero\", and written as formula_1.\nThe counterpart would be formula_1. When the formula_1 gets bigger, the limit goes to infinity. It is written as formula_1.\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra can be proven from some basic results in complex analysis. It says that every polynomial formula_1 with real or complex coefficients has a complex root (where a root is a number \"x\" satisfying the equation formula_1, and some of these roots may be the same).\nDifferential calculus.\nformula_1.\nA function of the form formula_1, which is not linear, cannot be calculated like above. It is only possible to calculate the slope by using tangents and secants. The secant passes through two points and when the two points get closer, it turns into a tangent.\nThe new formula is formula_1.\nformula_1.\nThe result is called derivative or slope of f at the point formula_1.\nIntegration.\nThe integration is about the calculation of areas.\nThe symbol formula_1\nis read as \"the integral of \"f\" with respect to \"x\" from \"a\" to \"b\", and refers to the area between the x-axis, the graph of function \"f\", and the lines \"x\"=\"a\" and \"x\"=\"b\". The formula_1 is the point where the area should start, and the formula_1 where the area should ends.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":48},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":108},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":119},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":133},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":210},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":287},{"uri":"Continuous_function","surface_form":"continuous function","offset":311},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"differentiation","offset":333},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integration","offset":353},{"uri":"Real_analysis","surface_form":"real analysis","offset":490},{"uri":"Complex_analysis","surface_form":"complex analysis","offset":505},{"uri":"Differentiation_equation","surface_form":"differentiation equation","offset":523},{"uri":"Functional_analysis","surface_form":"functional analysis.","offset":552},{"uri":"Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","surface_form":"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz","offset":573},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":603},{"uri":"Limit_(mathematics)","surface_form":"limit","offset":744},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":1094},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":1225},{"uri":"Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","surface_form":"fundamental theorem of algebra","offset":1267},{"uri":"Complex_analysis","surface_form":"complex analysis","offset":1339},{"uri":"Real","surface_form":"real","offset":1402},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex","offset":1410},{"uri":"Tangent","surface_form":"tangent","offset":1731},{"uri":"Secant_line","surface_form":"secants","offset":1744},{"uri":"Formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":1859},{"uri":"Derivative","surface_form":"derivative","offset":1913},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":2019}]}
