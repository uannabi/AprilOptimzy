The oil is used in cooking, as well as cosmetics, traditional medicine, and as a fuel for oil lamps.\nOlive oil quality is defined by some parameters that are measured by chemical analysis. One of the most important is acidity. The highest quality olive oil (Extra-Virgin) must feature an acidity lower than 0.8%.\nPeople see it as a healthy addition to their diet because of the high level of unsaturated fats (mainly oleic acid) and polyphenols.
