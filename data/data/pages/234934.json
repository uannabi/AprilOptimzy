{"id":234934,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_performance","text":"e=\"preserve\">Seismic performance is an execution of a building structure's ability to sustain its due functions, such as safety and serviceability, \"at\" and \"after\" a particular earthquake. A structure is, normally, considered \"safe\" if it does not endanger the lives and wellbeing of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered \"serviceable\" if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.\nAncient builders believed that earthquakes were a result of wrath of gods (in Greek mythology, e.g., the main \"Earth-Shaker\" was Poseidon) and, therefore, could not be resisted by humans.\nNowadays, the people's attitude has changed dramatically though seismic loads, sometimes, exceed ability of a structure to resist them without being broken, partially or completely.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building structure","offset":54},{"uri":"Safety","surface_form":"safety","offset":121},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":178},{"uri":"Seismic_design","surface_form":"designed","offset":458},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":499},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":537},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":546},{"uri":"Poseidon","surface_form":"Poseidon","offset":597}]}
