{"id":234962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority","text":"e=\"preserve\">A silent majority is a large group of people who support something, but choose not to express their opinions publicly.\nThis term was made popular by US President Richard Nixon in a speech he gave on November 3 1969, about the Vietnam War. Nixon said \"And so tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans; I ask for your support.\" The opposite of the silent majority were a noisy minority, a small group of people, who Nixon said tried to get their way by holding demonstrations in the streets.\nThe speech on this link does not contain these words. Read it for yourself. It only references the term \u201CSilent Majority\u201D which had been described during his campaign in other speeches.\nI might add that we are a Republic, and a \u201CSilent Majority\u201D is probably the most dangerous threat to the Constitution that we face.\nNazi Germany.\nDuring WWII many German citizens claimed they had no idea of what was happening with the concentration camps. However many citizens felt opposed but did not stand up and fight them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"US_President","surface_form":"US President","offset":162},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":175},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":239}]}
