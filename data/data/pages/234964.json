Kennedy won the election like many people expected, but it was a much closer election than most people thought it would be.\nIncumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower was not allowed to run again due to serving two terms.\nThis was the first presidential election in American history in which both candidates debated against each other on television. On television, Kennedy appeared calm while Nixon appeared nervous. More television viewers thought that Kennedy won the debate, while more radio listeners thought that Nixon won the debate.\nThis election was the last to not count District of Columbia as an electoral vote until the 1964 election.\nSenator John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for president on January 2, 1960. Vice President Richard Nixon announced his candidacy on January 9, 1960.\nThis was the last election where Ohio voted for the losing candidate until 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
