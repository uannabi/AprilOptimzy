{"id":234999,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ingy%C5%8D","text":"was the 19th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Ingy\u014D to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Ingy\u014D\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nThe \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" record that Ingy\u014D was the fourth son of Emperor Nintoku. He was the younger brother of Emperor Hanzei.\nIngy\u014D made one of his brothers his heir, but this plan did not unfold as planned. Instead, his brother's sons would attain the throne. Ingy\u014D would be followed by his nephews, Emperor Ank\u014D and Emperor Y\u016Bryaku.\nEvents of Ingy\u014D's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Ingy\u014D's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nThe earliest recorded earthquake in Japan was in 416. The Imperial Palace in Kyoto was destroyed.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ingy\u014D.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Ingy\u014D is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") in Fujiidera, which is a city near Osaka.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":147},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":156},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":171},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":208},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":224},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":246},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":262},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":283},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":318},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":329},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":409},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":455},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":487},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":502},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":544},{"uri":"Nihon_Shoki","surface_form":"Nihon Shoki","offset":557},{"uri":"Emperor_Nintoku","surface_form":"Emperor Nintoku","offset":610},{"uri":"Emperor_Hanzei","surface_form":"Emperor Hanzei","offset":657},{"uri":"Emperor_Ank%C5%8D","surface_form":"Emperor Ank\u014D","offset":848},{"uri":"Emperor_Y%C5%ABryaku","surface_form":"Emperor Y\u016Bryaku","offset":865},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":999},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1059},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1240},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1261},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1317},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1353},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1423},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1431},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1441},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1459},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1474},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1483},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1490},{"uri":"Fujiidera","surface_form":"Fujiidera","offset":1513}]}
