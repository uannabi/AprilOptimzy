{"id":235006,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Alien and Sedition Acts were acts of Congress signed by United States president John Adams in 1798, during a naval (sea) conflict against France.\nThe first three acts were about immigration. They set required time for an immigrant to become a citizen, and allowed the president to send illegal immigrant<nowiki/>s back to their home country if their home country is at war with the United States or they are considered to be dangerous to the United States. The fourth act made it a crime to publish bad things about the government.\nThe acts were very controversial. Many people did not like them because they felt that they violated the First Amendment.\nThe acts made many people dislike John Adams. For that reason, Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republican Party were able to defeat John Adams and the Federalist Party in the elections of 1800. Three of the acts were repealed. The Alien Enemies Act, however, is still United States law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Act_of_Congress","surface_form":"acts of Congress","offset":46},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":73},{"uri":"John_Adams","surface_form":"John Adams","offset":97},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":155},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":195},{"uri":"Illegal_immigrant","surface_form":"illegal immigrant","offset":303},{"uri":"First_Amendment","surface_form":"First Amendment","offset":654},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":734},{"uri":"Democratic-Republican_Party","surface_form":"Democratic-Republican Party","offset":759},{"uri":"Federalist_Party","surface_form":"Federalist Party","offset":826}]}
