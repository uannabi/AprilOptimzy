William Miller of New York.\nDuring 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon Johnson (his vice president) became president of the United States.\nLyndon Johnson campaigned to continue many of Kennedy's policies and ideas such as civil rights. He supported a series of programs called the \"Great Society\" to improve the quality of living for poor people which included programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and environmental programs.\nBarry Goldwater had the opposite belief that the government should be smaller and he was against government programs. During his campaign, actor Ronald Reagan made a famous speech called \"Time For A Choosing\" in support of Goldwater. Goldwater during the campaign was portrayed as an extremist who condoned the actions of the KKK and would cause nuclear war. His beliefs were radical at the time, but they would later influence many libertarian and conservative politicians.\nLyndon Johnson won the election by a landslide, and this was the last presidential election where Democrats carried any of 8 particular states \"(see the section\" Historical Events In This Election Cycle! \"below for more information).\"\nVermont.\nThis was the first election EVER where the Green Mountain State backed the Democratic candidate, as well as the first election (since the Republican Party was established) where Vermont did not support the Republican candidate.\nGeorgia.\nThis was the first election EVER where Georgia backed the Republican presidential candidate.\nMaine.\nExcept for 1912, this is the first election where Maine did not support the Republican Party (since its creation, of course).\nIdaho.\nThis is the last presidential election where Idaho voted for the Democratic candidate.\nNebraska.\nThis is the last presidential election where Nebraska as a whole voted for the Democratic candidate.\nKansas.\nThis is the last preidential election where Kansas voted for the Democratic candidate.\nOklahoma.\nThis is the last presidential election where Oklahoma voted for the Democratic candidate.\nNorth Dakota.\nThis is the last presidential election where North Dakota voted for the Democratic candidate.\nWyoming.\nThis is the last presidential election where Wyoming voted for the Democratic candidate.\nUtah.\nThis is the last presidential election where the Beehive State voted for the Democratic candidate.\nSouth Dakota.\nThis is the last presidential election where South Dakota voted for the Democratic candidate.\nIndiana.\nExcept for 2008, this would be the last presidential election where Indiana voted for the Democratic candidate.\nNorth Carolina.\nExcept for 1976 and 2008, this would be the last presidential election where North Carolina voted for the Democratic candidate.\nColorado.\nBefore 2008, this would be the last presidential election where Colorado voted for the Democratic candidate.\nVirginia.\nBefore 2008, this would be the last presidential election where Virginia voted for the Democratic candidate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":47},{"uri":"Lyndon_Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon Johnson","offset":56},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":163},{"uri":"Barry_Goldwater","surface_form":"Barry Goldwater","offset":174},{"uri":"Senator","surface_form":"Senator","offset":191},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":204},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
