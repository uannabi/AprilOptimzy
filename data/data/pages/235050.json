During the election, the economy was the greatest it had been in many years. Ronald Reagan called it \"Morning In America\".\nRonald Reagan won the election by a huge landslide (winning 49 out of 50 states).\nThis election received the highest electoral votes towards any presidential nominee in American history. It is the lowest electoral vote for a Democratic nominee and the highest for a Republican to date.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":36},{"uri":"Walter_Mondale","surface_form":"Walter Mondale","offset":45},{"uri":"Vice_president","surface_form":"vice president","offset":65},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":83},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":101},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":112},{"uri":"Strategic_Defense_Initiative","surface_form":"Strategic Defense Initiative","offset":223},{"uri":"Landslide_victory","surface_form":"landslide","offset":595},{"uri":"Electoral_college","surface_form":"electoral votes","offset":671},{"uri":"History_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"American history","offset":723},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":779}]}
