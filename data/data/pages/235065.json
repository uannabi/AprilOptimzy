{"id":235065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter","text":"A lighter is a tool that can produce a flame, on demand. It is made of a plastic or metal container, which contains a flammable liquid or gas. There is also a means of producing the flame, and extinguishing it, when it is no longer needed.\nOne of the first lighters was developed by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang D\u00F6bereiner in 1823. The lighter was produced until around 1880. The lighter was named D\u00F6bereiner's lamp.\nThere is often an electric cigarette lighter in cars. When the lighter button is pushed in, a metal heating element is connected to the car's 12 volt electricity supply, and it heats up to a high temperature. The lighter is then removed from the socket and the element is used to light the tip of a cigarette. The socket that the lighter goes in can also be used to power mobile phones and other electronics, and the term \"cigarette lighter\" is now commonly used to refer to this type of connector even when not being used to light a cigarette.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":15},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":287},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":294},{"uri":"Johann_Wolfgang_D%C3%B6bereiner","surface_form":"Johann Wolfgang D\u00F6bereiner","offset":302},{"uri":"D%C3%B6bereiner%27s_lamp","surface_form":"D\u00F6bereiner's lamp","offset":404},{"uri":"Heating_element","surface_form":"heating element","offset":523},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":573},{"uri":"Cigarette","surface_form":"cigarette","offset":722},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":795}]}
