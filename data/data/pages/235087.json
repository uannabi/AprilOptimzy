The song was written by Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III. A former Selena y Los Dinos member, Pete Astudillo, co-wrote the song. It was on her third album, \"Entre A Mi Mundo\" (1992). The song talks about a sad woman who is hurting because she has lost her boyfriend and she is explaining how it hurts to lose his love but she is saying that his love was like a flower that has dried up and died. As he says goodbye he takes her heart with him she hopes someday some other woman or his new woman will give him what he is looking for.\nThe song was released in the United States and Mexico in October 1992.
