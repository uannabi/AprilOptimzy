{"id":235102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware_removal_software","text":"=\"preserve\">As spyware has turned into a worse threat, a number of ways to get rid of spyware have been used to remove it. These include programs designed to remove or to block spyware, as well as various user practices which reduce the chance of getting spyware on a system.\nNonetheless, spyware remains a costly problem. When a large number of pieces of spyware have infected a Windows computer, the only way to get rid of them may involve backing up user data, and fully reinstalling the operating system. For instance, some versions of Vundo cannot be completely removed by Microsoft, PC Tools, Symantec and others because it infects Internet Explorer, and Windows' lsass.exe (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) with a randomly-filenamed dynamic link library (or dll). These can be very helpful.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spyware","surface_form":"spyware","offset":15},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":578},{"uri":"PC_Tools","surface_form":"PC Tools","offset":589},{"uri":"Symantec","surface_form":"Symantec","offset":599},{"uri":"Internet_Explorer","surface_form":"Internet Explorer","offset":638}]}
