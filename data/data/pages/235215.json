He is considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian Independence Movement.\nEarly life.\nHe was born to Vidyavati kaur and Sardar Kisan Singh Sandhu, in a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 in Lyallpur, Punjab in British India. His family had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.\nHis uncle Swaran Singh had participated in the freedom struggle against the British. When in 1907, an another uncle of Bhagat, Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.\nAfter coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them. The movement called 'Pagdi Sambhal Jatta' was launched in 1908.\nThe British came to know of his intentions and arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative's house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad India. Ajit Singh bid farewell to his family and fled to Iran in March.\nIn 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur and recieved his elementary education there till class IV. In 1916 his family shifted to Lahore so he had to leave the Primary School. In Lahore, he was admitted to the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V) School, and he received rest of his primary education from there. When he was in 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place. The very next day (on 14th April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was going to school. After running about 12 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. On 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh's compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn't been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on infront of the Sikh gurus potrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.\nIn 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India and to end their cooperation with the British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops & hospitals run by government were all boycotted. Many students also left British schools and joined Indian schools.\nBhagat Singh also actively participated in the movement. He along with a group of people used to burn foreign clothes publicly and used to boycott foreign schools, he was only 13 years old.\nBesides this, a month later he joined a Dramatics Society near the college campus and began to organize functions and shows.\nIn late October, he had organized a show for the governor of Punjab. When the governor Edward Douglas Maclagan arrived the theatre. The Indian people present there did not do anything in respect of the governor. They treated him very casually. He became so angry with the irrespective treating that he walked out of the theatre, but Bhagat Singh didn't mind and performed the show infront of the citizens of his motherland.\nWhile studying in National College, he used to spend most of his time in the College Library reading books about armed revolution in foreign countries.\nHe was inspired by the Russian revolutionaries who believed that armed revolt can only bring freedom. His first act which brought to notice was that occured in March 1924. It is said that one of his friend's bullock cart driver was beaten harshly by some English officials as the sign the outside the office of the officials read - 'Indians are not allowed'. He took revenge and along with Sukhdev he attacked the officials car and beated them with clubs and sticks and escaped unnoticed in the night.\nBhagat Singh worked for Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi in the newspaper Pratap Press in Kanpur for some months. Then he met Chandra Shekhar Azad and they began to work together for freedom struggle.\nIn March 1925, he accepted his father's wish returned to Lyallpur but had to soon escape from there as police had came to know of his whereabouts. He went to Delhi and started publishing the Daily Veer Arjun Newspaper for 6 months.\nIn October, he returned to Kanpur to free the Kakori prisoners who had been arrested after the train robbery in Kakori (9 August) along with their leader Ram Prasad Bismil. The prisoners were temporarily kept in Kanpur Station Cell before being shifted to different Central Jails.\nOn 22 November, along with Azad, Bhagat went to to the Station Cell unnoticed and broke the lockups and freed one their comrade but the police soon arrived there and they had to run away. Thus the plan failed.\nIn March 1926, he organized the Naujawan Bharat Sabha to encourage the young men of his country to fight for there freedom. He began to address big public meetings and asked them to overthrow the British rule from India. He also took the help of Dramatics Society for the purpose of spreading his message.\nOn 16 October, when the Dussehra festival fair was held in Titli Bagh in Lahore. At 8:10 pm a bomb exploded in crowded section of Bagh when the Ramleela procession was being taken out. About 10 people died in this explosion and about five times of that were injured. People rushed out of the Bagh to save their lives.\nNext day, the The Tribune was published as follows-\nThe British Government took advantage of the incident and arrested Bhagat on the pretext that he was involved in the bomb incident on 29 May 1927. The real reason for his arrest was to stop him from addressing people to unite against the British rule.\nIt was later found that the bomb explosion was caused by a man named Channa Adin who was bribed by Lahore police for committing such an act to get an opportunity to blame the revolutionaries.\nHe was released on a security of \u20B960,000 (about \u20B9 25,00,000 of today) for having found no evidence against him, about a month later.\nActivities.\nHe became involved in numerous revolutionary activities. He quickly gained prominence in the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and became one of its chief leaders. Eventually, the name of the organization was changed to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) on 9 September 1928.\nA Commission known as Simon Commission was appointed by the British Government to look after the administration of India for further political reforms. The commission which reached India on 3 February 1928 decided to tour the whole India to gain the first hand information of the condition of the administration. But there were no Indians in the commission, this angered many Indian political leaders who lead protests against the commission.\nThe leaders lead marchs and rallies wherever the commission went using the slogan 'Simon Go Back'.\n18 days later, Lalaji succumbed to his wounds. Bhagat Singh who was also in the protest march was the witness to this incident and decided to take revenge.\nTo avenge this, Bhagat made a plan by calling a meeting at Mozang House (an HSRA hideout). On the night, of 10 December the plan to kill the SP Scott was made. Jaigopal was asked to keep a watch on Scott for five days and report the time to fix for execution of plan.\nOn 15 December, the last meeting was held in which Sukhdev presented a map of the Police Headquarters of Lahore where Scott used to work. Bhagat and Rajguru were chosen to execute the plan. Jaigopal was told to signal Bhagat and Rajguru as he sees Scott coming out of the office. The plan was now ready to be executed.\nOn 17 December, Bhagat along with Rajguru & Chandrashekhar Azad went to the area of Police Headquarters. Bhagat and Rajguru hid behind a tree nearby. Jaigopal also came riding on his bicycle and acted as he was repairing it to wait for Scott. On 16:20 as another police officer ASP Saunders came out of the office Jaigopal mistook him for Scott and signaled Bhagat and Rajguru. As soon as Saunders approached the tree near the office Rajguru came out and shot him in the head which wounded him and Bhagat shot thrice in his chest and killed him.\nThe Head Constable Chanan Singh chased Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Azad but was wounded by Azad's covering fire.\nThe traffic inspector Fern who was standing there controlling the traffic saw the them running and started chasing them. Bhagat fired at Fern but he ducked down to prevent the shot and thus the shot missed. The four then escaped through the D.A.V college backdoor to arranged safehouses.\nNext day, Posters appeared all over the walls of Lahore informing the public about the revenge action against the British-\nThe rest of the matter of the poster contained the motives behind the murder of the officer and warning given to the Intelligence Department and Bureaucracy. It was signed by Balraj (a pseudonym of Chandrashekhar Azad).\nWhen the news of Saunder's murder reached the British government in Lahore. The government launched a search operation in the whole of Lahore. The CID was asked to keep a watch on every person departing and arriving in Lahore.\nOn 18 and 19 December many people were arrested on suspicion of the murder. Many people were beated mercilessly and caught and jailed without warrant.\nOn the evening of 19 December Sukhdev requested Durga Bhabhi (wife of Bhagwati Vohra, member of HSRA) to accompny Bhagat to escape from Lahore. Durga Bhabhi agreed willingly.\nTo avoid recognition Bhagat had shaved his beard and cut his long hair (a violation of Sikh customs) and had wore an English outfit. He asked Durga Bhabhi to wear an English outfit too. Rajguru was asked to become the porter at the station.\nAt about 4:00 am Bhagat along with Durga Bhabhi reached the Railway Station and boarded the first train from Lahore to Calcutta. Chandra Shekhar Azad too escaped Lahore along with them.\nIn Calcutta, Bhagat and Chandra Shekhar Azad met Jatindranath Das, a scholar and a scientist in January 1929. Jatin was asked to make Arsenals and other weopans for the HSRA. The HSRA set up a bomb factory in Agra for the purpose. In March, the arsenals were tried and tested in secret near the Yamuna River.\nIn March, the British Government introduced two bills called as Public Safety Bill and Trade Dispute Bill. The first was for the purpose of curbing mass protests that were taking place in many parts of the country and the second was for lowering the pension of the mill workers and farmers by 10%.\nMeanwhile, the Bombay Textile Mill workers announced a strike on 15 February to protest against low wages paid by the owner of the mill. The workers remained on strike for many days. They also barred the entry of the owner in the mill. The owner reported the problem to his friend who was a British Officer. The Officer agreed to help him. On 1 April, the Officer came with a large cavalry forces to disperse the protesting workers to make way for the owner. First the Officer requested the workers to end the strike but they refused to do so. The Officer then ordered his cavalry to Lathi charge on the workers. Many were injured in this Lathi Charge.\nTo put a stop on the strikes of workers, the government decided to pass the bills as soon as possible.\nThe British decided to pass the bills on 8 April.\nBhagat Singh decided to protect the rights of the farmers of his country and decided to halt the passing of bills.\nHe made a plan to bomb the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. He partnered with Batukeshwar Dutt for this task.\nOn 8 April, as the Speaker Vithalbhai Patel stood up to announce the passing of bill, He bombarded the assembly with two bombs making sure that this will not harm any person. They were shouting slogans of revolution and threw pamphlets.\nAfter the bombarding, they surrendered. He was kept in Delhi Central Jail from 16 April to 13 June.\nThe trial for Delhi Assembly Bomb case began on 7 May with an introductory hearing with the Presiding Judge Justice PB Pool. In the next hearing, a month later on 6 June lawyer Asaf Ali defended Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt. Asaf tried his best to defend the revolutionaries but in vain as on 12 June, both were sentenced to transportation for life in Delhi Jail.\nThe next day, the police came to know about his involvement in the murder of ASP Saunders and soon made preparations to transfer him to Lahore Jail.\nThe police then took Bhagat and Batukeshwar Dutt to Lahore through the van.\nThe next day, they reached Lahore Jail. Bhagat and Dutt became happy as many other members of HSRA who were his friends were together jailed there including Sukhdev and Jatindranath Das.\nThe next day, as Bhagat got to know that the English prisoners and thieves were treated with dignity and were given healthy food but there was discrimination with Indian prisoners and revolutionaries and given non-hygenic food as well.\nBhagat began his longest (112 days) hunger strike in jail which lasted from 15 June to 5 October 1929. Together many other revolutionaries began hunger strike that day.\nThe demands that Bhagat placed before the jailor were-\n1. There should be no discrimination between the British and Indian prisoners.\n2. Indian prisoners should be given books and newspapers to read and clean clothes to wear as given to the British.\n3. Healthy food should be provided to the Indian prisoners.\nThe demands were refused many times by the jail authorities and the jailors forced the prisoners to break their hunger strike treacherously.\nThey would often beat the prisoners to drink milk or swallow food to halt the hunger strike but the prisoners were adamant.\nAt last, on 5 October the authorities agreed to their demands and the prisoners halted their strike.\nMeanwhile, Jatin Das who had begun his hunger strike 28 days after Bhagat, died on 13 September 1929 due to weakness. Thousands of people attended his funeral on 15 September and felt proud for the brave revolutionary Jatin Das.\nThe Lahore Conspiracy Case trial began on 10 July 1929, in the Lahore Jail Cantonment Hall with the Presiding Judge Pandit Rai Sahib Sri Kishen. There were in total 17 accused and 2 approvers in the case. Jaigopal later turned approver.\nThe case trials went on with no decision for months. Jaigopal betrayed the HSRA by telling that Bhagat was involved in the murder of Saunders. On 21 October 1929, as Jaigopal spoke the truth a revolutionary Prem Dutt became so angry he insulted him and threw his slipper on his head. Jaigopal fainted and collapsed in the witness box.\nPrem Dutt was handcuffed but the revolutionaries protested so Magistrate Rai Saheb ordered all of them to be handcuffed but they did not budge. The police started beating them and forced to be handcuffed.\nTo Speed up the slow moving trial, Lord Irwin declared Emergency on 1 May 1930. Arrests of the accused were speeded up and the arrested ones were to throught trials of the special tribunal. The tribunal was appointed by the Viceroy on 30 April. Three Judges - Justice Coldstream, Justice GC Hilton and Justice Agha Hyder justified the Case. The trials were now held in the Court of Special Magistrate, Poonch House instead of Lahore Cantonment. In June Justice Hyder and Presiding Judge Justice Coldstream were removed and instead Justice Abdul Qadir and Justice Tapp were appointed.\nOn 7 October 1930, the special tribunal of three judges pronounced their judgement as follows-\nBhagat Singh along with Rajguru and Sukhdev was to be hanged on 24 March 1931 on 6:30 am sharp.\nMany of the politicians appealed to the government to reduce the punishment of the three comrades especially Madan Mohan Malviya, Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Subhash Chandra Bose who had positive views about the revolutionaries.\nEspecially, Mahatma Gandhi asked the Viceroy Lord Irwin to cancel the hanging of three revolutionaries but he refused to do so.\nOn 22 March, the Jailor decided to bring forward the hanging time 11 hours earlier to prevent public protest outside the Jail.\nThe families of the three were not allowed to meet them on 23 March. The father of Bhagat, Kishan Singh with his wife waited outside for a long a time to get a last glimpse of his brave son but even they were denied.\nAt 7:25, the Jailor arrived with other officers to take them to the gallows. At that time, Bhagat was reading the Biography of Russian leader Lenin. He called out to Bhagat to get ready as they were getting late. He replied 'wait a minute, one revolutionary is meeting the other'. He threw the book towards the ceiling and stepped out of the cell.\nThen while going towards the gallows the three comrades Bhagat, Sukhdev and Rajguru sang the patriotic song 'Mera Rang De Basanti Chola'.\nAt 7:28, the three arrived at the hanging fort where several officers were waiting for them. Bhagat said to one of the officers 'Sir, today you will see how bravely the great sons of India embrace death'.\nSo at 7:30 pm, the three were hanged till death by the Lahore Central Jail authorities.\nAfter hanging, their bodies were carried away secretly to Ferozepore through the backdoor of the Jail.\nLate at night, the authorities reached the Satluj river banks in Ferozepore where they burnt the bodies of the three revolutionaries.\nSoon a big crowd armed with fire torches arrived the river banks. The authorities were frightened and they fled from the scene. The people in the crowd then informed Bhagat's father Kishan Singh about the incident who along with Vidyawati came rushing to Ferozepore. Kishan Singh wept with grief along with pride at the same time for his brave son. The next day, the crowd and Kishan Singh cremated the body of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.\nThus the brave Indian revolutionary laid down his life for liberating his motherland.\nIn the memory of the martyrdom of the three brave sons of India the day '23 March' is celebrated every year as Martyr's Day.\nMany memorials, roads, dams and canals have been named after many great martyrs of our country including Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":39},{"uri":"Indian_independence_movement","surface_form":"Indian Independence Movement","offset":151},{"uri":"Sikh_Jat","surface_form":"Sikh Jat","offset":259},{"uri":"Lyallpur","surface_form":"Lyallpur","offset":299},{"uri":"Punjab_Province_(British_India)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":309},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":411},{"uri":"Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre","surface_form":"Jallianwala Bagh massacre","offset":1725},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":1900},{"uri":"Amritsar","surface_form":"Amritsar","offset":1923},{"uri":"Mahatma_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mahatma Gandhi","offset":2547},{"uri":"Non-cooperation_movement","surface_form":"Non-cooperation movement","offset":2575},{"uri":"Punjab","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":3389},{"uri":"Edward_Douglas_Maclagan","surface_form":"Edward Douglas Maclagan","offset":3415},{"uri":"Ganesh_Shankar_Vidyarthi","surface_form":"Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi","offset":4430},{"uri":"Chandra_Shekhar_Azad","surface_form":"Chandra Shekhar Azad","offset":4524},{"uri":"Hindustan_Republican_Association","surface_form":"Hindustan Republican Association","offset":6680},{"uri":"Hindustan_Socialist_Republican_Association","surface_form":"Hindustan Socialist Republican Association","offset":6812},{"uri":"Central_Legislative_Assembly","surface_form":"Central Legislative Assembly","offset":11991},{"uri":"Delhi","surface_form":"Delhi","offset":12023},{"uri":"Batukeshwar_Dutt","surface_form":"Batukeshwar Dutt","offset":12048},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":12285},{"uri":"Pamphlet","surface_form":"pamphlet","offset":12306}]}
