{"id":235417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_load","text":"Seismic load is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake-generated agitation to a building structure or its model. It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground, or with adjacent structures, or with gravity waves from tsunami.\nSometimes, seismic load exceeds ability of a structure to resist it without being broken, partially or completely. Due to their mutual interaction, seismic loading and seismic performance of a structure are intimately related.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquake_engineering","surface_form":"earthquake engineering","offset":45},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":98},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building structure","offset":134},{"uri":"Building_model","surface_form":"model","offset":160},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":203},{"uri":"Gravity_wave","surface_form":"gravity wave","offset":274},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":293},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":347},{"uri":"Seismic_performance","surface_form":"seismic performance","offset":470},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":495}]}
