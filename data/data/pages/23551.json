{"id":23551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency","text":"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a spin-off organisation from the United Nations. It was created as an autonomous (self-governing) organization on July 29, 1957. The organization is intended to monitor and promote the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy with protection from harmful radiation and, also, to prevent the use of this energy to build nuclear weapons.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and its former Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, were both awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on 7 October 2005 for their role in trying to prevent the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition of troops.\nThe IAEA has its headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Additional facilities are in Seibersdorf (near Vienna), Monaco, Toronto, and Tokyo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spin-off","surface_form":"spin-off","offset":47},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":78},{"uri":"July_29","surface_form":"July 29","offset":159},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":168},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":230},{"uri":"Nuclear_energy","surface_form":"nuclear energy","offset":255},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":299},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"nuclear weapon","offset":363},{"uri":"Mohamed_ElBaradei","surface_form":"Mohamed ElBaradei","offset":448},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":489},{"uri":"7_October","surface_form":"7 October","offset":510},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":520},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":565},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":577},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":648},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":656},{"uri":"Seibersdorf","surface_form":"Seibersdorf","offset":694},{"uri":"Monaco","surface_form":"Monaco","offset":721},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":729},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":742}]}
