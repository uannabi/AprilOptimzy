{"id":235602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment","text":"Japanese American internment happened during World War II, when the United States government forced about 110,000 Japanese Americans to leave their homes and live in internment camps. These were like prisons. Many of the people who were sent to internment camps had been born in the United States.\nOn December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and declared war on the United States. Many Americans were furious, and some blamed all Japanese people for what had happened at Pearl Harbor. They spread rumors that some Japanese people knew about the attack ahead of time and had helped the Japanese military. The FBI and other parts of the United States government knew that these rumors were not true, but did not say anything.\nJapanese Americans began to feel that other Americans were becoming upset with them. For example, John Hughes, a man who read the news and listened to the radio in Los Angeles, California, spoke about Japanese Americans. There were reports of businesses that had anti-Japanese signs. For example, a barber shop put up a sign saying \"Free shaves for Japs\" and \"not responsible for accidents.\" A funeral home hung a sign saying \"I'd rather do business with a Jap than an American.\"\nInternment begins.\nIn February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. This order said that people who lived in some parts of the country could be taken out of those areas for any reason. While the order did not use the exact words \"Japanese Americans\", people knew that those were the people who would be taken out of those areas. The areas included all of California and the western parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. (See the area marked \"exclusion zone\" on the map on this page.) This was where most Japanese Americans lived at that time.\nTo keep Japanese Americans from leaving these areas on their own, the government stopped many of them from taking money out of their bank accounts. This made it harder for them to move.\nJapanese Americans were given only 48 hours to leave for internment camps in other states. They were only allowed to carry one bag with them, and could not bring radios or cameras.\nWho was interned.\nIn total, the United States forced over 110,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps.\nAbout 80% of the Japanese-American people who lived in the continental United States were forced to leave their homes and live in internment camps. More than three out of every five of these people were born in the United States, and were United States citizens. About half of the people sent to the camps were children.\nMost of the Japanese Americans who were interned lived in the continental United States. About 160,000 Japanese Americans lived in Hawaii, but only a little over 1,000 of them were interned. Because there were so many Japanese American people living in such a small territory, interning them would have been almost impossible.\nInside the camps.\nThere were three government agencies that ran camps. Ninety percent of the Japanese Americans were in camps run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA). Only Japanese Americans lived in the WRA camps.\nWRA camps were surrounded by barbed wire. They were also guarded by soldiers who waited in watchtowers holding guns.\nSome people were shot. For example, James Wakasa, who stepped outside the barbed wire fence, was shot and killed. The guard who shot him said that Wakasa was trying to escape, but the Japanese Americans in the camp did not believe the guard. Most of the camps were many miles away from the coast, and often in rural areas. Many of the camps were in the desert, which was uncomfortable for many of the Japanese Americans who were not used to that type of climate. This also meant that even if somebody escaped, there would be nowhere for them to go.\nIn the camps, people had to stand in line to eat or to go to the bathroom.\nOne famous camp was Manzanar, which was in California. Many Japanese from Los Angeles and San Francisco were sent there. Other camps included Poston in Arizona and Minidoka in Idaho. There were a few camps outside of the western U.S., such as Jerome in Arkansas. Japanese Americans were often crowded into small spaces, such as race tracks, before being sent to the camps.\nA total of 1,862 people died from medical problems while in the internment camps. About one out of every 10 of these people died from tuberculosis.\nThe End of Internment.\nBy 1943, the government allowed some Japanese Americans to leave the camps to work or go to school. However, the government would not let them return to the West Coast. Some Japanese Americans were even allowed to serve as soldiers in the U.S. Army, and many served with honor in Europe.\nIn 1944, the United States government said that it would stop putting Japanese Americans in internment camps. The people who were placed in the camps were given $25 and a bus ticket home. However, it would take more than 40 years for the government to apologize to Japanese Americans for what had happened. In 1988, the government apologized and paid a check $20,000 to people who had been sent to internment camps.(most checks did not reach the recipients due to logistical issues.) Canada paid $21,000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":45},{"uri":"United_States_government","surface_form":"United States government","offset":68},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":114},{"uri":"Internment_camp","surface_form":"internment camps","offset":166},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":200},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":283},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":319},{"uri":"Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","surface_form":"attacked Pearl Harbor","offset":325},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":350},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":370},{"uri":"Rumor","surface_form":"rumors","offset":512},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":609},{"uri":"FBI","surface_form":"FBI","offset":623},{"uri":"United_States_government","surface_form":"United States government","offset":650},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news","offset":869},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":894},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles, California","offset":903},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":982},{"uri":"Barber","surface_form":"barber","offset":1038},{"uri":"Funeral_home","surface_form":"funeral home","offset":1133},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
