{"id":235616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment","text":"Impressment (the Press) was the act of forcing men to serve in the navy. The people who were \"pressed\" to join the navy were usually young men. A naval officer would lead a press gang and force men onto warships where they were made to serve as sailor<nowiki/>s. Their families (if they had families) seldom knew where they had been taken.\nThis was a normal practice in the Royal Navy during the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. Many people said that it should be stopped, but the Navy said it was a good way to get sailors who were needed to defend their country. After the Napoleonic Wars the need for sailors was less and the Navy stopped impressing them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"navy","offset":67},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":152},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warship","offset":203},{"uri":"Sailor","surface_form":"sailor","offset":245},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":374},{"uri":"Napoleonic_Wars","surface_form":"Napoleonic Wars","offset":579}]}
