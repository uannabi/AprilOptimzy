{"id":235623,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve","text":"e=\"preserve\">Na\u00EFve (pronounce: \"na-EEV\") is a French word which is used in English to mean that someone is very simple and does not understand about the dangers around them. Someone who is na\u00EFve does not have enough experience of life to know about things he or she ought to know; for example, they may be very trusting, not realizing that some people in the world are evil and that some situations are perilous.\nThe word is sometimes spelt in English without the French double dot on the letter i, \"naive\", due to the default settings for typing in English lacking it. It is an adjective. The noun is na\u00EFvet\u00E9, but is sometimes spelt na\u00EFvety in English. It is similar in meaning to the word \"innocent\" and is not always a negative quality in that being na\u00EFve implies a lack of acquired prejudice.\nThe word na\u00EFve is used in other special ways in the arts and sciences. It often means \"lack of experience\", but it does not necessarily mean it in a critical way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":46},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":75},{"uri":"Experience","surface_form":"experience","offset":216},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":369},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":579},{"uri":"Innocent","surface_form":"innocent","offset":692},{"uri":"Arts","surface_form":"arts","offset":849},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":858}]}
