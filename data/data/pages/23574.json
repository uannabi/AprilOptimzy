{"id":23574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research","text":"Research is a way of looking for new information, new understanding, and new facts. A person who does research is called a researcher. Some researchers work in academia. Other researchers work for businesses, for organisations, or for the government. Research is often used for solving problems or increasing available knowledge. This can be done by testing theories and making observations. Research usually prefers to be systematic, organised, and objective. Research is used in many different fields of study such as science, mathematics, and the humanities.\nAcademic research.\nResearchers take part in field or laboratory experiments, reading relevant books, journals or websites, taking notes and making conclusions. Teaching and lecturing is only part of the job of a professor or researcher. When they are not directly teaching classes they are often working on academic research. Learning institutions can vary widely in what they expect from members of their faculty. Most expect faculty members to set up their own laboratories. They hire their own lab employees and obtain their own funding, often from more than one source. Academic researchers often compete for grants to fund research at their own university. The more money researchers can attract, the higher the prestige of that university.\nScientific research.\nThe scientific method is the usual way of doing this kind of research. It is meant to improve understanding of biology, engineering, physics, chemistry and many other fields. With this kind of research, scientists can understand the world, and discover useful things.\nMoney for research comes from governments, private corporations, and charities. Some of these organizations combine research and development of new products and ways of doing their work.\nPublishing.\nResearch must be published so the world can learn from it. \"Nature\", \"Science\" and \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\", are general scientific journals. Many special journals are published. Research must pass the peer review process in order to be published.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":37},{"uri":"Understanding","surface_form":"understanding","offset":54},{"uri":"Fact","surface_form":"fact","offset":77},{"uri":"Academia","surface_form":"academia","offset":160},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":197},{"uri":"Organisation","surface_form":"organisation","offset":213},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":239},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":286},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"knowledge","offset":319},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theories","offset":358},{"uri":"Observation","surface_form":"observation","offset":378},{"uri":"Objectivity_(science)","surface_form":"objective","offset":450},{"uri":"Discipline_(study)","surface_form":"fields of study","offset":496},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":520},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":529},{"uri":"Humanities","surface_form":"humanities","offset":550},{"uri":"Researcher","surface_form":"Researcher","offset":581},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":615},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":626},{"uri":"Journal","surface_form":"journal","offset":663},{"uri":"Websites","surface_form":"websites","offset":675},{"uri":"Conclusion","surface_form":"conclusion","offset":709},{"uri":"Teaching","surface_form":"Teaching","offset":722},{"uri":"Lecture","surface_form":"lecturing","offset":735},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":774},{"uri":"Institution","surface_form":"Learning institutions","offset":888},{"uri":"Member","surface_form":"member","offset":951},{"uri":"Faculty_(academic_staff)","surface_form":"faculty","offset":968},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":1063},{"uri":"Funding","surface_form":"funding","offset":1094},{"uri":"Grant_(money)","surface_form":"grant","offset":1175},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":1212},{"uri":"Prestige","surface_form":"prestige","offset":1279},{"uri":"Scientific_method","surface_form":"scientific method","offset":1333},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":1440},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":1449},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":1462},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":1471},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":1532},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1627},{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":1648},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charities","offset":1666},{"uri":"Research_and_development","surface_form":"research and development","offset":1713},{"uri":"Nature_(journal)","surface_form":"Nature","offset":1856},{"uri":"Science_(journal)","surface_form":"Science","offset":1866},{"uri":"Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"Proceedings of the Royal Society","offset":1880},{"uri":"Peer_review","surface_form":"peer review","offset":2008}]}
