{"id":235989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope","text":"Syncope is the medical term for fainting or blacking out. It is a sudden loss of consciousness, usually for a short time. It is mostly because there is not enough oxygen in the brain. It can be for other reasons.\nFainting is quite common. It usually happens in two age ranges: the teenage years, and during older age. The chance of a person fainting at least once in a lifetime is about 40 to 50 percent. Syncope causes 1 to 3 percent of all attendances to emergency departments and 1 to 6 percent of all hospital admissions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medical","offset":15},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":81},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":163},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":177}]}
