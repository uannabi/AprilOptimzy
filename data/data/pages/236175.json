{"id":236175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Petrosian","text":"Tigran Petrosian (Tbilisi, Georgia, 17 June 1929 \u2013 Moscow, 13 August 1984) was World Chess Champion from 1963 to 1969. He was born to Armenian parents, and brought up in the capital of Armenia, Yerevan.p103 Before his chess career, he was a street cleaner.\nPetrosian got the USSR national master title in 1947, and his chess improved rapidly when he moved to Moscow that year. By coming second in the 1951 USSR championship he qualified for the FIDE Interzonal tournament in Stockholm next year. There, he qualified for the World Championship Candidates tournament in Zurich 1953. He came fifth, and was awarded the title of International Grandmaster.p118\nThe World Championship.\nBefore the title match started, FIDE changed the rules so that somebody who lost the world championship in a match would not automatically get a return match. The rule that allowed for return matches had been criticised for giving Botvinnik too great an advantage over his rivals.\nIn the match Petrosian started shakily, losing the first game and just escaping with a draw in the second game. From then on he was in control, and won the match (best of 24 games) by +5 \u20132 =15. In 1966 he defended the title against Boris Spassky, and won 12\u00BD\u201311\u00BD. The victory was rather more emphatic than the score suggests. In 1969 Spassky was again the challenger, and this time Petrosian lost 10\u00BD\u201312\u00BD.\nPetrosian played in every world championship cycle from 1951 to 1980, when he lost a quarter-final match against his old enemy, Viktor Korchnoi.\nOlympiads.\nPetrosian's record in Chess Olympiads was unsurpassed. He played for the USSR in nine Olympiads, and this is a summary of his overall results: +79 \u20131 =50.p156\u20138\nStyle, personality.\nPetrosian was one of those players who set out to stifle the opponent's chances before they take action themselves. He was a student of Nimzovich's ideas of prophylaxis. Capablanca was another such player, but his chess was pure and simple. Petrosian's was profound and complex. He has been much admired by grandmasters, but was not so popular with lesser players. Like Capablanca, he was somewhat lazy, and did not strive to win every game. At his peak, he was the best player in the world at manoeuvring in complex positions, and an outstanding endgame player.p300","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tbilisi","surface_form":"Tbilisi","offset":18},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":27},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":51},{"uri":"List_of_World_Chess_Champions","surface_form":"World Chess Champion","offset":79},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":134},{"uri":"Yerevan","surface_form":"Yerevan","offset":194},{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"USSR","offset":275},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":359},{"uri":"FIDE","surface_form":"FIDE","offset":445},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":475},{"uri":"Zurich","surface_form":"Zurich","offset":568},{"uri":"Grandmaster_(chess)","surface_form":"International Grandmaster","offset":625},{"uri":"Boris_Spassky","surface_form":"Boris Spassky","offset":1194},{"uri":"Viktor_Korchnoi","surface_form":"Viktor Korchnoi","offset":1496},{"uri":"Chess_Olympiad","surface_form":"Chess Olympiad","offset":1546},{"uri":"Nimzovich","surface_form":"Nimzovich","offset":1841},{"uri":"Prophylaxis","surface_form":"prophylaxis","offset":1862},{"uri":"Capablanca","surface_form":"Capablanca","offset":1875},{"uri":"Manoeuvre","surface_form":"manoeuvring","offset":2199}]}
