{"id":236182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman","text":"Milton Friedman (July 31, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 2006) was an American economist. He believed in monetarism. Monetarism is the theory that how much money the government prints each year has a huge effect on the economy. He supports the government printing the same low rate of money each year rather than a different amount each year.\nFriedman was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Hungarian-Jewish family. He was raised in Rahway, New Jersey. Friedman studied at Rutgers University, at Columbia University, and at the University of Chicago. He worked thirty years in Chicago with George Stigler as a leader of the Chicago school of economics.\nDuring the 1970s, Milton Friedman's idea of monetarism gained popularity and he became an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan.\nFriedman believed that the government control over the economy should be limited. He supported cutting taxes, lowering government spending, getting rid of government rules that limited the economy and letting parents choose which school their taxes paid for. His political views were libertarian. He was against forcing people to join the army, and said that getting rid of United States military conscription was the thing he was most proud of doing.\nThroughout several decades, Friedman made many documentaries, books, and interviews to express his views to the public. The main books he wrote were \"Capitalism and Freedom\" and \"Free to Choose\".\nFriedman married Rose Director in 1938. Together, they had a son and a daughter. He was agnostic.\nFriedman died of heart failure in San Francisco, California, aged 94. He was survived by his wife and his two children. His remains were cremated and scattered over the San Francisco Bay area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":59},{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":68},{"uri":"Monetarism","surface_form":"monetarism","offset":94},{"uri":"Brooklyn%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Brooklyn, New York","offset":353},{"uri":"Hungarians","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":377},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":387},{"uri":"Rahway%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Rahway, New Jersey","offset":419},{"uri":"Rutgers_University","surface_form":"Rutgers University","offset":459},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":482},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":514},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":563},{"uri":"George_Stigler","surface_form":"George Stigler","offset":576},{"uri":"Chicago_school_of_economics","surface_form":"Chicago school of economics","offset":610},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":759},{"uri":"Libertarian","surface_form":"libertarian","offset":1058},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"conscription","offset":1171},{"uri":"Agnostic","surface_form":"agnostic","offset":1510},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":1537},{"uri":"San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"San Francisco, California","offset":1554},{"uri":"Cremated","surface_form":"cremated","offset":1657},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Bay_area","surface_form":"San Francisco Bay area","offset":1689}]}
