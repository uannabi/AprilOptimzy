{"id":236293,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_K%C5%8Dsh%C5%8D","text":"was the 5th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor K\u014Dsh\u014D to be a legendary person, and the name K\u014Dsh\u014D\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that K\u014Dsh\u014D ruled from the palace of \"Ikekokoro-no-miya\" at Waki-no-kami in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nK\u014Dsh\u014D is almost certainly a legend. The \"Kojiki\" records only his name and genealogy. The \"Nihonshoki\" includes K\u014Dsh\u014D as the fourth of.\nEmperor K\u014Dsh\u014D was the oldest son of Emperor Itoku. \"Jinn\u014D Sh\u014Dt\u014Dki\" records that his mother was Amanotoyototsu-hime, and his grandmother by his mother's side was Okishimimi-no-kami.\nEvents of K\u014Dsh\u014D's life.\nThe absence of information about K\u014Dsh\u014D does not show that he was not real. Very little information is available for study before the rule of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei (509?-571).\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to K\u014Dsh\u014D.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":12},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":47},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":122},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":171},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":187},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":209},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":225},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":246},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":281},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":292},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":372},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":418},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":450},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":465},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":486},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":609},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":675},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":688},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":722},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":738},{"uri":"Emperor_Itoku","surface_form":"Emperor Itoku","offset":819},{"uri":"Grandmother","surface_form":"grandmother","offset":907},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1090},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1147},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1241},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1262},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1318},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1348},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1360},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1397},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1440},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1455},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1464},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1471},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1494}]}
