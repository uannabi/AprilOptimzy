Historians consider Emperor K\u014Dan to be a legendary person; and the name K\u014Dan\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" ruled from the palace of \"Akitsushima-no-miya\" at Muro in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nK\u014Dan is almost certainly a legend. The \"Kojiki\" records only his name and genealogy.
