{"id":236303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_K%C5%8Drei","text":"was the 7th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor K\u014Drei to be a legendary person; and the name K\u014Drei\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that K\u014Drei ruled from the palace of \"Ihoto-no-miya\" at Kuroda in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nK\u014Drei is almost certainly a legend. The \"Kojiki\" records only his name and genealogy. The \"Nihonshoki\" includes K\u014Drei as the sixth of.\nK\u014Drei was the eldest son of Emperor K\u014Dan. \"Jinn\u014D Sh\u014Dt\u014Dki\" records that his mother was Oshihime, who was the daughter of Ametarashihiko-Kunio-shihito-no-mikoto.\nSome scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors. These critics consider K\u014Drei's great-grandson (Emperor Sujin) to be the earliest to have actually existed.\nEvents of K\u014Drei's life.\nThe absence of information about K\u014Drei does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nThe \"Kojiki\" notes that it was during K\u014Drei's reign that Kibi Province was conquered.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to K\u014Drei.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":12},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":47},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":122},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":171},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":187},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":209},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":225},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":246},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":281},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":292},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":372},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":418},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":450},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":465},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":486},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":599},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":665},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":678},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":712},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":728},{"uri":"Emperor_K%C5%8Dan","surface_form":"Emperor K\u014Dan","offset":800},{"uri":"Consider","surface_form":"consider","offset":1011},{"uri":"Emperor_Sujin","surface_form":"Emperor Sujin","offset":1044},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1243},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1303},{"uri":"Kibi_Province","surface_form":"Kibi Province","offset":1376},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1472},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1493},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1549},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1579},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1591},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1628},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1671},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1686},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1695},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1702},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1725}]}
