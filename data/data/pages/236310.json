{"id":236310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_K%C5%8Dgen","text":"was the 8th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor K\u014Dgen to be a legendary person; and the name K\u014Dgen\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that K\u014Dgen ruled from the palace of \"Sakaihara-no-miya\" at Karu in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nK\u014Dgen is almost certainly a legend. The \"Kojiki\" records only his name and genealogy. The \"Nihonshoki\" includes K\u014Dgen as the seventh of.\nK\u014Dgen was the eldest son of Emperor K\u014Drei.\nSome scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors. These critics consider K\u014Dgen's grandson (Emperor Sujin) to be the earliest to have actually existed.\nEvents of K\u014Dgen's life.\nThe absence of information about K\u014Dgen does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nThe Abe clan are said to have descended from a son of Emperor K\u014Dgen.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to K\u014Dgen.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":12},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":47},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":122},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":171},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":187},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":209},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":225},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":246},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":281},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":292},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":372},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":418},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":450},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":465},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":486},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":601},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":667},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":680},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":714},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":730},{"uri":"Emperor_K%C5%8Drei","surface_form":"Emperor K\u014Drei","offset":804},{"uri":"Consider","surface_form":"consider","offset":898},{"uri":"Emperor_Sujin","surface_form":"Emperor Sujin","offset":925},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1124},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1184},{"uri":"Abe_clan","surface_form":"Abe clan","offset":1204},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1336},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1357},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1413},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1443},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1455},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1492},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1535},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1550},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1559},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1566},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1589}]}
