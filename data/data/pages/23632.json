{"id":23632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinshasa","text":"Kinshasa is the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (once called Zaire). It is the third largest city in the continent of Africa (after Lagos and Cairo). About eleven million people live there. Kinshasa is also a province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nKinshasa is on one side of the Congo river, and Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of Congo, is on the other side. Kinshasa and Brazzaville are the nearest country capitals in the world.\nHenry Morton Stanley founded (started) the town in 1881 and called it L\u00E9opoldville (after King L\u00E9opold II of Belgium, who controlled the Congo Free State now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), next to a village called Nshasa or Kinshasa. The city was originally private property (not public). The post developed successfully as the first navigable port on the Congo River above Livingstone Falls, a series of rapids over 300 kilometres (190\u00A0mi) below Leopoldville. At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between L\u00E9opoldville and Matadi. Later a railway went around the falls.\nL\u00E9opoldville changed its name to Kinshasa in 1966.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":16},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":24},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":36},{"uri":"Zaire","surface_form":"Zaire","offset":82},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":126},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":139},{"uri":"Lagos","surface_form":"Lagos","offset":153},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":163},{"uri":"Congo_river","surface_form":"Congo river","offset":311},{"uri":"Brazzaville","surface_form":"Brazzaville","offset":328},{"uri":"Henry_Morton_Stanley","surface_form":"Henry Morton Stanley","offset":473},{"uri":"1881","surface_form":"1881","offset":524},{"uri":"L%C3%A9opold_II_of_Belgium","surface_form":"L\u00E9opold II of Belgium","offset":568},{"uri":"Congo_Free_State","surface_form":"Congo Free State","offset":610},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":635},{"uri":"Livingstone_Falls","surface_form":"Livingstone Falls","offset":855},{"uri":"Leopoldville","surface_form":"Leopoldville","offset":928},{"uri":"Matadi","surface_form":"Matadi","offset":1053},{"uri":"1966","surface_form":"1966","offset":1145}]}
