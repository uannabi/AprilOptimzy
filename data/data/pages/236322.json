Historians consider Emperor Kaika to be a legendary person; and the name Kaika\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to the emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that Kaika ruled from the palace of \"Isakawa-no-miya\" at Kasuga in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nKaika is almost certainly a legend. The \"Kojiki\" records only his name and genealogy. The \"Nihonshoki\" includes Kaika as the eighth of.\nKaika was the second son of Emperor K\u014Dgen.\nSome scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors. These critics consider K\u014Dgen's son (Suijin) to be the earliest to have actually existed.\nEvents of Kaika's life.\nThe absence of information about Kaika does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kaika.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") in Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":11},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":22},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":46},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":121},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":170},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":186},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":208},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":224},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":245},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":279},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":290},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":370},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":416},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":448},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":463},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":484},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":599},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":665},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":678},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":712},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":728},{"uri":"Emperor_K%C5%8Dgen","surface_form":"Emperor K\u014Dgen","offset":801},{"uri":"Consider","surface_form":"consider","offset":895},{"uri":"Emperor_Sujin","surface_form":"Suijin","offset":917},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1109},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1169},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1252},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1273},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1329},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1359},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1371},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1408},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1451},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1466},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1475},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1482},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1505}]}
