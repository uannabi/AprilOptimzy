{"id":236325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Sujin","text":"was the 10th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor Sujin to be a legendary person; and the name Sujin\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that Sujin ruled from the palace of \"Mizogaki-no-miya\" at Shiki in what will come to be known Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nSujin is almost certainly a legend; but the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" record his name and genealogy. He was the second son of Emperor Kaika.\nSome scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors. These critics consider Sujin to be the earliest to have actually existed.\nEvents of Suijin's life.\nThe limited information about Sujin does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nSujin was interested in agriculture and irrigation. He established a system of taxation.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Sujin.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":123},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":172},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":188},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":210},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":226},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":247},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":282},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":293},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":373},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":419},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":451},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":466},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":487},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":599},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":665},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":682},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":695},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":727},{"uri":"Emperor_Kaika","surface_form":"Emperor Kaika","offset":763},{"uri":"Consider","surface_form":"consider","offset":857},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1054},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1114},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1286},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1307},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1363},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1393},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1405},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1442},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1485},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1500},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1509},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1516},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1539}]}
