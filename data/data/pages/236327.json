{"id":236327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_bread","text":"Soda bread is a kind of soft, golden bread made with baking soda. In its most basic form it contains only four ingredients; flour, salt, baking soda, and buttermilk. It can be changed when you add other ingredients. For instance, if you add a little sugar, some raisins, then cut in some butter, it may become a \"Raisin\" soda bread.\nSoda bread.\nSoda bread does not use yeast to get its rise, instead the rise comes from baking soda reacting with the acid (soured milk or buttermilk). This makes it a 'quick' bread that can be made in under 15 minutes. The important thing to remember is to have mix and knead the dough quickly and lightly. This will give you a bread that is dense, but not doughy, with a tender, slightly moist interior. Once the dough is formed into a round, a cross is cut on the top of the bread, which divides it into quarters called farls.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baking_powder","surface_form":"baking soda","offset":53},{"uri":"Ingredient","surface_form":"ingredient","offset":111},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":124},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":131},{"uri":"Buttermilk","surface_form":"buttermilk","offset":154},{"uri":"React","surface_form":"reacting","offset":432},{"uri":"Knead","surface_form":"knead","offset":603},{"uri":"Dense","surface_form":"dense","offset":675},{"uri":"Dough","surface_form":"dough","offset":690},{"uri":"Moist","surface_form":"moist","offset":722},{"uri":"Interior","surface_form":"interior","offset":728}]}
