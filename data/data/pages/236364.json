Depending on the level of potassium in the blood, this can be a medical emergency. A level that is too high can lead to abnormal hearth rhythms.\nMany medications can cause hyperkalemia, and it is much more likely to occur in people kidney problems.\nAlthough hyperkalemia often doesn't cause symptoms, doctors worry about hyperkalemia because it can cause a sudden change of heart rhythm in people who had not been having any symptoms. These abnormal heart rhythms can be deadly.\nIn the cases where death penalty is carried out using lethal injection, a hyperkalemia may be provoked atificially. Some of the mixtures used in the injections contain potassium chloride which will raise the level of potassium in the blood considerably.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":73},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":90},{"uri":"Medical_emergency","surface_form":"medical emergency","offset":173},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":341},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":607},{"uri":"Lethal_injection","surface_form":"lethal injection","offset":642},{"uri":"Potassium_chloride","surface_form":"potassium chloride","offset":756}]}
