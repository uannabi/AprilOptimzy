{"id":236385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Suinin","text":"was the 11th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor Suinin to be a legendary person; and the name Suinin\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that Suinin he ruled from the palace of \"Tamaki-no-miya\" at Makimuku in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nSuinin is almost certainly a legend; but the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" record his name and genealogy. He was the third son of Emperor Sujin.\nEvents of Suinin's life.\nThe limited information about Suinin does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nOne of Suinin's daughters was Yamatohime-no-mikoto. She established a site for ceremonies honouring the Shinto sun goddess (Amaterasu Omikami). In the region of Ise, she founded the Ise Shrine. She became the first Sai\u014D at Ise.\nThe records of Asama Shrine at the base of Mount Fuji describe events in this time frame. The earliest Shinto ceremonies in honour of Konohanasakuya-hime were in the 3rd year of the reign of Emperor Suinin (\u5782\u4EC1\u5929\u76873\u5E74).\n\"Nihonshoki\" describes a wrestling match during his era. This was the origin of Sumo wrestling.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Suinin.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":124},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":174},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":190},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":212},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":228},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":249},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":284},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":295},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":375},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":421},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":453},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":468},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":489},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":609},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":676},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":693},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":706},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":738},{"uri":"Emperor_Sujin","surface_form":"Emperor Sujin","offset":773},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":926},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":986},{"uri":"Yamatohime-no-mikoto","surface_form":"Yamatohime-no-mikoto","offset":1032},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1106},{"uri":"Amaterasu_Omikami","surface_form":"Amaterasu Omikami","offset":1126},{"uri":"Ise%2C_Mie","surface_form":"Ise","offset":1163},{"uri":"Ise_Shrine","surface_form":"Ise Shrine","offset":1184},{"uri":"Sai%C5%8D","surface_form":"Sai\u014D","offset":1217},{"uri":"Asama_Shrine","surface_form":"Asama Shrine","offset":1245},{"uri":"Mount_Fuji","surface_form":"Mount Fuji","offset":1273},{"uri":"Frame","surface_form":"frame","offset":1313},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1333},{"uri":"Konohanasakuya-hime","surface_form":"Konohanasakuya-hime","offset":1364},{"uri":"Sumo","surface_form":"Sumo wrestling","offset":1526},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1609},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1630},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1686},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1717},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1729},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1766},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1809},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1824},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1833},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1840},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1863}]}
