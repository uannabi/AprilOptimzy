{"id":236419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Hanzei","text":"was the 18th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Hanzei to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Hanzei\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to \"Nihonshoki\" and \"Kojiki\", he was a son of Emperor Nintoku. The eldest son would become known as Emperor Rich\u016B.\nHanzei was the brother of Rich\u016B. Hanzei's enthronement by-passed Rich\u016B's two sons. Few other details have survived.\nEvents of Hanzei's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Hanzei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nHanzei's reign is described as a time of peace. He died quietly in his palace.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Hanzei.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\") at Sakai. Hanzei is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":148},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":157},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":172},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":210},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":226},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":248},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":264},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":285},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":320},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":331},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":411},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":457},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":489},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":504},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":555},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":572},{"uri":"Emperor_Nintoku","surface_form":"Emperor Nintoku","offset":597},{"uri":"Emperor_Rich%C5%AB","surface_form":"Emperor Rich\u016B","offset":651},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":901},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":961},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1123},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1144},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1200},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1237},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1307},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1315},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1325},{"uri":"Sakai%2C_Osaka","surface_form":"Sakai","offset":1336},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1353},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1368},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1377},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1384}]}
