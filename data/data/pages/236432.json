{"id":236432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor","text":"e=\"preserve\">A character actor is an actor who plays a particular kind of character in a play, movie, television program, opera or ballet. The character actor is not the main part. He is not the lover or hero. He has a character which helps to support the main characters and therefore the story.\nCharacter roles may be roles such as: the faithful servant, the maid, the villain, the mother-in-law, the priest etc. They may or may not be comic characters.\nFor example, in \"The Wizard of Oz\" the main character is Dorothy. The Scarecrow, the Lion and the Tin Man are character roles.\nSome actors or singers prefer character roles to main roles. It may be because this kind or role suits their personality or their singing voice. Some people nearly always play the same kind of character role. We say that people like that are \"typecast\". Some actors are happy to remain typecast. Others may wish to broaden their repertoire and take on different roles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":37},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":89},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":95},{"uri":"Television_program","surface_form":"television program","offset":102},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":122},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":131},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":195},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":204},{"uri":"Servant","surface_form":"servant","offset":348},{"uri":"Maid","surface_form":"maid","offset":361},{"uri":"Villain","surface_form":"villain","offset":371},{"uri":"Mother-in-law","surface_form":"mother-in-law","offset":384},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":403},{"uri":"Comic","surface_form":"comic","offset":438},{"uri":"The_Wizard_of_Oz","surface_form":"The Wizard of Oz","offset":473},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"singing","offset":713},{"uri":"Voice","surface_form":"voice","offset":721}]}
