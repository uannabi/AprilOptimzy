{"id":236481,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Keik%C5%8D","text":"was the 12th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor Keik\u014D to be a legendary person; and the name Keik\u014D\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nKeik\u014D is almost certainly a legend; but the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" record his name.\nEvents of Keik\u014D's life.\nThe limited information about Keik\u014D does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nIn \"Kojiki\", Keik\u014D sent his one of his sons to Ky\u016Bsh\u016B to fight battles on his behalf. In \"Nihonshoki\", Keik\u014D fought and won these battles against local tribes. According to both sources, he sent Yamatotakeru to Izumo province and eastern provinces to expand his territory.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Keik\u014D.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara. The \"kami\" of Emperor Keik\u014D is also venerated at Anaho jinja in Anaho, \u014Cmi province.\nSpouses and children.\nEmpress (first): Harima no Inabi no Ooiratsume (\u64AD\u78E8\u7A32\u65E5\u5927\u90CE\u59EB), daughter of Wakatakehiko (\u82E5\u5EFA\u5409\u5099\u6D25\u65E5\u5B50)\nEmpress (second): Yasakairihime (\u516B\u5742\u5165\u5A9B\u547D), daughter of Yasakairihiko (\u516B\u5742\u5165\u5F66\u547D)\nMizuhanoiratume (\u6C34\u6B6F\u90CE\u5A9B), daughter of iwatsukuwake (\u78D0\u885D\u5225\u547D), younger sister of Iwakiwake (\u77F3\u57CE\u5225\u738B)\nAbe no Takadahime (\u963F\u500D\u9AD8\u7530\u5A9B), daughter of Abe no Kogoto (\u963F\u500D\u6728\u4E8B)\nInabinowakairatsume (\u4F0A\u90A3\u6BD8\u82E5\u90CE\u5973), daughter of Wakatakehiko, younger sister of Harima no Inabi no Ooiratsume\nIgotohime (\u4E94\u5341\u7434\u59EB\u547D),\u3000daughter of Mononobe no Igui (\u7269\u90E8\u80C6\u548B\u5BBF\u79B0)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":123},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":172},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":188},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":210},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":226},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":247},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":282},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":293},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":373},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":419},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":451},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":466},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":531},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":548},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":561},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":726},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":786},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1142},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1163},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1219},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1249},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1261},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1298},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1341},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1356},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1365},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1372},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1395},{"uri":"Kami","surface_form":"kami","offset":1406},{"uri":"Anaho_jinja","surface_form":"Anaho jinja","offset":1450},{"uri":"Anaho","surface_form":"Anaho","offset":1465},{"uri":"%C5%8Cmi_province","surface_form":"\u014Cmi province","offset":1472},{"uri":"Spouse","surface_form":"Spouse","offset":1486},{"uri":"Abe_clan","surface_form":"Abe no Kogoto","offset":1807},{"uri":"Mononobe_clan","surface_form":"Mononobe no Igui","offset":1963}]}
