{"id":236524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy","text":"=\"preserve\">In theater, an understudy is an actor or singer who studies the part of one of the main actors or singers in cases when they can't perform.\nIf a main performer is unable to perform, the understudy will take their place. The understudy is often a member of the chorus who might have had a small part in the performance anyway. Sometimes an understudy is called a \"standby\". A standby is usually not a member of the chorus or ensemble. They may be required to be present in the theatre during the performance, or part of it, in case of a problem.\nSometimes an understudy will become famous when they unexpectedly have to perform instead of the usual lead person.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"theater","offset":15},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":44},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":53}]}
