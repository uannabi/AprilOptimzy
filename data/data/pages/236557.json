{"id":236557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ch%C5%ABai","text":"was the 14th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider Emperor Ch\u016Bai to be a legendary person, and the name Ch\u016Bai\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nCh\u016Bai is almost certainly a legend; but the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" record his name. He was a grandson of Emperor Keik\u014D.\nCh\u016Bai's wife is known as Empress Jing\u016B. Her son would become known as Emperor \u014Cjin.\nEvents of Ch\u016Bai's life.\nThe limited information about Ch\u016Bai does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ch\u016Bai.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Fujiidera of Osaka Prefecture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":123},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":172},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":188},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":210},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":226},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":247},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":282},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":293},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":373},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":419},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":451},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":466},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":531},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":548},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":561},{"uri":"Emperor_Keiko","surface_form":"Emperor Keik\u014D","offset":611},{"uri":"Empress_Jing%C5%AB","surface_form":"Empress Jing\u016B","offset":651},{"uri":"Emperor_%C5%8Cjin","surface_form":"Emperor \u014Cjin","offset":696},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":846},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":906},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":989},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1010},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1066},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1096},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1108},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1145},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1188},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1203},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1212},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1219},{"uri":"Fujiidera%2C_Osaka","surface_form":"Fujiidera","offset":1242},{"uri":"Osaka_Prefecture","surface_form":"Osaka Prefecture","offset":1255}]}
