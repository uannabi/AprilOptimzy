{"id":236569,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Jing%C5%AB","text":", also known as was a legendary empress of Japan. Although her name was once included in the traditional order of succession, she is now considered as a regent.\nHistorians consider details about the life of Empress Jing\u016B to be mythical; and the name Jing\u016B\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for her posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this empress's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nJing\u016B is almost certainly a legend; but the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" record her name.\nJing\u016B was the principle wife of Emperor Ch\u016Bai Her son would become known as Emperor \u014Cjin. The \"Gukansh\u014D\" mentions her, but she is not included on the list of persons born within the line of Imperial descent.\nEvents of Jing\u016B's life.\nThe limited information about Jing\u016B does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter the death of Ch\u016Bai, Jing\u016B also served as regent, according to the oracle of Sumiyoshi-jinja, until her son was old enough to be emperor.\nAfter her death.\nThis empress' official name after her death (her posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jing\u016B.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the empress's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Jing\u016B is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.\nIn the centuries before the Meiji period, Jing\u016B was known as the 15th Japanese imperial ruler, according to the traditional order of succession. However, Jing\u016B's name is now removed from the official list of emperors of Japan. Jing\u016B's son, Emperor \u014Cjin, is today considered to have been the 15th emperor in the order of succession.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":22},{"uri":"Empress","surface_form":"empress","offset":32},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":43},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":93},{"uri":"Succeed","surface_form":"succession","offset":114},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":153},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"mythical","offset":227},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":268},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":284},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":306},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":322},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":343},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":378},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":389},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":469},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":515},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":547},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":562},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":627},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":644},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":657},{"uri":"Emperor_Ch%C5%ABai","surface_form":"Emperor Ch\u016Bai","offset":718},{"uri":"Emperor_%C5%8Cjin","surface_form":"Emperor \u014Cjin","offset":762},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":781},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1030},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1090},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":1153},{"uri":"Sumiyoshi-jinja","surface_form":"Sumiyoshi-jinja","offset":1188},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1315},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1336},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1392},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1428},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1498},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1506},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1516},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1534},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1549},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1558},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1565},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1588},{"uri":"Meiji_period","surface_form":"Meiji period","offset":1622},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1664},{"uri":"Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"imperial ruler","offset":1673},{"uri":"Traditional","surface_form":"traditional","offset":1706},{"uri":"Succeed","surface_form":"succession","offset":1727},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"list of emperors of Japan","offset":1794}]}
