{"id":23662,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration","text":"e=\"preserve\">Transliteration is a conversion of a text from one script to another. It swaps letters (thus \"trans-\" + \"liter-\") in predictable ways (such as \u03B1 \u2192 a, \u0434 \u2192 d, \u03C7 \u2192 ch, \u0576 \u2192 n or \u00E6 \u2192 ae.\nTransliteration is not about the sounds of the original. It is about the type or written characters, mostly the letters.\nExample: the name for Russia in Cyrillic script, \", is usually transliterated as \"Rossiya\".\nSo, '\u0441\u0441' is transliterated as 'ss', but pronounced /s/.\nTransliteration typically goes grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling.\nTransliteration is opposed to transcription, which maps the \"sounds\" of one language into a writing system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Letter_(alphabet)","surface_form":"letters","offset":92},{"uri":"Alpha","surface_form":"\u03B1","offset":156},{"uri":"A","surface_form":"a","offset":160},{"uri":"De_(Cyrillic)","surface_form":"\u0434","offset":163},{"uri":"D","surface_form":"d","offset":167},{"uri":"Chi_(letter)","surface_form":"\u03C7","offset":170},{"uri":"%D5%B6","surface_form":"\u0576","offset":178},{"uri":"Phonetics","surface_form":"sounds","offset":228},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"type","offset":268},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":307},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":338},{"uri":"Cyrillic_script","surface_form":"Cyrillic script","offset":348},{"uri":"Grapheme","surface_form":"grapheme","offset":495},{"uri":"Transcription_(linguistics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":664},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":710}]}
