{"id":236628,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Rich%C5%AB","text":"was the 17th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Rich\u016B to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Rich\u016B\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nSome scholars identify him with King San in the Book of Song. King San sent messengers to the Song Dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to \"Nihonshoki\" and \"Kojiki\", he was the first son of Emperor Nintoku.\nRich\u016B had two sons; but he was followed on the throne by his brother, who would become known as Emperor Hanzei. The enthronement of Hanzei by-passed Rich\u016B's two sons. Few other details have survived.\nTwo of Rich\u016B's grandsons would attain the throne as Emperor Kenz\u014D and as Emperor Ninken.\nEvents of Rich\u016B's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Rich\u016B's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nIn his sixth year of his reign, Rich\u016B died.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Rich\u016B.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\") at Sakai. Rich\u016B is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":147},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":156},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":171},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":208},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":224},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":246},{"uri":"King_San","surface_form":"King San","offset":291},{"uri":"Book_of_Song","surface_form":"Book of Song","offset":307},{"uri":"Song_Dynasty_(420-479)","surface_form":"Song Dynasty","offset":353},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":465},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":486},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":521},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":532},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":612},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":658},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":690},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":705},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":756},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":773},{"uri":"Emperor_Nintoku","surface_form":"Emperor Nintoku","offset":806},{"uri":"Emperor_Hanzei","surface_form":"Emperor Hanzei","offset":919},{"uri":"Attain","surface_form":"attain","offset":1054},{"uri":"Emperor_Kenz%C5%8D","surface_form":"Emperor Kenz\u014D","offset":1075},{"uri":"Emperor_Ninken","surface_form":"Emperor Ninken","offset":1096},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1229},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1289},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1416},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1437},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1493},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1529},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1599},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1607},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1617},{"uri":"Sakai%2C_Osaka","surface_form":"Sakai","offset":1628},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1644},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1659},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1668},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1675}]}
