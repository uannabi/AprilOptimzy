{"id":23663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Taoism or Daoism is a type of belief, or a way of thinking about life. It is at least 2,500 years old and it comes from China. Taoism is now said to be a philosophy. Tao (or Dao,) is the name of the force or the \"Way\" that Taoists believe makes everything in the world. Taoists think that words cannot be used to correctly describe Tao. The very first line of the \"D\u00E0o D\u00E9 J\u012Bng\" (), the most important text in Taoism, says \"the Way that can be explained in words is not the true Way.\" There are many other sacred writings by the teachers of Taoism.\nInstead of spending a lot of time trying to explain what the Tao is, Taoists focus on living a simple and balanced life in harmony with nature. This is one of the most important principles in Taoism. Taoists also believe that conflict is not good and that if you have a problem with something, it is better to find a way around it.\nBeliefs and practices.\nPeople who follow this religion believe that doing something with words, thoughts, symbolic actions, etc. can make things in the real world change. That idea is hard to understand. Here is an example: There is an old story that says China was once covered by a flood. The world was saved from the flood by \u79B9 Y\u01D4, who had only one leg that worked. Y\u01D4 went to different parts of China in a special order, and he dug ditches to let the flood water go into the ocean. When something very bad happens in the world, a Daoist priest can go to the Daoist temple and act out what Y\u01D4 did, and just doing that will make the world get fixed.\nDaoist priests do many other things. For instance, they can use fire and noise to scare demons away. They can do things to cure sickness. They can perform funerals and help keep the new ghosts safe from harm.\nIn Taoism it is believed that opposites rely on each other to exist. For example, big and small. Or, Light and dark.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":43},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":133},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":167},{"uri":"Tao","surface_form":"Tao","offset":179},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":212},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":302},{"uri":"Tao_Te_Ching","surface_form":"D\u00E0o D\u00E9 J\u012Bng","offset":378},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":697},{"uri":"Conflict","surface_form":"conflict","offset":787},{"uri":"Symbolic","surface_form":"symbolic","offset":999},{"uri":"Demons","surface_form":"demons","offset":1633}]}
