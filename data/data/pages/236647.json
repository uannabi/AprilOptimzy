{"id":236647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough","text":"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough KG PC (26 May 1650 \u2013 16 June 1722) was an important English soldier and statesman. He lived through the rules of five monarchs through the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served the Duke of York through the 1670s and early 1680s. This gave him military and political advancement through his brave, clever skill. Churchill helped secure James on the throne.\nHowever, just three years later he left his Catholic teacher for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. For his help in the Glorious Revolution, William at his coronation made him Earl of Marlborough (pronounced /'m\u0254:l b\"\u0259\"\u0279\u0259/). He served in the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was imprisoned in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money.\nHis marriage to the quick-tempered Sarah Jennings \u2013 Anne's close friend \u2013 helped Marlborough's rise. He first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces. Then he became a duke. Later, he became the richest of all Anne's subjects. Although in the end he could not completely crush his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power. Through him, the country grew more and more rich through the 18th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_Garter","surface_form":"KG","offset":40},{"uri":"Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"PC","offset":43},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":92},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"monarchs","offset":158},{"uri":"Page_(servant)","surface_form":"page","offset":235},{"uri":"House_of_Stuart","surface_form":"House of Stuart","offset":260},{"uri":"James_II_of_England","surface_form":"Duke of York","offset":302},{"uri":"Advance","surface_form":"advancement","offset":387},{"uri":"William_III_of_England","surface_form":"William of Orange","offset":567},{"uri":"Glorious_Revolution","surface_form":"Glorious Revolution","offset":606},{"uri":"Coronation","surface_form":"coronation","offset":642},{"uri":"Marlborough","surface_form":"Marlborough","offset":670},{"uri":"Nine_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Nine Years' War","offset":747},{"uri":"Jacobitism","surface_form":"Jacobitism","offset":802},{"uri":"Imprison","surface_form":"imprisoned","offset":862},{"uri":"Tower_of_London","surface_form":"Tower","offset":880},{"uri":"Anne_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Anne","offset":898},{"uri":"Temper","surface_form":"tempered","offset":1010},{"uri":"Sarah_Churchill%2C_Duchess_of_Marlborough","surface_form":"Sarah Jennings","offset":1019},{"uri":"Captain_General","surface_form":"Captain-Generalcy","offset":1105}]}
