{"id":236653,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baboon","text":"Baboons are monkeys of the genus \"Papio\". They are one of the largest kinds of monkey. It is an intelligent Old World monkey. It lives on the ground in groups called troops. Troops can be as small as a few baboons or as big as several hundred members.\nDistribution.\nBaboons live in forests and on savannahs in Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula. As they move into the open land, the family groups come together into groups several hundred strong, led by adult males that work together to protect the others from predators.\nDiet.\nBaboons are omnivores (they eat both plants and meat). They eat grasses, roots, insects and other small animals, like lizards, small mammals, fish, birds, and snakes. In some places, they steal food from humans.\nPredators.\nLeopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs, lions, hyenas and people hunt the baboon. To scare the predator away, baboons can show their eyelids, show their teeth, chase the predator, and make noise.\nTo understand their lives, one must see them in their natural environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":27},{"uri":"Old_World","surface_form":"Old World","offset":108},{"uri":"Monkey","surface_form":"monkey","offset":118},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":282},{"uri":"Savannah","surface_form":"savannah","offset":297},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":310},{"uri":"Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Arabian Peninsula","offset":328},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":610},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":648},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":663},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":689},{"uri":"Leopard","surface_form":"Leopard","offset":753},{"uri":"Cheetah","surface_form":"cheetah","offset":763},{"uri":"African_wild_dog","surface_form":"African wild dog","offset":773},{"uri":"Lion","surface_form":"lion","offset":792},{"uri":"Hyena","surface_form":"hyena","offset":799}]}
