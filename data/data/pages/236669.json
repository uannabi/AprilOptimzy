{"id":236669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Nintoku","text":"was the 16th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Nintoku to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Nintoku\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to \"Nihon Shoki\", Nintoku was the fourth son of Emperor \u014Cjin and the father of three emperors \u2014 Rich\u016B, Hanzei, and Ingy\u014D.\nEvents of Nintoku's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Nintoku's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nNintoku's reign is marked by Japan's first large-scale engineering projects.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Nintoku.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\") at Sakai. Nintoku is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":149},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":158},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":173},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":212},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":228},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":250},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":266},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":287},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":322},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":333},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":413},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":459},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":491},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":506},{"uri":"Nihon_Shoki","surface_form":"Nihon Shoki","offset":557},{"uri":"Emperor_%C5%8Cjin","surface_form":"Emperor \u014Cjin","offset":601},{"uri":"Emperor_Rich%C5%AB","surface_form":"Rich\u016B","offset":649},{"uri":"Emperor_Hanzei","surface_form":"Hanzei","offset":656},{"uri":"Emperor_Ingy%C5%8D","surface_form":"Ingy\u014D","offset":668},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":796},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":856},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1016},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1037},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1093},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1131},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1201},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1209},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1219},{"uri":"Sakai%2C_Osaka","surface_form":"Sakai","offset":1230},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1248},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1263},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1272},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1279}]}
