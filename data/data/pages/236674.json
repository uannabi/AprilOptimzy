The name Y\u016Bryaku\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\", Y\u016Bryaku was the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingy\u014D.\nHe was the brother of Emperor Ank\u014D.\nY\u016Bryaku was followed on the throne by his son, who would come to be known as Emperor Seinei.\nEvents of Y\u016Bryaku's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Y\u016Bryaku's life and rule.

He became the new emperor.\nY\u016Bryaku is known as a patron of silk. It is said that he encouraged growing mulberry bushes for silkworms to eat.\nPoems that are said to be Y\u016Bryaku's are included in the \"Many\u014Dsh\u016B\". A number of his verses are kept in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihonshoki.\"\nHe is credited with bringing many artisans from Korea to Japan.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Y\u016Bryaku.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\").
