{"id":23668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty","text":"Poverty means not having enough money for basic needs such as food, drinking water, shelter, or toileteries. Many people in different countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of West and Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and some parts of Asia.\nThere are different ways to measure poverty. The World Bank says that \"extreme poverty\" is when someone has less than US$1 a day to live on (that dollar is an ideal one). It has been changed to rule out certain effects such as inflation, meaning that prices of things rise higher than what a person is paid, and other price level differences. \"Moderate poverty\" is when people have to live on less than $2 a day. In the year 2001, 1.1 billion people were seen as \"extremely poor\", and 2.7 billion were seen as \"moderately poor\".\nIn the developed world this does not apply. There, many people are seen as the \"working poor\". They have a job, but do not earn enough money for basic things such as food and a home. In most developed countries, people without jobs receive money from the government, but this is often less than they need for a comfortable life.\nThere are different ways to tell if a country is rich or poor. The Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and Human Development Index, or HDI, are two of those measures. Gross Domestic Product is the money made from trade from inside the country.\nHDI, meaning the Human Development Index is a different matter. It is determined by life expectancy and adult literacy rates. Places in Africa like Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Mali are the poorest, with Sierra Leone having the lowest HDI ranking in the world.\nPoverty is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress. One way of helping lower poverty is by educating poor people so that they can start contributing to a nation's economic development. Education teaches the poor about their rights and may show them the path to become an important part of the growth and expansion of the country. Vienna Declaration also tells this fact.\nOne of the most important things that is needed to make a country richer is for the Government to want to help poor people do better. Without this, it is hard for people to become better off.\n\u201CThe poor are starving and their hunger keeps them in poverty.\u201D a quote from Nathan Jones","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":32},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":62},{"uri":"Drinking_water","surface_form":"drinking water","offset":68},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":84},{"uri":"Toileteries","surface_form":"toileteries","offset":96},{"uri":"Developing_country","surface_form":"developing","offset":175},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West","offset":195},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"Sub-Saharan Africa","offset":204},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":224},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":239},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":267},{"uri":"World_Bank","surface_form":"World Bank","offset":322},{"uri":"US%24","surface_form":"US$","offset":391},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":500},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":909},{"uri":"Gross_Domestic_Product","surface_form":"Gross Domestic Product","offset":1198},{"uri":"Human_Development_Index","surface_form":"Human Development Index","offset":1234},{"uri":"Human_Development_Index","surface_form":"Human Development Index","offset":1388},{"uri":"Life_expectancy","surface_form":"life expectancy","offset":1455},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":1481},{"uri":"Guinea-Bissau","surface_form":"Guinea-Bissau","offset":1519},{"uri":"Sierra_Leone","surface_form":"Sierra Leone","offset":1534},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":1551},{"uri":"Economic_development","surface_form":"economic development","offset":1802},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"Education","offset":1824},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"their rights","offset":1857},{"uri":"Vienna_Declaration","surface_form":"Vienna Declaration","offset":1969}]}
