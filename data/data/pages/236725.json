Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Ankan to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Ankan\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to \"Kojiki\" Ankan was the elder son of Emperor Keitai.\nAnkan died childless, and the throne passed to his brother, who would become known as Emperor Senka.\nEvents of Ankan's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Ankan's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAnkan attained the Imperial throne when his father, Emperor Keitai, abdicated in his favor.\nThe construction of state granaries in large numbers throughout Japan was a demonstration of the broad reach of Imperial power and concerns.\nHis death ended his reign after only four years.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ankan.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Ankan is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":147},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":156},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":171},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":208},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":224},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":246},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":262},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":283},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":318},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":329},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":409},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":455},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":487},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":502},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":553},{"uri":"Emperor_Keitai","surface_form":"Emperor Keitai","offset":588},{"uri":"Emperor_Senka","surface_form":"Emperor Senka","offset":690},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":822},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":882},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1247},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1268},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1324},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1360},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1430},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1438},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1448},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1466},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1481},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1490},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1497}]}
