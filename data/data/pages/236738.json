Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Senka to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Senka\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to \"Kojiki\", Senka was a son of Emperor Keitai.\nWhen Emperor Ankan died childless, the throne passed to his brother Senka.\nEvents of Senka's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Senka's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nDuring this reign, Soga no Iname became the first verifiable \"Great Minister\" or \"Omi\" (also identified as \"\u014C-omi\").\nThe reign of Emperor Senka lasted for three years.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Senka.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Senka is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":147},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":156},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":171},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":208},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":224},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":246},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":262},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":283},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":318},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":329},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":409},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":455},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":487},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":502},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":553},{"uri":"Emperor_Keitai","surface_form":"Emperor Keitai","offset":581},{"uri":"Emperor_Ankan","surface_form":"Emperor Ankan","offset":602},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":789},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":849},{"uri":"Soga_no_Iname","surface_form":"Soga no Iname","offset":884},{"uri":"Omi","surface_form":"Omi","offset":947},{"uri":"Lasted","surface_form":"lasted","offset":1009},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1100},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1121},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1177},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1213},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1283},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1291},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1301},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1319},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1334},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1343},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1350}]}
