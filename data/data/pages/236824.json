He grew up in Schiedam, where he married 19-year old Maria de la Quellerie on 28 March 1649. (She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35). The couple had eight children, most of whom did not live through infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.\nJoining the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1639, he served in many posts, like an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies. He then went to Japan. His most important position was that of head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Vietnam. However, he was called back from this post as it was found that he was working trade for his own account.\nIn 1651 he was asked to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa. He landed three ships \"Drommedaris\", \"Reijger\" and \"Goede Hoop\" at the future Cape Town on 6 April 1652 and strongly make the site as a way-station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The \"Walvisch\" and the \"Oliphant\" came later, having had 130 burials at sea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":80},{"uri":"Colonial","surface_form":"colonial","offset":86},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":124},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":145},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":212},{"uri":"Surgeon","surface_form":"surgeon","offset":240},{"uri":"Malacca","surface_form":"Malacca","offset":355},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":376},{"uri":"Eight","surface_form":"eight","offset":440},{"uri":"Infant_mortality","surface_form":"infancy","offset":490},{"uri":"Dutch_East_India_Company","surface_form":"Dutch East India Company","offset":617},{"uri":"Batavia","surface_form":"Batavia","offset":715},{"uri":"East_Indies","surface_form":"East Indies","offset":730},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":759},{"uri":"Tonkin","surface_form":"Tonkin","offset":838},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":846},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1053},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":1145},{"uri":"Trade_route","surface_form":"trade route","offset":1227},{"uri":"Burial","surface_form":"burial","offset":1345}]}
