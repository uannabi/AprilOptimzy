The name Seinei\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\", Seinei was a son of Emperor Y\u016Bryaku.\nSeinei fathered no children. He adopted two grandsons of Emperor Rich\u016B. Each would attain the throne; and they would become known as Emperor Ninken and as Emperor Kenzo\nEvents of Seinei's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Seinei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter the death of his father, Seinei overcame others in the struggle for power.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Seinei.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\").
