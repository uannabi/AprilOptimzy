{"id":236861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Kenz%C5%8D","text":"was the 23rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Kenz\u014D to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Kenz\u014D\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nKenz\u014D was a grandson of Emperor Rich\u016B; and he was adopted as heir by the childless Emperor Seinei.\nEvents of Kenz\u014D's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Kenz\u014D's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kenz\u014D.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, Kenz\u014D final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":147},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":156},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":171},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":208},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":224},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":246},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":262},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":283},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":318},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":329},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":409},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":455},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":487},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":502},{"uri":"Emperor_Rich%C5%AB","surface_form":"Emperor Rich\u016B","offset":563},{"uri":"Emperor_Seinei","surface_form":"Emperor Seinei","offset":622},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":755},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":815},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":898},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":919},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":975},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1011},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1073},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1081},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1091},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1116},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1131},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1140},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1147}]}
