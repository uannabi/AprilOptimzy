{"id":236891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart%C3%ADn_Chambi","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mart\u00EDn Chambi Jim\u00E9nez was a photographer who came from the south of Peru. He was also known as Mart\u00EDn Chambi de Coaza. He was the only well known indigenous Latin American photographer of his time. He was born November 5, 1891 in Puno (a city in Peru) and died September 13, 1973 in the city of Cusco.\nHe is considered one of the great figures of American photography.\nChambi is famous for the historic and social value of his photographs. He was a portrait photographer in the cities and the countryside of the Peruvian Andes. He was the leading portrait photographer in the Andean city of Cusco. Chambi also took many landscape photographs, and he sold these photographs as postcards. He was one of the first to use the postcard format in Peru.\nIn 1979, MOMA in New York had a Chambi exhibition. The exhibition later moved to various locations. It inspired other international exhibitions of his work.\nQuotations.\n\"It is wrong to focus too much on the \"testimonial\" (historical) value of his photos. They have that, indeed, but, in equal measure they express the \"milieu\" (society) in which he lived and they show (...) that when he was behind a camera, he became a giant, a true inventor, a force of invention, a recreator of life.\"\n- Mario Vargas Llosa\n\"I've read that in Chile they think that the indigenous South American peoples have no culture, that they are not civilised, that they are intellectually and artistically inferior to European white peoples. The artworks are a graphic testament that is more eloquent than my own opinion, always. I hope that this testament will be examined fairly and objectively. I feel I am representing my race; my people will speak through the photographs.\"\nEarly life.\nMart\u00EDn Chambi was born in a poor Quechua family. He was born in one of the poorest parts of Peru, at the end of the nineteenth century. His father worked in a gold mine by the River Inambari. Mart\u00EDn sometimes went to work with his father too. He saw his first photographer there at the mine. Chambi learned the basic techniques from a photographer at the Santo Domingo Mine. This meeting fired his ambition.\nChambi tried to work as a professional photographer after this. He traveled to the city of Arequipa in 1908, where photography was more developed. Many professional photographers lived in Areqiupa. They had developed individual photographic styles and professional techniques.\nChambi was an apprentice in the studio of Max T. Vargas. After nine years he created his own studio in Sicuani in 1917. He published his first postcards in November 1917.\nIn 1923 he moved to Cusco and opened a studio there. In Cusco he photographed rich society people and poor indigenous people. During his career, Chambi also travelled all over the Andes. He photographed the landscapes, Inca ruins, and local people. Chambi was with the American explorer Hiram Bingham when Bingham \"discovered\" Machu Picchu, the great Inca monument.\nChronology.\n1891 - Born in Coaza, Puno (Peru) to a Quechua-speaking indigenous family.\n1905 - Father dies.
