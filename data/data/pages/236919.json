{"id":236919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ninken","text":"was the 24th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Ninken to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Ninken\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nNinken was a grandson of Emperor Rich\u016B; and he was adopted by the childless Emperor Seinei.\nEvents of Ninken's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Ninken's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ninken.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Ninken is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":148},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":157},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":172},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":210},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":226},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":248},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":264},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":285},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":320},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":331},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":411},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":457},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":489},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":504},{"uri":"Emperor_Rich%C5%AB","surface_form":"Emperor Rich\u016B","offset":566},{"uri":"Emperor_Seinei","surface_form":"Emperor Seinei","offset":617},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":752},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":812},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":895},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":916},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":972},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1009},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1079},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1087},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1097},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1116},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1131},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1140},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1147}]}
