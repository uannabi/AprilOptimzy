{"id":236950,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclaimed_territory","text":"Unclaimed territory, formally correct terra nullius, is a word from International law. It is used to talk about land which has never been under the rule of any state. It can also be that the previous owner has given up their ownership. This can be done either implicitly or explicitly. There is also the term No man's land, but it may have a slightly different meaning. Rule over \"terra nullius\" can be obtained by occupying the territory.\nTwo territories that are currently terra nullius are Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan, and Marie Byrd Land, in Antarctica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"International law","offset":68},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"land","offset":112},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"rule","offset":148},{"uri":"No_man%27s_land","surface_form":"No man's land","offset":309},{"uri":"Bir_Tawil","surface_form":"Bir Tawil","offset":493},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":511},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":521},{"uri":"Marie_Byrd_Land","surface_form":"Marie Byrd Land","offset":532},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":552}]}
