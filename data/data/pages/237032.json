{"id":237032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_Radiology","text":"Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays, sonography, and so on.\nSome of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"x-ray","offset":230},{"uri":"Sonography","surface_form":"sonography","offset":238},{"uri":"Treatment","surface_form":"treatment","offset":351}]}
