{"id":23710,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Japan","text":"The flag of Japan shows a red sun (rising sun) in the middle of a white field. It is called \"Nisshoki\" (\u65E5\u7AE0\u65D7) formally in Japan. But Japanese people usually call it \"Hinomaru\" (\u65E5\u306E\u4E38) which means \"circle of the sun\".\nThe Japanese navy uses the other flag; the sun has rays.\nThis flag represents the heat of the sun. Its colours are red and white.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":30},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":218},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":247},{"uri":"Ray","surface_form":"ray","offset":265}]}
