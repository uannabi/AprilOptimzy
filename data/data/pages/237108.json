{"id":237108,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams","text":"The M1 Abrams is a modern main battle tank used by the United States. It is also exported to several countries. It is a well armed, well protected, and fast tank designed for modern armored ground warfare. Notable features of the M1 Abrams include the use of a powerful engine, layered armor, and a low profile. It is one of the heaviest tanks in service, weighing almost 70 short tons.\nThe M1 Abrams entered U.S. service in 1980, replacing the M60 Patton. Three main versions of the M1 Abrams have been deployed, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, incorporating improved armament, protection and electronics. These improvements, as well as periodic upgrades to older tanks have allowed this long-serving vehicle to remain in front-line service. The M1A3 is currently under development. It is the principal (main) main battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and in 2010 Iraq. The M1 Abrams is anticipated to be in U.S. service until the 2050s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Main_battle_tank","surface_form":"main battle tank","offset":26},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":81},{"uri":"Armored_warfare","surface_form":"armored ground warfare","offset":182},{"uri":"Short_ton","surface_form":"short ton","offset":375},{"uri":"M60_Patton","surface_form":"M60 Patton","offset":445},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":827},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"Marine Corps","offset":850},{"uri":"Egyptian_Army","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":882},{"uri":"Kuwaiti_Army","surface_form":"Kuwait","offset":889},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabian_Army","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":897},{"uri":"Australian_Army","surface_form":"Australia","offset":911},{"uri":"Iraqi_Army","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":934}]}
