{"id":237144,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_sentence","text":"=\"preserve\">A complex sentence is a sentence with two or more of dependent sentences and independent sentences mixed together by subordinating conjunctions, such as \"although,\" \"after,\" \"until,\" \"while,\" or \"when'\".\n\"Before the curtain rose, Nick came out and took a bow.\"\nIn this sentence, \"before\" is a subordinating conjunction. \"Before the curtain rose\" is a dependent sentence. With its subordinating conjunction, it joins the independent sentence by being smoothly contacted by its meaning. But without this independent sentence,\"Nick came and took a bow\", the dependent sentence cannot stay by itself. \"Before the curtain rose\" cannot stay by it self without an independent sentence joined together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":36},{"uri":"Conjunction","surface_form":"conjunction","offset":143}]}
