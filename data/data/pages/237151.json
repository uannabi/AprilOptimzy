{"id":237151,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Keitai","text":", also known as \"Keitai okimi\", was the 26th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Keitai to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Keitai\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nSome modern reference works of history call Keitai the \"King Ohoto of Koshi\". Koshi was a small regional entity in what would become Koshi Province in northern Japan.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", Ketai was a fifth generation grandson of Emperor \u014Cjin.\nWhen Emperor Buretsu died without a successor, Ketai attained the throne.\nThere was a period of disputes over the succession after Keitai's death. One branch of the Yamato clan supported sons who would become Emperor Ankan and Emperor Senka. Another branch supported the third son who would become known as Emperor Kimmei.\nEvents of Keitai's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Keitai's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nKeitai confronted rebellion in Ky\u016Bsh\u016B, which was then known as the. The emperor sent forces to calm the unrest.\nIt is not known how long Keitai lived after his abdication. Keitai abdicated in his favor of his eldest son who would become known as Ankan. Ankan died four years later, and Keitai's next oldest son would attain the throne. This son would come to be known as Emperor Senka.\nSenka died after three years as emperor; and the throne would be vacant. The third son of Ketai would attained the throne, and he would become known as Emperor Kemmei.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Keitai.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Keitai is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":45},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":56},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":80},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":180},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":189},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":204},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":242},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":258},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":280},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":296},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":317},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":352},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":363},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":443},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":489},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":521},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":536},{"uri":"Koshi_Province","surface_form":"Koshi Province","offset":685},{"uri":"Emperor_%C5%8Cjin","surface_form":"Emperor \u014Cjin","offset":826},{"uri":"Emperor_Buretsu","surface_form":"Emperor Buretsu","offset":845},{"uri":"Attained","surface_form":"attained","offset":893},{"uri":"Emperor_Ankan","surface_form":"Emperor Ankan","offset":1049},{"uri":"Emperor_Senka","surface_form":"Emperor Senka","offset":1067},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1147},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1282},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1342},{"uri":"Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"Ky\u016Bsh\u016B","offset":1389},{"uri":"Emperor_Senka","surface_form":"Emperor Senka","offset":1729},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1979},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":2000},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":2056},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":2093},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":2163},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":2171},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":2181},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":2200},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":2215},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":2224},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":2231}]}
