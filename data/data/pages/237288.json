{"id":237288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Bidatsu","text":"was the 30th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.\nThe years of reign of Bidatsu start in 572 and end in 585; however, there are no certain dates for this emperor's life or reign. The names and sequence of the early emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nHistorians consider details about the life of Emperor Bidatsu to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Bidatsu\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nHe was the second son of Emperor Kimmei. His mother, Ishi-hime, was a daughter of Emperor Senka.\nHis palace in Yamato Province was called Osada no Miya of Iware.\nAlthough he had many children, none of them would ever become emperor. According to \"Gukansh\u014D\", Bidatsu had four empresses and 16 Imperial children (6 sons and 10 daughters).\nEvents of Bidatsu's life.\nIn the 15th year of Kimmei's reign, Bidatsu was named Crown Prince.\nIn the 32nd year of Kimmei's reign (572), the emperor died; and his successor was Bidatsu. This was confirmed in ceremonies.\nBidatsu's reign was marked by power struggles about Buddhism. The two most important men in the court of Bidatsu were Soga no Umako and Mononobe no Moriya. Soga supported the growth of Buddhism, and Moriya wanted to stop it.\nBidatsu suffered from an unknown disease which afflicted him with sores. Probably, he was the first royal victim of smallpox in Japan.\nIn the 14th year of Bidatsu's reign (585), he died; and the succession (\"senso\") were passed to his younger half-brother who became known as Emperor Y\u014Dmei.\nAfter his death.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). Bidatsu is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":24},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":48},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":162},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":203},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":224},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":264},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":310},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":342},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":357},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":462},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":471},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":486},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":525},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":541},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":563},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":601},{"uri":"Emperor_Senka","surface_form":"Emperor Senka","offset":658},{"uri":"Yamato_Province","surface_form":"Yamato Province","offset":687},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":823},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":1107},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremonies","offset":1120},{"uri":"Soga_no_Umako","surface_form":"Soga no Umako","offset":1250},{"uri":"Mononobe_no_Moriya","surface_form":"Mononobe no Moriya","offset":1268},{"uri":"Succession","surface_form":"succession","offset":1552},{"uri":"Emperor_Y%C5%8Dmei","surface_form":"Emperor Y\u014Dmei","offset":1633},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1682},{"uri":"Earthen","surface_form":"earthen","offset":1752},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"tumulus","offset":1760},{"uri":"Kofun","surface_form":"kofun","offset":1770},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1790},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1805},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1814},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1821}]}
