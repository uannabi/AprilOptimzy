{"id":23734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monounsaturated_fat","text":"=\"preserve\">A monounsaturated fat is a kind of fat found in some foods such as nuts and avocados. They are the main component in olive oil (oleic acid).\nIn general, these fats are considered to be healthier than others. They have the same amount of energy, but they reduce blood cholesterol levels. This reduces the risk to the heart. Another type of fat is polyunsaturated fat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":79},{"uri":"Avocado","surface_form":"avocado","offset":88},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"olive oil","offset":129},{"uri":"Oleic_acid","surface_form":"oleic acid","offset":140},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":249},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":279},{"uri":"Polyunsaturated_fat","surface_form":"polyunsaturated fat","offset":358}]}
