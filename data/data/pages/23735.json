{"id":23735,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat","text":"=\"preserve\">Polyunsaturated fats are fats that are usually found in items like vegetable oils. Such items are typically found to be liquid at room temperature.\nChemistry.\nPolyunsaturated fats are called organic compounds. Its molecules contains more than one double bonds. The peculiar structure reduces the strength of the forces between molecules. This causes the items to have a lower melting point. This is why the items are usually liquid at room temperature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vegetable_oil","surface_form":"vegetable oil","offset":79},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":132},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":147},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":187},{"uri":"Organic_compounds","surface_form":"organic compounds","offset":203},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":226}]}
