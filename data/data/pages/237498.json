{"id":237498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick","text":"Francis Harry Compton Crick OM FRS (8 June 1916 \u2013 28 July 2004) was a British physicist, biologist and humanist.\nHe is one of those who worked out the structure of DNA. Using X-ray crystallography results from Maurice Wilkins' biophysics team at King's College London, Crick and James Watson discovered that DNA has what is called a \"double helix structure\".\nThis means that DNA is made of two chains wound round each other to make a spiral. Only one of the chains carries information, but the two chains together makes the molecule more stable. DNA is the basis of heredity for almost all forms of life today.\nCrick, Watson and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1962. Their work sparked a huge amount of research in molecular and cell biology and, as a result, many subsequent Nobel awards have been made.\nMolecular biology.\nThe adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be tRNAs and the catalytic \"ribonucleic-protein complexes\" became known as ribosomes. An important step was later realization (in 1960) that the messenger RNA was not the same as the ribosomal RNA.\nIn his thinking about the processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made clear the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology.\nNeurophysiology.\nIn the final phase of his career, Crick and Christof Koch published a series of articles on consciousness (1990\u20132005).\nCrick decided to focus his work on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick's book \"The Astonishing Hypothesis\" made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences.\nThe Francis Crick Institute.\nThe Francis Crick Institute is a \u00A3660,000,000 biomedical research centre in London. The Francis Crick Institute is a partnership between Cancer Research UK, Imperial College London, King's College London, the Medical Research Council, University College London (UCL) and the Wellcome Trust. It is the largest centre for biomedical research and innovation in Europe.\nThe Institute is next to St Pancras station on the Euston Road. It has an annual budget of over \u00A3100 million. The building\u2019s vaulted roof is arranged into two shells and is fitted with solar panels. A third of the building is below ground to reduce its visible mass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Merit_(Commonwealth)","surface_form":"OM","offset":28},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":31},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":70},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":78},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":89},{"uri":"Humanist","surface_form":"humanist","offset":103},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":164},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":175},{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallography","offset":181},{"uri":"Maurice_Wilkins","surface_form":"Maurice Wilkins","offset":210},{"uri":"King%27s_College_London","surface_form":"King's College London","offset":246},{"uri":"James_Watson","surface_form":"James Watson","offset":279},{"uri":"Spiral","surface_form":"spiral","offset":434},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"heredity","offset":566},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":645},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cell biology","offset":755},{"uri":"TRNA","surface_form":"tRNA","offset":900},{"uri":"Ribosome","surface_form":"ribosome","offset":972},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":1042},{"uri":"Ribosome","surface_form":"ribosomal RNA","offset":1080},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":1207},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":1231},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":1256},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":1393},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":1521},{"uri":"Visual","surface_form":"visual","offset":1607},{"uri":"Awareness","surface_form":"awareness","offset":1614},{"uri":"Human_brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":1818},{"uri":"Francis_Crick_Institute","surface_form":"Francis Crick Institute","offset":1889},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1961},{"uri":"Cancer_Research_UK","surface_form":"Cancer Research UK","offset":2022},{"uri":"Imperial_College_London","surface_form":"Imperial College London","offset":2042},{"uri":"King%27s_College_London","surface_form":"King's College London","offset":2067},{"uri":"Medical_Research_Council_(UK)","surface_form":"Medical Research Council","offset":2094},{"uri":"University_College_London","surface_form":"University College London","offset":2120},{"uri":"Wellcome_Trust","surface_form":"Wellcome Trust","offset":2160},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2243},{"uri":"St_Pancras_station","surface_form":"St Pancras station","offset":2276},{"uri":"Euston_Road","surface_form":"Euston Road","offset":2302},{"uri":"Solar_panel","surface_form":"solar panel","offset":2436}]}
