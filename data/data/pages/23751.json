{"id":23751,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa","text":"The Scramble for Africa (or the Race for Africa), from the 1880s until the start of World War I, was a time of much colonial expansion in Africa. Many European countries started colonies in Africa during this time. This is an example of New Imperialism. Liberia, Ethiopia and Darwiish State were not conquered at this time.\nThe last half of the 19th century saw a change in the way countries controlled their colonies. They changed from economic control through mass settlement, to political and military control of the colony's resources, especially in the 1870s. This was seen in the fight for the areas that were controlled by European nations.\nSome famous people who helped European countries find more land in Africa included the explorers David Livingston, Henry Morton Stanley, and Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, and the French politician Jules Ferry.\nThe Berlin Conference (1884 - 1885) tried to end disputes between the United Kingdom, France's Third Republic, the German Empire, and other European countries. They agreed that \"effective occupation\" would be the rule for colonial claims. Laws were made for using direct rule on a colony, backed up by military power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":84},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonial expansion","offset":116},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":138},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":151},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":178},{"uri":"Imperialism","surface_form":"Imperialism","offset":241},{"uri":"Darwiish_State","surface_form":"Darwiish State","offset":276},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":345},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economic","offset":437},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":467},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":735},{"uri":"David_Livingston","surface_form":"David Livingston","offset":745},{"uri":"Henry_Morton_Stanley","surface_form":"Henry Morton Stanley","offset":763},{"uri":"Pierre_Savorgnan_de_Brazza","surface_form":"Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza","offset":789},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":825},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":832},{"uri":"Jules_Ferry","surface_form":"Jules Ferry","offset":843},{"uri":"Berlin_Conference","surface_form":"Berlin Conference","offset":860},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":926},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":971},{"uri":"Effective_occupation","surface_form":"effective occupation","offset":1034},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"Law","offset":1095},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1158}]}
