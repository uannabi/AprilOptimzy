{"id":237987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_training","text":"Flexibility training refers to developing a wide range of movement in a joint or series of joints that is attainable in a momentary effort with the help of a partner or a piece of equipment. Human flexibility is not the same in all joints. Thus, some easily perform longitudinal splits but are very hard in transversal ones. Flexibility in some joints can be increased to a certain degree by stretching.\nFlexibility training has long been underestimated and perhaps overlooked by health-care professionals. Quality of life is considerably enhanced by improving and maintaining a good range of motion in the joints.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Range_of_motion","surface_form":"range of movement","offset":49},{"uri":"Joint","surface_form":"joint","offset":72},{"uri":"Stretching","surface_form":"stretching","offset":392},{"uri":"Health_care","surface_form":"health-care","offset":480}]}
