There were many airbases, bunkers, tunnels and fortifications around Townsville, some of these forts are still visible, where as others have been demolished.\nTownsville was once referred to as Australia's Saviour, but this slowly faded away as history from the war in Townsville was destroyed to hide tunnels from the public.\n1970s Onwards.\nOn Christmas Eve in 1971, Townsville was hit by Tropical Cyclone Althea, which destroyed the port almost completely.
