{"id":238386,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunbelt","text":"The \"Sun Belt\" is a term for the states in the southwestern and southeastern United States. Many people moved to these states from northern states in the years since World War II. A lot of older and retired people live there; these people are called \"snowbirds\" because they retired to a place with better weather than where they lived before. These places have large suburbs such as Sun City, Arizona, Lakewood, California, and Hialeah, Florida. States that are the best examples of the Sun Belt are California, Florida, and Arizona.\nThere is a college sports conference called the Sun Belt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":166},{"uri":"Sun_City%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Sun City, Arizona","offset":384},{"uri":"Lakewood%2C_California","surface_form":"Lakewood, California","offset":403},{"uri":"Hialeah%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Hialeah, Florida","offset":429},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":501},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":513},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":526}]}
