The name means \"island-mountains glacier\".\nThe south end of the mountain was once part of the coastline of the Atlantic ocean. The sea gradually moved about 5km south. Now there are beautiful steep cliffs and waterfalls.\nThe volcano erupted several times in 1821 and 1822. Some cattle and sheep died, presumably because of fluoride poisoning.\nThe 2010 eruption.\nAt Christmas 2009 the volcano started to show signs of being active again. On 27 March 2010 it started to erupt. On 14 April 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00F6kull started to erupt heavily from the top crater in the bottom left of the glacier. This made meltwater floods to rush down the nearby rivers. Many people had to be evacuated. Volcanic ash was thrown several kilometres into the atmosphere. The dust blow over northwest Europe on the 15th and 16th April 2010. It became very dangerous for aeroplanes to fly and so all commercial flights were stopped in most parts of northern Europe. This caused chaos for travellers, many of whom were trying to return home after their Easter vacation. The chaos continued for many days.\nIn Popular Culture.\nThe volcano was featured in 2013's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in a scene where Walter had to run from an eruption after pursuing Sean O' Connell to Iceland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":60},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":71},{"uri":"Atlantic","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":191},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":278},{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":289},{"uri":"1821","surface_form":"1821","offset":338},{"uri":"1822","surface_form":"1822","offset":347},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":358},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":369},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":403},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":412},{"uri":"Christmas_Island","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":445},{"uri":"2009_Victorian_bushfires","surface_form":"2009","offset":455},{"uri":"27_March","surface_form":"27 March","offset":520},{"uri":"2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":529},{"uri":"14_April","surface_form":"14 April","offset":558},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":627},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":660},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":689},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":720},{"uri":"Evacuation","surface_form":"evacuated","offset":750},{"uri":"Ash","surface_form":"ash","offset":770},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":793},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":813},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":854},{"uri":"Aeroplane","surface_form":"aeroplane","offset":923},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":1104}]}
