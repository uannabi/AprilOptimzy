{"id":238590,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function","text":"e=\"preserve\">In computer science and mathematics, an anonymous function is a function with no name. Usually, a function is written like: formula_1. It can be written anonymously as formula_1. Anonymous functions exist in most functional programming languages and most other programming languages where functions are values.\nExamples in some programming languages.\nEach of these examples show a nameless function that multiplies two numbers.\nPython.\n\uFFFD\uFFFD>(lambda x: (lambda y: x * y)) (3) (4)\nHaskell.\n\\x -> \\y -> x * y\n\\x y -> x * y\n\uFFFD\uFFFD> (\\x -> \\y -> x * y) 3 4\nStandard ML.\nfn (x, y) => x * y\nfn x => fn y => x * y\nJavaScript.\n(x, y) => x * y\nx => y => x * y\nC++ Boost.\n_1 * _2\nNote: What you need to write boost lambda is to include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp> header file, and using namespace boost::lambda, i.e.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":16},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":37},{"uri":"Functional_programming_language","surface_form":"functional programming language","offset":226}]}
