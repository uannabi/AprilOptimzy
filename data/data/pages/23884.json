{"id":23884,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra","text":"The urethra is a tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. It allows people and animals to remove urine from the body. People and animals control urination using the urethral sphincter.\nThe urethra is part of the urinary system in mammals. Because humans are mammals, they have urethras. In male mammals, the urethra is also a part of the reproductive system, because males use it as a tube for sperm during sex.\nHuman anatomy.\nIn human anatomy, men have longer urethras than women. This means that women have bladder infections more often, because their bladders are closer to the outside. Because the male urethra is longer and is not straight, inserting a catheter (tube to help urination) is more difficult in men.\nIn women, the urethra is 2.5-4 cm (1-1.5 in) long. Its opening to the outside of the body is part of the vulva (the area between a woman's legs). The female urethra is between the clitoris and the opening to the vagina. In men, the urethra is about 20 cm (8 in) long and its opening to the outside of the body is at the end of the penis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":17},{"uri":"Bladder","surface_form":"bladder","offset":40},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":115},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":130},{"uri":"Urinating","surface_form":"urination","offset":163},{"uri":"Urethral_sphincter","surface_form":"urethral sphincter","offset":183},{"uri":"Urinary_system","surface_form":"urinary system","offset":230},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":248},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":265},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":308},{"uri":"Reproductive_system","surface_form":"reproductive system","offset":356},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":412},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":425},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":454},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":535},{"uri":"Insert","surface_form":"inserting","offset":664},{"uri":"Catheter","surface_form":"catheter","offset":676},{"uri":"Vulva","surface_form":"vulva","offset":841},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoris","offset":916},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":948},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":1067}]}
