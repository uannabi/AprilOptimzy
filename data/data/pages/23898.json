There were also other types of controllers that could be used with the NES.\nSome famous games for the NES are \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Metroid\", \"Mega Man\", \"Castlevania\", \"Donkey Kong\", and \"Final Fantasy\". There have been many sequels made to these games and they are still enjoyed today. Nintendo discontinued (stopped making and selling) the NES in 1995.\nTechnical details.\nThe CPU (Central Processing Unit) in the NES is called MOS 6502 and is an 8-bit CPU.
