The winner is selected by a vote of the \"Professional Hockey Writers' Association\" after each team selects one player on their team to be voted on. It is often awarded to a player who has come back from career- or even life-threatening illness or injury. A player can receive this trophy only once in his career.\nHistory.\nThe trophy is named in honour of Bill Masterton, a Minnesota North Stars player who died on January 15, 1968, after sustaining an injury during a hockey game. During his playing career, Masterton showed \"to a high degree the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey\". It was first awarded following the 1967\u201368 regular season. As of the end of the 2008\u201309 NHL season, players for the Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins have won the trophy 4 times each, while the Los Angeles Kings have won 3 times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":64},{"uri":"Sportsmanship","surface_form":"sportsmanship","offset":146},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"hockey","offset":183},{"uri":"Bill_Masterton","surface_form":"Bill Masterton","offset":546},{"uri":"Minnesota_North_Stars","surface_form":"Minnesota North Stars","offset":564},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":923},{"uri":"New_York_Rangers","surface_form":"New York Rangers","offset":943},{"uri":"Boston_Bruins","surface_form":"Boston Bruins","offset":964},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Kings","surface_form":"Los Angeles Kings","offset":1022}]}
