It is a National Monument of Chile.\nThe original park boasts 100-year-old native Chilean palms (\"Phoenix canariensis\") and many green spaces, and its recent restoration has made it into an attractive walking destination. The majority of the grand houses in the park are in use as private homes.\nBoth the park and the former casino were named National Monuments on February 25, 1988.\nThe Park was severely damaged after the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, destroying all the balaustrades around the park.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Agust%C3%ADn_Ross_Edwards","surface_form":"Agust\u00EDn Ross","offset":31},{"uri":"Ross_Casino","surface_form":"Ross Casino","offset":72},{"uri":"Pichilemu","surface_form":"Pichilemu","offset":88},{"uri":"National_Monuments_of_Chile","surface_form":"National Monument of Chile","offset":107},{"uri":"Phoenix_canariensis","surface_form":"Phoenix canariensis","offset":196},{"uri":"2010_Pichilemu_earthquake","surface_form":"2010 Pichilemu earthquake","offset":522}]}
