In his books \"Strength and How to Obtain It\" and \"Sandow's System of Physical Training\", Sandow laid out specific prescriptions of weights and repetitions in order to achieve his ideal proportions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kaliningrad","surface_form":"K\u00F6ningsberg","offset":34},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":68},{"uri":"Bodybuilding","surface_form":"bodybuilding","offset":137},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":308},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":318},{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":370},{"uri":"Sportsperson","surface_form":"athletes","offset":619}]}
