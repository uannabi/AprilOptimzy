{"id":239637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)","text":"A fault is a fracture, or break, in the Earth's crust (lithosphere). Some faults are active. Here, sections of rock move past each other. This sometimes makes earthquakes.\nFaulting occurs when shear stress on a rock overcomes the forces which hold it together. The fracture itself is called a \"fault plane\". When it is exposed at the Earth's surface, it may form a cliff or steep slope called a \"fault scarp\".\nThe angle between the fault plane and an imaginary horizontal plane is called the \"dip angle\" of the fault. Faults may dip shallowly or steeply.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lithosphere","surface_form":"lithosphere","offset":55},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":111},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":159},{"uri":"Shear_stress","surface_form":"shear stress","offset":193},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"forces","offset":230},{"uri":"Fault_scarp","surface_form":"fault scarp","offset":396},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":461}]}
