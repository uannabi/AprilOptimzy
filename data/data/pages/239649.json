It was originally written in the languages of Aramaic and Hebrew (Old Testament) and Greek (New Testament).\nThe Latin Vulgate was common in Western Christianity through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into many more languages. Translations of the Bible into English have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium.
