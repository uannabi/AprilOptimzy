{"id":239678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts","text":"Darts is a type of throwing game where darts are thrown towards a circular target held on a wall. The circular target is called the dartboard. Darts is most liked in the United Kingdom (which was the first country to call darts a sport), mainly in England, and is a pub game. Darts was first played around the 1870s. Until 1930s all dart boards were made out of wood that had to be soaked in water day before.\nDartboard.\nA normal board is 17 and three-quarter inches in diameter and split into 20 sections, plus there are two circles in the middle, an outer ring and a triple ring (the ring halfway from the bull). Throwing the dart on the green ring (known as the \"single bull\") scores 25 points and the red spot (the \"bull\") scores 50 points. The 20 sections around the outside of the two circles each have a number from 1 to 20. The outer ring scores double the points and the triple ring scores triple. The highest score that can be made by throwing three darts in one round is 180. This is where all three darts hit the triple 20.\nThe 20 numbers are arranged in a random order, and is still the order in the present day. From the top number clockwise, the numbers go 20, 1, 18, 4, 13, 6, 10, 15, 2, 17, 3, 19, 7, 16, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12 and 5.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circular","surface_form":"circular","offset":66},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":170},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":230},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":248},{"uri":"Pub_game","surface_form":"pub game","offset":266},{"uri":"Quarter","surface_form":"quarter","offset":452},{"uri":"Inches","surface_form":"inches","offset":460},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":470},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":526},{"uri":"Clockwise","surface_form":"clockwise","offset":1146}]}
