{"id":239764,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennywise","text":"Pennywise is an American melodic hardcore band. They formed in Hermosa Beach, California in 1988. The band is named after the monster from It, Stephen King's novel of the same title. Pennywise's most successful line-up, which remained together for 13 years (from 1996 to 2009), consisted of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They kept their original line-up until original bassist Jason Thirsk killed himself in 1996, because he had issues with his alcoholism. After that Bradbury replaced him. In August 2009, Lindberg left Pennywise and was replaced by Ignite singer Zoli T\u00E9gl\u00E1s.\nPennywise has released nine studio albums. After releasing two EPs in 1989, the band signed to Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz) in 1990. Their two first albums were not very successful. Pennywise's next album, \"About Time\", became a mainstream success. It was the band's first album to appear on the top 100 on the \"Billboard\" music chart and chart outside the United States. By this time, a number of punk bands, such as Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid and NOFX, had hit the mainstream, but Pennywise did not want to be signed to a major label. When Bradbury joined in 1996 following Thrisk's death, Pennywise made even more popular albums and eventually became celebrities.\nTheir best known song is Bro Hymn form their self-titled debut album. After Thirsk's death, the band made a new version of this song as a tribute to Jason Thirsk which appeared on \"Full Circle\".\nDiscography.\n\"A Word from the Wise\" and \"Wildcard\" were both repackaged in the 1992 compilation album \"A Word from the 'Wise\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Melodic_hardcore","surface_form":"melodic hardcore","offset":25},{"uri":"Hermosa_Beach%2C_California","surface_form":"Hermosa Beach, California","offset":63},{"uri":"It_(monster)","surface_form":"It","offset":139},{"uri":"Stephen_King","surface_form":"Stephen King","offset":143},{"uri":"It_(novel)","surface_form":"of the same title","offset":164},{"uri":"Jim_Lindberg","surface_form":"Jim Lindberg","offset":291},{"uri":"Fletcher_Dragge","surface_form":"Fletcher Dragge","offset":314},{"uri":"Randy_Bradbury","surface_form":"Randy Bradbury","offset":341},{"uri":"Byron_McMackin","surface_form":"Byron McMackin","offset":367},{"uri":"Jason_Thirsk","surface_form":"Jason Thirsk","offset":447},{"uri":"Ignite_(band)","surface_form":"Ignite","offset":621},{"uri":"Zoli_T%C3%A9gl%C3%A1s","surface_form":"Zoli T\u00E9gl\u00E1s","offset":635},{"uri":"Epitaph_Records","surface_form":"Epitaph Records","offset":743},{"uri":"Bad_Religion","surface_form":"Bad Religion","offset":777},{"uri":"Brett_Gurewitz","surface_form":"Brett Gurewitz","offset":792},{"uri":"About_Time","surface_form":"About Time","offset":891},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":996},{"uri":"Music_chart","surface_form":"music chart","offset":1007},{"uri":"Bad_Religion","surface_form":"Bad Religion","offset":1102},{"uri":"Green_Day","surface_form":"Green Day","offset":1116},{"uri":"The_Offspring","surface_form":"The Offspring","offset":1127},{"uri":"Rancid_(band)","surface_form":"Rancid","offset":1142},{"uri":"NOFX","surface_form":"NOFX","offset":1153},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"celebrities","offset":1358},{"uri":"Bro_Hymn","surface_form":"Bro Hymn","offset":1396},{"uri":"A_Word_from_the_%27Wise","surface_form":"A Word from the 'Wise","offset":1669}]}
