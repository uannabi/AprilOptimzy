{"id":239767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_Time","text":"\"About Time\" is the third studio album by Pennywise, released on June 13, 1995.\nWhile the album was not a commercial success, it is considered by some critics to be one of Pennywise's best releases, and it includes their concert staples, \"Peaceful Day\", \"Perfect People\", \"Every Single Day\", and \"Same Old Story\". \"About Time\" was also the first Pennywise album to chart in Billboard. Most of the album follows the theme of problems with time: fear of it passing, controlling it and accepting it.\n\"About Time\" was also the last Pennywise album to feature bass player Jason Thirsk, who committed suicide on July 29, 1996. After debating whether to break up, or to continue on with a new bass player, Pennywise decided to hire a new bassist, Randy Bradbury, who would stay with the band permanently.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album&lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":26},{"uri":"Pennywise","surface_form":"Pennywise","offset":42},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":374},{"uri":"Jason_Thirsk","surface_form":"Jason Thirsk","offset":567},{"uri":"Randy_Bradbury","surface_form":"Randy Bradbury","offset":740}]}
