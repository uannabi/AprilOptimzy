{"id":239777,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">A compiled programming language is a programming language which is compiled. When a program is compiled, the compiler will change it from a programming language that a person can read, to a set of instructions that a computer can follow. These instructions (written in machine code) are then stored as an executable in a file. This file can be run quickly by the computer.\nThe other kind of language is an interpreted language. A program, or even single lines, will be interpreted one line at a time by the computer. This is slower for a computer than following compiled instructions. But it can be faster to write and test programs that are interpreted.\nScripting languages are often interpreted. Some languages can be either compiled or interpreted. Java, Lisp, Python and AutoIT are examples.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":50},{"uri":"Compile","surface_form":"compile","offset":80},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"program","offset":97},{"uri":"Compiler","surface_form":"compiler","offset":122},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":153},{"uri":"Machine_code","surface_form":"machine code","offset":282},{"uri":"Executable","surface_form":"executable","offset":318},{"uri":"Interpreter_(computing)","surface_form":"interpreted","offset":419},{"uri":"Scripting_languages","surface_form":"Scripting languages","offset":668},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":765},{"uri":"Lisp_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Lisp","offset":771},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":777}]}
