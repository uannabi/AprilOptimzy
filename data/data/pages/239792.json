{"id":239792,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_and_Fall%2C_Rage_and_Grace","text":"\"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" is the eighth album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 2008. It was their first album of new material in nearly five years, following 2003's \"Splinter\", and their first to be produced by Bob Rock. It had produced four singles: \"Hammerhead\", \"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\", \"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?\" and \"Half-Truism\".\nAlthough drummer Atom Willard (who left in July 2007) was still a member of the band during the recording, session musician Josh Freese actually handled the drum tracks, like he did on \"Splinter\". Due to contract issues with Geffen Records, Willard could not do recording on the album and later decided to leave the band and continue his duties in Angels & Airwaves full time while former Face to Face drummer Pete Parada joined the band just in time for the tour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album&lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":64},{"uri":"The_Offspring","surface_form":"The Offspring","offset":79},{"uri":"Splinter","surface_form":"Splinter","offset":193},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"produced","offset":226},{"uri":"Bob_Rock","surface_form":"Bob Rock","offset":238},{"uri":"Hammerhead","surface_form":"Hammerhead","offset":279},{"uri":"You%27re_Gonna_Go_Far%2C_Kid","surface_form":"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid","offset":293},{"uri":"Kristy%2C_Are_You_Doing_Okay%3F","surface_form":"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?","offset":321},{"uri":"Half-Truism","surface_form":"Half-Truism","offset":355},{"uri":"Adam_%26quot%3BAtom%26quot%3B_Willard","surface_form":"Atom Willard","offset":386},{"uri":"Josh_Freese","surface_form":"Josh Freese","offset":493},{"uri":"Geffen_Records","surface_form":"Geffen Records","offset":594},{"uri":"Angels_%26amp%3B_Airwaves","surface_form":"Angels & Airwaves","offset":717},{"uri":"Face_to_Face","surface_form":"Face to Face","offset":758},{"uri":"Pete_Parada","surface_form":"Pete Parada","offset":779}]}
