{"id":239794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping","text":"Jumping is a form of movement in which an organism pushes itself up through the air and falls back down. Jumping is different from running, galloping and other ways of moving because the body is airborne for a longer period of time.\nSome animals, such as the kangaroo, use jumping as their main form of traveling, while others, such as frogs, only use it to escape predators. Jumping is also an important feature of many different activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump, and show jumping.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":42},{"uri":"Running","surface_form":"running","offset":131},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":238},{"uri":"Kangaroo","surface_form":"kangaroo","offset":259},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":336},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":365},{"uri":"Long_jump","surface_form":"long jump","offset":468},{"uri":"High_jump","surface_form":"high jump","offset":479}]}
