{"id":239948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe_for_Hate","text":"\"Recipe for Hate\" is the seventh album by American punk rock band Bad Religion. It was released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records in 1993. It was released again on Atlantic Records after the band signed to that label.\nDespite being released on a major label, \"Recipe for Hate\" initially received mixed reviews from music critics, who generally found it to be less impressive than Bad Religion's older albums, but it has gained a cult following in recent times. The album got the band's highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at #14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, and scored the radio hits \"American Jesus\" and \"Struck a Nerve\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album| &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":51},{"uri":"Bad_Religion","surface_form":"Bad Religion","offset":66},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":103},{"uri":"Epitaph_Records","surface_form":"Epitaph Records","offset":140},{"uri":"Atlantic_Records","surface_form":"Atlantic Records","offset":190},{"uri":"Cult_following","surface_form":"cult following","offset":455},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":520},{"uri":"Billboard_magazine","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":568},{"uri":"Top_Heatseekers","surface_form":"Heatseekers","offset":580},{"uri":"American_Jesus","surface_form":"American Jesus","offset":626},{"uri":"Struck_a_Nerve","surface_form":"Struck a Nerve","offset":647}]}
