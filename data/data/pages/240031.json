{"id":240031,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanesville%2C_Ohio","text":"Zanesville is a city in and the county seat of Muskingum County, Ohio, United States. The population was 25,487 at the 2010 census.\nIt was founded by Ebenezer Zane. Zane had constructed Zane's Trace, a pioneer road through present-day Ohio. He settled in the area in 1797 with his son-in-law, John McIntire. They put the town at the point where Zane's Trace met the Muskingum River.\nFrom 1810-1812, the city was the second state capital of Ohio. The National Road runs through Zanesville as U.S. Route 40. Novelist Zane Grey, a descendant of the Zane family, was born in the city.\nThe city has two engineering landmarks: the Muskingum River Canal, designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark; and the Zanesville Y-Bridge, the only such structure in the United States still in use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":32},{"uri":"Muskingum_County%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Muskingum County","offset":47},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":65},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":71},{"uri":"United_States_Census_2010","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":119},{"uri":"Ebenezer_Zane","surface_form":"Ebenezer Zane","offset":150},{"uri":"Zane%27s_Trace","surface_form":"Zane's Trace","offset":186},{"uri":"John_McIntire_(pioneer)","surface_form":"John McIntire","offset":293},{"uri":"Muskingum_River","surface_form":"Muskingum River","offset":366},{"uri":"List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"state capital","offset":423},{"uri":"National_Road","surface_form":"National Road","offset":450},{"uri":"Novelist","surface_form":"Novelist","offset":506},{"uri":"Zane_Grey","surface_form":"Zane Grey","offset":515},{"uri":"National_Historic_Civil_Engineering_Landmark","surface_form":"National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark","offset":661},{"uri":"Zanesville_Y-Bridge","surface_form":"Zanesville Y-Bridge","offset":715},{"uri":"National_Register_of_Historic_Places","surface_form":"National Register of Historic Places","offset":812}]}
