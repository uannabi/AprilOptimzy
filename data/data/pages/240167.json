{"id":240167,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians","text":"Istrian Italians are one of the ethnic groups of Istria. The others are Croatians, Slovenians and Istrorumanians.\nHistory.\nThe Istrian Italians are the descendants of the romanized Illyrian population of Istria during the Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages they were under domination of many political states, like the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. But most of the time they were under the Republic of Venice, especially during the Renaissance.\nThe Istrian Italians enjoyed a huge cultural development in the centuries under Venice: Pola and Capodistria were important centers of art and culture during the Italian Renaissance. Personalities like Pier Paolo Vergerio (a famous \"Humanist\") and Santorius Santorio (a physician who discovered the medical thermometer) are renowned worldwide.\nIn the last two centuries, the Istrian Italians, who were the majority of the population of Istria under Napoleon, have been in continuous ethnic fighting with the Slavs of Istria. As a consequence, they have been reduced to a small minority, who have survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII.\nData.\nCurrently, there are nearly 50,000 Istrian Italians; a small minority of the Istria peninsula population. They are mainly divided between Croatia and Slovenia, but a few thousand still live in Italy (in the coastal city of Muggia near Trieste).\nIndeed, in various municipalities in actual Croatia and Slovenia, census data shows that there are still significant numbers of Italians living in Istria, such as 51% of the population of Gro\u017Enjan/Grisignana, 37% at Brtonigla/Verteneglio and nearly 30% in Buje/Buie.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Istria","surface_form":"Istria","offset":49},{"uri":"Croatians","surface_form":"Croatians","offset":72},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":83},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":222},{"uri":"Republic_of_Venice","surface_form":"Republic of Venice","offset":406},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":448},{"uri":"Venice","surface_form":"Venice","offset":541},{"uri":"Pula","surface_form":"Pola","offset":549},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":910},{"uri":"Istrian-Dalmatian_exodus","surface_form":"Istrian exodus","offset":1070},{"uri":"Foibe_massacres","surface_form":"Foibe massacres","offset":1093},{"uri":"WWII","surface_form":"WWII","offset":1126},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":1276},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":1288},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1331},{"uri":"Trieste","surface_form":"Trieste","offset":1373}]}
