{"id":24028,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people","text":"The Kurds are an ethnic group living in Turkey Iraq, Iran, Syria, Armenia and Lebanon. Kurds are an Indo-European people, like the peoples of Western and northwestern Iran, widely thought to be descended from the Medes. They speak Kurdish.\nKurds have similarly distinct features like those of southern Europe, however their looks vary from blondes to brunettes and although most have brown eyes they can have other colours. Their culture has survived for thousands of years despite efforts by their neighbours to demolish it: it remains a strong influence on their way of life. Today, there are thought to be about 40 million Kurds. Most are Sunnite Muslim.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":17},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":40},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":47},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":53},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":59},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":66},{"uri":"Lebanon","surface_form":"Lebanon","offset":78},{"uri":"Indo-European_people","surface_form":"Indo-European people","offset":100},{"uri":"Medes","surface_form":"Medes","offset":213},{"uri":"Kurdish_language","surface_form":"Kurdish","offset":231},{"uri":"Southern_Europe","surface_form":"southern Europe","offset":293},{"uri":"Blonde","surface_form":"blonde","offset":340},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":430},{"uri":"Sunni_Islam","surface_form":"Sunnite Muslim","offset":642}]}
