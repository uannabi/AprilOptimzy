When two or more armies (representing countries) attack each other, this is a war.\nGuerrilla warfare is a war tactic in which people () fight against an organized army. Guerrilla warfare is sometimes practiced in places where a regular army has difficulty, such as forests and mountains. Usually, this army is invading a territory.\nGuerrilla is a word of Spanish origin. It means \"little war\". It was first used in 1808, when Spain was invaded by Napoleon, resulting in the Peninsular War with Spanish guerilla forces resisting the French army.\nThis war tactic was used on the British by the Native Americans. The natives had an advantage because they used guerrilla warfare. This war tactic was also used on the Americans during the Vietnam War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":108},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":197},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":225},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":384},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":396},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":545},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":566},{"uri":"Peninsular_War","surface_form":"Peninsular War","offset":593},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":853}]}
