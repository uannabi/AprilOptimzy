{"id":240580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%2C_Texas","text":"Sherman is a city in northern Texas near Dallas and Oklahoma. It is the county seat of Grayson County.\nHistory.\nSherman was created in 1846 by the Texas legislature. The city got its name from General Sydney Sherman. He was a military hero during the Texas Revolution.\nThe city of Sherman had some human and environmental problems over the years. For example, a huge tornado happened in 1896. A race riot, which is a type of violent protest, happened in 1930 after a black man was accused of raping a white woman. People from the town burned the man in his jail cell and took his body into the streets. The people also burned down the black business district.\nHowever, Sherman continued to grow, especially when an Army Air Field for pilot training, Perrin Air Force Base, was built there in 1941. Perrin Field was closed in 1971.\nPresent.\nSherman is about 65 miles north of Dallas at the intersection of U.S. Highway 75 and U.S. Highway 82. It has a number of public schools and colleges. It even has its own symphony orchestra, which is not common for a city of its size. Manufacturing is a big part of the local economy. Also, several national companies have plants in Sherman. It is a good city for tourism and international students.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":30},{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":41},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":52},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":72},{"uri":"Grayson_County%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Grayson County","offset":87},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":153},{"uri":"Texas_Revolution","surface_form":"Texas Revolution","offset":251},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":367},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":734},{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":875},{"uri":"Intersection","surface_form":"intersection","offset":889},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":1019},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"Manufacturing","offset":1074}]}
