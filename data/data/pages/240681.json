The airport was opened in 1978 after it was decided in a few years earlier that Tenerife needed a new airport urgently due to foggy weather closing Tenerife North airport quite often. The first flight to land at the airport was carrying the Queen of Spain Her Majesty Queen Sofia, the airport is named after her. The airport is operated by a company called AENA which operates all civil airports in Spain.\nIn 2009, just over 7 million passengers used the airport.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tenerife","surface_form":"Tenerife","offset":109},{"uri":"Canary_Islands","surface_form":"Canary Islands","offset":130},{"uri":"Tenerife_North_Airport","surface_form":"Tenerife North","offset":213},{"uri":"Queen_Sofia","surface_form":"Queen Sofia","offset":589},{"uri":"Aeropuertos_Espa%C3%B1oles_y_Navegaci%C3%B3n_A%C3%A9rea","surface_form":"AENA","offset":678},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":720}]}
