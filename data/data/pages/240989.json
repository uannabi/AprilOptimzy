{"id":240989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel","text":"e=\"preserve\">Air travel is the process of going from place to place by any flying object, such as airplanes, helicopters, balloons, or anything that can fly.\nAir travel has been a very long dream of human beings from the ancient age. People seeing birds flying tried to take flight in many ways. At the end of the 18th century they made balloons, and at the beginning of the 20th they made machines that could fly. Air travel has made travel much faster. Today we can think of going around the world in 24 hours, which was never possible with any other type of transport.\nToday air travel is a normal way to travel, for pleasure, personal need or business.\nAir travel can be broadly put into two groups; domestic flights, and international flights. Air travel within a country are called domestic flights. Most countries have domestic airlines to provide this service. Air travel across the borders of countries are called international flights. Long distance air travel is mostly international.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":98},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":109},{"uri":"Balloon_(aircraft)","surface_form":"balloons","offset":122},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":835}]}
