{"id":241217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sublimation_printer","text":"A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a high quality computer printer that uses heat to make coloured images.\nThe ink is held on cellophane sheets that are the same size as the paper. A 6\" x 4\" printer would use 6\" x 4\" ink sheets. Each image uses 4 sheets - 3 ink sheets Cyan, Magenta and Yellow and a clear sheet.\nEach sheet of ink is printed one at a time. So making an image takes a long time.\nThe images are very high quality. They waste a lot of ink. This means that the prints are very expensive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"computer printer","offset":65},{"uri":"Cellophane","surface_form":"cellophane","offset":141},{"uri":"Cyan","surface_form":"Cyan","offset":284},{"uri":"Magenta","surface_form":"Magenta","offset":290},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"Yellow","offset":302}]}
