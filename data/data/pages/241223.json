{"id":241223,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer","text":"Kidney cancer is a form of cancer that begins in the kidneys. Common forms include Wilms tumor, which occurs in children, and renal cell carcinoma.\nTreatment.\nTreatment of renal cancer depends on the type of cancer. For renal cell carcinoma, removing the kidney, (Nephrectomy), is the best treatment when the cancer is localized. Removing a part of the kidney, (partial nephrectomy) may also be an option for some patients.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":27},{"uri":"Kidneys","surface_form":"kidneys","offset":53},{"uri":"Wilms_tumor","surface_form":"Wilms tumor","offset":83},{"uri":"Renal_cell_carcinoma","surface_form":"renal cell carcinoma","offset":126},{"uri":"Renal_cell_carcinoma","surface_form":"renal cell carcinoma","offset":220},{"uri":"Nephrectomy","surface_form":"Nephrectomy","offset":264}]}
