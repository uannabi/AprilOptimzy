{"id":241257,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilms_tumor","text":"Wilms' tumor, also known as Nephroblastoma, is a form of kidney cancer that occurs most often in children. It has an excellent prognosis, with 90% of patients living for more than five years after being diagnosed.\nTreatment.\nIn general, Wilms' tumor is curable. If the tumor is only in the kidney, it can be removed along with the whole kidney. This procedure is called a nephrectomy. During the operation, the surgeon checks if the other kidney has a tumor. If there are tumors in both kidneys, a piece of the tumor will be removed. After the surgery, the child is given some chemotherapy drugs like Dactinomycin. This drug is also known by its trade name Cosmegen.\nBoth operation and chemotherapy is sometimes used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kidney_cancer","surface_form":"kidney cancer","offset":57},{"uri":"Prognosis","surface_form":"prognosis","offset":127},{"uri":"Nephrectomy","surface_form":"nephrectomy","offset":372},{"uri":"Dactinomycin","surface_form":"Dactinomycin","offset":601},{"uri":"Trade_name","surface_form":"trade name","offset":646},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":686}]}
