{"id":24154,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation","text":"Navigation is the methods used to learn where someone is and how to go to another place. Since this is easy when landmarks are visible, the word is often limited to the methods ships or aircraft use. The word \"navigation\" was invented in the 15th century from the Latin word \"navis\" which means \"ship\" and is found in other Indo-European languages. Navigation is literally \"art of ship mastery\" but is also used for 'finding one's way'. The Global Positioning System is the main tool for it.\nSimple navigation.\nAn example of people who used the stars were the Vikings. They knew that the star called Polaris (the North Star) does not change location and points to the north. They would then know the latitude (distance from the equator), by measuring the angle between Polaris and the horizon. They also used animals, especially birds, to know if land was nearby. They also knew that specific kind of clouds form near land and that waves are different near land than at high seas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landmarks","surface_form":"landmarks","offset":113},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":177},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":186},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":264},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":296},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European languages","offset":324},{"uri":"Global_Positioning_System","surface_form":"Global Positioning System","offset":441},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":560},{"uri":"Polaris","surface_form":"Polaris","offset":600},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":700}]}
