{"id":241602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad","text":"Cycads are seed plants whose fossils are first found in the early Permian period.\nThey were very common in the Mesozoic era, the age of the dinosaurs, and are still living, but are now much less common. Only 9 genera (about 100 species) of cycads are found to be extant nowadays. Cycads are thought to have evolved from order Pteridospermae (seed ferns) of angiosperms, now totally extinct.\nThey are different from most plants because they have large crowns of compound leaves and a stout trunk. They are evergreen, dioecious plants having large pinnately compound leaves.\nThey are frequently confused with and mistaken for palms or ferns, but are only distantly related to both, and instead belong to the division Cycadophyta.\nCycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded). Their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination. This contrasts with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds and more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle.\nThey have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with various cyanobacteria living in the roots (the \"coralloid\" roots).\nThese photosynthetic cyanobacteria produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a human food chain if the cycad seeds are eaten, and may cause some neurological diseases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seed_plant","surface_form":"seed plant","offset":11},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":29},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":66},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":111},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":120},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":140},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":210},{"uri":"Extant","surface_form":"extant","offset":263},{"uri":"Pteridospermae","surface_form":"Pteridospermae","offset":326},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":382},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":470},{"uri":"Trunk_(botany)","surface_form":"trunk","offset":489},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":505},{"uri":"Dioecious","surface_form":"dioecious","offset":516},{"uri":"Arecaceae","surface_form":"palms","offset":624},{"uri":"Fern","surface_form":"fern","offset":633},{"uri":"Division_(biology)","surface_form":"division","offset":706},{"uri":"Gymnosperms","surface_form":"gymnosperms","offset":739},{"uri":"Fertilization","surface_form":"unfertilized","offset":773},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"pollination","offset":841},{"uri":"Angiosperms","surface_form":"angiosperms","offset":874},{"uri":"Pollinator","surface_form":"pollinator","offset":987},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":1030},{"uri":"Nitrogen_fixation","surface_form":"fix nitrogen","offset":1065},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"cyanobacteria","offset":1106},{"uri":"Neurotoxin","surface_form":"neurotoxin","offset":1210},{"uri":"BMAA","surface_form":"BMAA","offset":1228},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":1254},{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurological","offset":1365}]}
