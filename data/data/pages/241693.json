{"id":241693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MICR","text":"=\"preserve\">The MICR is a device that can recognise human readable characters printed on documents such as cheques using a special magnetic ink. The reader reads these characters by examining their shapes. Characters are printed in a special font. Each character is formed by a 7 x 10 matrix. The MICR has a magnetic head which can detect the magnetic pattern for each character.\nThe abbreviation MICR stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. This is a type of data input often found in banks. The bank account number and other details are printed onto bank cheques (USA - checks)in a special font with magnetic ink.\nThe magnetic characters can be read very quickly and accurately by MICR readers.\nNumbers in a special MICR font","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_hardware","surface_form":"device","offset":26},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"character","offset":67},{"uri":"Cheque","surface_form":"cheque","offset":107},{"uri":"Magnetic_ink","surface_form":"magnetic ink","offset":131},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":242},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"bank","offset":493},{"uri":"Cheque","surface_form":"cheque","offset":564},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":599}]}
