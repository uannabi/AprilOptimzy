{"id":241718,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis","text":"=\"preserve\">Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder that can affect multiple organs. The lungs are affected most often. The cause is not known. Corticosteroids such as prednisone are often used to treat sarcoidosis. In some cases, the immuosuppressive drug methotrexate may be also used. Antimalarial drugs have also been used.\nSarcoidosis may involve the brain. If it does, it is called neurosarcoidosis. In some cases, pulmonary fibrosis is a complication of sarcoidosis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lungs","surface_form":"lungs","offset":89},{"uri":"Corticosteroids","surface_form":"Corticosteroids","offset":144},{"uri":"Prednisone","surface_form":"prednisone","offset":168},{"uri":"Methotrexate","surface_form":"methotrexate","offset":257},{"uri":"Neurosarcoidosis","surface_form":"neurosarcoidosis","offset":388},{"uri":"Pulmonary_fibrosis","surface_form":"pulmonary fibrosis","offset":421}]}
