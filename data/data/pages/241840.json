He saw soldiers eating chocolate pellets with hard chocolate shells. He decided to make his own chocolate candies. He got the patent for these on March 3, 1941.\nThe name M&M comes from the founders name Forrest E. Mars Sr. The other M comes from the name of the president of the Hershey Company, William F. R. Murrie. The Mars Company started printing the white M on the candy in 1950.\nIn 1954 the world famous M&M characters made their first television appearance.
