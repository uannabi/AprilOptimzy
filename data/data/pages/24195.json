{"id":24195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet","text":"A trumpet is a brass instrument used mainly in Classical music and jazz music. The most common type of trumpet is a B\u266D trumpet, meaning that if the player plays a C, it will sound like a B\u266D in concert pitch. The trumpet is played by blowing into the mouthpiece and making a \"buzzing\" sound. There are three keys called valves that the player can press to change the pitch.\nHistory.\nThe trumpet has been around for about 3000 years. An early example of a brass instrument like a trumpet is called a shofar, which is still used in religious ceremonies. Eventually people started making trumpet-like instruments with wood (for example, the cornetto), and later, with brass. Modern bugle<nowiki/>s are similar to early metal trumpets.\nMany years ago, when the use of instrumental music was growing, trumpets became very important. Trumpets were long and without valves. This meant a player had to control the pitch of the sound with only his mouth, which was very difficult. Everyone respected trumpet players because trumpets were just so difficult to play.\nThe chromatic trumpet was developed in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, good valves made it easier to play notes on the trumpet. Still, trumpet is a difficult instrument to master.\nMusic for trumpet.\nClassical music is written for solo trumpet, and trumpets are included in orchestras. Trumpets play an important part in Jazz music, and other various popular genres. Sometimes, they also play short parts to emphasize sections in rock songs.\nTrumpet players.\nSome famous classical trumpet players are Adolph Herseth, Sergei Nakariakov and Maurice Andre.\nSome famous jazz trumpet players are Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Arturo Sandoval, Wynton Marsalis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Maynard Ferguson.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["instrument"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brass_instrument","surface_form":"brass instrument","offset":15},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":57},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":67},{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"concert pitch","offset":193},{"uri":"Mouthpiece_(brass)","surface_form":"mouthpiece","offset":250},{"uri":"Pitch","surface_form":"pitch","offset":366},{"uri":"Bugle","surface_form":"bugle","offset":678},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"Jazz","offset":1387},{"uri":"Adolph_Herseth","surface_form":"Adolph Herseth","offset":1567},{"uri":"Sergei_Nakariakov","surface_form":"Sergei Nakariakov","offset":1583},{"uri":"Maurice_Andre","surface_form":"Maurice Andre","offset":1605},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":1632},{"uri":"Miles_Davis","surface_form":"Miles Davis","offset":1657},{"uri":"Louis_Armstrong","surface_form":"Louis Armstrong","offset":1670},{"uri":"Arturo_Sandoval","surface_form":"Arturo Sandoval","offset":1687},{"uri":"Wynton_Marsalis","surface_form":"Wynton Marsalis","offset":1704},{"uri":"Dizzy_Gillespie","surface_form":"Dizzy Gillespie","offset":1721},{"uri":"Maynard_Ferguson","surface_form":"Maynard Ferguson","offset":1742}]}
