{"id":241979,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janeite","text":"The word Janeite has been used by people who love the works of Jane Austen. However, it can also be used to show disapproval. Claudia Johnson says that \"Janeitism\" is \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm (love) for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her (about her)\".\nJaneitism did not begin until after J. E. Austen-Leigh published \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1870. When this was published, Jane Austen became much more popular. This worried the literary elite. They felt they had to separate their liking of Austen from the \"masses\". The word \"Janeite\" was first begun by the literary scholar George Saintsbury in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of \"Pride and Prejudice\". Austen scholar Deidre Lynch explains, \"he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly (triumphantly, happily) pin\". In the early twentieth century, Janeitism was \"principally (mostly) a male enthusiasm shared among publishers, professors, and literati\". Rudyard Kipling even printed a short story called \"Janeites\" about a group of World War I soldiers who were fans of Austen's novels.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s,Austen's works were accepted at school, and the word began to change its meaning. It began to mean the people who liked Austen in the \"wrong\" way. The word, according to Lynch, is now \" and against \"other\" people\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jane_Austen","surface_form":"Jane Austen","offset":63},{"uri":"Idol","surface_form":"idol","offset":189},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literary","offset":456},{"uri":"Elite","surface_form":"elite","offset":465},{"uri":"George_Saintsbury","surface_form":"George Saintsbury","offset":604},{"uri":"Pride_and_Prejudice","surface_form":"Pride and Prejudice","offset":668},{"uri":"Rudyard_Kipling","surface_form":"Rudyard Kipling","offset":965},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short story","offset":996},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1043},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":1055},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":1073}]}
