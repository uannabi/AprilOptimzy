Animals that belong to the family Canidae are called canids. The family Canidae is divided into two tribes: Vulpini (\"true foxes\"), and Canini (\"true dogs\").\nCanids of the tribe Vulpini (foxes) are called \"vulpines\". Canids of the tribe Canini (wolves, dogs, coyotes and others) are called \"canines\". Some people call all these canids \"canines\", but this is wrong.\nExamples of canids are dogs, wolves, foxes, coyotes, and jackals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":13},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":23},{"uri":"Omnivore","surface_form":"omnivorous","offset":39},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":50},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":65},{"uri":"Carnivora","surface_form":"Carnivora","offset":71},{"uri":"Vulpini","surface_form":"Vulpini","offset":190},{"uri":"Canini","surface_form":"Canini","offset":218},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":470},{"uri":"Wolf","surface_form":"wolves","offset":476},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":484},{"uri":"Coyote","surface_form":"coyote","offset":491},{"uri":"Jackal","surface_form":"jackal","offset":504}]}
