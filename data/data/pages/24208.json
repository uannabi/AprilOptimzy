{"id":24208,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox","text":"A fox is a small mammalian carnivore. They hunt and eat live prey, mostly rabbits and rodents (squirrels and mice). They may also eat grasshoppers, birds' eggs, and even fruit and berries. Sometimes they eat carrion. Foxes are the smallest members of the dog family Canidae.\nTwelve species belong to the \"Vulpes\" genus of monophyletic \"true foxes\". There are about another 25 living or extinct species which are sometimes called foxes.\nThe fox has pointed ears, narrow snout, and a bushy tail.\nFoxes are swift and agile runners which live in family groups. A female fox is called a \"vixen\", and a male is called a \"dog\". Foxes' tails are multi-purpose organs. Their bushy tail helps them keep warm while they are sleeping in cold weather. It is also part of the animal's food store for wintertime. Foxes' plump, bushy tail is easily seen, and is used for sending signals to its family members. The tail is also used for balance while running.\nFoxes are found on all continents (except Antarctica), mostly living in forest, shrubland, and desert regions. They were not native to Australia, but were introduced in some way. The most common fox species is the red fox. In the United Kingdom, it was a common sport for people to hunt foxes with horses and dogs. This is now banned.\nTrue foxes.\nThe informal term 'true fox' refers to members of the \"Vulpes\" genus.\nThe arctic fox is included in this genus as \"Vulpes lagopus\". There is genetic evidence that shows it is probably a true fox.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":17},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":27},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":61},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":74},{"uri":"Rodents","surface_form":"rodents","offset":86},{"uri":"Grasshoppers","surface_form":"grasshoppers","offset":134},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":148},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":155},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":170},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":180},{"uri":"Carrion","surface_form":"carrion","offset":208},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":255},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":259},{"uri":"Canidae","surface_form":"Canidae","offset":266},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":282},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":313},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":322},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":386},{"uri":"Balance","surface_form":"balance","offset":920},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":985},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1015},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":1023},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1038},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1078},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1173},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunt","offset":1225},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":1241},{"uri":"Banned","surface_form":"banned","offset":1270},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":1353},{"uri":"Arctic_fox","surface_form":"arctic fox","offset":1364},{"uri":"Genetic","surface_form":"genetic","offset":1431},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":1439}]}
