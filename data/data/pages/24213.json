{"id":24213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_pyramid","text":"A food pyramid is a chart that can be used to see how many servings of each food should be eaten each day. It is for having good health.\nGrains give carbohydrates and some vitamins and minerals. Vegetables and fruits give a lot of vitamins, some minerals, and few fats, but fruits often have more calories and sugar. Dairy products (like milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.) have protein, some fat, and a lot of calcium, an element that helps build strong bones. Meat have protein, some fat, and B vitamins. Fats, oils, and sweets give calories, fats, and sugars but not a lot of nutrition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":7},{"uri":"Chart","surface_form":"chart","offset":20},{"uri":"Serving","surface_form":"serving","offset":59},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":76},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":129},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"Grain","offset":137},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":149},{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":172},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":185},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":264},{"uri":"Calorie","surface_form":"calorie","offset":297},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":310},{"uri":"Dairy","surface_form":"Dairy","offset":317},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":338},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":344},{"uri":"Yogurt","surface_form":"yogurt","offset":352},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":371},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":403},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"element","offset":415},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":447},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"Meat","offset":454},{"uri":"B_vitamins","surface_form":"B vitamins","offset":487},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":505},{"uri":"Nutrition","surface_form":"nutrition","offset":571}]}
