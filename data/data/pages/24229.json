{"id":24229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole","text":"A vole is a small mouse-like mammal. It is a rodent from a subfamily called the Arvicolinae. They live in woodlands and grasslands.\nThere are about 155 species of voles. There are species in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The closest relatives of voles are the lemmings and muskrats, which are in the same subfamily.\nAdult voles, depending on the species, are 7.5 to 17.5 centimetres (three to seven inches) long. They eat seeds, grass or other plants, and insects.\nMany animals hunt voles, for example owls, hawks, coyotes, foxes, weasels, cats and snakes.\nThe average life of the smaller vole species is three to six months. These voles rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the European water vole \"Arvicola\", live longer. They usually die during their second winter. As many as 88% of voles die during the first month of life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":18},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":29},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":45},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"subfamily","offset":59},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":106},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":120},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":152},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":191},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":199},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":211},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":222},{"uri":"Lemmings","surface_form":"lemmings","offset":276},{"uri":"Muskrat","surface_form":"muskrat","offset":289},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"centimetre","offset":387},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":415},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":438},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":445},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":460},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":472},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":486},{"uri":"Owl","surface_form":"owl","offset":518},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawk","offset":524},{"uri":"Coyote","surface_form":"coyote","offset":531},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":540},{"uri":"Weasel","surface_form":"weasel","offset":547},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":556},{"uri":"Snakes","surface_form":"snakes","offset":565},{"uri":"European_water_vole","surface_form":"European water vole","offset":717}]}
