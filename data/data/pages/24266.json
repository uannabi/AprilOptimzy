{"id":24266,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format","text":"=\"preserve\">A Computer number format is the way that computers and calculators represent numbers. Most computers use a system of binary which is composed of ones and zeros.\nOther systems in use are the octal (0,1-7) or the hexadecimal (0,1-9,A,B,C,D,E,F) systems.\nSo we can use codes, which the computer understands only, as well as other number systems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":53},{"uri":"Calculator","surface_form":"calculator","offset":67},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":129},{"uri":"Octal_numeral_system","surface_form":"octal","offset":202},{"uri":"Hexadecimal_numeral_system","surface_form":"hexadecimal","offset":223}]}
