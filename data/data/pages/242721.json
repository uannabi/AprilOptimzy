{"id":242721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Athletic_Conference","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) is a college athletic conference based in Birmingham, Alabama. It is made up of historically black universities in the Southern United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I for all sports. In football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).\nThe SWAC is one of two conferences (the other being the Ivy League) which do not take part in postseason play in the FCS football tournament. It is the only one of the two whose members offer a full range of scholarships for football. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game. Furthermore, one SWAC game, the Bayou Classic between Southern and Grambling State, is positioned on the schedule after the NCAA tournament has begun. In addition, Alabama State plays Division II rival Tuskegee annually on Thanksgiving Day (The Turkey Day Classic).\nHistory.\nIn 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs \u2013 C.H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C.H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E.G. Evans, H.J. Evans and H.J. Starns of Prairie View A&M, D.C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley College \u2013 met in Houston, Texas, to discuss common interests. At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.\nPaul Quinn became the first of the original members to leave the league when it did so in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was allowed into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the league in 1934. Arkansas AM&N entered in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954.\nAs the state-supported schools became bigger, it became difficult for the church-supported schools to pay for their sports teams. Soon the church-supported schools started to leave the conference. Bishop withdrew from the conference in 1956, Langston in 1957 and Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) in 1959. That happened one year after two more state-supported schools entered the league (Grambling College and Jackson State College). The enter-exit cycle continued in 1961 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the entrance of Alcorn A&M in 1962. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas-Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&M University became the conference\u2019s tenth member when it became a full member in September, 1999 after a one year period as an affiliate SWAC member.\nCurrent championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field and tennis. Women\u2019s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.\nMembership.\nThere are currently 10 members in the SWAC.\nFootball.\nAll games at were played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_college_athletic_conferences","surface_form":"college athletic conference","offset":63},{"uri":"Birmingham%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Birmingham, Alabama","offset":100},{"uri":"Historically_black_colleges_and_universities","surface_form":"historically black universities","offset":138},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"Southern United States","offset":177},{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":224},{"uri":"Division_I_(NCAA)","surface_form":"Division I","offset":231},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":261},{"uri":"Football_Championship_Subdivision","surface_form":"Football Championship Subdivision","offset":294},{"uri":"Ivy_League","surface_form":"Ivy League","offset":391},{"uri":"Bayou_Classic","surface_form":"Bayou Classic","offset":700},{"uri":"NCAA_Division_II","surface_form":"Division II","offset":852},{"uri":"Tuskegee_University","surface_form":"Tuskegee","offset":870},{"uri":"Turkey_Day_Classic","surface_form":"Turkey Day Classic","offset":913},{"uri":"Bishop_College","surface_form":"Bishop College","offset":1009},{"uri":"Paul_Quinn_College","surface_form":"Paul Quinn College","offset":1060},{"uri":"Prairie_View_A%26amp%3BM","surface_form":"Prairie View A&M","offset":1122},{"uri":"Texas_College","surface_form":"Texas College","offset":1155},{"uri":"Wiley_College","surface_form":"Wiley College","offset":1193},{"uri":"Houston%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Houston, Texas","offset":1216},{"uri":"Langston_University","surface_form":"Langston University","offset":1423},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":1446},{"uri":"Southern_University","surface_form":"Southern University","offset":1574},{"uri":"University_of_Arkansas_at_Pine_Bluff","surface_form":"Arkansas AM&N","offset":1622},{"uri":"Texas_Southern_University","surface_form":"Texas Southern University","offset":1656},{"uri":"Bishop_College","surface_form":"Bishop","offset":1888},{"uri":"Huston-Tillotson_University","surface_form":"Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston)","offset":1954},{"uri":"Grambling_College","surface_form":"Grambling College","offset":2087},{"uri":"Jackson_State_College","surface_form":"Jackson State College","offset":2109},{"uri":"Texas_College","surface_form":"Texas College","offset":2177},{"uri":"Alcorn_A%26amp%3BM","surface_form":"Alcorn A&M","offset":2229},{"uri":"Mississippi_Valley_State_College","surface_form":"Mississippi Valley State College","offset":2283},{"uri":"Alabama_State_University","surface_form":"Alabama State University","offset":2358},{"uri":"Alabama_A%26amp%3BM_University","surface_form":"Alabama A&M University","offset":2525},{"uri":"Legion_Field","surface_form":"Legion Field","offset":3134},{"uri":"Birmingham%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Birmingham, Alabama","offset":3150}]}
