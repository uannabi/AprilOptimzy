It is called Parliament Hill because it is on a hill above the Ottawa River.\nThere are three main buildings: the West Block, the East Block and the Centre Block.\nA fire in 1916 burned the Centre Block and only the library was saved. The building was rebuilt and the Peace Tower was finished in 1927.\nThe roof of each building is made of copper which turns green over time.\nThere are many statues around Parliament Hill including many former Prime Ministers and 5 famous women who helped women gain equal rights in Canada. There is also a centennial flame that was lit when Canada turned 100 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"buildings","offset":40},{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":53},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":61},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":74},{"uri":"Canada_Dry","surface_form":"Canada","offset":93},{"uri":"Government_of_Canada","surface_form":"Government of Canada","offset":111},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Members of Parliament","offset":142},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"laws","offset":169},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":223},{"uri":"Ottawa_River","surface_form":"Ottawa River","offset":238},{"uri":"1916","surface_form":"1916","offset":347},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"library","offset":389},{"uri":"1927","surface_form":"1927","offset":469},{"uri":"Roof","surface_form":"roof","offset":479},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":512},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":531},{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statues","offset":563},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Prime Ministers","offset":616},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"women","offset":645},{"uri":"Women%27s_rights","surface_form":"gain equal rights","offset":668},{"uri":"Flame","surface_form":"flame","offset":724},{"uri":"Centenary","surface_form":"100 years old","offset":762}]}
