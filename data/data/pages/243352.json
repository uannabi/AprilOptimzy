{"id":243352,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desso_GrassMaster","text":"e=\"preserve\">Desso GrassMaster is a sports playing field surface made of natural grass that has artificial fibres added to it. The unique part of this system is the artificial grass fibres, stuck 20\u00A0cm deep, which cover 3% of the surface. During the growing process, the roots of the natural grass mix with the man-made grass fibres to anchor the turf to product a stable, solid, and even field with better drainage and better playing comfort.\nReinforced natural grass is used for stadium pitches and training pitches used for soccer, rugby, American football and baseball. Reinforced natural grass can also be used for events and concerts. The artificial turf injection shortens the recovery time for the grass. Reinforced Natural Grass (also known as Hybrid Grass), as the name suggest, is formed by the mixture of natural and artificial fibres. It was in the year 1990, when the first generation of Reinforced Natural Grass developed. Using turf, made up of synthetic fibres, combined with Natural Grass has become extremely popular in recent times. In this case, the artificial fibres are intertwined with natural grass roots as they grow. The synthetic fibers help to stabilize and protect the natural grass, improving growth of natural grass fields.\nIn 2010, for the first time in history, a FIFA World CupTM was played on grass pitches that were partly made up of artificial grass in the Mbombela Stadium and the Peter Mokaba Stadium.\n__TOC__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Playing_field","surface_form":"playing field","offset":43},{"uri":"Artificial","surface_form":"artificial","offset":96},{"uri":"Fibres","surface_form":"fibres","offset":107},{"uri":"Unique","surface_form":"unique","offset":131},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":1298},{"uri":"Mbombela_Stadium","surface_form":"Mbombela Stadium","offset":1395},{"uri":"Peter_Mokaba_Stadium","surface_form":"Peter Mokaba Stadium","offset":1420}]}
