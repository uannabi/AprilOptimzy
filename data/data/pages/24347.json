{"id":24347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammability","text":"Flammability or inflammability means that something can be set on fire easily. It will burn easily. The words come from Latin. The word at the base is \"in-flammare\" (late Latin). It means something like \"to put fire to a thing\".\n\"Inflammable\" and \"flammable\" are used to mean the same thing. People sometimes get confused and think that \"inflammable\" means \"not flammable\" because the prefix \"in\" is often used to mean \"not\". For example, something that is inhuman is not human. Since many people do not know that \"inflammable\" means \"burns easily\", \"flammable\" is used more often in public places as a warning.\nFlammability can be tested. Paper, for example, is more flammable than wood, and less flammable natural gas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":66},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":120},{"uri":"Prefix","surface_form":"prefix","offset":385},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":708}]}
