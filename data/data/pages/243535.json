{"id":243535,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 5000 metres (about 3.1\u00A0mi or 16,404\u00A0ft) is a popular running distance. It is also known as a 5K or 5\u00A0km. Colloquially it is called a \"five-K\". It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics. \"5000 metres\" refers to racing on a track. \"5K\" usually refers to a roadrace or cross country event. While mainly run as an outdoor event, the 5000\u00A0m is sometimes run on an indoor track. Official records are kept for both outdoor and indoor 5000\u00A0m track events, but not for 5\u00A0km road races.\nMuch of the distance's popularity is due to the challenge it gives to both amateurs and professionals. It is a distance race that demands a great deal of endurance as well as speed. Strategies also play a key role, and the combination makes it attractive to many.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Running","surface_form":"running","offset":70},{"uri":"Colloquial","surface_form":"Colloquial","offset":122},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":197},{"uri":"World_Championships_in_Athletics","surface_form":"World Championships in Athletics","offset":219},{"uri":"Cross_country","surface_form":"cross country","offset":333},{"uri":"Amateurs","surface_form":"amateurs","offset":619},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":632}]}
