{"id":24358,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail","text":"A cocktail is a kind of mixed drink. Usually, it is made with alcoholic drinks such as vodka, gin or rum. Since such spirits do not have much taste of their own (at around 40% alcohol), other ingredients are added. Common ingredients are fruits, fruit juice, sugar, crushed ice, and ice cubes. If the cocktail is served in a bar or nightclub, it often comes with a piece of fruit on top. For example, a gin and tonic could have a lemon, a Pi\u00F1a Colada could have a pineapple and a cherry. A popular cocktail in Cornwall UK is the McVey, 440ml of strongbow and 125ml of Malibu.\nMost cocktails were invented in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. People began drinking a lot of cocktails in the United States in the 1920s due to Prohibition. Around that time, cocktails from Cuba, such as the mojito, became popular around the world.\nCocktails made without alcohol are also made.\nBecause all the ingredients give their flavor to the finished drink, a cocktail is only as good as the worst ingredient.\nCommon cocktails.\nThere is a group called the IBA that determines what common cocktails are, and how they should be made","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":30},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":62},{"uri":"Vodka","surface_form":"vodka","offset":87},{"uri":"Gin","surface_form":"gin","offset":94},{"uri":"Rum","surface_form":"rum","offset":101},{"uri":"Ingredient","surface_form":"ingredient","offset":192},{"uri":"Ice_cube","surface_form":"ice cube","offset":283},{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"bar","offset":325},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":332},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":430},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":464},{"uri":"Cherry","surface_form":"cherry","offset":480},{"uri":"Prohibition_Era","surface_form":"Prohibition","offset":729}]}
