The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on 19 November, at 11:50PM. It was a heavily edited version with about 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The movie was first shown to go along with Oasis' compilation album \"Stop the Clocks\", released on 20 November 2006. A preview of the movie was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005.\nThe movie features a new Oasis song also called \"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions. Gallagher described it as being \"one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!\". He has also said that his girlfriend thought it was the only Oasis song you could dance to. The song was left off \"Don't Believe the Truth\" because Gallagher felt that including it would have meant he'd have been singing too many songs on the record. Italian footballer Alessandro Del Piero also appears in the video signing a shirt for Noel.\nDVD Release.\nThis concert has also been shown regularly on the HD music television channel, \"Rave.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rockumentary","surface_form":"rockumentary","offset":31},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":68},{"uri":"Oasis_(band)","surface_form":"Oasis","offset":81},{"uri":"Don%27t_Believe_the_Truth","surface_form":"Don't Believe the Truth","offset":89},{"uri":"Direct","surface_form":"direct","offset":188},{"uri":"Premiere","surface_form":"premiere","offset":337},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":393},{"uri":"Channel_4","surface_form":"Channel 4","offset":494},{"uri":"Version","surface_form":"version","offset":556},{"uri":"Greatest_hits","surface_form":"compilation","offset":677},{"uri":"Stop_the_Clocks","surface_form":"Stop the Clocks","offset":696},{"uri":"Let_There_Be_Love_(2005_song)","surface_form":"Let There Be Love","offset":787},{"uri":"Lord_Don%27t_Slow_Me_Down_(song)","surface_form":"Lord Don't Slow Me Down","offset":893},{"uri":"Noel_Gallagher","surface_form":"Noel Gallagher","offset":930},{"uri":"Don%27t_Believe_the_Truth","surface_form":"Don't Believe the Truth","offset":969},{"uri":"The_Who","surface_form":"The Who","offset":1065},{"uri":"The_Yardbirds","surface_form":"The Yardbirds","offset":1074},{"uri":"The_Jeff_Beck_Group","surface_form":"the Jeff Beck Group","offset":1092},{"uri":"Alessandro_Del_Piero","surface_form":"Alessandro Del Piero","offset":1429},{"uri":"Rave_HD","surface_form":"Rave","offset":1595}]}
