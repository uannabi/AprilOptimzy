{"id":24374,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Star_Computers","text":"e=\"preserve\">North Star Computers was one of the earliest manufacturers of microcomputers. Before they started making their first computer, the \"North Star Horizon\", they made floppy disk drives for S-100 bus computers. They included a disk operating system called \"North Star DOS\" (or \"N*DOS\"). The Horizon used the North Star disk controller and operating system. It was one of the first microcomputers that had multi-user features.\nTheir second computer, called the \"North Star Advantage\", ran M, and had the keyboard and monitor built-in. The graphics were very powerful for their time. When the IBM PC came out, North Star made an MS-DOS compatible processor card that could be added to the \"Advantage\".\nTheir third computer, the \"North Star Dimension\", was multi-user like the \"Horizon\", but MS-DOS based.\nBecause their products in the early 1980s were only MS-DOS compatible, not fully PC compatible, they never sold very many, and the company went out of business.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microcomputer","surface_form":"microcomputer","offset":75},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":130},{"uri":"Floppy_disk","surface_form":"floppy disk","offset":176},{"uri":"S-100_bus","surface_form":"S-100 bus","offset":199},{"uri":"Disk_operating_system","surface_form":"disk operating system","offset":236},{"uri":"Multi-user","surface_form":"multi-user","offset":414},{"uri":"M","surface_form":"M","offset":497},{"uri":"IBM_PC","surface_form":"IBM PC","offset":600},{"uri":"MS-DOS","surface_form":"MS-DOS","offset":636},{"uri":"MS-DOS","surface_form":"MS-DOS","offset":798},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":848},{"uri":"MS-DOS","surface_form":"MS-DOS","offset":864},{"uri":"PC_compatible","surface_form":"PC compatible","offset":893}]}
