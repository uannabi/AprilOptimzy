{"id":24418,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_cat","text":"The Manx is a breed of domestic cat. It either has no tail at all, a \"rumpy\", or it has a very short tail, a \"stumpy\". This is because of a natural difference in spine length. The back legs are also longer than the front legs. The breed comes from the Isle of Man, where it was found as early as three hundred years ago.\nThe Manx's character is nervous. The Manx's appearance is round on the whole. They are skilled hunters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":14},{"uri":"Domestic_cat","surface_form":"domestic cat","offset":23},{"uri":"Natural","surface_form":"natural","offset":140},{"uri":"Spine","surface_form":"spine","offset":162},{"uri":"Isle_of_Man","surface_form":"Isle of Man","offset":252},{"uri":"Character_(persona)","surface_form":"character","offset":332},{"uri":"Appearance","surface_form":"appearance","offset":365}]}
