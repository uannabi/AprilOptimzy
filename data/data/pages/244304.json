{"id":244304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem","text":"=\"preserve\">The subset sum problem is an important problem of computer science. It can be stated as follows: Given a set of integers, does any subset of them sum to zero? For example, given the set, the answer is \"yes\" because the subset sums to zero. The problem is NP-Complete. It can be reformulated to the 3SAT.\nAn alternative statement of this problem is, given a set of numbers and an integer x determine whether or not there exist a subset that sums up to x.\nEg. given a set and x = 10 the answer is \"yes\" because sums to 10.\nRemember that the subsequence need not to be contiguous. For instance if x = 8 in above example the answer is still yes because sums to 8.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":62},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":117},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":124},{"uri":"NP-Complete","surface_form":"NP-Complete","offset":267},{"uri":"Boolean_satisfiability_problem","surface_form":"3SAT","offset":310}]}
