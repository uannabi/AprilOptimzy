He is known for creating the Richter scale of magnitude, which says how big an earthquake is.\nChildhood.\nRichter went to work at the\u00A0Carnegie Institute\u00A0in 1927 after\u00A0Robert Millikan\u00A0offered him a position as a\u00A0research assistant\u00A0there,\u00A0where he began a collaboration with Beno Gutenberg. The\u00A0Seismology Lab\u00A0at the\u00A0California Institute of Technology\u00A0wanted to begin publishing regular reports on earthquakes in southern California and had a pressing need for a system of measuring the strength of earthquakes for these reports. Together, Richter and Gutenberg devised the scale that would become known at the Richter scale to fill this need, based on measuring quantitatively the\u00A0displacement\u00A0of the earth by\u00A0seismic waves, as\u00A0Kiyoo Wadati\u00A0had suggested.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"April_26","surface_form":"April 26","offset":25},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":35},{"uri":"September_30","surface_form":"September 30","offset":42},{"uri":"1985","surface_form":"1985","offset":56},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":69},{"uri":"Seismologist","surface_form":"seismologist","offset":78},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":112},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":131},{"uri":"Richter_scale","surface_form":"Richter scale","offset":171},{"uri":"Carnegie_Institution_for_Science","surface_form":"Carnegie Institute","offset":275},{"uri":"Robert_Millikan","surface_form":"Robert Millikan","offset":308},{"uri":"Research_assistant","surface_form":"research assistant","offset":352},{"uri":"Caltech_Seismological_Laboratory","surface_form":"Seismology Lab","offset":434},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"California Institute of Technology","offset":456},{"uri":"Displacement_(vector)","surface_form":"displacement","offset":821},{"uri":"Seismic_waves","surface_form":"seismic waves","offset":850},{"uri":"Kiyoo_Wadati","surface_form":"Kiyoo Wadati","offset":868}]}
