In 1842 his father brought home a \"great piece of news\". Young John Lubbock thought it might be a new pony, and was disappointed that the news was that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village. He was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin's younger friends.\nLubbock was educated at Eton College from 1845 and afterwards was taken into his father's bank, where he became a partner at the age of twenty-two. In 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy.\nIn 1870, 1874, and 1880 he was elected to Parliament, where he promoted a number of laws. Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers in 1879; in 1881 he was president of the British Association, and from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnean Society of London. In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the [http://www.bbfund.org.uk Bankers Benevolent Fund] \u2013 a charity for bank employees, past and present and their dependants. In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society, later to become the Electoral Reform Society.\nLubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dublin and W\u00FCrzburg; and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council.\nIn February 1890 he was appointed a Privy Councillor, and was chairman of the committee of design on the new coinage in 1891. In January 1900 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury, his title commemorating the largest Neolithic site in Europe.\nLubbock in biology and archaeology.\nIn 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the 19th Century, \"Pre-historic times, as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern savages\". He invented the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic to denote the Old and New Stone Ages respectively, but more notable was his introduction of a Darwinian view of human nature.\nHe carried out extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin, who lived nearby in Downe. In addition to their shared interest in natural history, both men were active advocates of spelling reform, and members of the Spelling Reform Association. When Darwin died in 1882, Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, and was one of the pallbearers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"PC","offset":32},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":36},{"uri":"Baronet","surface_form":"Bt","offset":102},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":134},{"uri":"Banker","surface_form":"banker","offset":142},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":150},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":161},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Liberal","offset":179},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":187},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":325},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":483},{"uri":"Down_House","surface_form":"Down House","offset":512},{"uri":"Eton_College","surface_form":"Eton College","offset":661},{"uri":"Baronet","surface_form":"baronet","offset":813},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":866},{"uri":"British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","surface_form":"British Association","offset":1023},{"uri":"Linnean_Society_of_London","surface_form":"Linnean Society of London","offset":1083},{"uri":"Electoral_Reform_Society","surface_form":"Electoral Reform Society","offset":1397},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":1482},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":1490},{"uri":"University_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":1501},{"uri":"University_of_Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":1512},{"uri":"University_of_W%C3%BCrzburg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrzburg","offset":1523},{"uri":"British_Museum","surface_form":"British Museum","offset":1576},{"uri":"London_County_Council","surface_form":"London County Council","offset":1732},{"uri":"Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Privy Councillor","offset":1791},{"uri":"Peerage","surface_form":"peerage","offset":1918},{"uri":"Avebury","surface_form":"Avebury","offset":1935},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":1980},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"Palaeolithic","offset":2279},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":2296},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":2332},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"natural history","offset":2560},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":2611},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":2744},{"uri":"Pallbearer","surface_form":"pallbearer","offset":2782}]}
