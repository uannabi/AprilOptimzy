He dedicated the last 15 years of his life to organise a philosophical doctrine called Spiritism. He spread the educational ideas of Pestalozzi in the 19th century. He published books on grammar, mathematics and suggestions for the improvement of public education in France. He was a teacher of physiology, astronomy, physics and chemistry. The classes were at his home in Paris.\nIn 1854, Kardec started studying phenomena which some people call \"paranormal\" or \"supernatural\". This were quite common at that time.\nIn his philosophy the spiritual manifestations were useful to the social and moral improvement of men.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":81},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":88},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":104},{"uri":"Spiritism","surface_form":"Spiritism","offset":200},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":300},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":309},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiology","offset":408},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":420},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":431},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":443},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"supernatural","offset":576}]}
