{"id":244635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase","text":"=\"preserve\">Purchasing is the buying of goods or services. An item that has been bought is called a purchase. The opposite of a purchase is a sale. In common usage, the shorter word \"buy\" is typically used when shopping, rather than the word \"purchase\".\nThe word \"purchase\" is often used in contracts with \"acquisition\", as in the term \"Acquisitions and Mergers\" (A&M) in legal agreements made between large companies. Those contracts typically state than a company was \"purchased\" by another company.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buy","surface_form":"buying","offset":30},{"uri":"Goods","surface_form":"goods","offset":40},{"uri":"Service_(economics)","surface_form":"service","offset":49},{"uri":"Sale","surface_form":"sale","offset":142},{"uri":"Procurement","surface_form":"acquisition","offset":307},{"uri":"Acquisitions_and_Mergers","surface_form":"Acquisitions and Mergers","offset":337},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":425},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":458}]}
