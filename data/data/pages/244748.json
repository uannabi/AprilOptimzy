This tropical disturbance grew into Tropical Depression One-E on May 29. Tropical Depression One quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and it was given the name \"Agatha\". Moving toward land, Tropical Storm Agatha peak as a weak tropical storm with winds of 45\u00A0mph (75\u00A0km/h). Tropical Storm Agatha had made landfall near the Mexico and Guatemala border.

Moving just south of the Mexican coast, winds top at 30\u00A0mph (45\u00A0km/h), which was too low for a storm to be a tropical storm.

The next day, Blas weakened to a tropical depression and died the following day, June 21. Tropical Storm Blas remained far enough from land to cause no affects.\nHurricane Celia.\nCelia formed from an area of low pressure on June 19, and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. On June 21 Celia became a Category 2 hurricane and on June 23 strengthened further to become a Category 3 for a little while before weakening again due to bad conditions. After these bad conditions disappeared, Celia strengthened again and became a Category 5 hurricane on June 24, and the strongest storm of the season so far. However Celia moved into a part of the ocean with dry air above it and Celia weakened to a tropical storm quickly, before dying out completely. Celia was far enough away from land to not cause any damage.\nStorm names.\nThe following names will be used for named storms that form in East Pacific in 2010.
