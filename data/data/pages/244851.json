{"id":244851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)","text":"Android is an operating system for mobile devices. It is mostly used for smartphones, like Google's own Google Pixel, as well as by other phone manufacturers like HTC and Samsung. It has also been used for tablets such as the Motorola Xoom and Amazon Kindle. A modified Linux kernel is used as Android's kernel.\nGoogle says that over 1.3 million Android smartphones are sold every day. Most mobile phones run Android, making it the most popular mobile operating system. It is also the most popular operating system in general.\nIt supports multitasking and two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics.\nSecurity updates are not provided on versions older than Android 8.0. Newer versions receive security updates if the phone manufacturer supports them. Phones which have Android 10 and above receive security updates (like app updates) directly from Google Play.\nThe current stable version is Android 11, released on September 8, 2020. As of December 2020, Android 10 is the most used version.\nAndroid programs.\nPrograms for Android, also called \"apps\" (short for applications), usually come from the Google Play Store. The Android programs have a file extension of .APK. On May 7, 2019, Kotlin replaced Java as Google\u2019s preferred language for Android app development. Java is still supported, as is C++. Google states that \"Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages\". Other languages may also be used; such as Python and Go, and those languages and even C++ may have restrictions. Large portions of the operating system itself are also written in Java. Over 2.6 million apps are available for Android in the Google Play Store. Some apps are distributed elsewhere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["OS"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":14},{"uri":"Mobile_device","surface_form":"mobile device","offset":35},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":73},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":91},{"uri":"Google_Pixel","surface_form":"Google Pixel","offset":104},{"uri":"HTC_Corporation","surface_form":"HTC","offset":163},{"uri":"Samsung","surface_form":"Samsung","offset":171},{"uri":"Tablet_computer","surface_form":"tablets","offset":206},{"uri":"Motorola","surface_form":"Motorola","offset":226},{"uri":"Amazon_Kindle","surface_form":"Amazon Kindle","offset":244},{"uri":"Linux_kernel","surface_form":"Linux kernel","offset":270},{"uri":"Kernel_(computer_science)","surface_form":"kernel","offset":304},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":354},{"uri":"Mobile_operating_system","surface_form":"mobile operating system","offset":445},{"uri":"Multitasking","surface_form":"multitasking","offset":539},{"uri":"Android_11","surface_form":"Android 11","offset":895},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"Programs","offset":1014},{"uri":"Mobile_application","surface_form":"applications","offset":1066},{"uri":"Google_Play","surface_form":"Google Play","offset":1103},{"uri":"File_extension","surface_form":"file extension","offset":1150},{"uri":"APK_(file_format)","surface_form":".APK","offset":1168},{"uri":"Kotlin_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Kotlin","offset":1190},{"uri":"Kotlin_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Kotlin","offset":1361},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":1369},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":1379},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":1437}]}
