{"id":245146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecchi","text":"\"Ecchi\" (or \"Boku no Nuqman\", from the Japanese \u30A8\u30C3\u30C1 \"etchi\") is from the Japanese word meaning \"lewd\", \"sexy\", \"pervert\", or \"naughty\" when used as an adjective, or it can mean to have sex when it is used as a verb or noun. The English use of this word is usually used in manga and anime, used when it has sexual content, such as not much clothing or nudity, but does not show sex.\nEcchi anime is also sometimes filled with innuendo and sexual humor. Ecchi anime doesn\u2019t show sex, at least not in a clear way. It is similar to an R rated movie.\nEcchi is similar to hentai, though it doesn\u2019t go as far. The term itself may be from the word hentai, but the origins are unclear. Ecchi means \u201Ch\u201D.\nA character in anime is often called ecchi, or even hentai, when he is perceived as being a pervert. In an anime like Love Hina it\u2019s usually because of a comedic mistake or blunder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":39},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":73},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":151},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":228},{"uri":"Manga","surface_form":"manga","offset":272},{"uri":"Anime","surface_form":"anime","offset":282},{"uri":"Innuendo","surface_form":"innuendo","offset":424},{"uri":"Film_rating_systems","surface_form":"R rated movie","offset":530},{"uri":"Hentai","surface_form":"hentai","offset":565},{"uri":"Pervert","surface_form":"pervert","offset":785},{"uri":"Love_Hina","surface_form":"Love Hina","offset":811}]}
