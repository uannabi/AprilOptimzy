{"id":24550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackal","text":"Jackals are canid species found in Africa and Asia. They are nocturnal carnivorous and eat small mammals, birds and reptiles. To hunt, they can run at speeds of 16h (10mph).\nJackals are monogamous (each male lives with only one female). A pair defends its territory from other pairs: they mark the territory with urine and feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults who live with their parents until they have their own territory. Sometimes, jackals join small packs, for example to hunt a big animal, but normally they hunt alone or as a pair.\nJackals are not a clade. They have several times developed from canid ancestors.\nA canid from Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Ethiopian wolf (\"Canis simensis\"), is sometimes called simian jackal, but it is really a wolf. The Ethiopian wolf is one of the rarest and most endangered of all canid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canidae","surface_form":"canid","offset":12},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":35},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":46},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":61},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":71},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":97},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":106},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":116},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"h","offset":163},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mph","offset":168},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":203},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":228},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":256},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":313},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":323},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":587},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":663},{"uri":"Eritrea","surface_form":"Eritrea","offset":676},{"uri":"Wolf","surface_form":"wolf","offset":778},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"endangered","offset":833}]}
