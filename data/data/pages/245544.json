{"id":245544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith","text":"e=\"preserve\">Neith was one of the earliest goddesses of ancient Egypt. She was the patroness of the city Sais in the River Nile Delta. Several Egyptian queens of the first Dynasty were named after her. The people of lower Egypt prayed to her statues when they were sick or to keep them safe from harm. Every year the people held a great festival in her honor, called the Feast of Lamps, because at night, they burned lots of lights in the open air during the celebration.\nNeith was also known as \"The Warrior Goddess,\" \"The creator Goddess,\" \"The Mother Goddess,\" \"The Goddess of Lower Egypt,\" and \"The Goddess of Funerals or Funerary Goddess.\" In drawings of her, she wore the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Sometimes she was shown holding a bow and arrows.\nNeith had worshippers all over Egypt. In the Old Kingdom of Egypt, she was an important deity in Memphis. But, she lost some of her importance during the Middle Kingdom and early New Kingdom. But, in the 19th dynasty, she became more popular again.\nNeith was the goddess of war and hunting. It was her responsibility to help settle wars and disputes between the gods and the Egyptians. The Egyptian warriors believed they could not win a war without praying to her.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":43},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"ancient Egypt","offset":56},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":337},{"uri":"Bow_(weapon)","surface_form":"bow","offset":738},{"uri":"Old_Kingdom_of_Egypt","surface_form":"Old Kingdom of Egypt","offset":799},{"uri":"Memphis%2C_Egypt","surface_form":"Memphis","offset":851},{"uri":"Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt","surface_form":"Middle Kingdom","offset":908},{"uri":"New_Kingdom","surface_form":"New Kingdom","offset":933}]}
