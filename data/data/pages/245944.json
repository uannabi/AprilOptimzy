In one stage of their life cycle they have two unequal flagella. They include both single-celled types and brown algae (seaweeds such as kelp and \"Sargassum\"). They are members of the Kingdom Chromalveolata.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":53},{"uri":"Diatom","surface_form":"diatom","offset":115},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":147},{"uri":"Life_cycle","surface_form":"life cycle","offset":176},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":209},{"uri":"Brown_algae","surface_form":"brown algae","offset":261},{"uri":"Seaweed","surface_form":"seaweed","offset":274},{"uri":"Kelp","surface_form":"kelp","offset":291},{"uri":"Sargassum","surface_form":"Sargassum","offset":301},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"Kingdom","offset":338},{"uri":"Chromalveolata","surface_form":"Chromalveolata","offset":346}]}
