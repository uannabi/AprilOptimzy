{"id":245986,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant","text":"The Planck constant (Planck's constant) links the amount of energy a photon carries with the frequency of its electromagnetic wave. It is named after the physicist Max Planck. The Planck constant is a fundamental physical constant. It is written as \"h\".\nThe Planck constant has dimensions of physical action: energy multiplied by time, or momentum multiplied by distance. In SI units, the Planck constant is expressed in joule seconds (J\u22C5s) or (N\u22C5m\u22C5s) or (kg\u22C5m2\u22C5s\u22121).\nThe symbols are defined here.\nIn SI Units the Planck constant is exactly J\u00B7s (by definition). Scientists have used this quantity to calculate measurements like the Planck length and the Planck time.\nBackground.\n). S represents sunlight. The light between the planes BC and DE are in colour. These colours are recombined to form sunlight on the plane GH</a>\nBetween 1670 and 1900 scientists discussed the nature of light. Some scientists believed that light consisted of many millions of tiny particles. Other scientists believed that light was a wave.\nLight: waves or particles?\nIn 1678, Christiaan Huygens wrote the book \"Trait\u00E9 de la lumiere\" (\"Treatise on light\"). He believed that light was made up of waves. He said that light could not be made up of particles because light from two beams do not bounce off each other.\nIn 1672, Isaac Newton wrote the book \"Opticks\". He believed that light was made up of red, yellow and blue particles which he called corpusles. Newton explained this by his \"two prism experiment\". The first prism broke light up into different colours. The second prism merged these colours back into white light.\nDuring the 18th century, Newton's theory was given the most attention. In 1803, Thomas Young described the \"double-slit experiment\". In this experiment, light going through two narrow slits interferes with itself. This causes a pattern which shows that light is made up of waves. For the rest of the nineteenth century, the wave theory of light was given the most attention. In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell developed equations that described electromagnetic radiation as waves.\nThe symbols are defined here.\nBlack body radiators.\nAll warm things give off thermal radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation. For most things on Earth this radiation is in the infra-red range, but something very hot (1000\u00A0\u00B0C or more), gives off visible radiation, that is, light. In the late 1800's many scientists studied the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from black-body radiators at different temperatures.\nRayleigh-Jeans Law.\nFor long-wavelength radiation, the results predicted by this equation corresponded well with practical results obtained in a laboratory. However, for short wavelengths (ultraviolet light) the difference between theory and practice were so large that it earned the nickname \"the ultra-violet catastrophe\".\nPlanck's Law.\nThis formula worked well for short wavelength electromagnetic radiation, but did not work well with long wavelengths.\nIf the wavelength of light is allowed to become very large, then it can be shown that the Raleigh-Jeans and the Planck relationships are almost identical.\nHe calculated \"h\" and \"k\" and found that\nThe values are close to the modern day accepted values of and respectively. The Planck law agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance was only appreciated several years later.\nQuantum theory of light.\nIt turns out that electrons are dislodged by the photoelectric effect if light reaches a threshold frequency. Below this no electrons can be emitted from the metal. In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper explaining the effect. Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy. Einstein said that the effect was due to a photon striking an electron. This demonstrated the particle nature of light.\nEinstein also found that electromagnetic radiation with a long wavelength had no effect. Einstein said that this was because the \"particles\" did not have enough energy to disturb the electrons.\nPlanck received the Nobel Prize in 1918 in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta. In 1921 Einstein received the Nobel Prize for linking the Planck constant to the photoelectric effect.\nApplication.\nThe Planck constant is of importance in many applications. A few are listed below.\nBohr model of the atom.\nIn 1913 Niels Bohr published the Bohr model of the structure of an atom. Bohr said that the angular momentum of the electrons going around the nucleus can only have certain values. These values are given by the equation\nThe Bohr model of the atom can be used to calculate the energy of electrons at each level. Electrons will normally fill up the lowest numbered states of an atom. If the atom receives energy from, for example, an electric current, electrons will be excited into a higher state. The electrons will then drop back to a lower state and will lose their extra energy by giving off a photon. Because the energy levels have specific values, the photons will have specific energy levels. Light emitted in this way can be split into different colours using a prism. Each element has its own pattern. The pattern for neon is shown alongside.\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle.\nIn 1927 Werner Heisenberg published the uncertainty principle. The principle states that it is not possible to make a measurement without disturbing the thing being measured. It also puts a limit on the minimum disturbance caused by making a measurement.\nIn the macroscopic world these disturbances make very little difference. For example, if the temperature of a flask of liquid is measured, the thermometer will absorb a small amount of energy as it heats up. This will cause a small error in the final reading, but this error is small and not important.\nColour of light emitting diodes.\nIn the electric circuit shown on the right, the voltage drop across the light emitting diode (LED) depends on the material of the LED. For silicon diodes the drop is 0.6\u00A0V. However for LEDs it is between 1.8\u00A0V and 2.7\u00A0V. This information enables a user to calculate the Planck constant.\nThe energy needed for one electron to jump the potential barrier in the LED material is given by\nWhen the electron decays back again, it emits one photon of light. The energy of the photon is given by\nthe same equation used in the photoelectric effect. If these equations are combined, the wavelength of light and the voltage are related by\nThe table below can be calculated from this relationship.\nValue of the Planck constant and the kilogram redefinition.\nSince its discovery, measurements of h have become much better. Planck first quoted the value of h to be erg\u00B7sec. This value is within 5% of the current value.\nAs of 3 March 2014, the best measurements of h in SI units is \u00A0J\u00B7s. The equivalent figure in cgs units is \u00A0erg\u00B7sec. The relative uncertainty of h is.\nThe reduced Planck constant (\u0127) is a value that is sometimes used in quantum mechanics. It is defined by\nPlanck units are sometimes used in quantum mechanics instead of SI. In this system the reduced Planck constant has a value of 1, so the value of the Planck constant is 2\u03C0.\nPlancks constant can now be measured with very high precision. This has caused the BIPM to consider a new definition for the kilogram. The international prototype kilogram is no longer used to define the kilogram. Instead the BIPM defines the Planck constant to have an exact value. Scientists use this value and the definitions of the metre and the second to define the kilogram.\nValue of Theoretical Planck constant.\nformula_1\nHere, formula_1 is the permeability of free space, formula_1 is the speed of light, formula_1 is the electric charge of electron, formula_1 is the Bohr's radius, and formula_1 is the frequency of revolution of the electron in a hydrogen atom formula_1. When these constant values are substituted to the theoretical Planck constant, the theoretical Planck constant value is exactly equal to the experimental value.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":60},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"photon","offset":69},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":93},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_wave","surface_form":"electromagnetic wave","offset":110},{"uri":"Max_Planck","surface_form":"Max Planck","offset":164},{"uri":"Dimensional_analysis","surface_form":"dimensions","offset":278},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":309},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":330},{"uri":"Momentum","surface_form":"momentum","offset":339},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":362},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI units","offset":375},{"uri":"Joule","surface_form":"joule","offset":421},{"uri":"Newton_(unit)","surface_form":"N","offset":445},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":447},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"s","offset":449},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":456},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI Units","offset":501},{"uri":"Joule","surface_form":"J","offset":541},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"s","offset":543},{"uri":"Planck_length","surface_form":"Planck length","offset":632},{"uri":"Planck_time","surface_form":"Planck time","offset":654},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":1014},{"uri":"Christiaan_Huygens","surface_form":"Christiaan Huygens","offset":1056},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":1302},{"uri":"Thomas_Young","surface_form":"Thomas Young","offset":1686},{"uri":"Young%27s_interference_experiment","surface_form":"\"double-slit experiment\"","offset":1713},{"uri":"Interference","surface_form":"interferes","offset":1796},{"uri":"James_Clerk_Maxwell","surface_form":"James Clerk Maxwell","offset":1995},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":2025},{"uri":"Electromagnetic","surface_form":"electromagnetic","offset":2050},{"uri":"Thermal_radiation","surface_form":"thermal radiation","offset":2163},{"uri":"Infra-red","surface_form":"infra-red","offset":2268},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":2365},{"uri":"Black-body_radiation","surface_form":"black-body radiators","offset":2465},{"uri":"The_ultra-violet_catastrophe","surface_form":"the ultra-violet catastrophe","offset":2807},{"uri":"Photoelectric_effect","surface_form":"photoelectric effect","offset":3439},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":3563},{"uri":"Photons","surface_form":"photons","offset":3750},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":4112},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":4270},{"uri":"Niels_Bohr","surface_form":"Niels Bohr","offset":4471},{"uri":"Bohr_model","surface_form":"Bohr model","offset":4496},{"uri":"Angular_momentum","surface_form":"angular momentum","offset":4555},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":4579},{"uri":"Nucleus","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":4606},{"uri":"Werner_Heisenberg","surface_form":"Werner Heisenberg","offset":5358},{"uri":"Uncertainty_principle","surface_form":"uncertainty principle","offset":5390},{"uri":"Macroscopic","surface_form":"macroscopic","offset":5612},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":5698},{"uri":"Thermometer","surface_form":"thermometer","offset":5748},{"uri":"Light_emitting_diodes","surface_form":"LEDs","offset":6126},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"potential barrier","offset":6275},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI units","offset":6897},{"uri":"Centimetre-gram-second","surface_form":"cgs units","offset":6940},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":7066},{"uri":"Planck_units","surface_form":"Planck units","offset":7102},{"uri":"BIPM","surface_form":"BIPM","offset":7357},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"international prototype kilogram","offset":7413}]}
