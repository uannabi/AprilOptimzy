He made his debut for the Denmark national team in March 2010, and was the youngest player of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.\nIn 2011, Eriksen was named Danish Football Player of the Year, Dutch Football Talent of the Year, Ajax Talent of the Year (Marco van Basten Award), and made the UEFA Euro U-21 Team of the Tournament. He won the Eredivisie with Ajax in 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, and in 2012\u201313 before signing with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2013. He won the Tottenham Hotspur Player of the Year award for the 2013\u201314 season and in 2015, he won the Danish Football Player of the Year award for the second year in a row.\nEarly career in Middelfart and Odense.\nEriksen started playing football in his hometown Middelfart before his third birthday. In 2005 he switched to Odense Boldklub, who competed in the Danish youth championships. His team lost the semi-final against Br\u00F8ndby IF, but afterwards he was named \"Best Technical Player\" of the tournament. The following year OB won the tournament, when Eriksen scored the only goal in the final. After some good performances for OB's U-16 team and later on U-19 team and the Danish U-17 team, major European football clubs including Chelsea and Barcelona began to take notice. The player had trials with Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Milan, but finally decided to move to Ajax, stating \"My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option\".\nYouth & entrance in the first squad.\nOn 17 October 2008 it was announced that Eriksen had signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Amsterdam-based Ajax. The transfer fee received by OB was estimated at \u20AC1 million (\u00A3847,199). He worked his way through the youth teams, and was promoted to the first team squad in January 2010, where he was given the number 51 shirt. Within the month, he made his first team debut for the Dutch team in the Eredivisie on 17 January 2010 against NAC Breda. Ajax manager Martin Jol compared him to the likes of Ajax youth products Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart and described him as a good reader of the game in the traditional \"number 10\" role like the two Dutch internationals and Danish legend Michael Laudrup, who also played for Ajax.\nOn 25 March 2010 he scored his first goal for Ajax in a 6\u20130 win against opponent Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Cup. On 10 April 2010, Eriksen extended his contract with Ajax until the summer of 2014, stating \"I can still learn a lot here, I'm not finished yet and I hope I can mean a lot for the club.\" On 6 May 2010, Eriksen played in the second match of the final of the 2009\u201310 Dutch Cup as Ajax beat Feyenoord 1\u20134, with 1\u20136 on aggregate. At the end of his first professional season at Ajax, Eriksen had played 21 competitive matches, scoring one goal, and had made his international debut for Denmark.

On 11 November 2010, Eriksen scored his first goal at the Amsterdam ArenA a 3\u20130 Cup victory over BV Veendam. In December, Eriksen was named Danish \"Talent of the Year\". Several days after receiving this award, Eriksen once again proved his value to Ajax by scoring the only goal in a 0\u20131 away league victory over Vitesse. On 17 February 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in a European tournament, the Ajax goal to 2\u20130, when Ajax beat Anderlecht 3\u20130 in the 2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League. On 13 March 2011, Eriksen scored a solo goal, running from the half way line to finish it off with a strike to secure a 3\u20131 win over Willem II.\nDuring the rest of the season, Eriksen became more and more important for Ajax, due to his growing capabilities as the team's playmaker, providing many assists. After a good season during which he developed himself into an undisputed starter in the side that won the 2010\u201311 Eredivisie (Ajax's first Eredivisie title in seven years), he was named Ajax's Talent of the Year. On 23 May 2011 he was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year, the second Danish player to win the award since Jon Dahl Tomasson in 1996. He was elected by a jury under command of Holland's all-time best player Johan Cruyff. \"He's a player I really like with all my heart,\" Cruyff praised Eriksen. \"This prize is just the beginning, a stimulus to get the maximum out of his career. The talent is there, the recognition also; now it is up to the player himself. He is a typical product of the Danish school. You can compare him with Brian and Michael Laudrup. Only time will tell if Eriksen can reach the same level as them.\".\nRising influence in the squad.\nOn 18 October 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League when Ajax beat Dinamo Zagreb 2\u20130 in the group stage, making him the 2nd youngest player to score in the 2011\u201312 season. In the second match versus Dinamo Zagreb on 2 November he provided assists to Gregory van der Wiel and Siem de Jong as well as being involved with the third goal, as Ajax cruised to a 4\u20130 victory. He was named Danish Football Player of the Year on 7 November after helping Ajax win the Eredivisie the previous year and guiding the national team to a successful Euro 2012 qualification campaign, after receiving the award Eriksen said, \"I am extremely honoured to be standing here tonight. I did not expect it, it really means a lot to me. I would like to thank my team-mates in the national team as well as my team-mates at Ajax\". Following the success of Eriksen's third consecutive Eredivisie title in the 2012\u201313 season, he opted not to renew his contract with Ajax, and with one year still remaining on his current contract he was permitted to search for a new club.
