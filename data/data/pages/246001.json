{"id":246001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foster_(architect)","text":"Norman Robert Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, OM, FRIBA, FCSD, RDI (born 1 June 1935) is an English architect. His company, Foster and Partners, has an international design practice. He is the United Kingdom's biggest builder of landmark office buildings.\nHe is one of Britain's most prolific architects of his generation.\u00A0In 1999, he was awarded the\u00A0Pritzker Architecture Prize, often referred to as the\u00A0Nobel Prize\u00A0of architecture. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category.\nBiography.\nFoster was born to Robert Foster and Lilian Smith\u00A0in 1935 in\u00A0Reddish,\u00A0Stockport, Cheshire. They moved, soon after his birth, two miles to 4 Crescent Grove in\u00A0Levenshulme,\u00A0Manchester, which they rented for fourteen\u00A0shillings\u00A0(70p) a week:\u00A0Foster has no recollection of Reddish. Foster's parents were diligent, hard workers \u2013 so diligent that Foster, as an only child, felt their heavy workload restricted his relationship with them and he was often looked after by neighbours or other family members.\u00A0He attended\u00A0Burnage Grammar School for Boys\u00A0in\u00A0Burnage. In a\u00A0\"Guardian\"\u00A0interview in 1999, Foster said he always felt 'different' at school and was bullied and he retired into the world of books.\u00A0He considered himself quiet and awkward in his early years often making faux pas.\nFoster described Manchester as \"one of the workshops of the world\"\u00A0and \"the embodiment of a great city\",\u00A0his father, Robert, worked at\u00A0Metropolitan-Vickers,\u00A0Trafford Park\u00A0which fuelled Foster's interest in engineering and design.\u00A0He was fascinated with engineering and the process of designing. He says that caused him to pursue a career designing buildings.\u00A0Specific interests included aircraft, a hobby he maintains today;\u00A0and trains, generated by viewing passing trains on the railway outside his terraced home during his childhood.\nHe left school at 16 and worked in the Manchester City Treasurer's office. Next, he joined the National Service in the Royal Air Force. After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster attended the University of Manchester's School of Architecture and City Planning. He graduated in 1961. Later, Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he earned his Master's degree Foster also met Richard Rogers at Yale. He then travelled in America for a year. He returned to the UK in 1963. Then he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams. This allowed them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.\nFoster took a job as assistant to a contract manager with John Bearshaw and Partners, a local architectural practice.\u00A0\u00A0The staff advised him, that if he wished to become an architect, he should prepare a portfolio of drawings using the\u00A0perspective\u00A0and\u00A0shop drawings\u00A0from Bearshaw's practice as an example.\u00A0Bearshaw was so impressed with the drawings that he promoted the young Foster to the drawing department of the practice.\nIn 1956 Foster won a place at the\u00A0University of Manchester\u00A0School of Architecture and City Planning. Foster was not eligible for a\u00A0maintenance grant\u00A0so took up a number of part-time jobs to fund his studies,\u00A0becoming an ice-cream salesman, night-club bouncer\u00A0and working night shifts at a bakery to make\u00A0crumpets.\u00A0He combined these with self-tuition via visits to the local library in Levenshulme.\u00A0Foster took a keen interest in the works of\u00A0Frank Lloyd Wright,\u00A0Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,\u00A0Le Corbusier\u00A0and\u00A0Oscar Niemeyer\u00A0and graduated from Manchester in 1961.\nFoster won the Henry Fellowship to the\u00A0Yale School of Architecture, where he met future business partner\u00A0Richard Rogers\u00A0and earned his master's degree.\u00A0Vincent Scully\u00A0encouraged Foster and Rogers to travel in America for a year.\u00A0After returning to the UK in 1963 he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters\u00A0Georgie\u00A0and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams allowing them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for\u00A0high-tech\u00A0industrial design.\nFoster + Partners.\nAfter Team 4 went their separate ways, Foster and Wendy Cheesman founded Foster Associates, which later became\u00A0Foster and Partners\u00A0in 1967. A long period of collaboration with American architect\u00A0Richard Buckminster Fuller\u00A0began in 1968 and continued until Fuller's death in 1983. They collaborated on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design \u2013 including the Samuel Beckett Theatre project.\nOriginally they concentrated on industrial buildings. The turning point was the 1969 administrative and leisure center for\u00A0Fred. Olsen Lines\u00A0in\u00A0London Docklands, where workers and managers are not separated any more.\u00A0Foster and Partners' breakthrough building in the UK was the\u00A0Willis Faber & Dumas headquarters\u00A0in\u00A0Ipswich, of 1974. The client was a family run insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created\u00A0open plan\u00A0office floors long before open-plan became the norm. In a town not over-endowed with public facilities, the roof gardens, 25\u00A0metre swimming pool and gymnasium enhanced the quality of life for the company's 1200 employees.\u00A0The building has a full-height glass\u00A0fa\u00E7ade\u00A0moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester a work Foster admired in his youth. The building is now\u00A0Grade I* listed.\nThe\u00A0Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, an art gallery and museum on the campus of the\u00A0University of East Anglia,\u00A0Norwich, was one of the first major public buildings to be designed by Foster, completed in 1978, and became grade II* listed in December 2012. In 1990 Foster's design for the Terminal Building at\u00A0London Stansted Airport\u00A0was awarded the\u00A0Mies van der Rohe Award.\nFoster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the\u00A0HSBC Main Building\u00A0in\u00A0Hong Kong\u00A0for\u00A0HSBC. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to\u00A0Victoria Peak\u00A0or\u00A0Victoria Harbour.\u00A0Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967.\nPresent day.\nToday, Foster + Partners works with its engineers to use computer systems. They pay attention to basic physical laws such as convection. They have created efficient buildings like the Swiss Re London headquarters in London. The walls let in air for passive cooling and then let it out as it warms and rises.\nFoster's earlier designs reflected a sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision. His style has evolved into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the\u00A0tallest bridge in the world, the\u00A0Millau Viaduct\u00A0in\u00A0Southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; \"The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art.\"\nIn January 2007, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not want to retire, but wants to sell his 80-90% holding in the company valued at \u00A3300M to \u00A3500M.\nFoster is a member of the board of Trustees for the architectural charity Article 25. They design, construct and manage safe, sustainable buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.\nThe reason for his wealth is he receives 15% of the building cost.\nIn 2007, he worked with\u00A0Philippe Starck\u00A0and\u00A0Sir Richard Branson\u00A0of the\u00A0Virgin Group\u00A0for the\u00A0Virgin Galactic\u00A0plans.\nFoster designed the Apple Campus in Cupertino and is currently designing most of their Apple stores. He is also designing Bloomberg's headquarters in London. He also recently designed the Monaco Yacht club and the McLaren technology centre.\nFoster currently sits on the Board of Trustees at architectural charity\u00A0Article 25\u00A0who design, construct and manage innovative, safe, sustainable buildings in some of the most inhospitable and unstable regions of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of\u00A0the Architecture Foundation.\nHe has recently set up the Norman Foster Foundation which promotes interdisciplinary thinking and research to help new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future.\nFoster recently set up his personal Instagram account under the username @officialnormanfoster where he publishes photos of his everyday life\nRecognition.\nFoster was knighted in 1990 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1997. In 1999, he was created a life peer, as Baron Foster of Thames Bank, of Reddish in the County of Greater Manchester. He is a Crossbencher.\nNorman Foster is the second British architect to win the Stirling Prize twice: the first for the American Air Museum at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 1998, and the second for 30 St Mary Axe in 2004.\nFoster was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999.\nHe is also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the Society's highest award.
