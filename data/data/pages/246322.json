{"id":246322,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstile","text":"A turnstile, also called a baffle gate, is a type of gate. It only allows one person to pass at a time. It can also be made so as to make one-way traffic of people. It can also make passage only to people who put in a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. A turnstile can be used for paid access (sometimes called a faregate when used for this). For example, it can be used in public transport as a ticket barrier or at a pay toilet.\nTurnstiles are used at a variety of places. This includes stadiums, amusement parks, museums, and mass transit stations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gate","surface_form":"gate","offset":53},{"uri":"Fare_control","surface_form":"paid access","offset":282},{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"public transport","offset":375},{"uri":"Pay_toilet","surface_form":"pay toilet","offset":420},{"uri":"Variety","surface_form":"variety","offset":457},{"uri":"Stadiums","surface_form":"stadiums","offset":490},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":517},{"uri":"Mass_transit","surface_form":"mass transit","offset":530}]}
