{"id":246506,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seating_capacity","text":"=\"preserve\">Seating capacity is the highest number of people who can sit in a specific space. This limit can be either from the amount of space available, or from a law saying how many people are allowed to be there at a time.\nSeating capacity can be for different kinds of things. It can be the number of people who can fit in a vehicle, for example an automobile or an airplane. It can also be for a stadium. The largest sports building in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity of more than 257,000 people. Seats can be added on the field to raise that number to about 400,000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":54},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":354},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":371},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":402},{"uri":"Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway","surface_form":"Indianapolis Motor Speedway","offset":457}]}
