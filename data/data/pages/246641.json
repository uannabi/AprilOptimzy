{"id":246641,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster-Hayne_debate","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's \"Second Reply to Hayne\" (1830) was widely seen as \"the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress.\"\nWebster described the US government as \"made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people\". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\" in his Gettysburg Address.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":51},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":65},{"uri":"United_States_Senator","surface_form":"Senator","offset":87},{"uri":"Daniel_Webster","surface_form":"Daniel Webster","offset":95},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":113},{"uri":"Robert_Y._Hayne","surface_form":"Robert Y.
