{"id":246870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetus_Latina","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vetus Latina is the name given to a collection of Biblical texts that were translated into Latin before the Vulgate became the standard version used in the Latin-speaking world. The texts themselves are written in Late Latin, not in Old Latin. They often use different words than the Vulgate. No complete manuscript survives, only fragments are known. Many text passages are known because Church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo cited from them.\nSince the Council of Trent, held in the 16th century, the Vulgate is the official Bible translation for the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe Old Latin text means, \"Glory [belongs] to God among the high, and peace [belongs] to men of good will on earth\". The Vulgate text means \"Glory [belongs] to God among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth\".\nProbably the best known difference between the Old Latin and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster, where the phrase from the Vetus Latina, \"quotidianum panem\", \"daily bread\", becomes \"supersubstantialem panem\", \"supersubstantial bread\" in the Vulgate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Biblical","offset":63},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":72},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":104},{"uri":"Vulgate","surface_form":"Vulgate","offset":121},{"uri":"Fragment","surface_form":"fragment","offset":344},{"uri":"Augustine_of_Hippo","surface_form":"Augustine of Hippo","offset":425},{"uri":"Council_of_Trent","surface_form":"Council of Trent","offset":471},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":569},{"uri":"Pater_Noster","surface_form":"Pater Noster","offset":903},{"uri":"Epiousios","surface_form":"supersubstantial","offset":1030}]}
