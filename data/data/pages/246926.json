{"id":246926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States","text":"Historians (and sometimes political scientists) are surveyed and asked to give Presidents of the United States number ratings on their overall performance or on different aspects of their leadership.\nSeveral different factors are considered in deciding what makes one a good or bad president. These include their character, their vision for the country, their relations with congress, their relations with foreign leaders (diplomacy), how they managed the economy, how they managed the military, and their overall political skill.\nTo make sure the rankings are fair, many surveys equally balance the opinions of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\nIt is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges and lived in different times.\nHistorical opinions of U.S. presidents often change over time. For example, Harry Truman had very low approval ratings right after he left office, but many historians now consider him among the greatest presidents.\nMixed ratings.\nSome presidents have mixed ratings. For example, Andrew Jackson is considered to be a leader who stood for the common man, but at the same time historians criticize him because of the Indian Removal Act. Ulysses S. Grant is thought to be a bad leader since he hired corrupt friends for government jobs, but at the same time he helped African-American to have more rights in the Reconstruction Era.\nLow in rankings.\nChester Arthur, William Howard Taft, Benjamin Harrison, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Rutherford B. Hayes, Martin Van Buren, and Richard Nixon are considered to be below average.\nJohn Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan are often considered to be among the worst because they failed to prevent the growth of the slavery which resulted in the Civil War.\nAndrew Johnson is often ranked among the worst because he was against the Reconstruction.\nWarren G. Harding is often considered to be the worst because he hired corrupt friends to become government officials.\nNot ranked.\nWilliam Henry Harrison and James Garfield are often not ranked because they both died shortly after becoming presidents. When they are included, they are usually low in the list.\nAlso, Donald Trump is not ranked because his presidency has not ended yet. For the same reason, Barack Obama is not ranked in some polls because his presidency ended less than ten years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Presidents of the United States","offset":79},{"uri":"Liberal","surface_form":"liberal","offset":612},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrats","offset":620},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":634},{"uri":"Republicans","surface_form":"Republicans","offset":647},{"uri":"Harry_Truman","surface_form":"Harry Truman","offset":891},{"uri":"Andrew_Jackson","surface_form":"Andrew Jackson","offset":1094},{"uri":"Indian_Removal_Act","surface_form":"Indian Removal Act","offset":1229},{"uri":"Ulysses_S._Grant","surface_form":"Ulysses S.
