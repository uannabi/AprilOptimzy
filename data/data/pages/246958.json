There are different kinds of \"Treponema pallidum\", which cause diseases like syphilis, bejel, pinta and yaws.\nThe most common disease caused by \"Treponema pallidum\" is syphilis, a serious sexually transmitted infection.\nSyphilis is treated and cured by taking antibiotics. Usually, the first treatment used is penicillin. Antibiotic resistance has developed to a number of agents. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, may be as effective as penicillin-based treatment.\nPennicilin is still effective, but \"the potential of this spirochete to develop additional antibiotic resistance could seriously compromise syphilis treatment and control\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":26},{"uri":"Spirochaete","surface_form":"spirochaete","offset":36},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":48},{"uri":"Syphilis","surface_form":"syphilis","offset":136},{"uri":"Bejel","surface_form":"bejel","offset":146},{"uri":"Pinta_(disease)","surface_form":"pinta","offset":153},{"uri":"Yaws","surface_form":"yaws","offset":163},{"uri":"Sexually_transmitted_infection","surface_form":"sexually transmitted infection","offset":247},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":319},{"uri":"Penicillin","surface_form":"penicillin","offset":369},{"uri":"Antibiotic_resistance","surface_form":"Antibiotic resistance","offset":381},{"uri":"Ceftriaxone","surface_form":"Ceftriaxone","offset":440},{"uri":"Cephalosporin","surface_form":"cephalosporin","offset":472},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":486}]}
