{"id":24696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendogs","text":"is a video game for the Nintendo DS. In \"Nintendogs\", the player has dogs. At the start of the game one can choose a type of dog and give it a name. They give the dogs food and drinks if a dog is good one might get to feed them a dog biscuit or a jerky treat. The dogs can be washed, taken for a walk, taught to do tricks and put into contests. The contests are: agility trial, disc competition and obedience trial. One can find out how to compete in these contests by looking at their care books, under Supplies.\nThere are four versions of the game each with different breeds.\nThey are: \"Dalmatian and Friends\", \"Chihuahua and Friends\", \"Labrador and Friends\" and \"Dachshund and Friends\". All breeds are unlockable in every version and a player can unlock dogs by increasing his trainer points. However, the player can only have three dogs at home. To get more the player must drop off one at the Dog Hotel. Every player can only drop off five dogs at a time.\nIf the player does not play the game for a long period of time, the dog may run away. So players need to play with their dogs daily.\nA sequel, \"Nintendogs + Cats\", was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":5},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":24},{"uri":"Dogs","surface_form":"dogs","offset":69},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":168},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":177},{"uri":"Washing","surface_form":"washed","offset":276},{"uri":"Teach","surface_form":"taught","offset":302},{"uri":"Contest","surface_form":"contest","offset":335},{"uri":"Four","surface_form":"four","offset":524},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":570},{"uri":"Nintendo_3DS","surface_form":"Nintendo 3DS","offset":1146}]}
