{"id":24698,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi","text":"Luigi is a video game character made by Nintendo. The famous game designer,\u00A0Shigeru Miyamoto, made him. Luigi is the little bit younger but\u00A0taller\u00A0fraternal twin\u00A0brother\u00A0of the Nintendo mascot, Mario. He is in many games all over the\u00A0\"Mario\"\u00A0series, almost always as an\u00A0assistant\u00A0to his brother Mario.\nThe first game Luigi was in was\u00A0\"Mario Bros. (Game and Watch)\" (1983) as a character seen working in a factory. He later appeared playable in the 1983 arcade game \"Mario Bros\" and was played by the second character. It was also done in\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros.\",\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 3\",\u00A0\"Super Mario World\", and other games. The first game where he was present as the first character was\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\". In the Mario series, he is usually not the main character. However, he has his own games where is the main character, such as Luigi's Mansion and Mario is Missing!. He also appears in many spin-offs, such as Mario Kart, Mario Party, and the Super Smash Bros. series. Luigi has also been in every show of the three\u00A0DiC\u00A0TV series based on the Nintendo Entertainment System\u00A0and\u00A0Super Nintendo Entertainment System\u00A0games.\nAt first he was made as a\u00A0palette swap\u00A0of Mario with a green color instead of red. Later in the series, he became his own character with his own personality and abilities. As his part in the\u00A0\"Mario\"\u00A0series progressed, Luigi became taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called 2013 \"The Year of Luigi\" to mark the thirty years of the existence of the character. Similarly, games being released in 2013 bring attention to Luigi, such as,\u00A0',\u00A0\"Dr. Luigi\", and the level pack\u00A0\"New Super Luigi U\"\u00A0for\u00A0\"New Super Mario Bros. U\". In\u00A0\"Super Mario 3D World\" a Luigi version of\u00A0\"Mario Bros.\"\u00A0called\u00A0\"Luigi Bros.\" can be unlocked.\nConcept and creation.\nThe events leading to the creation of Luigi began in 1982, during the making of \"Donkey Kong\". The Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (who used to be \"Jumpman\") hoping that he would be able to present the character in many different pars in future games. Miyamoto had been given ideas by the game\u00A0\"Joust\"\u00A0to create a game where two players can play at the same time. This was the cause of his development of the game\u00A0\"Mario Bros.\"\u00A0in 1983, with Luigi as the brother of Mario and the second playable character. The name Luigi is said to have been inspired by a pizza business near the head office of Nintendo of America in\u00A0Redmond, Washington, called \"Mario & Luigi's\". Miyamoto noticed that the word\u00A0\"ruiji\"\u00A0means \"similar\" in the Japanese language, and that Luigi was designed to have the same size, shape and gameplay of Mario.\nAt first in\u00A0\"Donkey Kong\", Mario was a carpenter. In\u00A0\"Mario Bros.\", Mario and Luigi\u00A0were designed as\u00A0Italian\u00A0plumbers by Miyamoto, on the suggestion of a partner. Software limits at the time\u2014almost the same as those that gave\u00A0Mario\u00A0his special look in\u00A0\"Donkey Kong\"\u2014meant the first appearance of Luigi was limited to a simple\u00A0palette swap\u00A0of Mario designed to be the second player. The characters were in every way the same, other than their colors.\u00A0The green color for Luigi would last as one of his physical characteristics in future releases.\nAfter the success of\u00A0\"Mario Bros.\", Luigi was presented to a wider market in 1985 with the release of the console game\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. \"Once again his part was limited to a palette swap of Mario, acting as the second-player in almost the same way as\u00A0\"Mario Bros. \"The Japan-only form of\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00A0in 1986 (released in the west as\u00A0\" \"in the future) marked the start of the development of Luigi becoming a separate character. As with his last appearances, Luigi was still a palette swap of Mario. However, his moves were not the same. Luigi could now jump high up and a great distance more than his brother, at the cost of motion reaction and exactness.\nWhile this form of\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00A0was released in Japan, it was thought to be too hard for the American public at the time. In 1988, as a result, an alternative release was developed to be good enough as\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00A0for western players (and in the future released in Japan as\u00A0\"Super Mario USA\"). This would play a key part in forming the current look of Luigi. The game was a conversion of\u00A0', with the art changed to be characters and places from the\u00A0\"Mario\"\u00A0series. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who could jump the highest, was good enough for the model for Luigi. This caused his taller, thinner look, combined with his Mario-design outfit and green color. There were appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario before - for example, in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game\u00A0'\u00A0and before that, in a very limited 1986 anime\u00A0' (though in the anime he had a yellow shirt and blue overalls). Licensed art for\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 3\"\u00A0and\u00A0\"Super Mario World \"presents Luigi with this new look. Nintendo of Japan would not change his art differences to his look within the game until the 1992 game\u00A0\"Super Mario Kart\". The appearance of Luigi from the\u00A0\"Yume K\u014Dj\u014D: Doki Doki Panic\" version of\u00A0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00A0has been used ever since, even for games made again in which he was a palette swap to start with.\nVoice.\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's has changed over the years. In \"Mario Kart 64\", which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters had two different voices in relation to the region of the game. North American and European forms present a deep voice for Luigi, by Charles Martinet, who also voices Mario, Wario, Waluigi, and Toadsworth. The Japanese form uses a high, falsetto voice, by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All forms of \"Mario Party\" present the high-pitched clips of Bardakoff from \"Mario Kart 64\". Luigi kept this higher voice in \"Mario Party 2\". In \"Mario Golf\", \"Mario Tennis\", and \"Mario Party 3\" his voice returned to normal. Since then, in all games but ' and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", Luigi has always had a medium-pitched voice. In ', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese \"Mario Kart 64\". In \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", Luigi's voice is based on Mario's voice (with clips taken from \"Super Mario 64\"), with a higher pitch. In \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", he has his own voice clips instead of voice clips taken from Mario.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":11},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":22},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":40},{"uri":"Shigeru_Miyamoto","surface_form":"Shigeru Miyamoto","offset":76},{"uri":"Fraternal_twins","surface_form":"fraternal twin","offset":147},{"uri":"Brother","surface_form":"brother","offset":162},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":186},{"uri":"Mario","surface_form":"Mario","offset":194},{"uri":"Mario_(series)","surface_form":"Mario","offset":235},{"uri":"Game_%26amp%3B_Watch","surface_form":"Mario Bros.
