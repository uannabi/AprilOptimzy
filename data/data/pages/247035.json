{"id":247035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-penetrative_sex","text":"e=\"preserve\">Non-penetrative sex is a form of sexual activity which does not involve penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth, unlike the more common penetrative sex.\nMedical professionals accept the term of non-penetrative sex. It is a way to practice safer sex and of birth control as bodily fluids are not exchanged between partners. The form of sex is practised between partners who do not feel ready, are not physically able, cannot or simply do not want to have socially appropriate penetrative sex, but still wish to have a sexual act.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_activity","surface_form":"sexual activity","offset":46},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":104},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":112},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":121},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":163},{"uri":"Safer_sex","surface_form":"safer sex","offset":254},{"uri":"Birth_control","surface_form":"birth control","offset":271}]}
