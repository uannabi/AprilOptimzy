{"id":247045,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a piecewise function is a function that is defined using multiple rules. Each rule specifies the function values for a portion of the domain, and the rules are conjoined together using the formula_1 symbol. For example, there might be a function which gives when x > 0, and when x \u2264 0.\nThe absolute value function, floor function and step function are some common functions which are usually defined piecewise.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Absolute_value","surface_form":"absolute value function","offset":319}]}
