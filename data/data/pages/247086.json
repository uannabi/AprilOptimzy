{"id":247086,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Guffman","text":"\"Waiting for Guffman\" is a musical mockumentary movie made in 1997. It was directed by Christopher Guest, who also stars in the movie. The movie is set in the small town of Blaine, Missouri, which is not a real town. The town decides to perform a musical called \"Red, White and Blaine\" to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the town, and invites a famous theater critic named Guffman to see it, hoping that he will make the play famous.\nThe name of the movie is a reference to the play \"Waiting for Godot\" by Samuel Beckett. In that play, the two main characters are waiting for a man named Godot, who never shows up. In \"Waiting for Guffman\", Guffman never shows up, either.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mockumentary","surface_form":"mockumentary","offset":35},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":181},{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"theater","offset":355},{"uri":"Waiting_for_Godot","surface_form":"Waiting for Godot","offset":487},{"uri":"Samuel_Beckett","surface_form":"Samuel Beckett","offset":509}]}
