{"id":247148,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism","text":"Neoclassicism is the name given to movements in the arts that draw upon Western classical art and culture (usually that of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome). Traditionally, Classicism is about the art made in antiquity (very long ago, in ancient times) or later art inspired by that of antiquity. But Neoclassicism is always about the art made later but inspired by antiquity. So, Classicism and Neoclassicism are often used together. It often means clearness, elegance, harmony, and rest made by careful attention to traditional forms.\nExamples of Neoclassicism in architecture include the White House and Neue Wache.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cultural_movement","surface_form":"movements","offset":35},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":52},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":98},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":123},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":141},{"uri":"Classicism","surface_form":"Classicism","offset":171},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":564},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":589},{"uri":"Neue_Wache","surface_form":"Neue Wache","offset":605}]}
