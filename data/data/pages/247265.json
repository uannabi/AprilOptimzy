{"id":247265,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property","text":"=\"preserve\">The commutative property says that the order of the numbers when adding or multiplying can be changed without changing the answer. For example, both formula_1 and formula_1 are equal to 10, and both formula_1 and formula_1 are equal to 35. This can be done with any numbers, or with more than two numbers.\nThe definition of commutative property of addition is formula_1. \"a\" and \"b\" are variables and can be any number.\nSome operations like dividing are not commutative. For instance, formula_1 is 2, but formula_1 is formula_1. Subtraction is not commutative either: formula_1 is 4, but formula_1 is negative 4.\nIn higher mathematics like calculus, there are other commutative operations besides adding and multiplying.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":399},{"uri":"Operation_(mathematics)","surface_form":"operation","offset":437},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":652}]}
