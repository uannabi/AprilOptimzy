{"id":247267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be written as a complete ratio of two integers.\nAn irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form. It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point. In addition, these digits would also not repeat. The set of irrational numbers is sometimes written as formula_1 or formula_1.\nIrrational numbers often occur in geometry. For instance, if a square has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two meters. This is an irrational number. In decimal form it is written as 1.414213... Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.\nOne well known irrational number is pi (\u03C0). This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323\u2026.\nOther examples of irrational number include the numbers formula_1 and formula_1. A number for which irrationality is not known is the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":55},{"uri":"Ratio","surface_form":"ratio","offset":104},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":117},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal","offset":180},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":211},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":423},{"uri":"Square_root_of_two","surface_form":"square root of two","offset":526},{"uri":"Mathematical_proof","surface_form":"proved","offset":648},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":664},{"uri":"Pi_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"pi","offset":782},{"uri":"Circumference","surface_form":"circumference","offset":802},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":821},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":843},{"uri":"Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant","surface_form":"Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant","offset":1082}]}
