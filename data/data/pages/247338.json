{"id":247338,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire_Ironstone_Railway","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway (the O.I.R.) was a standard gauge railway that served an ironstone quarry near the village of Wroxton in Oxfordshire. It linked to the Great Western Railway about to the east, just north of the town of Banbury. Both the quarry and line opened in 1917 and closed in 1967, when the Ironstone ran out. It never became part of British Rail and was run by the quarry's owners.\nThe quarry was heavily worked in the Second World War, due to extra war needs. A newer quarry close by is now served by trucks only.\nThe OIR operated its own fleet of steam locomotives: 0-6-0T, 0-6-0ST and 0-4-0ST's.\nHeavy clay and Ironstone deposits seround Banbury.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Standard_gauge","surface_form":"standard gauge","offset":66},{"uri":"Ironstone","surface_form":"ironstone","offset":104},{"uri":"Quarry","surface_form":"quarry","offset":114},{"uri":"Wroxton","surface_form":"Wroxton","offset":141},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":152},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":182},{"uri":"Banbury","surface_form":"Banbury","offset":249},{"uri":"Ironstone","surface_form":"Ironstone","offset":327},{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":370},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":456},{"uri":"Steam_locomotive","surface_form":"steam locomotive","offset":586},{"uri":"0-6-0","surface_form":"0-6-0","offset":605},{"uri":"Side_tank","surface_form":"T","offset":610},{"uri":"Saddle_tank_(locomotive)","surface_form":"ST","offset":618},{"uri":"0-4-0","surface_form":"0-4-0","offset":625},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":642},{"uri":"Ironstone","surface_form":"Ironstone","offset":651}]}
