{"id":247454,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Bay_Thunder_Cats","text":"The Thunder Bay Thunder Cats was the name of the Rockford IceHogs of the UHL (now the International Hockey League) prior to moving to Rockford. The team went through a number of different names prior to being the Thunder Cats, including the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks and the Thunder Bay Senators.\nHistory.\nAfter the success of the 5-time Allan Cup champion Thunder Bay Twins, the Colonial Hockey League took interest in expanding to the Northwestern Ontario city. In 1991, the Colonial league introduced the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks, spelling the end of the 21-year Twins franchise that stepped aside for the new Semi-Pro team. In 1993, the team changed its name to the Thunder Bay Senators to reflect the teams affiliation with the National Hockey League's Ottawa Senators. Soon after, the CoHL changed its name to the United Hockey League and in 1996 the team became the Thunder Bay Thunder Cats.\nAfter eight seasons in Thunder Bay, the Thunder Cats were bought, moved to Rockford, Illinois, and renamed the Rockford IceHogs in 1999.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rockford_IceHogs_(UHL)","surface_form":"Rockford IceHogs","offset":49},{"uri":"United_Hockey_League","surface_form":"UHL","offset":73},{"uri":"International_Hockey_League_(2007-)","surface_form":"International Hockey League","offset":86},{"uri":"Allan_Cup","surface_form":"Allan Cup","offset":338},{"uri":"Thunder_Bay_Twins","surface_form":"Thunder Bay Twins","offset":357},{"uri":"Colonial_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Colonial Hockey League","offset":380},{"uri":"Northwestern_Ontario","surface_form":"Northwestern Ontario","offset":437},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":734},{"uri":"Ottawa_Senators","surface_form":"Ottawa Senators","offset":759},{"uri":"United_Hockey_League","surface_form":"United Hockey League","offset":821},{"uri":"Rockford%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Rockford, Illinois","offset":975},{"uri":"Rockford_IceHogs_(UHL)","surface_form":"Rockford IceHogs","offset":1011}]}
