{"id":247467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymington_Branch_Line","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Lymington branch line is a short line running between Brockenhurst and Lymington Pier. The line is operated by South West Trains. There is a station in between called Lymington Town. The short length of track between Lymington Town and Lymington Pier has a line speed of 20mph.\nPreserved 421cig Units.\nThe two preserved 421cig units make the line a popluar destination for rail-fans. Unit 1497 \"Freshwater\" was painted in British Rail White and Blue while 1498 \"Farringford\" was painted in BR Green. The units were given names of places on the Isle of Wight as they only ran on this line. Until 22 May 22 2010 they were the only EMU slamdoor units still in operation anywhere in Britain.\nFuture of the Branch Line.\nThe line is now operated by 158/9 sprinter units. This means the 750Volt DC electric has no longer got a use. This may seem strange as most parts of the country are electrifiying lines. The reason for this is that \"450 units\" have 4 cars which are too long for Lymington Town Station. And South West Trains are not willing to remove a coach from a 450 unit. The only solution then is to use DMU 3 car sprinter units.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_West_Trains","surface_form":"South West Trains","offset":128},{"uri":"British_Rail","surface_form":"British Rail","offset":439},{"uri":"Isle_of_Wight","surface_form":"Isle of Wight","offset":561}]}
