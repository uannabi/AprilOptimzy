It is the agent which causes anthrax.\nDescription.\nThe bacillus lives in soils worldwide at moderate temperatures. It can be grown in aerobic or anaerobic conditions (it is a facultative anaerobe) in a medium with essential nutrients, including carbon and nitrogen sources. In 1877, this organism was the first to be shown to cause disease by Robert Koch and verified by Louis Pasteur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"gram-positive","offset":26},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":51},{"uri":"%C2%B5m","surface_form":"\u00B5m","offset":66},{"uri":"Anthrax","surface_form":"anthrax","offset":128},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":172},{"uri":"Aerobic","surface_form":"aerobic","offset":233},{"uri":"Anaerobic","surface_form":"anaerobic","offset":244},{"uri":"Facultative_anaerobe","surface_form":"facultative anaerobe","offset":274},{"uri":"Nutrients","surface_form":"nutrients","offset":323},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":344},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":355},{"uri":"Robert_Koch","surface_form":"Robert Koch","offset":442},{"uri":"Louis_Pasteur","surface_form":"Louis Pasteur","offset":470}]}
