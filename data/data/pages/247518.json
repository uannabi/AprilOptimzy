{"id":247518,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christadelphians","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Christadelphians are a Christian denomination that developed in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 19th century. Other names for them include Brothers of Christ and Christ's Brethren. They were in effect founded by John Thomas, but do not consider him greater than any other teacher. Today, there are about 55,000-60,000 Christadelphians. Many of them live in Britain, Australia, Africa and the United States.\nIdeas.\nTheir ideas are close to other Restorationist movements such as the Anabaptist movement. They say that when Christianity came in contact with the Hellenic world, it was spoiled. Therefore, they only accept teachings that can be found in the Bible. They think that the Bible was inspired by God and they accept no other texts.\nCommunity.\nThey do not have priests or pastors, instead each local church has a group of elders who are chosen by the members each year. Most male members take turns to speak each week.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":40},{"uri":"Christian_denomination","surface_form":"denomination","offset":50},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":85},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":108},{"uri":"John_Thomas_(Christadelphian)","surface_form":"John Thomas","offset":245},{"uri":"Restorationism","surface_form":"Restorationist","offset":478},{"uri":"Anabaptist","surface_form":"Anabaptist","offset":515},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Hellenic","offset":593},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":688},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":737}]}
