{"id":247909,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion","text":"Ambient occlusion is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to estimate how light behaves. The physics of how photons of light can occupy a space says that inner corners of objects (or space where two objects are close to each other) have less light and appear darker (have more shadow).\nImagine being inside a matte white cube with even light; the surface color is exactly the same so theoretically you shouldn't be able to see any corners or edges; but because of the described effect you can.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":41},{"uri":"Computer_graphics","surface_form":"computer graphics","offset":44}]}
