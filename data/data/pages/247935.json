New York City, N.Y. 1957) was an important sugar and railroad magnate. He served as Cuba\u2019s ambassador to the United States from 1932 until 1934.\nCintas used to be a Cuban Ambassador to the United States. Cintas liked to collect art and manuscripts. He had bought the Bliss Copy for $54,000 at a public auction in 1949. It \"set a new high record for the sale of a document at public auction\". The Castro government claimed Cintas' properties after it became powerful in 1959. But Cintas, who died in 1957, had willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, if it would be kept at the White House. It was moved there in 1959, and is still there today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":115},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":125},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":156},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"ambassador","offset":163},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":181},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":237},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"Ambassador","offset":243},{"uri":"Auction","surface_form":"auction","offset":374},{"uri":"Will_(law)","surface_form":"willed","offset":581}]}
