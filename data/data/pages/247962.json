It can be called a crescent or a crescent roll. Although a crescent roll may be smaller. It is made of a variant of puff pastry. A croissant can be eaten with savory or sweet fillings.\nHistory.\nBreads shaped like crescents have been around since the Medieval times. Before the croissant, there was a version of the croissant called a \"feteer meshaltet\". It came from Egypt. Many years later, a crescent-shaped version of feteer meshaltet was made. It was called \"feteer halali\" (crescent feteer). The feteer halali became popular throughout Europe, especially France. Later, feteer halali became known as a croissant.\nCroissants used to be only available to aristocrats. Marie Antoinette is believed to have introduced it to the French elites. Now they are available in any supermarkets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":27},{"uri":"Puff_pastry","surface_form":"puff pastry","offset":234},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":368},{"uri":"Feteer_meshaltet","surface_form":"feteer meshaltet","offset":453},{"uri":"Feteer_meshaltet","surface_form":"feteer meshaltet","offset":539},{"uri":"Aristocrat","surface_form":"aristocrats","offset":776},{"uri":"Marie_Antoinette","surface_form":"Marie Antoinette","offset":789},{"uri":"Upper_class","surface_form":"elites","offset":854}]}
