{"id":248048,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Wittenham","text":"Long Wittenham is a village on the south bank of the River Thames in South Oxfordshire. In 1974 it came from Berkshire to the county of Oxfordshire.\nHistory.\nThere are crop marks (dating from the 6th Century) that there must have been a large collection of buildings, maybe a royal palace or at least high status Saxon enclosure. The number of objects that were found in Saxon burial sites around the village support this. These large, Saxon burial sites also indicate a good sized population, that lasted over many years.\nThe village was mentioned in the Domesday Book. By Tudor times, it had a population of around 200, with crops: wheat, oats, barley and even rye. Following a local legend Oliver Cromwell addressed the villagers on his way to his niece's wedding, in neighbouring Little Wittenham.\nBuildings.\nThe village Cross has First Millennial origins: the base dating from the 7th century. St. Birinus preached here when he brought Christianity to the area. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary, begun around 1120, is on the site of a previous Saxon church. Cruck Cottage can be architecturally dated to being around 800 years old and as such is (possibly) the oldest house in South Oxfordshire.\nThe building housing Pendon Museum, originally started life as The Three Poplars - a working man's pub. It was sold in 1954 and now houses a model railway museum.\nLocation.\nLong Wittenham is in the Thames Valley north of Didcot, and southeast of Abingdon. To the west is the village of Appleford, which has the nearest railway station, on the line between Didcot and Oxford.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":53},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":75},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":136},{"uri":"Domesday_Book","surface_form":"Domesday Book","offset":556},{"uri":"House_of_Tudor","surface_form":"Tudor","offset":574},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":686},{"uri":"Oliver_Cromwell","surface_form":"Oliver Cromwell","offset":693},{"uri":"Little_Wittenham","surface_form":"Little Wittenham","offset":784},{"uri":"Birinus","surface_form":"St. Birinus","offset":899},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":941},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Church of England","offset":971},{"uri":"Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","surface_form":"Saint Mary","offset":1006},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon_architecture","surface_form":"Saxon","offset":1066},{"uri":"Cruck","surface_form":"Cruck","offset":1080},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":1365},{"uri":"Didcot","surface_form":"Didcot","offset":1439},{"uri":"Abingdon","surface_form":"Abingdon","offset":1464},{"uri":"Appleford","surface_form":"Appleford","offset":1504},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":1537}]}
