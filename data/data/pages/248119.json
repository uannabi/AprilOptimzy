There are four subspecies of the bird. They live in Australian forests. Farmers do not like sulphur-crested cockatoos because the cockatoos eat vegetables that the farmers have grown. They are a protected species, but sometimes get shot.\nMany people like sulphur-crested cockatoos and keep them as pets. They are very loud and have a natural desire to chew wood and other materials. They are very long-lived. In captivity they can live to 70 years.
