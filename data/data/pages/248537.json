The club is from Aue in Saxony.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded as SG Aue in 1945 and on 1 November 1948 became BSG Pneumatik Aue. Changes in sponsorship led to a change in name to Zentra Wismut Aue in 1949 and then simply to SC Wismut Aue in 1951. 1951 they promoted to the DDR-Oberliga. In 1954 the government decided that the nearby city Chemnitz(now called Karl-Marx-Stadt) should have a good team. So the name of Aue was changed to SC Wismut Karl Marx Stadt. But the club still played in Aue. In 1963 Karl Marx Stadt got its own team so the club was renamed to SC Wismut Aue.\nTill 1989 Aue was one of the most successful teams in the DDR.
