{"id":248586,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage","text":"The Northwest Passage is a sea passage along the north coast of North America, through the Arctic Ocean. Because of ice, the passage is usually closed to ships.\nThe Spanish Empire wanted to reach Asia by a western route, because Portugal controlled the eastern route around the Cape of Good Hope. Spain wanted to have a route that it could control. This caused most European countries to search for a possible route. Roald Amundsen was the first person to navigate the passage between 1903 and 1906.\nGlobal warming is increasing the melting for the Passage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":64},{"uri":"Arctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Arctic Ocean","offset":91},{"uri":"Spanish_Empire","surface_form":"Spanish Empire","offset":165},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":196},{"uri":"Trade_route","surface_form":"route","offset":214},{"uri":"Portuguese_Empire","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":229},{"uri":"Cape_of_Good_Hope","surface_form":"Cape of Good Hope","offset":278},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":366},{"uri":"Roald_Amundsen","surface_form":"Roald Amundsen","offset":417},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"Global warming","offset":500}]}
