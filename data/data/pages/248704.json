{"id":248704,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodontosaur","text":"The Heterodontosauridae (\"different-toothed lizards\") is a family of early ornithischian dinosaurs.\nThey have often been considered basal ornithopods, although recent studies suggest they may have been more closely related to marginocephalians. Although their fossils are rare, they lived around the globe beginning in the Upper Triassic and may have persisted into the Lower Cretaceous.\nJaws and teeth.\nA large gap, called a diastema, separated the premaxillary teeth from the those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw bone) in many ornithischia, but this diastema was arched in heterodontosaurs.\nThe mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischia. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.\nHeterodontosaurids are called that because they have two different kinds of teeth. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the early Jurassic \"Abrictosaurus\", \"Heterodontosaurus\", and \"Lycorhinus\", the first two premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the \"caniniform\" or 'tusk'.\nClassification.\nSeveral early studies suggested that heterodontosaurs were primitive ornithischians. The main hypothesis in recent years has put heterodontosaurids in as basal ornithopods. However, others have suggested that heterodontosaurs share a common ancestor with Marginocephalia (ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs). This has support from some recent studies. A clade containing heterodontosaurs and marginocephalians has been named Heterodontosauriformes. Heterodontosaurs may even be basal to both ornithopods and marginocephalians. In 2007, a cladistic analysis suggested that heterodontosaurs are basal to all known ornithischians except \"Pisanosaurus\", a result that echoes some of the very earliest work on the family.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ornithischia","surface_form":"ornithischia","offset":75},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":89},{"uri":"Ornithopod","surface_form":"ornithopod","offset":138},{"uri":"Marginocephalia","surface_form":"marginocephalia","offset":226},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":323},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":370},{"uri":"Diastema","surface_form":"diastema","offset":426},{"uri":"Maxilla","surface_form":"maxilla","offset":491},{"uri":"Ornithischia","surface_form":"ornithischia","offset":533},{"uri":"Mandible","surface_form":"mandible","offset":601},{"uri":"Ornithischia","surface_form":"ornithischia","offset":669},{"uri":"Beak","surface_form":"beak","offset":710},{"uri":"Premaxilla","surface_form":"premaxilla","offset":747},{"uri":"Dentary","surface_form":"dentary","offset":808},{"uri":"Abrictosaurus","surface_form":"Abrictosaurus","offset":965},{"uri":"Heterodontosaurus","surface_form":"Heterodontosaurus","offset":982},{"uri":"Lycorhinus","surface_form":"Lycorhinus","offset":1007},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":1313},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":1373},{"uri":"Ornithopod","surface_form":"ornithopod","offset":1379},{"uri":"Marginocephalia","surface_form":"Marginocephalia","offset":1474},{"uri":"Pachycephalosaur","surface_form":"pachycephalosaur","offset":1508},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":1573},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":1697},{"uri":"Cladistic","surface_form":"cladistic","offset":1757},{"uri":"Pisanosaurus","surface_form":"Pisanosaurus","offset":1854}]}
