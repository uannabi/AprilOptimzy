{"id":248791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoptera","text":"Neoptera is a classification group that has almost all the winged insects, mostly those that can flex their wings over their abdomens. This is in contrast with the more basal orders of winged insects, which are not able to flex their wings in this way.\nThe Neoptera can be contrasted with the Palaeoptera, the 'ancient-winged' insects, which include the Odonata, the Ephemeroptera and extinct groups such as the Palaeodictyoptera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":14},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":59},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":66},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":125},{"uri":"Basal_(evolution)","surface_form":"basal","offset":169},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":175},{"uri":"Palaeoptera","surface_form":"Palaeoptera","offset":293},{"uri":"Odonata","surface_form":"Odonata","offset":354},{"uri":"Ephemeroptera","surface_form":"Ephemeroptera","offset":367},{"uri":"Palaeodictyoptera","surface_form":"Palaeodictyoptera","offset":412}]}
