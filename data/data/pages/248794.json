{"id":248794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endopterygota","text":"The Endopterygota (or Holometabola), are insects of the subclass Pterygota.\nThey have complete metamorphosis. This means they go through different larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larval and adult stages differ very much in their anatomy and behavior. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.\nThey are distinguished from the Exopterygota (or Hemipterodea) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (\"internal winged forms\") develop wings inside the body during metamorphosis.\nThe earliest endopterygote fossils date from the Carboniferous.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":41},{"uri":"Pterygota","surface_form":"Pterygota","offset":65},{"uri":"Metamorphosis","surface_form":"complete metamorphosis","offset":86},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":147},{"uri":"Pupa","surface_form":"pupa","offset":155},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":166},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":234},{"uri":"Behavior","surface_form":"behavior","offset":246},{"uri":"Holometabolism","surface_form":"holometabolism","offset":271},{"uri":"Exopterygota","surface_form":"Exopterygota","offset":345},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":536},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":558}]}
