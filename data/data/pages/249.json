{"id":249,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything2","text":"=\"preserve\">Everything2 or E2 is a website. It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a diary.\nE2 users create pages called \"nodes\" and add stuff in \"writeups\". Only logged-in users can create writeups. Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called \"gods\") choose can edit the writeup. On the other hand, on Wikipedia, anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages.\nEverything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does. So, it is possible to have more than one article (writeups) under the same title (node), each by different authors, and presenting different points of view.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":35},{"uri":"Diary","surface_form":"diary","offset":127},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":383},{"uri":"Neutral_point_of_view","surface_form":"neutral point of view","offset":519}]}
