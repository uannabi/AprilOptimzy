For example, websites might have important information in a sound file with somebody reading it out loud, which would make it possible for people who are blind or who have trouble seeing to get the information. Another way of making a website more accessible would be to remove an image with flashing lights, because such images could give some people seizures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":47},{"uri":"Blind","surface_form":"blind","offset":285},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":412},{"uri":"Seizure","surface_form":"seizure","offset":483}]}
