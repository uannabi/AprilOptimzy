{"id":249163,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffatitan","text":"\"Giraffatitan\" (\"giraffe titan\") is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs which lived during the Upper Jurassic, about 140 million years ago. It was related to \"Brachiosaurus\", and was one of the largest animals known to have walked the earth.\nGiraffatitans were about long and weighed about. They had very long necks and were well adapted for feeding on the tall conifers which were the main trees in the Jurassic forests. They lived in what is now Tanzania.\nIt was first named as an African species of \"Brachiosaurus\" (\"B. brancai\") in 1914. In 1991, George Olshevsky said there were enough differences to make its own genus, creating \"Giraffatitan\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":38},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":47},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":56},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"Upper Jurassic","offset":89},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":115},{"uri":"Brachiosaurus","surface_form":"Brachiosaurus","offset":153},{"uri":"Neck","surface_form":"neck","offset":304},{"uri":"Conifers","surface_form":"conifers","offset":356},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":442},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":485},{"uri":"Brachiosaurus","surface_form":"Brachiosaurus","offset":497}]}
