Esotericism also describes mystical, spiritual or occult viewpoints (point of view). Esotericism studies Gnosticism, Yoga, Alchemy, Magic, Spiritualism, Hypnosis, Astrology, Meditation, Mysticism, and Occultism. Many followers of Abrahamic faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, have criticized Esotericism as black magic. Esotericism in religion is called \"obscurantism\".\nEsotericism can also be about understanding symbolism and hidden meanings of many different books. They include religious books, philosophy books and books about history. They use these books as their texts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mysticism","surface_form":"mystical","offset":107},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":117},{"uri":"Occult","surface_form":"occult","offset":130},{"uri":"Point_of_view","surface_form":"point of view","offset":149},{"uri":"Gnosticism","surface_form":"Gnosticism","offset":185},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"Yoga","offset":197},{"uri":"Alchemy","surface_form":"Alchemy","offset":203},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"Magic","offset":212},{"uri":"Spiritualism","surface_form":"Spiritualism","offset":219},{"uri":"Hypnosis","surface_form":"Hypnosis","offset":233},{"uri":"Astrology","surface_form":"Astrology","offset":243},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"Meditation","offset":254},{"uri":"Mysticism","surface_form":"Mysticism","offset":266},{"uri":"Occultism","surface_form":"Occultism","offset":281},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":341},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":358},{"uri":"Black_magic","surface_form":"black magic","offset":396},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":571},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":588},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":621},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":660}]}
