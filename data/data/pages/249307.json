The first object is an \"indirect object\", the second is a \"direct object\". Notice that, in the last example, you sent a letter, not your son. The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object.\nHere some grammarians also see \"son\" as the indirect object (\"letter\" is the term which cannot be left out).p720","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":56}]}
