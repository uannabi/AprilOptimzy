{"id":249318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(grammar)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Voice in grammar expresses the way the action (or state) that the verb expresses relates to the subject or object. In English grammar, there are two voices: active and passive. When a clause is in the active voice, the subject is the doer of the action. When a clause is in the passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action. The active voice is much more commonly used than the passive voice.\nForming the Passive Voice.\nIn passive clauses, the object is moved to the subject position. Generally, only transitive verbs can be transformed into the passive voice, because only transitive verbs have with objects. Verbs in the passive voice are formed using the past participle of the main verb with the auxiliary verb conjugated into the appropriate tense.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":22},{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":109},{"uri":"Object_(grammar)","surface_form":"object","offset":120},{"uri":"Transitivity_(grammar)","surface_form":"transitive verbs","offset":525}]}
