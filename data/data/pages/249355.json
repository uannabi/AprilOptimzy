{"id":249355,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_to_Fall","text":"\"Ready to Fall\" is the first single by melodic hardcore band Rise Against from their fourth studio album, \"The Sufferer & The Witness\" (2006).\nAn acoustic version of this song was done live on the CJZN Radio station in Victoria, British Columbia, on January 18, 2007, before a Billy Talent concert featuring Rise Against, Anti-Flag, and Moneen.\nOn March 12, 2009, the song became a downloadable song in the video game, \"Guitar Hero World Tour\". It is also shown in Tap Tap Revenge 3 on the iPhone and iPod Touch as a downloadable double song pack with Audience of One. The song was also shown in 2009 action movie 12 Rounds.\nMusic video.\nThe video was made in 2006. It is about pollution and its effects on the environment. The video is 3 minutes and 52 seconds long. It cuts between shots of the band playing and shots of animals being saved or dying, if not already dead. This is from many environmental dangers made by humans. At the end of the video, lead singer Tim McIlrath says, \"Every action has a reaction. We've got one planet, one chance.\"\nThere was also a version played on television. There are also ones that are more graphic. This was never really released. But it is available on some websites. The video serves a testimony to veganism. Rise Against is an active supporter of PETA, a animal rights organization, and the band members are all active vegetarians.\nChart performance.\nThe song got to number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. It is the lowest charting single from \"The Sufferer & the Witness\". Although, it was the band's second highest charting single.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":29},{"uri":"Melodic_hardcore","surface_form":"melodic hardcore","offset":39},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":56},{"uri":"Rise_Against","surface_form":"Rise Against","offset":61},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":92},{"uri":"The_Sufferer_%26amp%3B_The_Witness","surface_form":"The Sufferer & The Witness","offset":107},{"uri":"Billy_Talent","surface_form":"Billy Talent","offset":277},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":290},{"uri":"Anti-Flag","surface_form":"Anti-Flag","offset":322},{"uri":"Moneen","surface_form":"Moneen","offset":337},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":407},{"uri":"Guitar_Hero_World_Tour","surface_form":"Guitar Hero World Tour","offset":420},{"uri":"Tap_Tap_Revenge_3","surface_form":"Tap Tap Revenge 3","offset":465},{"uri":"IPhone","surface_form":"iPhone","offset":490},{"uri":"IPod_Touch","surface_form":"iPod Touch","offset":501},{"uri":"Audience_of_One_(Rise_Against_song)","surface_form":"Audience of One","offset":552},{"uri":"12_Rounds_(film)","surface_form":"12 Rounds","offset":614},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"pollution","offset":678},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":711},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":823},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":922},{"uri":"Lead_singer","surface_form":"lead singer","offset":955},{"uri":"Tim_McIlrath","surface_form":"Tim McIlrath","offset":967},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":1201},{"uri":"Testimony","surface_form":"testimony","offset":1230},{"uri":"Veganism","surface_form":"veganism","offset":1243},{"uri":"PETA","surface_form":"PETA","offset":1292},{"uri":"Vegetarian","surface_form":"vegetarian","offset":1364}]}
