{"id":249444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se","text":"Edgard Victor Achille Charles Var\u00E8se, whose name was also spelled Edgar Var\u00E8se (December 22, 1883 \u2013 November 6, 1965), was a French composer who spent the greater part of his career in the United States.\nVar\u00E8se's music has an emphasis on timbre and rhythm. He made up the term \"organized sound.\" This phrase means that some timbres and rhythms can be grouped together. Although his finished works only last about three hours, he has been thought as an influence by many big composers of the late 20th century. His use of new instruments and electronic resources led to his being known as the \"Father of Electronic Music\" while Henry Miller described him as \"The stratospheric Colossus of Sound\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":125},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":132},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":189},{"uri":"Timbre","surface_form":"timbre","offset":238},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":249},{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"phrase","offset":301},{"uri":"Hour","surface_form":"hour","offset":419},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":452},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":496},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrument","offset":525},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic resources","offset":541},{"uri":"Henry_Miller","surface_form":"Henry Miller","offset":627}]}
