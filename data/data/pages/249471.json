{"id":249471,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_grammar","text":"e=\"preserve\">A text grammar is the study of texts above the level of the sentence. It shows how texts are put together so as to convey ideas, facts, messages, and fiction.\nA similar term is discourse analysis. Both are mostly concerned with natural language use; discourse analysis would include spoken language. Speech is also the parent of rhetoric, the ancient study of persuasive speaking. In a similar way, literary criticism parallels text grammar, because both concentrate on the printed word. A text grammar approach puts emphasis on the linguistic structure of a text, rather than its cultural or symbolic meaning.\nA text is a coherent body of sentences. Coherent means they are linked by a consistent \"theme\". The text ends when \"completion\" is signalled. For example, when a problem introduced at the start is solved, or when a promised discussion has reached a conclusion.\nText types.\nMany texts, of course, can and do have a mixture of two or more of these types.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":73},{"uri":"Discourse_analysis","surface_form":"discourse analysis","offset":190},{"uri":"Rhetoric","surface_form":"rhetoric","offset":342},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticism","offset":421},{"uri":"Parallel","surface_form":"parallel","offset":431},{"uri":"Print","surface_form":"print","offset":487},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistic structure","offset":546},{"uri":"Cultural","surface_form":"cultural","offset":594},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":786}]}
