The INC says it was made by Jesus Christ. The church does not believe in the religious teachings of the Trinity, including the teaching that Jesus is God.\nFelix Manalo joined many religious organizations as a young adult. He said that God gave him a mission to teach the gospel and to bring back the first church made by Jesus. The INC began with a handful of followers on July 27, 1914 in Punta, Santa Ana, Manila, with Manalo as highest minister. It has now spread to many different countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"IPA","offset":18},{"uri":"Filipino_language","surface_form":"Filipino","offset":24},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":69},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":98},{"uri":"Felix_Manalo","surface_form":"Felix Manalo","offset":113},{"uri":"1914","surface_form":"1914","offset":129},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":163},{"uri":"Christ","surface_form":"Christ","offset":169},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":212},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":276},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":285},{"uri":"Gospel","surface_form":"gospel","offset":406},{"uri":"July_27","surface_form":"July 27","offset":508},{"uri":"1914","surface_form":"1914","offset":517},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":543},{"uri":"Minister","surface_form":"minister","offset":574}]}
