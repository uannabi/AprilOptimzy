{"id":249658,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapsychology","text":"Parapsychology is the study of psychic events. These phenomona involve the exchange of information between a person and their environment, without the use of the five senses. They include extrasensory perception (such as telepathy), influence of mind on matter (psychokinesis), anomalous experiences (such as past life experiences and near death experiences) and apparitions. Such things have been reported for a very long time.\nIn 2005, Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson said that many scientists are not yet swayed by the evidence for parapsychology and the paranormal. Josephson contends that some scientists feel uncomfortable about ideas such as telepathy and that their emotions sometimes get in the way when making evaluations.\nBelief Dependent Realism Theory.\nCreated by psychologist Michael Shermer. It states that the brain makes sense of the world by seeing patterns. Because of this the mind is constantly looking for new patterns to better understand the world. However, sometimes the mind finds patterns where none exist. This is called Paternicity or pareidolia. It is the tendency to find patterns, even when they aren\u2019t really there. When this happens people often view the world through these false patterns.\nHeuristics.\nHeuristics are ways of thinking that conserve mental effort that allow quick decisions about a large amount of information. One problem with heuristics is that they are often wrong.\nTypes of heuristics.\nAnchoring and Adjustment is a type of heuristic in which a person makes an educated guess about a question. Then, when that person learns new information they adjust their answer around their original guess. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first discovered this type of heuristic. In one of their first studies on Anchoring and Adjustment they gave divided participants into two groups, gave them one of two problems and asked them to guess the answer.\n1 is the anchor in the first problem and 2 is the anchor in the second problem. The average guess of the group given the first problem (with 1 as the anchor) is much lower than the group given the second problem (with 2 as the anchor). The average guess of the first group was 512 and the average guess of the second group was 2,250. Even though these answers were very different both were very far from the true answer, which was 40,320.\nThe Availability Heuristic is used when a person answers a question based on how easily instances of an event come to mind. An example would be living in a neighborhood with a high crime rate and overestimating the amount of robberies that take place in the United States every year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"psychic","offset":31},{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"five senses","offset":162},{"uri":"Telepathy","surface_form":"telepathy","offset":221},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":246},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":254},{"uri":"Psychokinesis","surface_form":"psychokinesis","offset":262},{"uri":"Reincarnation","surface_form":"past life experiences","offset":309},{"uri":"Near_death_experience","surface_form":"near death experience","offset":335},{"uri":"Ghosts","surface_form":"apparition","offset":363},{"uri":"Nobel_prize","surface_form":"Nobel Laureate","offset":438},{"uri":"Brian_Josephson","surface_form":"Brian Josephson","offset":453},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"paranormal","offset":557},{"uri":"Telepathy","surface_form":"telepathy","offset":648},{"uri":"Michael_Shermer","surface_form":"Michael Shermer","offset":789},{"uri":"Pareidolia","surface_form":"pareidolia","offset":1063},{"uri":"Amos_Tversky","surface_form":"Amos Tversky","offset":1661},{"uri":"Daniel_Kahneman","surface_form":"Daniel Kahneman","offset":1678}]}
