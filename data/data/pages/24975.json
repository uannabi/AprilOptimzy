Almost 20 years of his life he spent in Munich and Turin. Tyutchev was a good friend of Heinrich Heine, knew Schelling as well. Tyutchev didn\u2019t want people to know him as a poet. He didn\u2019t take any part in a literary life.\nWorks.\nHe has around 400 of his poems. Russian people quote them very often. His early poems are made in Russian poetic tradition of the XVIII century. In the 1830s we can find an influence of European (especially German) romanticism on Tyutchev\u2019s lyrics. He writes philosophic poems about the universe, nature and human being. In 1840s Tyutchev wrote several articles about relations between Russia and Occidental civilization. In 1850s Tyutchev created several heartfelt poems, in which we can see love as a tragedy. These poems are combined into one cycle, named \u201CDenisievsky\u201D. \u201CDenisievsky\u201D means dedicated to a mistress of Tyutchev \u2013 Elena Alexandrovna Denisieva. In 1860s\u20131870s Tyutchev wrote mainly political poems.\nThe most famous Tyutchev's poem is \u201CSilentium!\u201D. This is a hard appeal to be silent. Because a man never can understand another person. A line \u201CA word once uttered is untrue\u201D is one of the most popular aphorisms of Tyutchev. As well as \u201CWe can\u2019t understand Russia by the reason\u201D and \u201CWe are not know, what will be the respond for our word\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"rus","offset":27},{"uri":"December_5","surface_form":"December 5","offset":87},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":98},{"uri":"July_27","surface_form":"July 27","offset":105},{"uri":"1873","surface_form":"1873","offset":114},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":152},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":160},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":207},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":218},{"uri":"Heinrich_Heine","surface_form":"Heinrich Heine","offset":255},{"uri":"German_idealism","surface_form":"Schelling","offset":276},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"XVIII","offset":527},{"uri":"1830s","surface_form":"1830s","offset":549},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"romanticism","offset":612},{"uri":"1840s","surface_form":"1840s","offset":721},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":783},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"Occidental civilization","offset":794},{"uri":"1850s","surface_form":"1850s","offset":822},{"uri":"1860s","surface_form":"1860s","offset":1062},{"uri":"1870s","surface_form":"1870s","offset":1068}]}
