{"id":25001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peoples","text":"Slavs live in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe, Central Asia and North Asia. Present-day Slavic peoples are classified into\u00A0West Slavs\u00A0(mainly Poles,\u00A0Czechs\u00A0and\u00A0Slovaks),\u00A0East Slavs\u00A0(mainly Russians,\u00A0Belarusians, and\u00A0Ukrainians), and\u00A0South Slavs (mainly Serbs,\u00A0Bulgarians,\u00A0Croats,\u00A0Bosniaks,\u00A0Macedonians,\u00A0Slovenes, and\u00A0Montenegrins).\n, Austrians, Hungarians, Romanians (although 1/3 of Romanian population is made of Slavic population, mainly , Serbians and Bulgarians), Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians (and these 3 countries have sizable Russian and Poles population, so much so that they make a majority etnic groups in those countries) live near the Slavic nations but are not Slavs themselves. There are more Slavs than any other ethnic group in Europe. Russians make up the most Slavs, followed by Poles and Ukrainians.\nThere are many small historic Slavic nations like Lusatia (and Lusatian Serbs stil live in eastern Germany), Rusin, Kashubia and others. Russia is now the most powerful and populated Slavic country, but in the 10th century Serbs and Czechs were powerful, in 13th and 14th century Serbs were powerful, and in the 16th century Poland was the strongest nation in the area.\nThe Slavic languages are closely related. The largest similarities can be found within the same group (for example, Polish and Slovak, both West Slavic languages), but similarities exist even between Slavic languages from other different subgroups (such as Bulgarian and Russian).\nHowever, the greastest similarities are between Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian, which are South Slavic languages. They are considered separate by the Bosnian and Croatian governments (the separation is of political nature), but linguistically they are one language- Serbo-Croatian (since Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin are more similar than those variants of English, German. Dutch, or Hindi\u2013Urdu, and mutual intelligibility between their speakers \"exceeds that between the standard variants of English, French, German or Spanish).\nSlavic languages are spoken natively by 300 million people and as second or third languages by many more people in countries as far away as Germany and China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":14},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":30},{"uri":"Southeast_Europe","surface_form":"Southeast Europe","offset":46},{"uri":"West_Slavs","surface_form":"West Slavs","offset":140},{"uri":"Poles","surface_form":"Poles","offset":159},{"uri":"Czechs","surface_form":"Czechs","offset":166},{"uri":"Slovaks","surface_form":"Slovaks","offset":177},{"uri":"East_Slavs","surface_form":"East Slavs","offset":187},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russians","offset":206},{"uri":"Belarusians","surface_form":"Belarusians","offset":216},{"uri":"Ukrainians","surface_form":"Ukrainians","offset":233},{"uri":"South_Slavs","surface_form":"South Slavs","offset":250},{"uri":"Serbs","surface_form":"Serbs","offset":270},{"uri":"Bulgarians","surface_form":"Bulgarians","offset":277},{"uri":"Croats","surface_form":"Croats","offset":289},{"uri":"Bosniaks","surface_form":"Bosniaks","offset":297},{"uri":"Macedonians_(ethnic_group)","surface_form":"Macedonians","offset":307},{"uri":"Slovenes","surface_form":"Slovenes","offset":320},{"uri":"Montenegrins","surface_form":"Montenegrins","offset":334},{"uri":"Hungarians","surface_form":",","offset":349},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austrians","offset":351},{"uri":"Hungarians","surface_form":", Hungarians","offset":360},{"uri":"Romanians","surface_form":"Romanians","offset":374},{"uri":"Serbs","surface_form":", Serbians","offset":458},{"uri":"Bulgarians","surface_form":"Bulgarians","offset":473},{"uri":"Estonia","surface_form":"Estonia","offset":486},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":497},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":513},{"uri":"Poles","surface_form":"Poles","offset":570},{"uri":"Lusatia","surface_form":"Lusatia","offset":894},{"uri":"Lusatian_Serbs","surface_form":"Lusatian Serbs","offset":907},{"uri":"Rusin","surface_form":"Rusin","offset":953},{"uri":"Kashubia","surface_form":"Kashubia","offset":960},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic languages","offset":1218},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":1330},{"uri":"Slovak_language","surface_form":"Slovak","offset":1341},{"uri":"Bulgarian_language","surface_form":"Bulgarian","offset":1471},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":1485},{"uri":"Serbian_language","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":1543},{"uri":"Bosnian_language","surface_form":"Bosnian","offset":1552},{"uri":"Croatian_language","surface_form":"Croatian","offset":1564},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1865},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":1874},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":1882},{"uri":"Hindustani_language","surface_form":"Hindi\u2013Urdu","offset":1892},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":2010},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":2028},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":2178},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":2190}]}
