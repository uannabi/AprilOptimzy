{"id":250030,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babysitter","text":"e=\"preserve\">A babysitter, or 'sitter', is a person paid to look after a family's child or children when the parents are away for a short time. Babysitters are often teenage females. Babysitters are different than nannies in that they only supervise, or look after, children for a short while instead of an extended length of time. Babysitters are popular in American and European countries, but now it is getting popular in Asian countries, like Japan and China.\nGeneral.\nMost of the time, babysitters are in middle school, high school or college. Their age can range from thirteen (13) and up. There are some adults who have in home childcare as well. The type of work for babysitting workers also varies from watching a sleeping child, changing diapers, playing games, preparing meals, to teaching the child to read or even driving (if the age is right), depending on the agreement between parents and babysitter.\nOrganizations.\nIn some countries there are organizations that produce training courses for babysitters, such as the American Red Cross, and they mainly focusing on child safety and first aid for infants and children. These classes or courses can be provided at local hospitals, libraries, and sometimes schools. These classes can teach the babysitter to keep both the child, or children, and the babysitter safe in different health and weather conditions. CPR is a common technique used to help someone breathe in an emergency. First aid is the practice of basic healthcare, like tending for a sprained ankle. You can be certified in either of these things. These are important things for a babysitter to learn in their everyday practice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
