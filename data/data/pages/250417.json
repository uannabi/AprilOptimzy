{"id":250417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_atonement","text":"Blood atonement was once a teaching of the Mormon Church. Brigham Young first preached about blood atonement in the 1850s, though Joseph Smith may have thought of it first.\nBlood atonement taught that murder is so bad that the only way the murderer could pay for their sins was to be killed. This was sometimes called \"blood-for-blood\" punishment because it was used to punish murder. However, sometimes it was also used for non-violent crimes, like denying or leaving the church or marrying someone of a different race.\nThe idea of blood atonement led to firing squads being allowed in Utah for many years. It also may have led to the Mountain Meadows Massacre, where Mormons killed some emigrants from Arkansas.\nAt one time, most Mormons believed in blood atonement. Today, only\u00A0some fundamentalists do.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","surface_form":"Mormon Church","offset":43},{"uri":"Brigham_Young","surface_form":"Brigham Young","offset":58},{"uri":"Joseph_Smith","surface_form":"Joseph Smith","offset":130},{"uri":"Firing_squad","surface_form":"firing squads","offset":556},{"uri":"Mountain_Meadows_Massacre","surface_form":"Mountain Meadows Massacre","offset":636},{"uri":"Emigrant","surface_form":"emigrants","offset":689},{"uri":"Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints","surface_form":"some fundamentalists do","offset":781}]}
