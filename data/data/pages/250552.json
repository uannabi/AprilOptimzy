US 101 was also one of the original U.S. Routes established in 1926.\nThis route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System.\nUS 101 starts at Olympia, Washington, runs south through the rest of Washington, through Oregon and then through California to Los Angeles.\nThe Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is part of US 101.\nSouthern Californians usually refer to the highway as The 101 (where it is mostly a freeway). In Northern California, people simply call it 101.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":7},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":21},{"uri":"United_States_Numbered_Highways","surface_form":"U.S. Routes","offset":98},{"uri":"California_Freeway_and_Expressway_System","surface_form":"California Freeway and Expressway System","offset":283},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":351},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":414},{"uri":"Golden_Gate_Bridge","surface_form":"Golden Gate Bridge","offset":469}]}
