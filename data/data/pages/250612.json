The Japanese conventions of geography and history divide the nation into eight regions, including the Ch\u016Bbu region. These have been used since 1905 as basic units for description and comparison and as cultural markers.\nThe regions of Japan are a fusion of historical divisions and modern administrative needs\". The significance of the region in Japan is geographical, cultural and administrative.\nHistory.\nIn the late 7th century, the \"Hokurid\u014D\" was identified as one of the eight largest administrative areas of the Imperial system (\"ritsuryo seido\").\n\"Gokishichid\u014D\" is an ancient system of names for parts of the country, including \"Hokurid\u014D\". Ch\u016Bbu covers a central part of the island of Honsh\u016B in roughly the same area as the traditional \"Hokuriku\", \"K\u014Dshin'etsu\" and \"T\u014Dkai\".\nIn the Meiji period, the modern regional system was made by Imperial decree. Japan was divided into regions (\"[http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/languagesofsecurity/2011/05/27/japanese-region/ chih\u014D] \"), including the Hokuriku and Tokai or Ch\u016Bbu region. A regional council (\"chih\u014D gy\u014Dsei ky\u014Dgisai\") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping. The council also included regional chiefs of central government ministries.\nTable: Ch\u016Bbu region.\nOver time, Ch\u016Bbu has developed its own regional dialects, customs and unique traditional culture.\nGeography.\nThe Ch\u016Bbu region is a large area of Honsh\u016B.
