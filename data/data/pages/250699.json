He is currently sports writer.\nHe was awarded the Presidential Award at the Ballon D'OR award 2014 held in Zurich Jan 12th 2015.\nIt is \"bestowed upon a person or institution that has made a superlative contribution to football without seeking to monopolise the limelight\" apparently.\nWonderful speech from Hiroshi Kagawa during the ceremony. Even the hardened of footballers will have lumps in their throats.\n\"I'm very proud to attend this wonderful ceremony,\" he begins. \"This is the greatest honour to be presented with this award.\n\"In 1979 Mr Blatter was part of the Fifa organising committee of a youth tournament in Japan. Unfortunately my English has not made any progress since that tournament!\n\"So I was sceptical about coming to the this ceremony today. But my friends in Japan said I must come - even if only to meet Manuel Neuer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and bring back some autographs.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":51},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":60}]}
