{"id":250724,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_arrester","text":"A lightning arrester is a device that is used to switch a lightning strike from something such as a television antenna to a metal rod about two meters long that is buried in the ground. If a lightning arrester is not used, then the lightning will go through the television set and burn it out.\nA \"lightning arrester\" does not really \"arrest\" or stop lightning. It \"diverts\" or changes the way lightning goes so that it ends up going into the ground instead of going into a television set or other device that it could hurt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
