It is also one of the largest in the United States.\nThe museum is at 200 Eastern Parkway, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Arnold L. Lehman is the museum's Director.\nThe Brooklyn Museum has more than one-and-a-half million objects. Some of these pieces of art are from as long ago as ancient Egypt while others are very recent. The museum is a 560,000 square foot (52,000 m\u00B2), Beaux-Arts building. Approximately 500,000 people visit the museum each year.\nHistory.\nThe Brooklyn Museum was started by Augustus Graham in 1897. The building has a steel frame It was designed by McKim, Mead, and White and built by the Carlin Construction Company. Daniel Chester French, the man who made the Lincoln Memorial, made two allegorical figures, \"Brooklyn\" and \"Manhattan\" (carved in 1916, and moved to the museum in 1963), and of the figures on the building.\nThomas S. Buechner was made the museum's director in 1960. Buechner made a large change in the way the museum displayed the art. Also one thousand pieces of art that had been in the museum's archives were put back on display.\nThe Brooklyn Museum changed its name to Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1997. On March 12, 2004, the museum announced that it would revert to its old name, the Brooklyn Museum.\nFunding.\nIn 2005, the museum was one of 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to get part of $20 million from the Carnegie Corporation, made possible by a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nArt and exhibitions.\nThe museum is known for its large collections of Egyptian and African art, and 17th, 18th, and 19th century paintings.\nIn 2002, the museum bought the work \"The Dinner Party\" by artist Judy Chicago.

Sackler Center for Feminist Art since 2007.\nIn 2008, Edna Russman said that a third of the Coptic art in the museum's collection, the second-largest in North America, is fake.

They have been displayed since 2009.\nArtists like Patrick Kelly, Chuck Close, Denis Peterson, Ron Mueck, Takashi Murakami, Mat Benote, Kiki Smith, Jim Dine, Robert Rauschenberg, Sylvia Sleigh, William Wegman and Banksy have also been found in the museum.\nPrograms.\nIn 2000, the Brooklyn Museum started the Student Museum Apprentice Program.
