{"id":250944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barosaurus","text":"\"Barosaurus\" was a large, long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur which lived about 156 to 145 million years ago. The name \"Barosaurus\" means \"heavy lizard\"; this giant was named by paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh in 1890. \"Barosaurus\" fossils have been found in western North America and East Africa.\n\"Barosaurus\" was differently proportioned to its close relative \"Diplodocus\". It had a longer neck and shorter tail, but was about the same length overall. It was longer than \"Apatosaurus\", but its skeleton was less robust.\nSauropod skulls are rarely preserved, and scientists have yet to discover a \"Barosaurus\" skull.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":52},{"uri":"Othniel_Charles_Marsh","surface_form":"Othniel C.
