{"id":251009,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huni","text":"Huni was the last Pharaoh of Egyptian Third dynasty. He was successor of Khaba, and maybe Khaba's son. Huni established a fortress on the island of Elephantine, and he maybe built pyramid in Meidum.\nOne of officials of king Djoser was also named Huni, and it's possible that this man and pharaoh Huni are the same person.\nHuni had two wives - Djefatnebti and Meresankh I. With Djefatnebti, he fathered Hetepheres I, and with Meresankh he sired Sneferu, his own successor. Sneferu became a king after Huni's death, and he married his half-sister Hetepheres. Huni's grandson - son of Sneferu - was pharaoh Khufu, who built Great Pyramid of Giza.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"Pharaoh","offset":18},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":29},{"uri":"Khaba","surface_form":"Khaba","offset":73},{"uri":"Djoser","surface_form":"Djoser","offset":224},{"uri":"Djefatnebti","surface_form":"Djefatnebti","offset":343},{"uri":"Meresankh_I","surface_form":"Meresankh I","offset":359},{"uri":"Hetepheres_I","surface_form":"Hetepheres I","offset":402},{"uri":"Sneferu","surface_form":"Sneferu","offset":444},{"uri":"Khufu","surface_form":"Khufu","offset":604},{"uri":"Great_Pyramid_of_Giza","surface_form":"Great Pyramid of Giza","offset":621}]}
