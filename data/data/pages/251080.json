{"id":251080,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilationism","text":"=\"preserve\">Annihilationism (also called conditional immortality) is something that some Christians believe. People who are annihilationists believe that those who do not go to heaven do not live forever in hell, but instead die and no longer exist. (Annihilationists often believe that people are punished for a period of time in hell before they stop existing). Most Christians are not annihilationists. Famous Christian writers who have written in favor of annihilationism include Edward Fudge, John Wenham, and Clark Pinnock. Christians who have written against annihilationism include J.P. Moreland, Robert Peterson, and Ron Rhodes.\nGroups that believe in annihilationism include Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christians","surface_form":"Christians","offset":89},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":207},{"uri":"Edward_Fudge","surface_form":"Edward Fudge","offset":484},{"uri":"John_Wenham","surface_form":"John Wenham","offset":498},{"uri":"Clark_Pinnock","surface_form":"Clark Pinnock","offset":515},{"uri":"J.P._Moreland","surface_form":"J.P.
