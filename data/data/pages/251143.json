{"id":251143,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesothosaurus","text":"\"Lesothosaurus\" was a small, early, lightly-built dinosaur. It was an herbivore (plant-eater) and a fast, agile runner. It was small and lizard-like, about 3 feet (1 m) long. It walked on two long legs, had four-toed feet, five-fingered hands, short arms, a long pointed tail, a flexible neck, and a small head. Its head was short and flat with large eyes. It had sharp, pointed front teeth and arrow-like cheek teeth, but its lower jaw ended in toothless bone.\nThe place of this species within the Ornithischia is controversial. It is probably an ornithopod.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":50},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":137},{"uri":"Ornithischia","surface_form":"Ornithischia","offset":499},{"uri":"Ornithopod","surface_form":"ornithopod","offset":548}]}
