{"id":251187,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesha","text":"Kesha Rose Sebert, known simply as Kesha (stylized as Ke$ha until 2014; born March 1, 1987) is an American singer-songwriter. She has become famous for her style of dance-pop and electropop music, as well as her rap-singing of the lyrics to many of her biggest hits. She has three number-one songs in the U.S. They are \"Tik Tok\" (2009), \"We R Who We R\" (2010; number-one debut), and \"Timber\" with rapper Pitbull (2013). Kesha has also released the albums \"Animal\" (2010) and \"Warrior\" (2012), along with the EP \"Cannibal\" (2010) and the remix album \"I Am the Dance Commander + I Command You to Dance\" (2011). She also helped to co-write Britney Spears' 2011 single \"Till the World Ends\". She is also known for songs such as \"Your Love Is My Drug\", \"Blow\", \"Take It Off\", \"Die Young\", and \"Blah Blah Blah\", a collaboration with the alternative band 3OH!3.\nEarly life.\nKesha Rose Sebert was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 1, 1987. She was raised by her single mother, Pebe Sebert, and moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1991. She has one older brother and one younger brother.\nCareer.\nIn 2005, Kesha was in an episode of \"The Simple Life\", which starred Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.\nHer first single \"Tik Tok\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. \"Tik Tok\" became the best-performing song of 2010 in the United States. She has sold 55 million records.\nIn 2010, Kesha's first album \"Animal\" was released. Her first extended play \"Cannibal\" was released later that year. Her third studio album, \"Warrior\", was released in 2012.\nIn late 2013, Kesha was featured on rapper Pitbull's single \"Timber\". The song reached number one in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US.\nIn July 2017, she released the single \"Praying\", along with its music video, and announced a new studio album, \"Rainbow\". The song reached the top 30 in Australia, the UK, US, and Canada. It is notably different from her other singles because it does not use the dance-pop or electropop genres that she is known for.\nKesha released her fourth studio album, \"High Road\", on January 31, 2020. It entered the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart at number seven.\nPersonal life.\nEarly in her career, Kesha stated that the use of a dollar sign ($) in her stage name was meant to be ironic, as she was not raised in a wealthy household.\nIn January 2014, Kesha entered rehab for treatment for an eating disorder. Her mother says that her disorder started when she was 18. Later that year, she announced that her name would be styled back to \"Kesha\" instead of \"Ke$ha\", and her Twitter username was changed from @keshasuxx to simply @KeshaRose.\nIn February 2016, Kesha appeared in federal court in New York City to end her contract with Sony Music and the producer Dr. Luke\u2014who has produced many of her biggest hits\u2014claiming that he sexually and emotionally abused her. The court ruled that Kesha is to remain under her contract with Sony but is able to work with other producers. However, Kesha's lawyers argued that remaining with the same label would not benefit her. Other recording artists, such as Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Adele, and Demi Lovato, have shown support during Kesha's legal troubles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":98},{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":107},{"uri":"Dance-pop","surface_form":"dance-pop","offset":165},{"uri":"Electropop","surface_form":"electropop","offset":179},{"uri":"Tik_Tok","surface_form":"Tik Tok","offset":320},{"uri":"We_R_Who_We_R","surface_form":"We R Who We R","offset":338},{"uri":"Timber","surface_form":"Timber","offset":384},{"uri":"Rapper","surface_form":"rapper","offset":397},{"uri":"Pitbull_(rapper)","surface_form":"Pitbull","offset":404},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"Animal","offset":456},{"uri":"Warrior","surface_form":"Warrior","offset":476},{"uri":"Cannibal","surface_form":"Cannibal","offset":512},{"uri":"I_Am_the_Dance_Commander_%2B_I_Command_You_to_Dance","surface_form":"I Am the Dance Commander + I Command You to Dance","offset":550},{"uri":"Britney_Spears","surface_form":"Britney Spears","offset":637},{"uri":"Till_the_World_Ends","surface_form":"Till the World Ends","offset":666},{"uri":"Your_Love_Is_My_Drug","surface_form":"Your Love Is My Drug","offset":725},{"uri":"Blow","surface_form":"Blow","offset":749},{"uri":"Take_It_Off","surface_form":"Take It Off","offset":757},{"uri":"Die_Young","surface_form":"Die Young","offset":772},{"uri":"Blah_Blah_Blah","surface_form":"Blah Blah Blah","offset":789},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":897},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":910},{"uri":"Nashville","surface_form":"Nashville","offset":1003},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":1014},{"uri":"The_Simple_Life","surface_form":"The Simple Life","offset":1129},{"uri":"Paris_Hilton","surface_form":"Paris Hilton","offset":1161},{"uri":"Nicole_Richie","surface_form":"Nicole Richie","offset":1178},{"uri":"Tik_Tok","surface_form":"Tik Tok","offset":1211},{"uri":"Warrior","surface_form":"Warrior","offset":1520},{"uri":"Pitbull_(rapper)","surface_form":"Pitbull","offset":1595},{"uri":"Timber_(Pitbull_song)","surface_form":"Timber","offset":1613},{"uri":"Praying_(Kesha_song)","surface_form":"Praying","offset":1731},{"uri":"Rainbow_(Kesha_album)","surface_form":"Rainbow","offset":1804},{"uri":"High_Road_(Kesha_album)","surface_form":"High Road","offset":2050},{"uri":"Dollar_sign","surface_form":"dollar sign","offset":2210},{"uri":"Eating_disorder","surface_form":"eating disorder","offset":2372},{"uri":"Lady_Gaga","surface_form":"Lady Gaga","offset":3079},{"uri":"Taylor_Swift","surface_form":"Taylor Swift","offset":3090},{"uri":"Adele","surface_form":"Adele","offset":3104},{"uri":"Demi_Lovato","surface_form":"Demi Lovato","offset":3115}]}
