{"id":251311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procompsognathus","text":"\"Procompsognathus\" was a small, speedy theropod dinosaur. This meat-eater lived during the late Triassic period, about 210 million years ago (mya). It probably ate insects and lizards in a relatively dry, inland environment.\n\"Procompsognathus\" may have been about one meter long (3.3\u00A0ft),\nA biped, \"Procompsognathus\" had long hind legs, short arms, large clawed hands, a long slender snout with many small teeth, and a stiff tail. The tibia is approximately 20% longer than the femur in \"Procompsognathus\". This suggests that they were good runners.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":39},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":48},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":96},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":164},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":176},{"uri":"Biped","surface_form":"biped","offset":291},{"uri":"Tibia","surface_form":"tibia","offset":435},{"uri":"Femur","surface_form":"femur","offset":478}]}
