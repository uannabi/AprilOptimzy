In 1993 the band stopped playing music, but they began again in 2000 and still play music today.\nTheir lyrics were very political. They did not like the police, war, capitalism or racism. They did like gay people and thought that they should be treated fairly.\nThe name MDC is an abbreviation and has meant many things. The band changes what it means a lot. It has meant \"Millions of Dead Cops\", \"More Dead Cops\", \"Millions of Dead Children\", \"Multi Death Corporations\", \"Millions of Damn Christians\", \"Missile Destroyed Civilization\" and \"Magnus Dominus Corpus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anarcho-punk","surface_form":"anarcho-punk","offset":11},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":28},{"uri":"Austin%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Austin, Texas","offset":63},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":80},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":143},{"uri":"San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"San Francisco, California","offset":162},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":324},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":380},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":413},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":421},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"capitalism","offset":426},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":440},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":462},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":540}]}
