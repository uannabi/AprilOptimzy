{"id":251456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaver_ant","text":"Weaver ants (also known as tailor ants or green ants; genus \"Oecophylla\") are eusocial insects of the Formicidae family. They make their nests from living leaves, still attached to the tree. Instead of needles and thread, they use a rare type of silk, made in the mouths of their own grubs. The grubs are passed to and from between the leaves, to sew them together. Tailor ants may be found in the rainforest of Asia.\nColonies of weaver ants can be very large, containing more than half a million workers. The colonies can be made up of more than a hundred nests across several trees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":54},{"uri":"Eusocial","surface_form":"eusocial","offset":78},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":87},{"uri":"Formicidae","surface_form":"Formicidae","offset":102},{"uri":"Needle","surface_form":"needle","offset":202},{"uri":"Thread","surface_form":"thread","offset":214},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":246},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"grubs","offset":284},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":412}]}
