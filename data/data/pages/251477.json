The mayor of Ogden is Mike Caldwell. Ogden was originally named Fort Buenaventura. Fort Buenaventura was the first permanent settlement by people whose families came from Europe in the area now known as Utah. A trapper named Miles Goodyear established it in 1846 a mile west of present downtown Ogden. Then a year later, the fort was bought by Mormon settlers for about $2,000. Brownsville is another name that was once used for the settlement.
