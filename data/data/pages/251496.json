{"id":251496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattusili_III","text":"=\"preserve\">Hattusili III was a king of the Hittite empire around 1267\u20131237 BC. He was the fourth and last son of Mursili II.\nHattusili led the Hittite forces in the Battle of Kadesh against Egypt in 1274 BC. Hattusili and the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II later made a peace treaty. This is the earliest treaty which has survived to the present day. Apparently, it was based upon previous Hittite models. The treaty set up a long-lasting peace between the two rival empires. Ramesses married Hattusili's daughter, and years later he married another Hittite princess.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hittite","surface_form":"Hittite","offset":44},{"uri":"Mursili_II","surface_form":"Mursili II","offset":114},{"uri":"Battle_of_Kadesh","surface_form":"Battle of Kadesh","offset":166},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Egyptian","offset":227},{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"pharaoh","offset":236},{"uri":"Ramesses_II","surface_form":"Ramesses II","offset":244},{"uri":"Peace_treaty","surface_form":"peace treaty","offset":269}]}
