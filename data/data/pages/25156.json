{"id":25156,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)","text":"Macedonia or Macedon or the Macedonian Empire was an Ancient Macedonian kingdom of the Archaic and Classical Greece, and later the most powerful state of Hellenistic Greece. The kingdom was established and was at first ruled by the royal Argead dynasty, which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south.\nAlexander the Great made it the most powerful kingdom in the Near East for a few years. When he died the empire fell apart and the Antigonid dynasty ruled Macedonia as a small empire. Centuries later the Roman Empire conquered Macedonia and much of Alexander's empire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classical_antiquity","surface_form":"Ancient Macedonian","offset":53},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":72},{"uri":"Archaic_Greece","surface_form":"Archaic","offset":87},{"uri":"Classical_Greece","surface_form":"Classical Greece","offset":99},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":145},{"uri":"Hellenistic_Greece","surface_form":"Hellenistic Greece","offset":154},{"uri":"History_of_Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)","surface_form":"kingdom was established","offset":178},{"uri":"Argead_dynasty","surface_form":"Argead dynasty","offset":238},{"uri":"Antipatrid_dynasty","surface_form":"Antipatrid","offset":280},{"uri":"Antigonid_dynasty","surface_form":"Antigonid","offset":295},{"uri":"Ancient_Macedonians","surface_form":"ancient Macedonians","offset":328},{"uri":"Greek_peninsula","surface_form":"Greek peninsula","offset":415},{"uri":"Epirus_(ancient_state)","surface_form":"Epirus","offset":448},{"uri":"Paeonia_(kingdom)","surface_form":"Paeonia","offset":468},{"uri":"Thrace","surface_form":"Thrace","offset":490},{"uri":"Ancient_Thessaly","surface_form":"Thessaly","offset":513},{"uri":"Alexander_the_Great","surface_form":"Alexander the Great","offset":536},{"uri":"Near_East","surface_form":"Near East","offset":597},{"uri":"Antigonid_dynasty","surface_form":"Antigonid dynasty","offset":667},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":740}]}
