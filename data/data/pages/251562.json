{"id":251562,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avimimus","text":"\"Avimimus\" (meaning \"bird mimic\") was a recently discovered maniraptoran. It was a very fast moving, light-weight, bird-like theropod dinosaur that lived in the late Cretaceous in what is now Mongolia, around 70 million years ago. that may have had feathers. There are two known species, \"Avimimus portentosus\" and \"Avimimus nemegtensis\".\nFlight?\nThe forelimbs were relatively short. The bones of the hand were fused together, as in modern birds, and a ridge on the ulna (lower arm bone) was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by Kurzanov. Kurzanov, in 1987, also reported the presence of quill knobs, and while Chiappe confirmed the presence of bumps on the ulna, their function remained unclear. Kurzanov was so convinced they were attachment points for feathers that he concluded that \"Avimimus\" may have been capable of weak flight. The presence of feathers is now widely accepted, but most paleontologists do not believe \"Avimimus\" could fly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Maniraptora","surface_form":"maniraptora","offset":60},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":115},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":125},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":134},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":166},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":192},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":249},{"uri":"Ulna","surface_form":"ulna","offset":466},{"uri":"Quill_knob","surface_form":"quill knob","offset":602}]}
