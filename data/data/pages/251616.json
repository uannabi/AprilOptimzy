{"id":251616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segnosaurus","text":"\"Segnosaurus\" (meaning \"slow lizard\") was a herbivorous theropod dinosaur that lived during the late Upper Cretaceous, about 93 million years ago. It was a rather large Therizinosaur. This is a family of theropods which were herbivores. They changed from the usual carnivorous lifestyle of their ancestors.\nFour partial skeletons of \"Segnosaurus\" have been found in Mongolia. It had a long flexible neck, long head, three-toed feet, a broad strong pelvis, stocky legs with clawed fingers and toes, and a short tail. In 2010 Gregory Paul estimated the body length at six metres, the weight at 1.3 tonnes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":44},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":56},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":65},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":101},{"uri":"Therizinosaur","surface_form":"Therizinosaur","offset":169},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":194},{"uri":"Herbivores","surface_form":"herbivores","offset":225},{"uri":"Lifestyle","surface_form":"lifestyle","offset":277},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":366}]}
