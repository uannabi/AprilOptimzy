{"id":25167,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama","text":"\"Futurama\" is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Matt Groening and developed by Groening and David X. Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It is in \"New\" New York City during the 31st century. The shows were first shown on Fox Network on March 28, 1999, until August 10, 2003.\nIn 2008 Comedy Central began airing episodes. Comedy Central later said that the seventh season would be the final season. The series finale aired on September 4, 2013, though Groening has said he will try to get it picked up by another network. Also, 4 DVD movies were made.\nPlot summary.\nThe series is about Philip J. Fry (Billy West), a lazy New York City pizza delivery boy, who froze himself by mistake on New Year's Eve, 1999. He wakes up one thousand years later on New Year's Eve, 2999, and finds himself in \"New\" New York City. Fry wants to get a new job, though in the end he is forced to be a delivery boy. Fry tries to escape from his job and afterwards goes to Planet Express, a small delivery company that goes around the galaxy owned by his distant nephew, where he becomes a delivery boy. The series then describes the adventures of Fry and the other workers as they go around the universe making deliveries.\nSetting.\nThe first episode begins in the year 3000, a time where there are many technological advancements, as well as a place where 21st century problems are treated as everyday situations. In a jab at segregation, for example, the series depicts the human prejudice against mutants as being so great that the latter have been forced to live underground in the sewers. The characters' home on Earth is the city of New New York, built over the ruins of present-day New York City, referred to as \"Old New York\".\nThere is a fictional religion named Robotology in the television show. It is similar to United States black churches.\nNetworks.\nOld episodes are now seen on Adult Swim (a part of Cartoon Network) and Too Funny To Sleep (a part of TBS) in the United States, on Teletoon in Canada, on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom plus Sky One, Sky Two, Sky Three and TV6 in the UK and Republic of Ireland, on Fox8 and Network Ten in Australia, on Pro 7 in Germany and on Canal Fox in Latin America, including Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":26},{"uri":"Animated","surface_form":"animated","offset":32},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":41},{"uri":"Sitcom","surface_form":"sitcom","offset":57},{"uri":"Matt_Groening","surface_form":"Matt Groening","offset":75},{"uri":"David_X._Cohen","surface_form":"David X.
