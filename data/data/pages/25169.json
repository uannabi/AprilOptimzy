{"id":25169,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar","text":"Radar is a machine that uses radio waves for echolocation to find objects such as aircraft, ships, and rain.\nBy doing this, the radar can locate the object. Radar is used in many different ways. It can measure the speed and number of cars on a road, the amount of water in the air, and many other things.\nRadar was first used in 1904 by [http://www.design-technology.info/resourcedocuments/Huelsmeyer_EUSAR2002_english.pdf Christian H\u00FClsmeyer]. He was given a patent for radar (Reichspatent Nr. 165546). Radar was vital in the Battle of Britain and other parts of World War II. The Axis countries failed to keep up with British and American radar technology during the war.\nThe word \"RADAR\" was created in 1942 as an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging. This acronym replaced the British initialism \"RDF\" (\"Radio Direction Finding\"). The word is now thought of by many people as a regular word, no longer as an acronym.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":11},{"uri":"Radio_wave","surface_form":"radio wave","offset":29},{"uri":"Echolocation","surface_form":"echolocation","offset":45},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":82},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":92},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":103},{"uri":"Battle_of_Britain","surface_form":"Battle of Britain","offset":527},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":564},{"uri":"Axis_countries","surface_form":"Axis countries","offset":582},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":717},{"uri":"Initialism","surface_form":"initialism","offset":792}]}
