Another similar site, videogamespot.com was created in December of the same year to talk about console video game systems. In 1997, videogamespot.com became videogames.com for a short time. Afterward in 1998, videogames.com and GameSpot.com joined together to become a single site.\nGameSpot makes video game and PC reviews, previews, downloads, news, and information. It is known as one of the biggest game websites on the Internet. ZDNet bought GameSpot later on. However ZDNet was later bought by CNET Networks, who were then bought by CBS Corporation in March 2008. CBS Interactive are the current owners of GameSpot.\nOn October 3, 2005, GameSpot changed how the website looked, making it similar to what TV.com looks like.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":14},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PC","offset":153},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":460},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PC","offset":475},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":586},{"uri":"ZDNet","surface_form":"ZDNet","offset":596},{"uri":"CNET","surface_form":"CNET Networks","offset":662},{"uri":"CBS_Corporation","surface_form":"CBS Corporation","offset":701},{"uri":"CBS_Interactive","surface_form":"CBS Interactive","offset":732},{"uri":"TV.com","surface_form":"TV.com","offset":871}]}
