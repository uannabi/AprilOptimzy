{"id":25187,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland","text":"e=\"preserve\">The adrenal gland is a gland in most mammals. It is near the kidneys. Its name tells its position (\"ad\" \u2013 \"near\", and \"renes\" \u2013 \"kidneys\"). The gland is made up of two types of tissues: the centrally located tissue is called the adrenal medulla and outside this lies the adrenal cortex.\nThe adrenal glands are known as \"suprarenal glands\" in humans. In many animals the glands are next to the kidneys, but they are cap-like structures on top of the kidneys in humans.\nThe adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.\nThe adrenal gland makes hormones which control stress. It is involved in the production of steroid hormones. Among these hormones are cortisol and adrenaline.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":36},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":50},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":74},{"uri":"Mineralocorticoid","surface_form":"mineralocorticoid","offset":547},{"uri":"Glucocorticoid","surface_form":"glucocorticoid","offset":567},{"uri":"Androgen","surface_form":"androgen","offset":588},{"uri":"Aldosterone","surface_form":"aldosterone","offset":627},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":666},{"uri":"Electrolyte","surface_form":"electrolyte","offset":685},{"uri":"Hormones","surface_form":"hormones","offset":730},{"uri":"Stress_(biology)","surface_form":"stress","offset":753},{"uri":"Steroid","surface_form":"steroid","offset":797},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":805},{"uri":"Cortisol","surface_form":"cortisol","offset":840},{"uri":"Adrenaline","surface_form":"adrenaline","offset":853}]}
