Party hats, noisemakers, fire crackers and drinking champagne are fairly common during this holiday.\nMany towns also have firework shows or other noisy ways to start the new year. Places like Berlin, Chicago, Edinburgh, Los Angeles, London, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo are well known for their New Year's Eve celebrations.\nNew Year's Eve is also a work holiday in some countries, such as Australia, Argentina, Brazil, France, Mexico, the Philippines, and Venezuela.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":22},{"uri":"New_Year%27s_Day","surface_form":"New Year's Day","offset":37},{"uri":"December_31","surface_form":"December 31","offset":56},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":97},{"uri":"Champagne_(wine)","surface_form":"champagne","offset":267},{"uri":"Firework","surface_form":"firework","offset":337},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":407},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":415},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":424},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":435},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":448},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":456},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":466},{"uri":"Rio_de_Janeiro","surface_form":"Rio de Janeiro","offset":473},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":489},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":497},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":510},{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":600},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":635},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":646},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":657},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":665},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":673},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":685},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":702}]}
