{"id":25234,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_dynasty","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Chen dynasty \u9673\u671D (557-589) was the fourth and the last of the southern dynasties in China. It was an ethnic Han dynasty.\nFew records survive from the time of the Chen dynasty. However, the records that exist say that the dynasty was strong and rich. Legend says that the Chen dynasty had ten times more wealth than Europe at the time. The Chen dynasty's rulers had a tax system and ruling system similar to the Kang-Qian 'flourishing age'. (The Kang-Qian age was the last and richest Chinese feudal dynasty).\nThe Chen dynasty took in an enormous amount of silver, which was used as money at the time. The records that still exist say that the dynasty had as much as 30 million taels of silver in their reserves. (A silver tael weighed about 30 grams.) During the Chen dynasty, there was also a huge demand for Chinese silk, spices, porcelain, artwork, and many other products.\nIn the year 589, the Sui dynasty took over the Chen dynasty after the last Chen Emperor abdicated (gave up his position as Emperor).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dynasties_in_Chinese_history","surface_form":"dynasties in China","offset":87},{"uri":"Han_Chinese","surface_form":"ethnic Han","offset":117},{"uri":"Wealth","surface_form":"wealth","offset":319},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":383},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudal","offset":508},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":572},{"uri":"Tael","surface_form":"tael","offset":693},{"uri":"Reserve_bank","surface_form":"reserves","offset":718},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":760},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":834},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spice","offset":840},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":848},{"uri":"Sui_dynasty","surface_form":"Sui dynasty","offset":914},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":973},{"uri":"Abdication","surface_form":"abdicated","offset":981}]}
