Shortly after this, Tony Abbott became Health Minister. The contest between Abbott and Gillard often attracted attention from the media.

Labor politicians were unhappy with the way he led the party. The media had a lot of stories about the possibility that he would be challenged as leader. On 23 June 2010, there were several meetings between Gillard and Rudd, as well as other Labor party leaders. Rudd spoke to the media and said that Gillard had asked him to resign or hold a new vote for the party leadership. This would decide who was to be the leader of the Labor Party and therefore the Prime Minister of Australia.\nAt first Rudd said he would challenge Gillard at the meeting. However, hours before the vote, he resigned as leader when he knew that he did not have enough support to defeat Gillard. She won the election unopposed and became Australia's 27th Prime Minister. At the same meeting the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, was elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Labor's deputy leader, and hence Deputy Prime Minister. Gillard said that \"It is my intention to lead a government that is focused each and every day on meeting the needs of working families around the country\". She said \"I came to the view that a good government was losing its way\".\nIn February 2012, Rudd resigned as Foreign Minister, and said that he would challenge her for the leadership of the Labor Party.

She won the leadership, getting 71 votes to only 31 for Rudd.\nOn 26 June 2013, Gillard called a leadership spill. Kevin Rudd declared himself as a candidate. Rudd defeated Gillard by 57 to 45 votes. After the results, several ministers resigned from their ministerial positions including Wayne Swan, Peter Garrett, Greg Combet, Joe Ludwig, Craig Emerson and Stephen Conroy. In accordance with the pledge she and Rudd made in the vote, Gillard announced that she would not seek re-election and announced her retirement from politics at the upcoming federal election.\nPolitical positions.\nGillard is a member of the Left faction of the Labor party. Analyses of Jacqueline Kent's 2009 biography of Gillard suggest that her membership in the faction is \"more organisational than ideological\".\nOn population policy, in contrast to her predecessor, Gillard is against a \"big Australia\". She emphasises the need for sustainability, saying \"Australia should not hurtle down the track towards a big population\".\nGillard is pro-choice on reproductive rights.

She had previous relationships with union officials Michael O'Connor and Bruce Wilson and fellow Federal Labor MP Craig Emerson. She has never married and has had no children.\nWhen asked in 2010 on the ABC's Jon Faine program, \"Do you believe in God?\", Gillard answered, \"No, I don't Jon, I'm not a religious person... I'm, of course, a great respecter of religious beliefs but they're not my beliefs\". Newly appointed Prime Ministers must take an affirmation of office, or swear an oath of office on the Bible. Gillard chose an affirmation.\nShe lives in the south western Melbourne suburb of Altona and is a public supporter of the Western Bulldogs Australian Rules Football club.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of
