{"id":253129,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_gymnastics","text":"Wheel gymnastics is a form of gymnastics which originated in Germany.\nWheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the \"Rh\u00F6nrad\", \"gymnastics wheel\", \"gym wheel\", or \"German wheel\".\nThere are three main categories of exercise in wheel gymnasts. They are: \"straight line\", \"spiral\", and \"vault\".\nHistory.\nWhile being a child, Otto Feick, the son of a blacksmith from Reichenbach, Germany, used to roll down a hill in two wagon tires which inspired him later to invent the wheel gymnastics between 1920-1922. The current wheel gymnastics obtained its final shape in 1974 with the introduction of the PVC coating. Now, it's a competitive sport practiced in Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, and United States of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gymnastics","surface_form":"gymnastics","offset":30},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":61},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":88},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":388},{"uri":"PVC","surface_form":"PVC","offset":607},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":663},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":672},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":681},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":694},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":703},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":716},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":727}]}
