Bush made.\nThe Bush Doctrine is usually used to describe how Bush invaded Iraq in what is known as pre-emptive war (which means to attack the enemy before they can attack you).\nGeorge W. Bush did not make up this term and he never said what he thought about the term.\nThere are other United States presidential doctrines also.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Foreign_policy","surface_form":"foreign policy","offset":82},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
