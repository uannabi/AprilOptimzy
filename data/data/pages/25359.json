By area, it is the fourth largest Spanish autonomous community after Castile and Le\u00F3n, Andalusia and Castile-La Mancha.\nAragon is bordered to the north by France (Nouvelle-Aquitaine region). Within Spain, the community is bordered to the east by Catalonia (Lerida and Tarragona provinces), to the south by Valencian Community (Castell\u00F3n and Valencia provinces) and Castile-La Mancha (Cuenca and Guadalajara provinces), and to the west by Castile and Le\u00F3n (Soria province), La Rioja and Navarre.\nRelief.\nMost of Aragon has an altitude of.

Some important tributaries on the left side of the river (rivers that come from the Pyrenees) are the Arag\u00F3n, born in Huesca but flows into the community of Navarre, the G\u00E1llego and Cinca, which joins the Segre just before ending up in the Ebro. Right tributaries are the rivers Jal\u00F3n, Huerva and Guadalupe.\nOn the Ebro, near the border with Catalonia, lies the Mequinenza Reservoir, with a length of about 110\u00A0km, and that is popularly known as the \"Sea of Aragon\".\nClimate.\nIn the middle of Aragon, which is only above sea level, the annual average temperature is around. To the north and south of the Ebro valley, where the elevation rises to above sea level, the temperature drops by two degrees.

Each province is divided in \"comarcas\" (a \"comarca\" is a local administrative division) and these are divided in municipalities.\nPopulation.\nAragon has a population, in 2013, of 1,347,150, for a population density of inhabitants/km2, one of the lowest in Spain. The most densely populated areas are around the valley of the Ebro river, particularly around Zaragoza, and in the Pyrenean foothills (the hills at the base of the Pyrenees), while the areas with the fewest inhabitants tend to be those that are higher up in the Pyrenean mountains, and in most of the southern province of Teruel.\nThe province of Zaragoza is the one with more inhabitants, with 978,638 people living there, representing % of the population of Aragon.\nThe city with more people living in it is the capital, Zaragoza (620,419).
