The cup happens every four years. The competition is one of the biggest sporting events in the world (along with the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics).\nThere are only 20 spots available in a Rugby World Cup, so teams must compete for them in a qualifying competition. Teams that reached the knockout stages of the previous tournament automatically qualify for the next tournament.\nThe 2011 match was held in New Zealand, and the 2015 England. The 2019 competition will be held in Japan.\nThe current champions are South Africa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":42},{"uri":"Rugby_union","surface_form":"rugby union","offset":69},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":226},{"uri":"Olympics","surface_form":"Olympics","offset":249},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":516},{"uri":"2015","surface_form":"2015","offset":537},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":542},{"uri":"2019","surface_form":"2019","offset":555},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":588}]}
