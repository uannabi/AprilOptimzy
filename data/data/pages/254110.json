{"id":254110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness","text":"=\"preserve\">Endianness refers to how hexadecimal data is ordered in machine language, the simplest, most understandable code that a computer can use.\nIn computer coding, certain numbers, usually two bytes long (1 byte = 8 bits) that are called \"words\", can be written or input in two ways: little-endian and big-endian. It depends on the data format and the way the computer reads the data.\nNow, the way it's written right now is big-endian, because the bigger number is on the end. (In hexadecimal, the numbers go from 0 to 9, then from A to F. After F, a 1 is added to the front. [e.g. F+1=10, which is 16 in our numbering system])","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hexadecimal","surface_form":"hexadecimal","offset":37},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":153}]}
