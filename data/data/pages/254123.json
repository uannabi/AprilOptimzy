The company used to be known as Mercedes-Ilmor. They are owned by Mercedes-Benz. Since 1995, their engines have been used by the McLaren Formula One race cars. For the season, Mercedes-Benz also supplied the Brawn GP and Force India teams with engines. In the season Mercedes supplied McLaren, Force India. They also supplied the engines for the new Mercedes-Benz factory team, Mercedes GP, which was formed from the Brawn GP team.\nBackground.\nIlmor was founded by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan in 1983, as an independent British Formula One engine manufacturer. The company name was taken from the last names of the founders. It originally started building engines for IndyCars. They received financial support from IndyCar team owner and builder Roger Penske.\nThe Daimler-Benz company purchased Chevrolet's 25% share of Ilmor in 1993. In 2002 Daimler AG increased its share to 55% and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor. In 2005 Daimler became the sole owner of Ilmor and renamed the company Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines Ltd.\nOne division of the company was called Special Projects. Since 2003, Special Projects had been building Honda's Indy Racing League engines. In 2005, Special Projects split from Mercedes-Ilmor and became a separate company named Ilmor Engineering Ltd. Ilmor Engineering is owned by Mario Illien and Roger Penske. This new company is totally independent of Mercedes-Benz.\nHistory.\nIn Ilmor entered Formula One as an engine supplier. They supplied engines to the Leyton House team. Leyton House was formerly known as March. In 1992, Leyton House changed its name back to March and continued using Ilmor engines.\nIlmor also supplied engines to the Tyrrell team in. Powered by an Ilmor V10, Tyrrell scored 8 points, and March 3 points in the Formula One Championship.\nIlmor had developed a good name in F1. When the Sauber sportscar-team and Mercedes-Benz were planning to enter Formula One together, they made a deal with Ilmor. However, Ilmor deceided not to put the slogan \"Concept by Mercedes-Benz\" on the engines. Since the engines were officially called Ilmor, Mercedes backed out of the project with Ilmor.\nAfter an unexpectedly fast performance in, Sauber convinced Mercedes to join officially in 1994. In Ilmor also supplied the new Pacific GP team of Keith Wiggins with the old 1993 version of the engines. Pacific only managed to qualify seven times in thirty-two tries. The Ilmor engine was not the cause of this poor performance.\nIlmor became the engine partner to McLaren in. The partnership received its first win at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix. Mika H\u00E4kkinen won the driver's championships in the and seasons. The McLaren team won the constructor's championship in. After not winning a single race in the season, McLaren bounced back and won the driver's championship in season with Lewis Hamilton.\nIn 2001 Paul Morgan was killed while landing his vintage (antique) plane at Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire. This led to Mercedes-Benz increasing their financial involvement in Ilmor, and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor Ltd.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["company"],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":48},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":62},{"uri":"Mercedes-Benz","surface_form":"Mercedes-Benz","offset":156},{"uri":"McLaren","surface_form":"McLaren","offset":219},{"uri":"Brawn_GP","surface_form":"Brawn GP","offset":298},{"uri":"Force_India","surface_form":"Force India","offset":311},{"uri":"McLaren","surface_form":"McLaren","offset":375},{"uri":"Force_India","surface_form":"Force India","offset":384},{"uri":"Mercedes_GP","surface_form":"Mercedes GP","offset":468},{"uri":"Brawn_GP","surface_form":"Brawn GP","offset":507},{"uri":"Ilmor","surface_form":"Ilmor","offset":534},{"uri":"Mario_Illien","surface_form":"Mario Illien","offset":555},{"uri":"Paul_Morgan_(engineer)","surface_form":"Paul Morgan","offset":572},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":619},{"uri":"IndyCar_Series","surface_form":"IndyCars","offset":759},{"uri":"Roger_Penske","surface_form":"Roger Penske","offset":837},{"uri":"Daimler-Benz","surface_form":"Daimler-Benz","offset":855},{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":886},{"uri":"Daimler_AG","surface_form":"Daimler AG","offset":934},{"uri":"Honda","surface_form":"Honda","offset":1229},{"uri":"Indy_Racing_League","surface_form":"Indy Racing League","offset":1237},{"uri":"Ilmor_Engineering_Ltd","surface_form":"Ilmor Engineering Ltd","offset":1353},{"uri":"Leyton_House_Racing","surface_form":"Leyton House","offset":1585},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":1639},{"uri":"Tyrrell","surface_form":"Tyrrell","offset":1769},{"uri":"V10_engine","surface_form":"V10","offset":1806},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One Championship","offset":1862},{"uri":"Mercedes-Benz","surface_form":"Mercedes-Benz","offset":1962},{"uri":"Sauber","surface_form":"Sauber","offset":2277},{"uri":"Pacific_GP","surface_form":"Pacific GP","offset":2362},{"uri":"McLaren","surface_form":"McLaren","offset":2598},{"uri":"1997_Australian_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"1997 Australian Grand Prix","offset":2656},{"uri":"Mika_H%C3%A4kkinen","surface_form":"Mika H\u00E4kkinen","offset":2684},{"uri":"Lewis_Hamilton","surface_form":"Lewis Hamilton","offset":2922},{"uri":"Sywell_Aerodrome","surface_form":"Sywell Aerodrome","offset":3014},{"uri":"Northamptonshire","surface_form":"Northamptonshire","offset":3032}]}
