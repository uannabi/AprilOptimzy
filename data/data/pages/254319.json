{"id":254319,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0umadija","text":"\u0160umadija (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0428\u0443\u043C\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430) is a geographical region in Serbia. The area was heavily forested, hence the name (\"\u0160uma\" - forest). The city of Kragujevac is the center of the region, and the administrative center of the \u0160umadija District in Central Serbia.\nBorders.\n\u0160umadija is located between rivers Sava and Danube in the north, river Velika Morava in the east, river Zapadna Morava in the south, and Kolubara, Ljig and Di\u010Dina in the west. According to some interpretations (for example, physiologists such as Jovan Cviji\u0107 and ethnologist such as Erdeljanovi\u0107.), the northern border of \u0160umadija lay between Avala and Kosmaj mountain. According to that view, the capital of Serbia, Belgrade does not belong to this region.\nHistory.\nDuring the 18th century, the forests of \u0160umadija were the refuge for the Hajduks that fought against Ottoman occupation. The first Serbian uprising in 1804 was led by national hero Kara\u0111or\u0111e. The second Serbian uprising in 1815 was led by Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 who successfully repelled the Turkish forces and, by 1830, Serbia had gained its full autonomy. Because of Milo\u0161's efforts and negotiations Serbia was finally an independent state, after centuries under Ottoman reign.\nBetween 1922 and 1929, one of the administrative units of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was named \u0160umadijska Oblast. It roughly included territory of present-day \u0160umadija District with its administrative seat in Kragujevac, which is the seat of the modern district as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serbian_Cyrillic","surface_form":"Serbian Cyrillic","offset":10},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":66},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":95},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":143},{"uri":"Kragujevac","surface_form":"Kragujevac","offset":151},{"uri":"%C5%A0umadija_District","surface_form":"\u0160umadija District","offset":228},{"uri":"Central_Serbia","surface_form":"Central Serbia","offset":249},{"uri":"Jovan_Cviji%C4%87","surface_form":"Jovan Cviji\u0107","offset":520},{"uri":"Erdeljanovi%C4%87","surface_form":"Erdeljanovi\u0107","offset":557},{"uri":"Avala","surface_form":"Avala","offset":617},{"uri":"Kosmaj","surface_form":"Kosmaj","offset":627},{"uri":"Belgrade","surface_form":"Belgrade","offset":691},{"uri":"Hajduk","surface_form":"Hajduk","offset":814},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman","offset":842},{"uri":"Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e","surface_form":"Kara\u0111or\u0111e","offset":922},{"uri":"Milo%C5%A1_Obrenovi%C4%87","surface_form":"Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107","offset":980},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Yugoslavia","offset":1276},{"uri":"%C5%A0umadija_District","surface_form":"\u0160umadija District","offset":1372},{"uri":"Kragujevac","surface_form":"Kragujevac","offset":1422}]}
