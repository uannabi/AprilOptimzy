{"id":25444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Muslims have different dress codes for different contexts. Conservative ideas of \"hijab\" require people to dress modestly both for outside and religious contexts. Clothing for everyday wear, inside and outside the house is different, and very much depends on the family.\nClothes for men.\nMuslim men also have many rules about clothing, some of the most strict ones involve gold, there are over 160 rules\nA mans clothing is modest and loose so as not to emphasize the shape of the body. It should cover at least the area from navel to knees.\nThey should wear a qamisi a knee covering religious clothing to prayer and many many more.\nClothes for women.\nIslam says that women should dress in a very special way. This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children. Usually, women who travel to Islamic countries should also wear such dress.\nIn the very least, the garment should cover the shoulders. Long-sleeved garments (and trousers) are preferred. Use a headscarf to cover the hair (especially when you enter a mosque or other place of worship).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":13},{"uri":"Dress_code","surface_form":"dress code","offset":36},{"uri":"Hijab","surface_form":"hijab","offset":95},{"uri":"Modesty","surface_form":"modestly","offset":126},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":664},{"uri":"Garment","surface_form":"garment","offset":897},{"uri":"Headscarf","surface_form":"headscarf","offset":991},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":1048}]}
