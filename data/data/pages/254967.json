He was named PETA's Sexiest Vegetarian in 2012 (along with Jessica Chastain).\nHe would like the legalization of marijuana and hemp. He is also an environmental activist. Harrelson is a supporter of the 9/11 truth movement. He has supported reopening an investigation into the September 11 terrorist attacks.\nIn 1985, Harrelson married Nancy Simon, daughter of playwright Neil Simon, in Tijuana. The two meant to divorce the following day, but the storefront marriage/divorce parlor was closed when they had returned to it. The two remained married for ten months.\nOn December 28, 2008, Harrelson married Laura Louie, his girlfriend since 1987.
