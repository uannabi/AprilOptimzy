{"id":254971,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_cat","text":"The Persian is a cat from Persia (now Iran). It is one of the oldest and most popular cat breeds. They are called Longhair or Persian Longhair in Britain. It was made by English breeders and the American ones after the Second World War. Because of very careful breeding, it has gotten a really flat face and many different colors. While most cat fanciers love the flat faced Persian, this brings along many illnesses. The public likes the traditional faced Persian more than the flat faced one. They can get polycystic kidney disease easily.\nThe gentle and easy-going nature of the Persian makes it very easy to live in apartments with this cat. While it is the top cat in the U.S.A, it's popularity has decreased in France and the U.K.\nPersian cats are not an ordinary cat,they can barely live outside in the wild.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":17},{"uri":"Persia_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"Persia","offset":26},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":38},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":219},{"uri":"Polycystic_kidney_disease","surface_form":"polycystic kidney disease","offset":508},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.A","offset":677},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"U.K","offset":732}]}
