{"id":255,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_yield","text":"=\"preserve\">Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.\nHowever, the concept is also applicable to water, and soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is \"renewed\" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Growth","surface_form":"growth","offset":48},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":61},{"uri":"Forestry","surface_form":"forestry","offset":104},{"uri":"Sustainable_forestry","surface_form":"sustainable forestry","offset":123},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":310},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":321},{"uri":"Renewable_resource","surface_form":"renewable resource","offset":420},{"uri":"Carrying_capacity","surface_form":"carrying capacity","offset":445}]}
