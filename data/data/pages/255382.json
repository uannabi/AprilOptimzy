Honda F1 originally started in 1964 and were in F1 until 1968 when after the death of one of their drivers, Honda decided to leave Formula 1. Then, in 2006 Honda bought British American Racing to who it already supplied Honda engines. With the partnership of former Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello and former BAR driver Jenson Button, the 'new' Honda F1 team won its first, and only, race in 2006 when Jenson Button won the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. Then in 2008 due to the recession, Honda announced they would leave F1. Not too long after, Ross Brawn bought out the team and renamed it Brawn GP, and ran the team in the 2009 season.\nHistory.\nTyrrell Racing \u2192 British American Racing \u2192 Honda Racing F1 \u2192 Brawn GP \u2192 Mercedes GP","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":23},{"uri":"British_American_Racing","surface_form":"British American Racing","offset":239},{"uri":"Rubens_Barrichello","surface_form":"Rubens Barrichello","offset":351},{"uri":"Jenson_Button","surface_form":"Jenson Button","offset":392},{"uri":"Jenson_Button","surface_form":"Jenson Button","offset":474},{"uri":"2006_Hungarian_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"2006 Hungarian Grand Prix","offset":496},{"uri":"Brawn_GP","surface_form":"Brawn GP","offset":661},{"uri":"British_American_Racing","surface_form":"British American Racing","offset":734},{"uri":"Brawn_GP","surface_form":"Brawn GP","offset":778},{"uri":"Mercedes_GP","surface_form":"Mercedes GP","offset":789}]}
