{"id":25561,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band","text":"\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is an album released by The Beatles. It was the 9th Beatles album to be released in the United Kingdom. It was released on 1 June 1967, and stayed at the top of the charts for twenty-seven weeks. It has lots of well-known songs such as McCartney's \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" and \"A Day in the Life\", which Lennon and McCartney worked on together. For a while before this album came out, The Beatles had been trying new things when they made records, but this album made a much bigger change in the way they sounded.\nThe album title was used later for a 1978 Universal Pictures movie. Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees played Sgt. Pepper's band, while Billy Preston was the Sergeant. George Burns played Mr. Kite (the mayor), Steve Martin (in his first film) played Maxwell Edison, and Aerosmith was the Future Villain Band. It consistently holds the top spot on critics' lists of the greatest albums of all time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":46},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":64},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":128},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"McCartney's","offset":276},{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"Lennon","offset":341},{"uri":"Universal_Pictures","surface_form":"Universal Pictures","offset":593},{"uri":"Peter_Frampton","surface_form":"Peter Frampton","offset":619},{"uri":"Bee_Gees","surface_form":"Bee Gees","offset":642},{"uri":"Billy_Preston","surface_form":"Billy Preston","offset":684},{"uri":"George_Burns","surface_form":"George Burns","offset":716},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":750},{"uri":"Steve_Martin","surface_form":"Steve Martin","offset":758},{"uri":"Aerosmith","surface_form":"Aerosmith","offset":818}]}
