{"id":255656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell","text":"B cells are lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Once the B cell is activated, it turns into a plasma cell, and starts producing antibodies. They are a vital part of the adaptive immune system. They have a protein on the B cell's outer surface known as a 'B cell receptor'. This allows a B cell to bind to a specific antigen.\nRecently, a new, suppressive function of B cells has been discovered.\nIn mammals, immature B cells are formed in the bone marrow, hence their name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lymphocytes","surface_form":"lymphocytes","offset":12},{"uri":"White_blood_cell","surface_form":"white blood cell","offset":35},{"uri":"Antibodies","surface_form":"antibodies","offset":133},{"uri":"Adaptive_immune_system","surface_form":"adaptive immune system","offset":174},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":210},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"outer surface","offset":234},{"uri":"Antigen","surface_form":"antigen","offset":321},{"uri":"Bone_marrow","surface_form":"bone marrow","offset":447}]}
