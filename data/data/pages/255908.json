{"id":255908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braces","text":"Braces (suspenders in the U.S.) are a standard item of male clothing, now worn less often than before. Their function is to keep trousers at a set height on the body. They are standard wear for formal styles of dress such as the lounge suit.\nThere is also a fashion use among some young males, and a use by some workmen. Braces can be worn entirely out of sight, hidden by a waistcoat, or in sight as a display. A critical factor in formal dress is the \"drop\" of the trousers as they meet the shoes. Here braces avoid the need to hitch trousers up, always a problem with belts.\nIn many countries braces were worn by all classes of men for well over a hundred years until about the 1960s, except in the armed forces. Then fashion changed and men's clothes became informal, with lower waistlines and belts. Now they are a minority item.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trousers","surface_form":"trousers","offset":129},{"uri":"Lounge_suit","surface_form":"lounge suit","offset":229},{"uri":"Waistcoat","surface_form":"waistcoat","offset":375},{"uri":"Belt","surface_form":"belt","offset":571},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":681},{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":702},{"uri":"Fashion","surface_form":"fashion","offset":721},{"uri":"Belt","surface_form":"belt","offset":798}]}
