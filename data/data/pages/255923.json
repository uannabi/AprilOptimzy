{"id":255923,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Bickell","text":"Bryan Bickell (born March 9, 1986 in Orono, Ontario) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey left winger. He played for the Chicago Blackhawks amd Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nCareer.\nHe was chosen 41st overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He earned a Stanley Cup ring from the team but his name was not engraved on the cup. On June 24, 2013, Bickell won his second Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks after they defeated the Boston Bruins 4 games to 2 in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals.\nHealth issues.\nBickell began experiencing symptoms of vertigo that forced him to miss two games during the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals. He initially believed the ailment was caused by an infected tooth. Bickell's agent later commented that Bickell was suffering from vestibular issues, which hindered his performance during the 2015\u201316 Chicago Blackhawks season. In November 2016, Bickell began experiencing an unexplained pain in his shoulder and leg that caused him to miss multiple games. Doctors later diagnosed Bickell with multiple sclerosis. Bickell commented on his health by stating, \"Since the 2015 playoffs, I've been struggling to understand what was going on with my body. Again during the past few weeks, it felt like something wasn't right.\" Ron Francis, the Hurricanes' general manager, stated that Bickell would take an indefinite amount of time off from hockey to receive treatment for his condition. While Bickell ultimately returned to Hurricanes towards the end of the 2016\u201317 season, he announced he would retire from playing hockey to focus on his MS treatment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"March_9","surface_form":"March 9","offset":20},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":29},{"uri":"Orono%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Orono","offset":37},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":44},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":65},{"uri":"Winger_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"left winger","offset":98},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":129},{"uri":"Carolina_Hurricanes","surface_form":"Carolina Hurricanes","offset":152},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":179},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":311},{"uri":"Boston_Bruins","surface_form":"Boston Bruins","offset":481},{"uri":"2013_Stanley_Cup_Finals","surface_form":"2013 Stanley Cup Finals","offset":515},{"uri":"Vertigo","surface_form":"vertigo","offset":594},{"uri":"2015_Stanley_Cup_Finals","surface_form":"2015 Stanley Cup Finals","offset":647},{"uri":"Vestibular_system","surface_form":"vestibular issues","offset":803},{"uri":"2015%E2%80%9316_Chicago_Blackhawks_season","surface_form":"2015\u201316 Chicago Blackhawks season","offset":864},{"uri":"Multiple_sclerosis","surface_form":"multiple sclerosis","offset":1065},{"uri":"Ron_Francis","surface_form":"Ron Francis","offset":1293}]}
