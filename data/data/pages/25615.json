{"id":25615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy","text":"Aristocracy is a kind of government that puts power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class. In Ancient Greek, the word aristocracy means \"the rule of the best\", but it has come to be linked with rule by Nobility.\nThere are different kinds of aristocracy with different ways the government is set up. In history, most aristocracies are hereditary. Members of the ruling group have passed on power to their eldest surviving son, and sometimes to their eldest daughter. Aristocracy can be combined with other kinds of government. There were small groups of people that run a country. The people were called aristocrats and often had titles such as duke, duchess, baron and baroness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":25},{"uri":"Ruling_class","surface_form":"ruling class","offset":88},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":105},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"Nobility","offset":213},{"uri":"Hereditary","surface_form":"hereditary","offset":345},{"uri":"Duke","surface_form":"duke","offset":655},{"uri":"Duchess","surface_form":"duchess","offset":661},{"uri":"Baron","surface_form":"baron","offset":670},{"uri":"Baroness","surface_form":"baroness","offset":680}]}
