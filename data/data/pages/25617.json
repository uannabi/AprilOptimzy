{"id":25617,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon","text":"Poseidon\u00A0() is the god of the sea, earthquakes, storms and horses in\u00A0ancient Greek religion\u00A0and\u00A0myth. He was one of the\u00A0Twelve Olympians. His parents were Kronos\u00A0and\u00A0Rhea. He was the older brother of Zeus yet not by much.\nPoseidon was generally regarded as an ill-tempered being. His mood was a reflection of the state of his realm. He was thought to conjure up violent storms at sea when angered. While he was married\u00A0to the goddess Amphitrite, one of the Nereids, like his brother Zeus, Poseidon had a number of affairs with other goddesses and mortal woman, siring such heroes as Theseus and Bellerophon. Lord of the waters, Poseidon was both patron and protector of both sailors and seafarers, who would pray to him for safe passage across the sea. Poseidon was often regarded as the \u201CFather of Horses,\u201D as they were thought to be his creations. He was additionally the chief deity and patron of the city of Corinth, whereupon the Isthmian Games\u00A0were held every other four years in his honor. Otherwise known as the Earth-Shaker\u00A0(), Poseidon was thought to be the cause of such disasters, striking the Earth with his trident (a three-pronged spear) whenever he was particularly enraged. The god's symbol was his trident and the bull, horse and dolphin were his sacred animals. The god Neptune is his Roman equivalent. Neptune was a more war-like figure. Some have theorized this god is in fact Owen's hair coming from the popular belief that it summoned a storm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquakes","surface_form":"earthquakes","offset":35},{"uri":"Storms","surface_form":"storms","offset":48},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"ancient Greek religion","offset":69},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":96},{"uri":"Twelve_Olympians","surface_form":"Twelve Olympians","offset":120},{"uri":"Kronos","surface_form":"Kronos","offset":155},{"uri":"Rhea_(mythology)","surface_form":"Rhea","offset":166},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":200},{"uri":"Amphitrite","surface_form":"Amphitrite","offset":434},{"uri":"Nereid","surface_form":"Nereid","offset":457},{"uri":"Theseus","surface_form":"Theseus","offset":583},{"uri":"Bellerophon","surface_form":"Bellerophon","offset":595},{"uri":"Horses","surface_form":"Horses","offset":799},{"uri":"Corinth","surface_form":"Corinth","offset":912},{"uri":"Isthmian_Games","surface_form":"Isthmian Games","offset":935},{"uri":"Bull","surface_form":"bull","offset":1232},{"uri":"Dolphin","surface_form":"dolphin","offset":1248},{"uri":"Neptune_(mythology)","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":1289}]}
