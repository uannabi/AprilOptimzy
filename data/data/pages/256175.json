{"id":256175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome","text":"e=\"preserve\">Klinefelter syndrome, 47, XXY, or XXY syndrome is a genetic disorder where people have an extra number of X chromosomes. People who have Klinefelter's Syndrome are often called \"XXY Males\", or \"47, XXY Males\".\nEffects.\nMales who have this condition are almost always infertile. This means that they cannot father babies.\nIn other organisms.\nOther males can have Klinefelter's Syndrome as well as humans. The mouse is one example.\nTortoiseshell or calico markings on male cats are an indicator of a similar syndrome. These cats are considered to be the model organism for Klinefelter syndrome, because the gene for a cat's tabby coat markings is found on the X chromosome.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetic_disorder","surface_form":"genetic disorder","offset":65},{"uri":"Infertility","surface_form":"infertile","offset":280},{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"babies","offset":326},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":421},{"uri":"Calico_cat","surface_form":"calico","offset":460},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":565},{"uri":"Tabby_cat","surface_form":"tabby","offset":635}]}
