{"id":25626,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming","text":"e=\"preserve\">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs using \"objects\" to stand for data and methods. Computer programs that are not object-oriented are a list of instructions for the computer, telling it to do certain things in a certain way, which is called procedural programming. However, in object-oriented programming, computer programs use objects that talk to one another to change the data in those objects and to work in a way that the user wants. Because of the way object-oriented programming is designed, it helps the developer by allowing for code to be easily reused by other parts of the program or even by other people.\nMost programming languages are a mix of different ways of writing computer programs. For example, Python allows for computer programs to be written both in object-oriented programming and in procedural programming. There are many programming languages that allow you to write computer programs in object-oriented programming. Some of these programming languages are: C++, Java, Ruby, Perl, Emarald, Sapphire, PHP, Python, etc.\nFeatures.\nObjects is a term used to refer to instances of classes.\nExamples.\nIn the examples below, we create a class called codice_2. This class contains the attributes codice_2 (for the name of the person) and codice_2 (for the name of the friend). Each of the methods in the codice_2 class contains a list of instructions that makes use of both the codice_2 and codice_2 attributes.\nPython.\nThis code is in Python.\nstephen.say_name() # Shows 'My name is Stephen'\nstephen.say_goodnight() # Shows 'Good night nobody.'\njoe.say_name() # Shows 'My name is Joe'\njoe.say_goodnight() # Shows 'Good night Stephen'\nJava.\nThis code is in Java.\nCriticism.\nEven though object-oriented programming is popular, some people think that it is bad and criticize it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Object_(computer_science)","surface_form":"objects","offset":92},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":114},{"uri":"Method_(computer_science)","surface_form":"methods","offset":123},{"uri":"Procedural_programming","surface_form":"procedural programming","offset":290},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":672},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":765},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":1034},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":1039},{"uri":"Ruby_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Ruby","offset":1045},{"uri":"Perl","surface_form":"Perl","offset":1051},{"uri":"Emarald","surface_form":"Emarald","offset":1057},{"uri":"Sapphire","surface_form":"Sapphire","offset":1066},{"uri":"PHP","surface_form":"PHP","offset":1076},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":1081},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":1504},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":1724}]}
