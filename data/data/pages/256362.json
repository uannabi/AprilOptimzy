{"id":256362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage","text":"Macrophages are white blood cells within tissues, produced by the differentiation of monocytes.\nMonocytes and macrophages are phagocytes, acting in general immunity. They also trigger specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity) of vertebrates.\nTheir role is to phagocytose (engulf and then digest) cellular debris and pathogens either as stationary or as mobile cells. They also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to the pathogen,\nLife cycle.\nWhen a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the wall of a blood vessel it changes to become a macrophage. Monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances, triggered by a range of stimuli. At some sites such as the testis, macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation.\nUnlike short-lived neutrophils, macrophages survive longer in the body, up to several months.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"White_blood_cell","surface_form":"white blood cell","offset":16},{"uri":"Differentiation","surface_form":"differentiation","offset":66},{"uri":"Monocyte","surface_form":"monocyte","offset":85},{"uri":"Phagocyte","surface_form":"phagocyte","offset":126},{"uri":"Immunity","surface_form":"immunity","offset":156},{"uri":"Adaptive_immunity","surface_form":"adaptive immunity","offset":213},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":235},{"uri":"Phagocytosis","surface_form":"phagocytose","offset":265},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":322},{"uri":"Lymphocyte","surface_form":"lymphocyte","offset":393},{"uri":"Monocyte","surface_form":"monocyte","offset":475},{"uri":"Blood_vessel","surface_form":"blood vessel","offset":528}]}
