{"id":256399,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesoul","text":"Vesoul is a commune. It is the prefecture of the Haute-Sa\u00F4ne department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9 region.\nGeography.\nThe Haute-Sa\u00F4ne is a rural department and is based around five towns: Vesoul (the prefecture), Gray, H\u00E9ricourt, Lure and Luxeuil-les-Bains. The Durgeon and Colombine rivers flow through the commune.\nHistory.\nVesoul is first mentioned in a document dated 899. That document speaks about an elevation with a fortified watchtower. The document speaks about \"Castrum Vesulium\". Castrum is a fortification, and \"Vesulium\" has the syllable \"ves\" which meant hill or mountain in a language that was spoken before the Celts. Today, there is a castle that forms the centre of the city. The first houses were built inside the walls of the castle. Newcomers who found no place settled outside the city walls, on the flanks of the hill. Growing wine was popular.\nIn 1814, after the fall of the empire, a buffer state was created, with Vesoul as capital. The principality was that of Free County, of the Vosges and of Porrentruy.\nToday, one of the main factories of PSA Peugeot Citro\u00EBn is near Vesoul.\nLibrary.\nThe first public library of Vesoul opened in 1771. The \"abb\u00E9\" (abbot) Bardenet, superior of the Saint-Esprit hospital in Besan\u00E7on, gave his book collection to the town. There were 1772 books. The collections became a lot larger with the Revolution. At that time, the revolutionaries (people who led the French Revolution) took the books from the monasteries of the town (\"capucins\") and even of the region (\"Luxeuil\" and \"Faverney\" monasteries). Around 20,000 books were added to the library this way, including some 11th century manuscripts. The Mayor's office was responsible for keeping the books.\nIn 1981, the municipality decided to build a new building to encourage the public to read. The library recently got computers. There are around 200 manuscripts and 150 incunables.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":12},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":31},{"uri":"Haute-Sa%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Haute-Sa\u00F4ne","offset":49},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":61},{"uri":"Bourgogne-Franche-Comt%C3%A9","surface_form":"Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9","offset":79},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":103},{"uri":"Haute-Sa%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Haute-Sa\u00F4ne","offset":126},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":149},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":204},{"uri":"Gray_(Haute-Sa%C3%B4ne)","surface_form":"Gray","offset":217},{"uri":"H%C3%A9ricourt_(Haute-Sa%C3%B4ne)","surface_form":"H\u00E9ricourt","offset":223},{"uri":"Lure%2C_Haute-Sa%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Lure","offset":234},{"uri":"Luxeuil-les-Bains","surface_form":"Luxeuil-les-Bains","offset":243},{"uri":"Motte-and-bailey","surface_form":"fortified watchtower","offset":428},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":509},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":547},{"uri":"Celt","surface_form":"Celt","offset":632},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":657},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":855},{"uri":"Buffer_state","surface_form":"buffer state","offset":914},{"uri":"Principality","surface_form":"principality","offset":968},{"uri":"Free_County","surface_form":"Free County","offset":993},{"uri":"Vosges","surface_form":"Vosges","offset":1013},{"uri":"Porrentruy","surface_form":"Porrentruy","offset":1027},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factories","offset":1062},{"uri":"PSA_Peugeot_Citro%C3%ABn","surface_form":"PSA Peugeot Citro\u00EBn","offset":1075},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"library","offset":1137},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1229},{"uri":"Besan%C3%A7on","surface_form":"Besan\u00E7on","offset":1241},{"uri":"French_revolution","surface_form":"Revolution","offset":1357},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monasteries","offset":1466},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":1519},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":1637},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":1650},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"Mayor","offset":1667},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":1734},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":1770},{"uri":"Incunable","surface_form":"incunable","offset":1889}]}
