{"id":25655,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli","text":"Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi, better known as Sandro Botticelli (\"little barrel\") (March 1, 1445 \u2013 May 17, 1510) was an Italian painter. He went to the Florentine school during the Early Renaissance (Quattrocento).\nLess than a hundred years later, Giorgio Vasari saw this movement as a \"golden age\". The patron of the movement was Lorenzo de' Medici. Giogio Vasari expressed this thought at the head of his \"Vita\" of Botticelli.\nYoung Botticelli.\nBotticelli was born in Florence in the working-class \"rione\" of \"Ognissanti\". At first he did an apprenticeship to become a goldsmith. Following the boy's wishes, his doting father sent him to Fra Filippo Lippi. Lippi was working on frescoing the Convent of the Carmine. Lippi's synthesis of the new control of three-dimensional forms, tender expressiveness in face and gesture, and decorative details inherited from the late Gothic style were the strongest influences on Botticelli. Another influence were the Pollaiuolo brothers.They were doing a series of Virtues for the Tribunale or meeting hall of the Mercanzia. This hall was a cloth-merchants' confraternity.Botticelli contributed to this the \"Fortitude\", dated 1470 in the Uffizi Gallery.\nHe was an apprentice too of Andrea del Verrocchio, where Leonardo da Vinci worked beside him, but he made his name in his local Church of Ognissanti, with a \"St. Augustine\" that successfully competed as a pendant with Domenico Ghirlandaio's \"Jerome\" on the other side \"the head of the saint being expressive of profound thought and quick subtlety\" (Vasari). In 1470 he opened his own independent \"studio\".At what age did he start art?\nBeing discovered by the Medici.\nLorenzo de' Medici was quick to employ his talent. Botticelli made consistent use of the circular \"tondo\" form and did many beautiful female nudes, according to Vasari. The \"Birth of Venus\" was at the Medici villa of Castello.\nInfluences of religion on Botticelli.\nThis is a common misunderstanding. It is based on a mistake by Vasari. The painting referred to here, now in the National Gallery in London, is by the artist Botticini. Vasari confused their similar sounding names.\nOther influences.\nIn 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned him and prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists who had been summoned to fresco the walls of the Sistine Chapel. The iconological program was the supremacy of the Papacy. Sandro's contribution was moderately successful.\nHe returned to Florence, and \"being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and illustrated the Inferno which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstension from work led to serious disorders in his living.\" Thus Vasari characterized the first printed Dante (1481) with Botticelli's decorations; he could not imagine that the new art of printing might occupy an artist. As for the subject, when Fra Girolamo Savonarola began to preach hellfire and damnation, the susceptible Sandro Botticelli became one of his adherents, a \"piagnone\" left painting as a worldly vanity, burned much of his own early work, fell into poverty as a result, and would have starved but for the tender support of his former patrons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"March_1","surface_form":"March 1","offset":85},{"uri":"1445","surface_form":"1445","offset":94},{"uri":"May_17","surface_form":"May 17","offset":101},{"uri":"1510","surface_form":"1510","offset":109},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":122},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":130},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":189},{"uri":"Quattrocento","surface_form":"Quattrocento","offset":202},{"uri":"Giorgio_Vasari","surface_form":"Giorgio Vasari","offset":250},{"uri":"Golden_age","surface_form":"golden age","offset":289},{"uri":"Lorenzo_de%27_Medici","surface_form":"Lorenzo de' Medici","offset":333},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":472},{"uri":"Apprenticeship","surface_form":"apprenticeship","offset":546},{"uri":"Goldsmith","surface_form":"goldsmith","offset":573},{"uri":"Fra_Filippo_Lippi","surface_form":"Fra Filippo Lippi","offset":642},{"uri":"Fresco","surface_form":"fresco","offset":682},{"uri":"Convent_of_the_Carmine","surface_form":"Convent of the Carmine","offset":696},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":728},{"uri":"Gesture","surface_form":"gesture","offset":819},{"uri":"Antonio_Pollaiuolo","surface_form":"Pollaiuolo brothers","offset":960},{"uri":"Fortitude_(Botticelli)","surface_form":"Fortitude","offset":1151},{"uri":"1470","surface_form":"1470","offset":1169},{"uri":"Uffizi_Gallery","surface_form":"Uffizi Gallery","offset":1181},{"uri":"Andrea_del_Verrocchio","surface_form":"Andrea del Verrocchio","offset":1225},{"uri":"Leonardo_da_Vinci","surface_form":"Leonardo da Vinci","offset":1254},{"uri":"Church_of_Ognissanti","surface_form":"Church of Ognissanti","offset":1325},{"uri":"St._Augustine_(Botticelli)","surface_form":"St. Augustine","offset":1355},{"uri":"Domenico_Ghirlandaio","surface_form":"Domenico Ghirlandaio","offset":1415},{"uri":"1470","surface_form":"1470","offset":1558},{"uri":"Lorenzo_de%27_Medici","surface_form":"Lorenzo de' Medici","offset":1664},{"uri":"Tondo","surface_form":"tondo","offset":1763},{"uri":"National_Gallery%2C_London","surface_form":"National Gallery","offset":2042},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":2062},{"uri":"Botticini","surface_form":"Botticini","offset":2087},{"uri":"1481","surface_form":"1481","offset":2165},{"uri":"Pope_Sixtus_IV","surface_form":"Pope Sixtus IV","offset":2171},{"uri":"Sistine_Chapel","surface_form":"Sistine Chapel","offset":2293},{"uri":"Dante_Alighieri","surface_form":"Dante","offset":2527},{"uri":"Dante_Alighieri","surface_form":"Dante","offset":2722},{"uri":"Printing","surface_form":"printing","offset":2807},{"uri":"Girolamo_Savonarola","surface_form":"Girolamo Savonarola","offset":2869}]}
