He played for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, Calgary Flames, Los Angeles Kings and Florida Panthers.\nCareer.\nBefore playing in the NHL, Versteeg played 5 seasons in the Western Hockey League (WHL). 3 seasons with the Lethbridge Hurricanes, 1 seasons with the Kamloops Blazers and 1 season with the Red Deer Rebels.\nHe was drafted with the 134th overall pick by the Boston Bruins in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He played 2 seasons with their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, Providence Bruins and was traded along with a conditional draft pick to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Brandon Bochenski.\nHe played 3 seasons with the Blackhawks and won the Stanley Cup with them during the 2009\u201310 NHL season. His name was originally misspelled \"Kris Vertseeg\" when it was engraved on the Stanley Cup but it was quickly corrected afterwards. Versteeg was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with the rights to prospect Bill Sweatt for Viktor Stalberg, Chris DiDomenico, and Philippe Paradis because of salary cap restraints.\nHe played 1 season with the Maple Leafs and was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for first-round and third-round draft picks. He only played 20 games for the Flyers and was again traded, this time to the Florida Panthers for a second-round and a third-round pick.\nVersteeg would play 1 season and 28 games with the Panthers before being traded back to the Chicago Blackhawks on November 14, 2013 in exchange for Jimmy Hayes and Dylan Olsen. On June 15, 2015, he won his second Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks after they defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games.\nOn September 11, 2015, Versteeg was traded along with Joakim Nordstr\u00F6m to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for a 3rd round draft pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Versteeg and Nordstr\u00F6m were traded because the Blackhawks had to make cap space for Marcus Kruger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":58},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":80},{"uri":"Winger_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"right winger","offset":91},{"uri":"Carolina_Hurricanes","surface_form":"Carolina Hurricanes","offset":123},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":150},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":207},{"uri":"Toronto_Maple_Leafs","surface_form":"Toronto Maple Leafs","offset":227},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Flyers","surface_form":"Philadelphia Flyers","offset":248},{"uri":"Calgary_Flames","surface_form":"Calgary Flames","offset":269},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Kings","surface_form":"Los Angeles Kings","offset":285},{"uri":"Florida_Panthers","surface_form":"Florida Panthers","offset":307},{"uri":"Western_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Western Hockey League","offset":393},{"uri":"Lethbridge_Hurricanes","surface_form":"Lethbridge Hurricanes","offset":441},{"uri":"Kamloops_Blazers","surface_form":"Kamloops Blazers","offset":483},{"uri":"Red_Deer_Rebels","surface_form":"Red Deer Rebels","offset":522},{"uri":"Boston_Bruins","surface_form":"Boston Bruins","offset":589},{"uri":"American_Hockey_League","surface_form":"American Hockey League","offset":663},{"uri":"Providence_Bruins","surface_form":"Providence Bruins","offset":703},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":779},{"uri":"Brandon_Bochenski","surface_form":"Brandon Bochenski","offset":814},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":885},{"uri":"2009%E2%80%9310_NHL_season","surface_form":"2009\u201310 NHL season","offset":918},{"uri":"Toronto_Maple_Leafs","surface_form":"Toronto Maple Leafs","offset":1097},{"uri":"Bill_Sweatt","surface_form":"Bill Sweatt","offset":1151},{"uri":"Viktor_Stalberg","surface_form":"Viktor Stalberg","offset":1167},{"uri":"Chris_DiDomenico","surface_form":"Chris DiDomenico","offset":1184},{"uri":"Philippe_Paradis","surface_form":"Philippe Paradis","offset":1206},{"uri":"Salary_cap","surface_form":"salary cap","offset":1234},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Flyers","surface_form":"Philadelphia Flyers","offset":1319},{"uri":"Florida_Panthers","surface_form":"Florida Panthers","offset":1462},{"uri":"Jimmy_Hayes_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"Jimmy Hayes","offset":1670},{"uri":"Dylan_Olsen","surface_form":"Dylan Olsen","offset":1686},{"uri":"Tampa_Bay_Lightning","surface_form":"Tampa Bay Lightning","offset":1791},{"uri":"Joakim_Nordstr%C3%B6m","surface_form":"Joakim Nordstr\u00F6m","offset":1879},{"uri":"Carolina_Hurricanes","surface_form":"Carolina Hurricanes","offset":1903},{"uri":"2017_NHL_Entry_Draft","surface_form":"2017 NHL Entry Draft","offset":1969},{"uri":"Marcus_Kruger","surface_form":"Marcus Kruger","offset":2075}]}
