{"id":256772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniverse","text":"=\"preserve\">The Omniverse is a set or number of supposedly co-existing parallel universes or contains archverses that forms all of existence.\nBy definition, there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another. The multiverse/omniverse theory is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it. An idea that cannot be tested or is not based on logic is not science. So it is not known if multiverse/omniverse is a scientific idea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parallel_universe","surface_form":"parallel universe","offset":71}]}
