He also hit 16 World Series home runs, and held the record for most home runs in Yankee Stadium for many years. He was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. His three closest teammates were Joe DiMaggio, Roger Maris and Whitey Ford. He was an alcoholic. He had hepatitis C and died in Dallas, Texas from liver cancer.\nHis nicknames included The Mick, The Commerce Comet, and Muscles. \"The Commerce Comet\" is a reference to Mantle's days spent working in the coal mines of Commerce, Oklahoma. As a result of this work, Mantle grew incredibly strong, which led to the nickname \"Muscles\".\nMantle was noted for batting average and for his batting power. He won the Major League Baseball Triple Crown in 1956, leading MLB in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI). He received three American League (AL) Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, and played in nineteen Major League Baseball All-Star Game games.
