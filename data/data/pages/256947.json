Later the team was officially named Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro.\nIn September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of their sponsorship arrangement with Marlboro until 2011. This came at a time when tobacco sponsorship was being banned in many location. It had become illegal in the European Union, including F1 races.

Although Marlboro does not sponsor Team Penske, Philip Morris USA is still Team Penske's main sponsor.\nMarlboro also sponsored the Australian Marlboro Holden Dealer Team from 1974 through to 1984. The Marlboro branding gave rise to some of Australia's most prominently recognizable race cars such as the L34 and A9X Torana, as well as the VK Group C \"Big Banger\" Commodore.\nIn Motorcycling Grand Prix, Marlboro sponsored the Yamaha team in 500cc and 250cc class.
