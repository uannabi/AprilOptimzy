{"id":256961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_You_(She%27s_So_Heavy)","text":"\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is a song by The Beatles from their album \"Abbey Road\". It was written by John Lennon, although it is credited to McCartney.\nThe song is an unusual Beatles song for many reasons, its length (nearly eight minutes), small number of lyrics (only fourteen different words are sung), three-minute descent through the same repeated guitar chords, and sudden ending. It is also one of the last songs that the Beatles mixed as a group, on August 20, 1969.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":43},{"uri":"Abbey_Road","surface_form":"Abbey Road","offset":73},{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"John Lennon","offset":104},{"uri":"Lennon-McCartney","surface_form":"McCartney","offset":144},{"uri":"Lyrics","surface_form":"lyrics","offset":260},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":356},{"uri":"Guitar_chord","surface_form":"chord","offset":363}]}
