Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting the final key of A major. He also used the same technique on his 1965 song \"If I Needed Someone,\" which shares a similar melodic pattern. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound.\nA harmonium and handclaps were added on July 16.
