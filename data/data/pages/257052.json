The town overlooks Hilo Bay.\nHilo is near two shield volcanoes\nSome of the best ground-based astronomical observatories are on Mauna Kea.\nHilo is home to the University of Hawaii at Hilo, as well as the Merrie Monarch Festival, a week-long celebration of ancient and modern hula, which takes place every year after Easter. It is also home to the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation, one of the world's leading producers of macadamia nuts. It is served by Hilo International Airport, inside the CDP.\nHistory.\nAlthough there is not much archaeological evidence, people lived in the areas along Hilo Bay, Wailuku and Wailoa Rivers before the Western world made contact. They were known as the Hilo. They dominated the high mountaintops until the middle 1800s. Hilo means high mountaintop in the original language of the native peoples who lived on the mountaintops. King Kamehameha, the first king of Hawaii, conquered all the islands and then moved the Hilo mountain settlement to the shore after the arrival of outsiders.\nOriginally, the name Hilo applied to the whole district of Hilo, now divided into South Hilo District and North Hilo District. When William Ellis visited in 1823, the main settlement in Hilo district was Wai\u0101kea on Hilo Bay. Missionaries came to the district in the early to middle 1800s, founding several churches, notably Haili Church, in the area of modern Hilo.\nHilo expanded as sugar plantations in the surrounding area created new jobs and drew in many workers from Asia, making the city a trading center.\nA breakwater across Hilo Bay was begun in the 1900s and completed in 1929. On April 1, 1946, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake near the Aleutian Islands created a fourteen-meter high tsunami that hit Hilo 4.9 hours later, killing 160 people. In response an early warning system, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, was established in 1949 to track these killer waves and provide warning. This tsunami also meant the end of the Hawaii Consolidated Railway, and instead the Hawaii Belt Road was built north of Hilo using some of the railbed.\nOn May 23, 1960, another tsunami, caused by a 9.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Chile the previous day, claimed 61 lives allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. Low-lying bayfront areas of the city on Wai\u0101kea peninsula and along Hilo Bay, previously populated, were rededicated as parks and memorials.\nGeography and climate.\nHilo is located at (19.705520, -155.085918).\nHilo is classified by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), and has a total area of, of which is land and of which (7.10%) is water.\nHilo features a tropical rainforest climate (Koppen \"Af\"), with substantial rainfall throughout the course of the year. Hilo's location on the eastern side of the island of Hawaii (windward relative to the trade winds) makes it the wettest city in the United States and one of the wettest cities in the world. An average of around of rain fell at Hilo International Airport annually between 1971\u20132000, with 275 days of the year receiving some rain. At some other weather stations in Hilo the annual rainfall is above.\nMonthly average temperatures range from in January to in August. The highest recorded temperature was on May 20, 1996, and the lowest on February 21, 1962. The wettest year was 1994 with and the driest year was 1983 with. The most rainfall in one month was in December 1954. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on November 2, 2000.\nHilo's location on the shore of the funnel-shaped Hilo Bay also makes it vulnerable to tsunamis.\nEducation.\nThere are many educational institutions in Hilo. Some of these are: two post-secondary institutions, the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Census-designated_place","surface_form":"CDP","offset":30},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"State of Hawaii","offset":41},{"uri":"Hawaii_(island)","surface_form":"island of Hawaii","offset":91},{"uri":"2000_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2000 census","offset":147},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":172},{"uri":"Hawaii_County%2C_Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii County, Hawaii","offset":187},{"uri":"South_Hilo_District","surface_form":"South Hilo District","offset":233},{"uri":"Hilo_Bay","surface_form":"Hilo Bay","offset":273},{"uri":"Shield_volcano","surface_form":"shield volcano","offset":300},{"uri":"Observatories","surface_form":"observatories","offset":360},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo","surface_form":"University of Hawaii at Hilo","offset":412},{"uri":"Merrie_Monarch_Festival","surface_form":"Merrie Monarch Festival","offset":457},{"uri":"Hula_(dance)","surface_form":"hula","offset":528},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":569},{"uri":"Mauna_Loa_Macadamia_Nut_Corporation","surface_form":"Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation","offset":600},{"uri":"Macadamia_nut","surface_form":"macadamia nut","offset":677},{"uri":"Hilo_International_Airport","surface_form":"Hilo International Airport","offset":709},{"uri":"Census-designated_place","surface_form":"CDP","offset":748},{"uri":"Wailuku_River","surface_form":"Wailuku","offset":856},{"uri":"Wailoa_River","surface_form":"Wailoa River","offset":868},{"uri":"Kamehameha","surface_form":"Kamehameha","offset":1122},{"uri":"William_Ellis_(missionary)","surface_form":"William Ellis","offset":1407},{"uri":"Wai%C4%81kea","surface_form":"Wai\u0101kea","offset":1479},{"uri":"Haili_Church","surface_form":"Haili Church","offset":1599},{"uri":"Sugar_plantations_in_Hawaii","surface_form":"sugar plantations","offset":1658},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":1747},{"uri":"Hilo_Bay","surface_form":"Hilo Bay","offset":1807},{"uri":"Aleutian_Island_earthquake","surface_form":"7.8 magnitude earthquake","offset":1882},{"uri":"Aleutian_Islands","surface_form":"Aleutian Islands","offset":1916},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":1963},{"uri":"Pacific_Tsunami_Warning_Center","surface_form":"Pacific Tsunami Warning Center","offset":2063},{"uri":"Hawaii_Consolidated_Railway","surface_form":"Hawaii Consolidated Railway","offset":2207},{"uri":"Hawaii_Belt_Road","surface_form":"Hawaii Belt Road","offset":2252},{"uri":"Great_Chilean_Earthquake","surface_form":"9.5 magnitude earthquake","offset":2366},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":2408},{"uri":"Waiakea","surface_form":"Wai\u0101kea","offset":2547},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"United States Census Bureau","offset":2742},{"uri":"Census-designated_place","surface_form":"census-designated place","offset":2775},{"uri":"Tropical_rainforest_climate","surface_form":"tropical rainforest climate","offset":2895},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koppen","offset":2924},{"uri":"Windward_and_leeward","surface_form":"windward","offset":3060},{"uri":"Trade_wind","surface_form":"trade wind","offset":3085},{"uri":"Hilo_Bay","surface_form":"Hilo Bay","offset":3777},{"uri":"Vulnerable","surface_form":"vulnerable","offset":3800},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":3814},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo","surface_form":"University of Hawaii at Hilo","offset":3940},{"uri":"Hawaii_Community_College","surface_form":"Hawaii Community College","offset":3973}]}
