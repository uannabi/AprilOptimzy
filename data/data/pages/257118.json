Starting with the line \"Golden slumbers fill your eyes\", the drums come in and McCartney switches to a stronger tone. McCartney said, \"I remember trying to get a very strong vocal on it, because it was such a gentle theme, so I worked on the strength of the vocal on it, and ended up quite pleased with it.\"\nThe main recording session for \"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\" was on July 2, 1969.\nJohn Lennon was not present. He was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Scotland on July 1, 1969, and was hospitalized there until July 6.\nAdditional vocals were added in an overdub session on 30 July 1969, the same day the first trial edit of the side two medley was created.
