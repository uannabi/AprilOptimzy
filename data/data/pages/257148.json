Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". It was composed mainly by John Lennon with input from Paul McCartney and credited to McCartney.\nInspiration.\nLennon wrote the song taking inspiration from a nineteenth century circus poster for Pablo Fanque's circus which he purchased in an antique shop on 31 January 1967 while filming the promotional video for the song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in Kent. Lennon said that \"Everything from the song is from that poster, except the horse wasn't called Henry.\" (The poster idenitifies the horse as \"Zanthus\".) Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite, who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":70},{"uri":"Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band","surface_form":"Sgt.
