Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\nComposition.\n\"Within You Without You\" features only Harrison and a group of uncredited Indian musicians, although producer George Martin arranged the string section, and Harrison and assistant Neil Aspinall played the tambura. According to Prema Music, dilrubha player Amrit Gajjar played on the track. It is the second of Harrison's songs to be explicitly influenced by Indian classical music, after \"Love You To\", and Harrison's only composition on \"Sgt. Pepper\". \"Within You Without You\" was written on a harmonium at the house of long-time Beatles friend Klaus Voormann, while \"there were lots of joints being smoked\".\nStephen Stills was so impressed by the lyrics that he had them carved on a stone monument in his yard. John Lennon said it was\"one of George's best songs.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"George_Harrison","surface_form":"George Harrison","offset":46},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":78},{"uri":"Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band","surface_form":"Sgt.
