Millions of species, and humanity itself, are threatened. The title of the book, \"Storms of My Grandchildren\", refers to the extreme weather events \"that will greet the next generation if the unmitigated use of fossil fuels continues\".\nHansen states that we immediately need to \"reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to at most 350 ppm in order to avoid disasters for coming generations\". He says that we need to reduce coal plant emissions, and improve forestry and agricultural practices.\n\"Storms of My Grandchildren\" has been reviewed in \"Nature, the Los Angeles Times\", \"Science\", and \"Cosmos\".\nJames Hansen is director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and is often called the \"father of global warming\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"James_Hansen","surface_form":"James Hansen","offset":76},{"uri":"Fossil_fuel","surface_form":"fossil fuel","offset":122},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"changing our climate","offset":138},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":490},{"uri":"Parts-per_notation","surface_form":"ppm","offset":520},{"uri":"Nature_(magazine)","surface_form":"Nature","offset":730},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Times","surface_form":"Los Angeles Times","offset":742},{"uri":"Science_(magazine)","surface_form":"Science","offset":763},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":819},{"uri":"Goddard_Institute_for_Space_Studies","surface_form":"Goddard Institute for Space Studies","offset":824},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":895}]}
