{"id":257754,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Good_Morning","text":"\"Good Morning Good Morning\" is a song written by John Lennon (credited to McCartney) and performed by The Beatles on the 1967 \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album.\nLyrical inspiration.\nInspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The jingle went: \"Good morning, good morning, The best to you each morning, Sunshine Breakfast, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Crisp and full of fun\".\nThe line \"It's time for tea and Meet the Wife\" refers to a BBC sitcom, \"Meet the Wife\".\nRecording.\nThe track was recorded on 8 February 1967, with overdubs (extra music that's recorded into the song) on 16 February (bass and vocals), 13 March (brass section), 28 March (backing vocals and guitar solo), and 29 March (animal noises). The guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney.\nAt Lennon's request, George Martin brought in Sounds Incorporated to play the brass section with their signature saxophone sound.\nLennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning as well as the end of the song so that the animal heard was one capable of devouring or frightening the animal that came before it..\nThe final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\".\nIn the mono version, the length is 2:35, whereas in the stereo version, the length is 2:41 because there are more animal noises.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"John Lennon","offset":49},{"uri":"McCartney","surface_form":"McCartney","offset":74},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":102},{"uri":"Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band","surface_form":"Sgt.
