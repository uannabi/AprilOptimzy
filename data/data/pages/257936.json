{"id":257936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state","text":"Oxidation state (or oxidation number) refers to the number of electrons added to or removed from an element when it forms a chemical compound. Sodium metal, for example, has an oxidation state of 0 in the elemental state. But when it gives up its one valence (outer) electron (symbolized by e\u2212), it becomes a sodium ion Na+ with an oxidation state of +1. Iron is another example. It can lose two electrons, forming an oxidation state of +2; or it can lose three electrons, forming an oxidation state of +3.\nIf elements gain electrons, they have negative oxidation states. If chlorine gains an electron, it forms a Cl\u2212 ion (chloride) and has oxidation state of \u22121. If sulfur gains two electrons, it forms an S2\u2212 ion (sulfide) and has oxidation state of \u22122.\nThe Na+ ions and Cl\u2212 ions then form a compound, NaCl, sodium chloride (table salt). Or the Fe2+ and S2\u2212 ions form FeS, iron sulfide.\nAll free elements have an oxidation state of 0.\nExamples: potassium permanganate with the formula KMnO4 has Mn in oxidation state +7, and CrO42\u2212 has Cr in oxidation state +6.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":62},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"element","offset":100},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":124},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"Sodium","offset":143},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":177},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":316},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"Iron","offset":355},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":575},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":667},{"uri":"Table_salt","surface_form":"table salt","offset":827},{"uri":"Iron_sulfide","surface_form":"iron sulfide","offset":875},{"uri":"Permanganate","surface_form":"permanganate","offset":957},{"uri":"Chromate","surface_form":"CrO42\u2212","offset":1027}]}
