{"id":25797,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers","text":"The Philadelphia Flyers are an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL). They began in 1967, and have been a strong team for most of their history. The Flyers won the Stanley Cup championship in 1974 and 1975. They also made the finals in 1976, 1980, 1985, 1987, 1997, and 2010. They won the President's Trophy as top team in the regular season in 1975, 1980, and 1985.\nTheir championship team in the 1970s was led by Bobby Clarke, who won the Hart Trophy as most valuable player (MVP) in the NHL in 1973, 1975, and 1976. Bernie Parent was also an important part of this team: he was named the NHL's top goaltender in 1974 and 1975, and those same years won the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP in the playoffs. Reggie Leach was the NHL's top goal scorer in 1976; he also won the Conn Smythe Trophy that year. Bob Dailey, Rick MacLeish, and Bill Barber were also important members of the 1970s Flyers.\nIn 1979-80, the Flyers set an NHL record for most games in a row without a loss: 35. No team in North America in hockey, baseball, football, or basketball has had more games unbeaten. Goaltender Pete Peeters was one reason they set this record.\nIn the 1980s, the team was led by Mark Howe (son of Gordie Howe), a defenceman who also played well on offence. Pelle Lindbergh (1985) and Ron Hextall (1987) both won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender; Hextall also won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1987. Tim Kerr was a high goal scorer.\nEric Lindros won the Hart Trophy in 1995. John Leclair, Mark Recchi, and Eric Desjardins were also strong players in the 1990s.\nThe Flyers continued to be a strong team in the early 21st century, coming very close to making the Stanley Cup finals twice. Keith Primeau, Peter Forsberg, and Simon Gagne have been among their top players. They lost the 2010 Stanley Cup finals to Chicago Blackhawks in six games, but did not make the playoffs in four out of the last eight seasons (2012-13, 2014-15, 2016-17, 2018-19).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":31},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":54},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":178},{"uri":"President%27s_Trophy","surface_form":"President's Trophy","offset":303},{"uri":"Regular_season","surface_form":"regular season","offset":341},{"uri":"Bobby_Clarke","surface_form":"Bobby Clarke","offset":429},{"uri":"Hart_Trophy","surface_form":"Hart Trophy","offset":455},{"uri":"Most_valuable_player","surface_form":"most valuable player","offset":470},{"uri":"Bernie_Parent","surface_form":"Bernie Parent","offset":533},{"uri":"Conn_Smythe_Trophy","surface_form":"Conn Smythe Trophy","offset":673},{"uri":"Reggie_Leach","surface_form":"Reggie Leach","offset":716},{"uri":"Conn_Smythe_Trophy","surface_form":"Conn Smythe Trophy","offset":784},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1002},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":1027},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":1037},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":1050},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"Goaltender","offset":1090},{"uri":"Mark_Howe","surface_form":"Mark Howe","offset":1185},{"uri":"Gordie_Howe","surface_form":"Gordie Howe","offset":1203},{"uri":"Vezina_Trophy","surface_form":"Vezina Trophy","offset":1322},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"goaltender","offset":1353},{"uri":"Eric_Lindros","surface_form":"Eric Lindros","offset":1447},{"uri":"Hart_Trophy","surface_form":"Hart Trophy","offset":1468}]}
