{"id":257989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico","text":"The Flag of the State of New Mexico has the red sun symbol of the Zia people in the middle and has a yellow background.\nIn 1920, Dr. Harry Mera, an archaeologist, won a contest to design a new state flag and chose the Zia sun symbol because he was familiar with it. It was used in Zia Pueblo on a 19th century pot. There is four points in the symbol because four is a sacred number to the Zia. To the Zia, it is the Circle of Life: four winds, four seasons, four directions, and four sacred obligations. New Mexico was the 48th state and it was founded in 1912.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":25}]}
