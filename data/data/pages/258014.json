{"id":258014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide","text":"Iron(III) oxide, also known as rust, is a reddish substance, an iron oxide. It has a chemical formula of Fe2O3. It is made by the reaction of iron with oxygen. It is found naturally in the ground. It is a major ore of iron (iron comes from this mineral)haematite. It dissolves in acids. It can be mixed with fine powdered granules of aluminum in a 27:80 ratio to form thermite, a semi-explosive powder.\nThe iron is in the +3 oxidation state, which is what the III means. If the iron was in the +2 oxidation state, it would be iron(II) oxide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iron_oxide","surface_form":"iron oxide","offset":64},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":142},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":152},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":211},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":245},{"uri":"Haematite","surface_form":"haematite","offset":253},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":280},{"uri":"Aluminum","surface_form":"aluminum","offset":334},{"uri":"Thermite","surface_form":"thermite","offset":368},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":425},{"uri":"Iron(II)_oxide","surface_form":"iron(II) oxide","offset":526}]}
