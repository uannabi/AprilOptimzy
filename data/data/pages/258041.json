{"id":258041,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704","text":"NFPA 704, also known as a fire diamond, is a diamond-shaped sign or picture that tells people about the hazards of a chemical compound. It was designed in 1960 by the National Fire Protection Association, as a way of quickly telling firefighters and other emergency workers what kind of dangers might be nearby.\nThe sign is made of four smaller diamonds: a red one on top, a yellow one on the right, a white one on the bottom, and a blue one on the left. Numbers or symbols in these boxes tell how dangerous the chemical is.\nThe red diamond tells how flammable the chemical compound is: how easily it catches fire. The yellow diamond tells about reactivity: how quickly the compound reacts with other materials. (For example, some chemicals, like ammonium nitrate, explode when they touch water; this is an example of reactivity.) The blue diamond tells how dangerous the chemical is to a person's health. Each of these three diamonds - red, yellow, and blue - are given a score between 0 and 4. A score of 0 means there is no danger. A score of 4 means there is the worst possible danger.\nThe white diamond has codes for \"special hazards.\" For example, if a chemical like ammonium nitrate should not touch water because it will explode, a W with a line through it will be written in the white diamond.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":45},{"uri":"Hazard","surface_form":"hazards","offset":104},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":117},{"uri":"National_Fire_Protection_Association","surface_form":"National Fire Protection Association","offset":167},{"uri":"Firefighter","surface_form":"firefighter","offset":233},{"uri":"Flammability","surface_form":"flammable","offset":551},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":609},{"uri":"Reactivity_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reactivity","offset":646},{"uri":"Ammonium_nitrate","surface_form":"ammonium nitrate","offset":747},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explode","offset":765},{"uri":"Code","surface_form":"code","offset":1112}]}
