{"id":258144,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_chloride","text":"Zinc chloride is a chemical compound. It contains zinc and chloride ions. The zinc is in the +2 oxidation state, the only oxidation state zinc has. Its chemical formula is ZnCl2.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless crystal compound. It dissolves in water. It reacts with bases to make zinc hydroxide.\nPreparation.\nZinc chloride can be made by reacting zinc with hydrochloric acid. In this reaction, hydrogen gas is also produced. It can also be made by reacting zinc with chlorine.\nUses.\nIt is used in the making of chemicals, textile processing, and the electrolyte of the Leclanche cell. Cells containing this chemical are marketed as \"Super Heavy Duty\" or \"Extra Heavy Duty\".\nSafety.\nZinc chloride irritates skin and the respiratory tract.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":19},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":50},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":59},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":68},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":96},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":265},{"uri":"Zinc_hydroxide","surface_form":"zinc hydroxide","offset":279},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":346},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":356},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":393},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":510},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":521},{"uri":"Electrolyte","surface_form":"electrolyte","offset":549},{"uri":"Leclanche_cell","surface_form":"Leclanche cell","offset":568},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":705},{"uri":"Respiratory_tract","surface_form":"respiratory tract","offset":718}]}
