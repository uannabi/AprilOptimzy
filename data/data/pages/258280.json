{"id":258280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_chlorate","text":"Potassium chlorate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KClO3. It has potassium and chlorate ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless crystalline solid. It dissolves in water. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It gives off oxygen when heated. Sometimes manganese(IV) oxide is used to make the oxygen come faster. It can explode when mixed with a strong reducing agent. It can make many things burn that don't normally burn.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by electrolysis of a hot solution of potassium chloride. This is similar to the chloralkali process. It can also be made by reacting concentrated sodium chlorate with potassium chloride.\nUses.\nIt is used in fireworks. It is a part of Armstrong's mixture, a sensitive explosive. It is also used to make oxygen gas in high school and college labs. It can burn sugar when mixed with sugar and concentrated sulfuric acid. It can also replace potassium nitrate in gunpowder. It is used in oxygen candles. Oxygen candles made oxygen when burned. They are used in spaceships.\nSafety.\nPotassium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent and can catch many things on fire. When it is mixed with sulfur or phosphorus, it burns very easily. Many other chemicals can make dangerous mixtures with potassium chlorate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":24},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":81},{"uri":"Chlorate","surface_form":"chlorate","offset":95},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":104},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":140},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":197},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":227},{"uri":"Manganese(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"manganese(IV) oxide","offset":257},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":357},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":455},{"uri":"Potassium_chloride","surface_form":"potassium chloride","offset":489},{"uri":"Chloralkali_process","surface_form":"chloralkali process","offset":532},{"uri":"Sodium_chlorate","surface_form":"sodium chlorate","offset":598},{"uri":"Firework","surface_form":"firework","offset":659},{"uri":"Armstrong%27s_mixture","surface_form":"Armstrong's mixture","offset":686},{"uri":"Sensitive","surface_form":"sensitive","offset":709},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":719},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":768},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":784},{"uri":"Lab","surface_form":"lab","offset":792},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":855},{"uri":"Potassium_nitrate","surface_form":"potassium nitrate","offset":890},{"uri":"Gunpowder","surface_form":"gunpowder","offset":911},{"uri":"Spaceship","surface_form":"spaceship","offset":1009},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":1133},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":1143}]}
