{"id":258282,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masterplan_(song)","text":"\"The Masterplan\" is a song by English rock band Oasis. It was written by lead guitarist, Noel Gallagher.\nThe song was first released as a B-side to the CD version of their hit single \"Wonderwall\" in October 1995. \"The Masterplan\" was also released with the \"Stop the Clocks\" EP in November 2006. It also shares the name with the 1998 B-side compilation album, \"The Masterplan\", on which it is featured as the last track.\nNoel Gallagher has regularly declared \"The Masterplan\" as one of the best songs he has ever written. However, he regrets the fact that it was first released as a B-side, admitting he was \"young and stupid\", when he made that decision. He also claims that Creation Records boss, Alan McGee, upon hearing the song, told Noel it was \"too good\" to be a B-side. Noel reportedly replied, \"Well, I don't write shit songs!\".\n\"The Masterplan\" is sung by Noel, and features all band members except for Liam Gallagher, in addition to an orchestra. The song features a backwards guitar solo after the first chorus. Approximately 30 seconds from the end of the song, Noel can be heard singing the chorus from \"Octopus's Garden\" by The Beatles.\nThe song is included in Oasis' album \"Stop the Clocks\". An animated video was created to promote the album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":38},{"uri":"Oasis_(band)","surface_form":"Oasis","offset":48},{"uri":"Lead_guitar","surface_form":"lead guitar","offset":73},{"uri":"Noel_Gallagher","surface_form":"Noel Gallagher","offset":89},{"uri":"A-side_and_B-side","surface_form":"B-side","offset":138},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":176},{"uri":"Wonderwall_(song)","surface_form":"Wonderwall","offset":184},{"uri":"Stop_the_Clocks_(EP)","surface_form":"Stop the Clocks","offset":258},{"uri":"The_Masterplan","surface_form":"The Masterplan","offset":361},{"uri":"Creation_Records","surface_form":"Creation Records","offset":676},{"uri":"Alan_McGee","surface_form":"Alan McGee","offset":699},{"uri":"Liam_Gallagher","surface_form":"Liam Gallagher","offset":913},{"uri":"Octopus%27s_Garden","surface_form":"Octopus's Garden","offset":1118},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":1139}]}
