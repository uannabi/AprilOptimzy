{"id":258367,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderwall_(movie)","text":"\"Wonderwall\" is a 1968 British movie by then first-time director Joe Massot. It starred Jack MacGowran, Jane Birkin, Richard Wattis, Irene Handl, and Iain Quarrier, and had cameos by Anita Pallenberg and Dutch designers The Fool (who were also set designers for the movie).\nPlot.\nThe story of the movie revolves around the reclusive, eccentric scientist Oscar Collins (MacGowran), whose next-door neighbours are a pop photographer and his girlfriend/model (Birkin), named Penny Lane. Discovering a beam of light streaming through a hole in the wall between them, Collins follows the light and spots Penny modelling for a photo shoot. Intrigued, he begins to make more holes, as days go by and they do more photo sessions. Oscar gradually becomes infatuated with the girl, and feels a part of the couple's lives, even forsaking work to observe them. When they quarrel and the couple split, Penny takes an overdose of pills and passes out, but Oscar comes to her rescue.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":23},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":31},{"uri":"Joe_Massot","surface_form":"Joe Massot","offset":65},{"uri":"Jack_MacGowran","surface_form":"Jack MacGowran","offset":88},{"uri":"Jane_Birkin","surface_form":"Jane Birkin","offset":104},{"uri":"Richard_Wattis","surface_form":"Richard Wattis","offset":117},{"uri":"Irene_Handl","surface_form":"Irene Handl","offset":133},{"uri":"Iain_Quarrier","surface_form":"Iain Quarrier","offset":150},{"uri":"Cameo_appearance","surface_form":"cameos","offset":173},{"uri":"Anita_Pallenberg","surface_form":"Anita Pallenberg","offset":183},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":204},{"uri":"The_Fool_(design_collective)","surface_form":"The Fool","offset":220},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":418}]}
