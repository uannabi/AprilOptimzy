{"id":258387,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_damper","text":"=\"preserve\">A harmonic damper is a device connected to the free end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine. It is needed in engines with long crankshafts, such as straight-8 engines. It is used on most engines to reduce torsional vibrations that can occure at certain speeds.\nConstruction.\nThe damper consists of an inner hub attached to the end of the crankshaft. A round mass is attached to the hub by an elastic material. This becomes a spring-mass-damper system. By selection of the damping material and the size of the mass, the damper can be made to quiet the torsional vibrations. The overall appearance is that of a thick disk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crankshaft","surface_form":"crankshaft","offset":75},{"uri":"Internal_combustion_engine","surface_form":"internal combustion engine","offset":92},{"uri":"Straight-eight_engine","surface_form":"straight-8 engines","offset":175},{"uri":"Torsion_(twist)","surface_form":"torsional","offset":232},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":385},{"uri":"Elasticity_(physics)","surface_form":"elastic","offset":419}]}
