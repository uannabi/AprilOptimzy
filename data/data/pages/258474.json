{"id":258474,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Feels_Love%3F","text":"\"Who Feels Love?\" is a song by the rock band Oasis. It was written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. It became the second single to be released from the album \"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\". The song reached number 4 on the UK singles charts. The single was a success, but it failed to achieve a Silver or better certification in the UK. The previous 11 British Oasis singles had reached this level of certification.\nThe album was noted for its psychedelic feel, and \"Who Feels Love?\" was the best example of this. Mark Stent was praised for his production on the song, creating a \"trippy\" feel like that found on Beatles songs such as \"Rain\". With the psychedelic and Eastern sound, the song also reminds of George Harrison achievements like \"Within You Without You\" and also some of his solo work.\nHowever, despite the high-quality production, the song was not well received by the critics, \"NME\" said that the production \"triumphs over any real sort of feeling... pure mock Maharishi spirituality that not even Liam can salvage from the realm of self-parody\".\nOne of the B-sides is a cover of The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\". It was played live during the Shoulders tour of 2000.\nThe video was filmed in Death Valley, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":35},{"uri":"Oasis_(band)","surface_form":"Oasis","offset":45},{"uri":"Noel_Gallagher","surface_form":"Noel Gallagher","offset":96},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":133},{"uri":"Album_(music)","surface_form":"album","offset":164},{"uri":"Standing_on_the_Shoulder_of_Giants","surface_form":"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants","offset":171},{"uri":"Psychedelic","surface_form":"psychedelic","offset":462},{"uri":"Mark_Stent","surface_form":"Mark Stent","offset":532},{"uri":"Rain_(The_Beatles_song)","surface_form":"Rain","offset":654},{"uri":"George_Harrison","surface_form":"George Harrison","offset":726},{"uri":"Within_You_Without_You","surface_form":"Within You Without You","offset":761},{"uri":"NME","surface_form":"NME","offset":911},{"uri":"Maharishi","surface_form":"Maharishi","offset":994},{"uri":"Liam_Gallagher","surface_form":"Liam","offset":1031},{"uri":"A-side_and_B-side","surface_form":"B-side","offset":1091},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":1113},{"uri":"Helter_Skelter_(song)","surface_form":"Helter Skelter","offset":1127},{"uri":"Death_Valley","surface_form":"Death Valley","offset":1222}]}
