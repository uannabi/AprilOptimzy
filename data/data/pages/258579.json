She is famous for writing children's books with animal characters such as \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\".\nPotter was born in Kensington, London. Her family was quite rich. She was educated by governesses. She did not have many friends, but she had many pets, including Benjamin and Peter, two rabbits. She spent her holidays in Scotland and the Lake District. There, she began to learn to love nature, plants, and animals, which she carefully painted.\nWhen she was around 30, Potter published \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\". It was very popular. She also became engaged to her publisher Norman Warne. Her parents became angry and separated with her because of this. They did not want her to marry someone who was socially lower than her. However, Warne died before he and Potter could marry.\nPotter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time. She did not have to ask her parents for money anymore because she had money from her books. In time, she bought Hill Top Farm and more land. In her forties, she married William Heelis, a local solicitor. She also began raising sheep and became a farmer, though she continued writing. She published 23 books.\nPotter did not have any children. She died of heart disease and pneumonia in Near Sawrey, Lancashire on 22\u00A0December 1943. Almost all of her money was left to the National Trust. Her books continue to sell well around the world, in many different languages.
