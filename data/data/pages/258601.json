{"id":258601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_oxide","text":"Lead(II) oxide, also known as plumbous oxide and litharge, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbO. It has lead in the +2 oxidation state. It also contains oxide ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow or red solid. When it is heated with charcoal it makes liquid lead metal. It is a crystalline solid. It is highly toxic since it has lead in it. It reacts with acids to make other lead(II) salts and bases to make plumbites.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by heating lead strongly in air. It can be also made by heating lead carbonate or lead nitrate.\nUses.\nIt is made when lead is taken from its ores. The lead sulfide in galena is changed to lead(II) oxide, which is heated with charcoal to make liquid lead. It is used to make lead glass. It used to be used in lead paint.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":64},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":119},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":134},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":168},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":174},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":269},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":289},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":367},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":406},{"uri":"Lead_carbonate","surface_form":"lead carbonate","offset":523},{"uri":"Lead_nitrate","surface_form":"lead nitrate","offset":541},{"uri":"Galena","surface_form":"galena","offset":626},{"uri":"Lead_glass","surface_form":"lead glass","offset":733}]}
