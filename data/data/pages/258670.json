{"id":258670,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_ground_squirrel","text":"The little ground squirrel (\"Spermophilus pygmaeus\") is a species of rodent in the Sciuridae family. It is found in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\nThe Caucasian mountain ground squirrel, \"Spermophilus musicus\", was previously a subspecies, but is now a separate species.\nThis species is diurnal and lives in grassland, uncultivated ground, field edges and roadside verges. It avoids areas with dense long vegetation. It lives in colonies and builds burrows. It makes permanent burrows for hibernation and reproduction and temporary burrows for shelter. Before hibernation, all exits from the burrow are plugged by soil. In March or April the entrances are opened, the burrows cleaned and new construction starts. It uses mounds on the surface as look-out points.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":69},{"uri":"Sciuridae","surface_form":"Sciuridae","offset":83},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":116},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":125},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":137},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":145},{"uri":"Uzbekistan","surface_form":"Uzbekistan","offset":158},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":251},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":310},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":331},{"uri":"Colony_(biology)","surface_form":"colonies","offset":452}]}
