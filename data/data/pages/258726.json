{"id":258726,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_nitrate","text":"Lead nitrate is a chemical compound. It has lead and nitrate ions in it. It was known long ago as plumb dulcis. The lead is in the +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nLead nitrate is a white solid. It is one of the few lead compounds that can dissolve in water. Lead(II) acetate is the other lead compound that can dissolve. It is an oxidizing agent. It crackles when it is heated. It is toxic because it has lead in it.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving lead, lead(II) oxide, or lead(II) carbonate in nitric acid.\nUses.\nIt is used to make other lead compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":18},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":44},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":53},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":61},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":134},{"uri":"Lead(II)_acetate","surface_form":"Lead(II) acetate","offset":258},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":330},{"uri":"Lead(II)_oxide","surface_form":"lead(II) oxide","offset":461},{"uri":"Lead(II)_carbonate","surface_form":"lead(II) carbonate","offset":480},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":502}]}
