{"id":258739,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate","text":"Acetate, also known as ethanoate, is the salt of acetic acid (vinegar). It is formed when acetic acid is deprotonated. Its chemical formula is CH2COOH- when it exists as an ion. Acetate salts turn brown when heated, and smell like acetic acid.\nAcetate is usually found as part of a compound formed as a salt, for example sodium acetate, often as the product of a neutralisation reaction of acetic acid and a base.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acetic_acid","surface_form":"acetic acid","offset":49},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonated","offset":105},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":173},{"uri":"Salts","surface_form":"salts","offset":186},{"uri":"Sodium_acetate","surface_form":"sodium acetate","offset":321},{"uri":"Acid%E2%80%93base_reaction","surface_form":"neutralisation","offset":363},{"uri":"Acetic_acid","surface_form":"acetic acid","offset":390},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":408}]}
