{"id":258767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_Kids","text":"=\"preserve\">PBS Kids is the educational children's programming brand of the Public Broadcasting Service. It started in 1994. Its programming is non-commercial, like all PBS programming. PBS Kids programs are mostly shown in the daytime. These programs are meant for children ages 3-10 (with some exceptions, Sesame Street is 2-6, Arthur is 4-12, etc.). PBS Kids's programs use science, math and reading. Some of them also include social studies. All of the programs give a problem that the children have to solve. An example of these problems would be what to do when two children want to play with the same thing but fight (teaching the importance of sharing).\nProgramming.\nSee List of programs broadcast by PBS Kids","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":28},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"programming","offset":51},{"uri":"Brand","surface_form":"brand","offset":63},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"Public Broadcasting Service","offset":76},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"non-commercial","offset":144},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":169},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":377},{"uri":"Math","surface_form":"math","offset":386},{"uri":"Reading","surface_form":"reading","offset":395},{"uri":"Social_studies","surface_form":"social studies","offset":430},{"uri":"List_of_programs_broadcast_by_PBS_Kids","surface_form":"List of programs broadcast by PBS Kids","offset":679}]}
