{"id":258786,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction","text":"Habitat destruction is when a habitat is no longer able to support the plants, animals, or other organisms that live in it. When this happens, the organisms could die. Some might move to other places.\nHabitat loss can happen naturally. Wildfires can destroy plants that animals need to live in or to eat. Lava flows from volcanoes can do the same thing.\nHabitat loss can also be caused by the actions of people. For example, when trees are cut down, birds who nested in the trees can no longer live there. Clearing grassland to make habitats for people can take away habitat for other animals. Some natural habitats are protected by laws, for example National parks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":30},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":97},{"uri":"Wildfire","surface_form":"Wildfire","offset":236},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"Lava","offset":305},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":321},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":515},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"National park","offset":651}]}
