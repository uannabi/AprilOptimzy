There is a system for recording and assessing craters.\nLargest craters on Earth.\nThere are some other suggested impact structures which are larger. It is a feature of the Earth that climate, weathering and plate tectonics removes most of the older features and events. In comparison, the Moon retains a nearly complete record of its past impact events. The implication is that the Earth once suffered a similar bombardment in its early history. This period is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, because it occurred after the Earth and Moon formed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":63},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":272},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":281},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":296},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":378},{"uri":"Implication_(grammar)","surface_form":"implication","offset":447},{"uri":"Late_Heavy_Bombardment","surface_form":"Late Heavy Bombardment","offset":563}]}
