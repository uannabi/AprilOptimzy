He also said, \"It was the first song I'd ever written the words first. I never wrote words first, it was always some kind of accompaniment. I've hardly ever done it since either.\" The lyrics follow the \"letter song\" model as used on \"P.S. I Love You\", the B-side of their first single.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":29},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"Paul McCartney","offset":53},{"uri":"McCartney","surface_form":"McCartney","offset":81},{"uri":"With_the_Beatles","surface_form":"With the Beatles","offset":114},{"uri":"P.S._I_Love_You_(The_Beatles_song)","surface_form":"P.S.
