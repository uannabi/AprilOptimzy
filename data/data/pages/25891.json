{"id":25891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask","text":"A mask is a type of clothing which covers the face. It is similar to a veil, but more close-fitting.\nUses.\nThere are different reasons why people use masks. A person can use a mask so others do not know who they are (as when committing a crime). Or, a mask may keep someones face safe from harm (like a gas mask so harmful gases do not get into the lungs).\nThere are many practical uses for masks in everyday life. Mostly, the masks used are \"semi-masks\" which cover only the bottom half of the face, the mouth and nose. An example is the use of masks in operating theatres, and\nby wood-workers. In surgery, the purpose is to keep bacteria off the patient; in wood-working the purpose is to keep wood fibres out of the lungs.\nIn Venetian masks only the top half of the face is covered, to prevent recognition. Ice hockey masks, used in the Hannibal Lecter movies, cover the whole face to protect it from the hockey puck moving at high speed.\nThe word.\nThe word 'mask' might have come from other languages. The French \"masque\", the Italian \"maschera\", the Spanish \"m\u00E1scara\", the Latin (not classical) \"mascus/masca (meaning \"ghost\")\" or the Arabic \"maskharah (meaning \"jester\" or \"man in masquerade\")\" all use the same word.\nHistory.\nOne of the oldest masks found is the Death Mask. This stone mask is 9000 years old and is probably the oldest mask in the world. It is kept in Mus\u00E9e de la bible et Terre Sainte, Paris.\nThere are also three masks from the same period, kept in The Israel Museum, Jerusalem.\nMasks are used in many magical or shamanistic rituals in non-western societies. The celebration or appeasement of animistic spirits takes place with dance and song in ancient performances in many parts of the world. In these events performers use costumes and masks to mimic the supposed spirits.\nFrom this kind of beginning, the use of masks in ancient Greek theatre may have started. The actors and chorus in this early theatre all used masks.\nMasks in recent times.\nMasks have been used to protect people against air-borne diseases. They were worn during the plague in the Middle Ages; during the influenza epidemic of 1918, and the COVID-19 epidemic. Gas masks were issued in World War II even though phosgene gas was never used in that war (it had been in WWI).\n2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.\nDuring the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, a new variation of trikini, with two pieces for the body and a face mask was designed. Indian film actress Kajol popularized the idea of this trikini.\nFigurative uses.\nThere are some other uses of the word 'mask', which arise by extension. That means using 'mask' as a metaphor. In film a mask is a screen which cuts out part of the image. In social theory, a mask is the behaviour a person takes on in his role or job. Thus policemen, head teachers, army commanders, prime ministers act as they are expected to act (most of the time). The inference is that behind the mask is the 'real' person. Their role is a mask. As a verb, 'to mask' means to cover or hide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":20},{"uri":"Face","surface_form":"face","offset":46},{"uri":"Veil","surface_form":"veil","offset":71},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":238},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":303},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":349},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":599},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":631},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":696},{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibre","offset":701},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":719},{"uri":"Venice","surface_form":"Venetian","offset":729},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"Ice hockey","offset":810},{"uri":"Hannibal_Lecter","surface_form":"Hannibal Lecter","offset":840},{"uri":"Puck_(sports)","surface_form":"puck","offset":915},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1010},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1031},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1055},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1078},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1140},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":1528},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"shaman","offset":1539},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":1551},{"uri":"Celebrate","surface_form":"celebration","offset":1589},{"uri":"Appease","surface_form":"appease","offset":1604},{"uri":"Animism","surface_form":"animistic","offset":1619},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":1629},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_theatre","surface_form":"ancient Greek theatre","offset":1851},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":1895},{"uri":"Greek_chorus","surface_form":"chorus","offset":1906},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":1927},{"uri":"Plague","surface_form":"plague","offset":2067},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":2081},{"uri":"Influenza","surface_form":"influenza","offset":2105},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":2141},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":2185},{"uri":"Phosgene","surface_form":"phosgene","offset":2210},{"uri":"WWI","surface_form":"WWI","offset":2266},{"uri":"Trikini","surface_form":"trikini","offset":2362},{"uri":"Kajol","surface_form":"Kajol","offset":2450},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":2612},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"film","offset":2625},{"uri":"Social_theory","surface_form":"social theory","offset":2686},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":2715},{"uri":"Role","surface_form":"role","offset":2750},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":2768},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":2784},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":2794},{"uri":"Commander","surface_form":"commander","offset":2799},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":2811},{"uri":"Implication_(grammar)","surface_form":"inference","offset":2883}]}
