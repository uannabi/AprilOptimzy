{"id":259015,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Lynn","text":"Dame Vera Margaret Lynn CH DBE (\"n\u00E9e\" Welch; 20 March 1917 \u2013 18 June 2020) was an English singer and actress. Lynn was born in East Ham, Essex. She began performing in public at age seven and she started using her grandmother's maiden name (Lynn) as her stage name. Her first radio broadcast was in 1935 with the Joe Loss Orchestra. At this time she was being featured on records released by dance bands including those of Loss and of Charlie Kunz.\nShe was popular during World War II. Her best known songs are We'll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover.\nLynn worked a lot with charities for former military servicemen, disabled children, and breast cancer. Veterans of the Second World War still admire her. She was named the Briton who best exemplified (the best example of) the spirit of the twentieth century, in 2000.\nVera Lynn's album \"We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn\" went to #1 in the United Kingdom. This made her the oldest living artist to top the U.K. album charts. The album is some of her recordings made for Decca Records. Lynn recorded for Decca between 1936 and 1959. The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart on 13 September 2009. The album entered the chart at number 20 on 30 August. It then climbed to number 2 the following week, before reaching the top position.\nThe 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove, starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, ends with a world-ending war of atomic bombs. The scene uses Vera Lynn's song \"We'll Meet Again\".\nLynn died on 18 June 2020 at the age of 103 in East Sussex.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour","surface_form":"CH","offset":24},{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"DBE","offset":27},{"uri":"N%C3%A9e","surface_form":"n\u00E9e","offset":33},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":82},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":90},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":101},{"uri":"East_Ham","surface_form":"East Ham","offset":127},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":137},{"uri":"Stage_name","surface_form":"stage name","offset":254},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":282},{"uri":"Charlie_Kunz","surface_form":"Charlie Kunz","offset":435},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":472},{"uri":"We%27ll_Meet_Again","surface_form":"We'll Meet Again","offset":511},{"uri":"(There%27ll_Be_Bluebirds_Over)_The_White_Cliffs_of_Dover","surface_form":"The White Cliffs of Dover","offset":532},{"uri":"Charity_(practice)","surface_form":"charities","offset":582},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":603},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabled","offset":624},{"uri":"Breast_cancer","surface_form":"breast cancer","offset":647},{"uri":"Veteran","surface_form":"Veteran","offset":662},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":678},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":910},{"uri":"Decca_Records","surface_form":"Decca Records","offset":1040},{"uri":"UK_Albums_Chart","surface_form":"UK Albums Chart","offset":1138},{"uri":"Dr._Strangelove","surface_form":"Dr. Strangelove","offset":1328},{"uri":"Peter_Sellers","surface_form":"Peter Sellers","offset":1354},{"uri":"George_C._Scott","surface_form":"George C.
