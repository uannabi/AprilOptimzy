In the form of a back beat, syncopation is used in virtually all popular music.\nSyncopation has been an important element of musical composition since at least the Middle Ages. For some musical styles, such as jazz and ragtime, syncopation is an essential part of their character.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bar_(music)","surface_form":"measure","offset":18},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":332},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":402},{"uri":"Ragtime","surface_form":"ragtime","offset":408},{"uri":"Cuban_music","surface_form":"Cuban music","offset":417},{"uri":"Funk","surface_form":"funk","offset":430},{"uri":"Ska","surface_form":"ska","offset":436},{"uri":"Reggae","surface_form":"reggae","offset":441},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"rap","offset":449},{"uri":"Jump_blues","surface_form":"jump blues","offset":454},{"uri":"Progressive_rock","surface_form":"progressive rock","offset":466},{"uri":"Extreme_metal","surface_form":"extreme metal","offset":484},{"uri":"Breakbeat","surface_form":"breakbeat","offset":499},{"uri":"Drum%27n%27bass","surface_form":"drum'n'bass","offset":510},{"uri":"Dubstep","surface_form":"dubstep","offset":523},{"uri":"Minimalism","surface_form":"minimalism","offset":535},{"uri":"Back_beat","surface_form":"back beat","offset":679},{"uri":"Popular_music","surface_form":"popular music","offset":727},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":826}]}
