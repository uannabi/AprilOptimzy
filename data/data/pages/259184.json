The city is located about 50 miles north of \"Medellin\", the department capital. It has a population of about 23,000 residents.\nHistory.\nIt was founded by the name \"Villa de Santaf\u00E9\" in 1541 by Jorge Robledo on the western bank of the Cauca River. It received the coat of arms and the title of \"City of Antioquia\" from King Philip II of Spain in 1545. It was promoted to the status of parish in 1547 by the bishop of Popay\u00E1n. It changed its name in 1584 when it became the capital of Antioquia. It was a mining town from its beginnings and the gold mining operation has been the base of its economy.\nIts cathedral was constructed in 1799 and elevated to Diocese of Antioquia in 1804 by Pope Pius VII. In 1813 Antioquia was declared a sovereign and independent state with Santa Fe as its capital, a status it maintained until 1826, when Medell\u00EDn was chosen as the new departmental seat. Due to the state of conservation of its colonial architecture, it was declared a national monument in 1960.\nGeography.\nThe municipal area has a mountainous territory within the Central Cordillera of the Andes and watered by the rivers Cauca and Tonusco. Its area is 493\u00A0km\u00B2.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of \"Santa Fe de Antioquia\" is based on agriculture. The main products made are coffee, maize and beans.\nTourism.\nTourism was, and continues to be one of the more important economic enterprises for the municipality. The opening of the \"Tunnel of the West\" (which shortens the time and the distance between the locality and Medell\u00EDn) in 2006 has allowed hundreds of tourists to come each weekend, stimulating the vocation of the vicinity as a summer vacation site.\nSites of Interest.\nAll of the town is a historical site; the architecture that has survived through the years gives \"Santa Fe de Antioquia\" the aspect of a city \"suspended\" in the colonial era, which is the reason the city was declared a National monument.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":29},{"uri":"Antioquia_Department","surface_form":"Antioquia Department","offset":49},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":73},{"uri":"Cauca_River","surface_form":"Cauca River","offset":317},{"uri":"Philip_II_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip II of Spain","offset":406},{"uri":"Popay%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Popay\u00E1n","offset":499},{"uri":"Pope_Pius_VII","surface_form":"Pope Pius VII","offset":768},{"uri":"Medell%C3%ADn","surface_form":"Medell\u00EDn","offset":918},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":1256},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1303},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":1343},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":1351},{"uri":"Bean","surface_form":"bean","offset":1361}]}
