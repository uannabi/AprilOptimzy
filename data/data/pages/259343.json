{"id":259343,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_sulfate","text":"Tin(II) sulfate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SnSO4. It contains tin and sulfate ions. The tin is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a white crystalline solid. It is not a reducing agent like other compounds containing tin(II), like tin(II) chloride. It absorbs water from the atmosphere and dissolves in the water it absorbed.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving tin in sulfuric acid. It is also made by reacting tin with copper(II) sulfate.\nUses.\nIt is used as a source of tin(II) ions without any tin(IV) ions contaminating them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":21},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":83},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":91},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":99},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":126},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":169},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":200},{"uri":"Tin(II)_chloride","surface_form":"tin(II) chloride","offset":261},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":401},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":444},{"uri":"Copper(II)_sulfate","surface_form":"copper(II) sulfate","offset":453}]}
