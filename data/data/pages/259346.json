{"id":259346,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(IV)_chloride","text":"Tin(IV) chloride, also known as stannic chloride or tin dioxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SnCl4. It contains tin and chloride ions. The tin is in its +4 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a corrosive liquid (anhydrous) or solid (hydrated). It makes hydrochloric acid fumes which irritate the nose. It reacts with strong bases to make tin(IV) oxide hydrate. It also reacts with hydrochloric acid to make the SnCl62- ion.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting tin with chlorine.\nSn + 2 Cl2 \u2192 SnCl4\nUses.\nIt was used in World War I to create irritating clouds of smoke. It is also used to make tin(IV) fluoride. It is also used to make organic compounds that have tin in them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":70},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":132},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":140},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":149},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":176},{"uri":"Anhydrous","surface_form":"anhydrous","offset":231},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":272},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":343},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":400},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":479},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":488},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":538},{"uri":"Tin(IV)_fluoride","surface_form":"tin(IV) fluoride","offset":612},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":654}]}
