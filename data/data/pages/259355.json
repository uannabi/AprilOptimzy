{"id":259355,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(IV)_oxide","text":"Tin(IV) oxide, also known as tin dioxide or stannic oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SnO2. It has tin and oxide ions in it. It has tin in its +4 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a white powdery solid. It reacts with acids to produce stannic salts, such as tin(IV) chloride with hydrochloric acid. It reacts with strong bases to make stannites. It reacts with carbon at a high temperature to make tin metal.\nOccurrence.\nIt is found as cassiterite in the mineral form. Cassiterite is an ore of tin.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made in pure form by burning powdered tin in air.\nUses.\nIt is used to detect carbon monoxide. It is also used as a catalyst for certain reactions. It is also used to make ceramics opaque (not clear). It is used in sensors of gases that can burn. A tin(IV) oxide wire is heated. When a flammable gas flows over it, it can conduct a little electricity. The sensor measures the electricity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":63},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":119},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":127},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":133},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":166},{"uri":"Stannic","surface_form":"stannic","offset":256},{"uri":"Tin(IV)_chloride","surface_form":"tin(IV) chloride","offset":279},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":301},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":342},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":382},{"uri":"Cassiterite","surface_form":"cassiterite","offset":457},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":476},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":508},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":515},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"carbon monoxide","offset":620},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":658},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":714},{"uri":"Opacity_(optics)","surface_form":"opaque","offset":723},{"uri":"Sensor","surface_form":"sensor","offset":757}]}
