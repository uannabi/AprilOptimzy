{"id":259601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairpin_turn","text":"A hairpin turn (also hairpin bend, hairpin corner, or just hairpin), is a very tight corner. It makes a vehicle turn almost 180\u00B0 to continue on the road. It gets its name from the way it looks like a hairpin or bobby pin. Hairpin turns may be called switchbacks in American English.\nHairpin turns may be built when a road or path climbs up or down a steep slope. This allows the path to travel the slope with a smaller slope. Hairpin turns may be used in race tracks to slow down the race cars after a long, fast straight.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":104},{"uri":"Bobby_pin","surface_form":"bobby pin","offset":211},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":265},{"uri":"Race_track","surface_form":"race track","offset":455}]}
