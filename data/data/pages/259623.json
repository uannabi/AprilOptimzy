{"id":259623,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_River_National_Park","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Endeavour River National Park is just north of Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. It protects the north banks of the Endeavour River. Both the river and the park are named after Captain James Cook's ship, HM Bark Endeavour. The ship was repaired in the river in 1770 after being damaged by coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Most of the park can only be reached by boat. There are no facilities in the park, and people are not allowed to camp there. The park covers an area of about 2400 hectares. It is next to the Cairns Marine Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.\nThe Endeavour River protects a number of different habitats including, coastal dunes, fresh water wetlands, river estuary, mangrove forests, heathland and tropical woodlands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cooktown%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Cooktown, Queensland","offset":64},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":86},{"uri":"Endeavour_River","surface_form":"Endeavour River","offset":132},{"uri":"James_Cook","surface_form":"James Cook","offset":201},{"uri":"HM_Bark_Endeavour","surface_form":"HM Bark Endeavour","offset":220},{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":305},{"uri":"Great_Barrier_Reef","surface_form":"Great Barrier Reef","offset":318},{"uri":"Cairns_Marine_Park","surface_form":"Cairns Marine Park","offset":529},{"uri":"Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park","surface_form":"Great Barrier Reef Marine Park","offset":556},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":639},{"uri":"Dune","surface_form":"dune","offset":667},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"wetland","offset":686},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":702},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":711},{"uri":"Heathland","surface_form":"heathland","offset":729}]}
