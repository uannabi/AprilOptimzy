{"id":259659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Island","text":"Ross Island is an island which was formed by four volcanoes in the Ross Sea, which can be found near the continent, Antarctica.\nGeography.\nBecause of the persistent presence of the ice sheet, the island is sometimes mistaken to be a part of Antarctica. Its area is 2,460\u00A0km\u00B2 (950 sq mi); only a small portion of the island is free of ice and snow. The planet's southernmost active volcano, Erebus (3794 m), as well as the dormant volcano Terror (3230 m), are situated on the island. They were named by Ross after his ships HMS \"Erebus\" and HMS \"Terror\". The third highest peak is Mount Bird, and on its slopes are Shell Glacier and Endeavour Piedmont Glacier. Abbott Peak stands between Mount Erebus and Mount Bird.\nDespite its relatively small size, Ross Island is the world's 6th highest island.\nDiscovery.\nThe island was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841, and it was later named in his honour by Robert F. Scott.\nRoss Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica. It was and still is the southernmost island reachable by sea. Huts built by Scott's and Shackleton's expeditions are still located on the island, preserved as historical sites.\nToday Ross Island is home to New Zealand's Scott Base, and the largest Antarctic settlement, the U.S. Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station. Greenpeace established World Park Base on the island and it ran for five years, from 1987 to 1992.\nClaims.\nRoss Island lies within the boundaries of Ross Dependency, which is claimed by New Zealand.\nWildlife.\nRoss Island supports a colony of about a half million (500 000) Ad\u00E9lie Penguins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Islands"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":50},{"uri":"Ross_Sea","surface_form":"Ross Sea","offset":67},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":116},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":374},{"uri":"Mount_Erebus","surface_form":"Erebus","offset":390},{"uri":"Dormant_volcano","surface_form":"dormant volcano","offset":422},{"uri":"Mount_Terror_(Antarctica)","surface_form":"Terror","offset":438},{"uri":"HMS_Erebus_(1826)","surface_form":"HMS \"Erebus\"","offset":523},{"uri":"HMS_Terror_(1813)","surface_form":"HMS \"Terror\"","offset":540},{"uri":"Mount_Bird","surface_form":"Mount Bird","offset":580},{"uri":"Shell_Glacier","surface_form":"Shell Glacier","offset":614},{"uri":"Endeavour_Piedmont_Glacier","surface_form":"Endeavour Piedmont Glacier","offset":632},{"uri":"Abbott_Peak_(Antarctica)","surface_form":"Abbott Peak","offset":660},{"uri":"List_of_islands_by_highest_point","surface_form":"6th highest island","offset":778},{"uri":"James_Clark_Ross","surface_form":"James Clark Ross","offset":842},{"uri":"Robert_F._Scott","surface_form":"Robert F.
