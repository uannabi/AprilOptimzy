They generally contain the full dialog from the anime from which they are adapted. While generally published in book form, they are also sometimes released electronically as e-books, occasionally called e-manga.\nThis format has been adopted by companies such as Disney and companies from other countries' television and movie, and may even be based on live-action productions.\nCompanies such as Tokyopop and Viz release movies comics but refer to them as Cine-manga and Ani-manga, respectively. These western companies also release movies comics for young readers. movies comics have been well received in English speaking countries, with some titles selling more than 500,000 copies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anime","surface_form":"anime","offset":103},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":291},{"uri":"E-book","surface_form":"e-book","offset":353},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Disney","offset":441},{"uri":"Tokyopop","surface_form":"Tokyopop","offset":574},{"uri":"Viz_Media","surface_form":"Viz","offset":587}]}
