{"id":259954,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precinct","text":"=\"preserve\">A precinct is a closed or clearly marked space which belongs to an organisation. Around some main buildings, such as a cathedral or college, is a space. This space may have other buildings in it, and usually has a wall round it. The whole area has one owner (such as the church). Persons may only come into the precint if they are allowed: it is not a public space, even though members of the public may use it. For example, students and staff may enter a college, but visitors will have to give reasons at the entry.\nThe concept of a precinct is mediaeval. Towns, churches, palaces, colleges were places of limited access. They were surrounded by walls and guarded.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organisation","surface_form":"organisation","offset":79},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":110},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":131},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":144},{"uri":"Wall","surface_form":"wall","offset":226},{"uri":"Owner","surface_form":"owner","offset":264},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":437},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"staff","offset":450},{"uri":"Visitor","surface_form":"visitor","offset":481},{"uri":"Mediaeval","surface_form":"mediaeval","offset":559},{"uri":"Towns","surface_form":"Towns","offset":570},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":587}]}
