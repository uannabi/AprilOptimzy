{"id":260192,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_sulfide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Iron sulfide is the chemical compound FeS, a black solid. It is made of iron and sulfide ions. FeS has iron in its +2 oxidation state. It reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide gas.\nIn plural, \"iron sulfides\" may refer to a range of chemical compounds composed of iron and sulfur. For example to FeS2 (iron disulfide) found in the ground as the mineral pyrite. FeS2 is shiny like a metal and has a bright golden color. That's why it is sometimes called \"fool's gold\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":33},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":85},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":94},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":102},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":131},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":163},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":177},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":203},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":307},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":316},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":388},{"uri":"Pyrite","surface_form":"pyrite","offset":396},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":425}]}
