{"id":260297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Heap","text":"Todd Benjamin Heap (born March 16, 1980 in Mesa, Arizona) is an American football player., he played tight end for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL). Heap was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens out of the Arizona State University by the Baltimore Ravens with the 31st pick in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft.\nHeap wore #80 while playing college football and #86 as a professional. With Baltimore, Heap was known for his quiet personality. Heap's NFL career with the Ravens and Cardinals has been plagued by injuries. He has missed portions of most of his NFL seasons and huge parts of the 2004, 2007, and 2011 NFL seasons. However, he is the Ravens second all-time leader in receptions (the Ravens offense struggled much during Heap's stay there, and Heap was often the primary receiver), and all-time leader in yards and touchdowns. He was released by the Ravens in the 2011 offseason, and signed with the Cardinals, where he struggled to produce. Heap has also taken a number of big hits. He has been greatly popular with the Ravens fan base.\nTodd Heap is married to Ashley Heap.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mesa%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Mesa, Arizona","offset":43},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":64},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":73},{"uri":"Tight_end","surface_form":"tight end","offset":101},{"uri":"Arizona_Cardinals","surface_form":"Arizona Cardinals","offset":119},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League (NFL)","offset":144},{"uri":"Baltimore_Ravens","surface_form":"Baltimore Ravens","offset":200},{"uri":"Arizona_State_University","surface_form":"Arizona State University","offset":228},{"uri":"2001_NFL_Draft","surface_form":"2001 NFL Draft","offset":322},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":366},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":415},{"uri":"NFL","surface_form":"NFL","offset":475}]}
