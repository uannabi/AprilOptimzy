His writings have focused on political economy, environmental sociology, and Marxist theory.\nFoster's most recent book, \"The Ecological Revolution: Making Peace with the Planet\", examines the ecological crisis, and includes essays on global warming, peak oil, species extinction, world water shortages, global hunger, alternative energy sources, sustainable development, and environmental justice. Foster says that any attempt to solve our problems merely by technological, industrial or free market means, divorced from fundamental social relations, cannot succeed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":72},{"uri":"Monthly_Review","surface_form":"Monthly Review","offset":92},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":125},{"uri":"University_of_Oregon","surface_form":"University of Oregon","offset":142},{"uri":"Eugene%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Eugene","offset":166},{"uri":"Political_economy","surface_form":"political economy","offset":203},{"uri":"Environmental_sociology","surface_form":"environmental sociology","offset":222},{"uri":"Marxism","surface_form":"Marxist theory","offset":251},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":408},{"uri":"Peak_oil","surface_form":"peak oil","offset":424},{"uri":"Water_shortage","surface_form":"water shortage","offset":460},{"uri":"Sustainable_development","surface_form":"sustainable development","offset":520}]}
