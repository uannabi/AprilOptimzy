First awarded in 1949, they were originally referred to as just the \"Emmy Awards\" until the first Daytime Emmy Award ceremonies were held in the 1970s, and the word \"primetime\" was added to disambiguate between the two.\nRetired awards.\nA number of awards have been retired throughout the years, including some that have been replaced by similar award categories in the Daytime Emmys, Sports Emmys, and other areas of recognition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Academy_of_Television_Arts_%26amp%3B_Sciences","surface_form":"Academy of Television Arts & Sciences","offset":68},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":138},{"uri":"Primetime","surface_form":"primetime","offset":147},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":157},{"uri":"Emmy_Award","surface_form":"Emmy Award","offset":250},{"uri":"Daytime_Emmy_Award","surface_form":"Daytime Emmy Award","offset":279},{"uri":"Daytime_Emmys","surface_form":"Daytime Emmys","offset":550},{"uri":"Sports_Emmys","surface_form":"Sports Emmys","offset":565}]}
