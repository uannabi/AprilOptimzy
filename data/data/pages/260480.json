{"id":260480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypophosphite","text":"Sodium hypophosphite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaH2PO2. It contains sodium and hypophosphite ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a white solid. It is a strong reducing agent. When it is heated, it produces phosphine gas and sodium phosphite. It is quite poisonous. It can be oxidized to sodium phosphate.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by heating white phosphorus in sodium hydroxide solution. This makes phosphine gas and sodium hypophosphite.\nUses.\nIt is used for nickel plating without doing electrolysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":26},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":90},{"uri":"Hypophosphite","surface_form":"hypophosphite","offset":101},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":115},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":169},{"uri":"Phosphine","surface_form":"phosphine","offset":216},{"uri":"Sodium_phosphite","surface_form":"sodium phosphite","offset":234},{"uri":"Sodium_phosphate","surface_form":"sodium phosphate","offset":297},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":356},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":370},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":469},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":498}]}
