{"id":260515,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophosphorous_acid","text":"=\"preserve\">Hypophosphorous acid, also known as phosphinic acid, is a chemical compound. It is an acid. It contains hydrogen and hypophosphite ions. Its chemical formula is H3PO2.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless solid. It can absorb water to make an oily liquid. It is a weak acid. It reacts with bases to make hypophosphite salts such as sodium hypophosphite. It is a powerful reducing agent. It breaks down when heated into phosphine and phosphorous acid.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by protonation of hypophosphites.\nUses.\nIt can be used as a reducing agent. It is also used to make medicines. It can be used to make illegal drugs, which is why it is restricted. It is used to plate metal on objects without using electroplating.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":70},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":98},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":116},{"uri":"Hypophosphite","surface_form":"hypophosphite","offset":129},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":143},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":295},{"uri":"Sodium_hypophosphite","surface_form":"sodium hypophosphite","offset":337},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":376},{"uri":"Phosphine","surface_form":"phosphine","offset":424},{"uri":"Phosphorous_acid","surface_form":"phosphorous acid","offset":438},{"uri":"Protonation","surface_form":"protonation","offset":483},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":580},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":622},{"uri":"Restrict","surface_form":"restricted","offset":648},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":711}]}
