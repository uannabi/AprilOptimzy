It contains phosphorus and oxide ions. It contains phosphorus in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nPhosphorus(V) oxide is a colorless solid. It has a strong odor. It dissolves in water to produce phosphoric acid. It can corrode metals. It is irritating to the skin. It can make bad burns.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by burning phosphorus into high amounts of air.\nUses.\nIt is used to dry things out because it absorbs water. It dries things out from acids like nitric acid to organic compounds like carboxylic acids.\nSafety.\nPhosphorus(V) oxide is corrosive. Its vapors are toxic and burn the eyes and skin. It also irritates skin and eyes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":62},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":124},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":139},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":145},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":184},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"odor","offset":271},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":310},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":342},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":470},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":561},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":572},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic compounds","offset":587},{"uri":"Carboxylic_acid","surface_form":"carboxylic acid","offset":610},{"uri":"Vapor","surface_form":"vapor","offset":674}]}
