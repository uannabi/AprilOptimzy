It contains phosphorus in its +3 oxidation state. It contains phosphorus and oxide ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a white, waxy solid that can absorb water. It reacts with water to make phosphorous acid. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make phosphorus trichloride and phosphorous acid. It is a reducing agent. It is toxic and has a garlic-like odor.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by burning phosphorus in a little air. This is the source of many phosphorus compounds.\nUses.\nIt can attach to certain transition metals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":63},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":153},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":182},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":197},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":203},{"uri":"Phosphorous_acid","surface_form":"phosphorous acid","offset":299},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":332},{"uri":"Phosphorus_trichloride","surface_form":"phosphorus trichloride","offset":358},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":411},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":502},{"uri":"Transition_metal","surface_form":"transition metal","offset":610}]}
