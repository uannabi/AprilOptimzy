{"id":260522,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_trichloride","text":"Phosphorus trichloride is a chemical compound. It is a molecular compound made up of phosphorus covalently bonded to three chlorine atoms. The phosphorus is considered to be in a 3+ oxidation state and each chlorine is considered to be in a 1- oxidation state. The chemical formula is PCl3.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless liquid. It reacts with water to make phosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid. It is very toxic. It is a weak reducing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting extra phosphorus with chlorine. It is used to make phosphorous acid industrially (in factories).\nUses.\nIt is used to make organic compounds. It is also used to make other phosphorus compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":28},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":85},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"chlorine atom","offset":123},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state and each chlorine is considered to be in a 1- oxidation state","offset":182},{"uri":"Phosphorous_acid","surface_form":"phosphorous acid","offset":358},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":379},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":429},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":487},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":503},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":603}]}
