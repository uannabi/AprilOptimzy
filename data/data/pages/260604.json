{"id":260604,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision","text":"An elastic collision is when two objects collide and bounce back with little or no deformation. For example, two rubber balls bouncing together would be elastic. Two cars hitting each other would be inelastic, as the cars crumple, and do not bounce back. In a perfectly elastic collision (the simplest case), no kinetic energy is lost, and so the kinetic energy of the two objects after the collision is equal to their total kinetic energy before the collision. Elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms (heat, sound). The other rule to remember when working with elastic collisions is that momentum is conserved.\nOne-dimensional Newtonian.\nConsider two particles, indicated by subscripts 1 and 2. Let \"m1\" and \"m2\" be the masses, \"u1\" and \"u2\" be the velocities before the collision and \"v1\" and \"v2\" be the velocities after collision.\nUsing Conservation of Momentum to write one formula.\nSince it is an elastic collision, the total momentum before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision.\nGiven that momentum (p) is calculated as\nUsing Conservation of Energy to write a second formula.\nThe second rule we use is that the total kinetic energy remains the same, meaning that the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy.\nPutting those two equations together.\nThese equations may be solved directly to find \"vi\" when \"ui\" are known or vice versa.\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us an answer of formula_1.\nUnfortunately, we'd still need to use conservation of momentum to figure out whether formula_1 is positive or negative.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deformation","surface_form":"deformation","offset":83},{"uri":"Elastic","surface_form":"elastic","offset":153},{"uri":"Kinetic_energy","surface_form":"kinetic energy","offset":312}]}
