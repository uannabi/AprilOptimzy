{"id":260626,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Adams","text":"Michael Adams (born 17 November 1971 in Truro, Cornwall) is a British chess grandmaster (1989). His highest ranking was world #4, achieved several times from October 2000 to October 2002. He achieved a peak FIDE rating of 2755.\nHe has achieved good results in World Chess Championship tournaments. At the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, he reached the final, narrowly losing out to Rustam Kasimdzhanov in the tie-break games.\nAdams won the British Chess Championship in 1989 at the age of seventeen. Making only rare appearances, he won (jointly) in 1997, and won again in 2010 and 2011. A fine score of 6\u00BD/7 in the 2011 European Club Championship marked a return to form, but his results are no longer so consistent as they used to be.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Truro","surface_form":"Truro","offset":40},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":47},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":62},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":70},{"uri":"Grandmaster_(chess)","surface_form":"grandmaster","offset":76},{"uri":"FIDE","surface_form":"FIDE","offset":207},{"uri":"World_Chess_Championship","surface_form":"World Chess Championship","offset":260},{"uri":"Rustam_Kasimdzhanov","surface_form":"Rustam Kasimdzhanov","offset":386}]}
