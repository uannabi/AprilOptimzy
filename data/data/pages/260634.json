{"id":260634,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_carbonate","text":"Potassium carbonate, also known as potash or pearl ash, is a chemical compound. It is made of potassium and carbonate ions. Its chemical formula is K2CO3.\nProperties.\nPotassium carbonate is a white solid. It dissolves in water. It is similar to sodium carbonate. It reacts with acids to make carbon dioxide and a potassium salt. It does not dissolve in alcohol. It is basic. It is a mild drying agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by the reaction of carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide.\nUses.\nIt is used to soften water (remove some of the ions from water) and make soap. It is used to put out fires. It can be used as an electrolyte to electrolyze water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Potash","surface_form":"potash","offset":35},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":61},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":94},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":108},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":118},{"uri":"Sodium_carbonate","surface_form":"sodium carbonate","offset":245},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":278},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":292},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":323},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":353},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":368},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":445},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":465},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"soap","offset":565},{"uri":"Electrolyte","surface_form":"electrolyte","offset":621},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolyze","offset":636}]}
