{"id":260839,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stile","text":"A stile is a simple wooden structure which helps people to climb over a fence in the countryside. Where there is a footpath (a right of way) which goes through a field with animals, there may be a stile so that walkers can climb over out of the field. The stile is there instead of a gate. If there were a gate and there were animals in the field, the animals could escape if the gate were left open. Stiles are, of course, a problem for people who are disabled.\nThere are many stiles in the countryside in the United Kingdom. Another way of letting walkers through but keeping animals in is to use a kissing gate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Countryside","surface_form":"countryside","offset":85},{"uri":"Gate","surface_form":"gate","offset":284},{"uri":"Disabled","surface_form":"disabled","offset":453},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":511},{"uri":"Kissing_gate","surface_form":"kissing gate","offset":601}]}
