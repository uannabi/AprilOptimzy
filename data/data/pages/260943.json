{"id":260943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge","text":"London Bridge is a bridge over the River Thames. It is in central London, and connects the City of London with Southwark. It is between Cannon Street Railway Bridge and Tower Bridge.\nOn the south side of the bridge are Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge station. On the north side are the Monument to the Great Fire of London and Monument tube station.\nIt was previously the only bridge over the Thames downstream from Kingston until Putney Bridge opened in 1729. The current bridge opened on 17th March 1973 and is the latest in a succession of bridges to occupy the spot and claim the name.\nThe bridge carries part of the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority; the bridge itself is owned and maintained by a charity overseen by the City of London Corporation.\nThe name London Bridge is often mistakenly applied to Tower Bridge, which is the next bridge downstream.\nRoman bridge.\nA bridge has existed at or near the present site over the period from the Roman occupation of the area, nearly 2,000 years ago. The first bridge across the Thames in the London area, probably a military pontoon bridge, was built of wood by the Romans on the present site around 50 AD.\nAround 59 AD, a piled bridge was constructed, and the local Britons built a small trading settlement next to it\u2014the town of Londinium. The settlement and the bridge were destroyed in a revolt led by Queen Boudicca in 60 AD. The victory was short-lived, and soon afterwards the Romans defeated the rebels and set about building a new walled town. Some of the 2nd-century Roman wall has survived to this day. The new town and bridge were built around the position of the present bridge, providing access to the south-coast ports via Stane Street (the A3 route) and Watling Street (the A2).\nMedieval bridge.\nThe practice was finally stopped in 1660.\nThe mediaeval bridge itself was demolished in 1831.\nModern bridge.\nUntil 1750 when Westminster Bridge was built, London bridge was the only structure crossing the River Thames.\nThe medieval bridge was replaced in 1831, but in 1967 it was dismantled and re-assembled as \"London Bridge (Lake Havasu City) London Bridge\" at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, now linking an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City.\nIn 1968, the current bridge was built.\nIn June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames.\n2017 attack.\nAt 22:08 BST on 3 June 2017, a van rammed multiple pedestrians on London Bridge. The incident, along with a stabbing attack in Borough Market, led to seven deaths. Three presumed terrorists were shot dead by the police.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["bridge"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":19},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":35},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":66},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":91},{"uri":"Southwark","surface_form":"Southwark","offset":111},{"uri":"Tower_Bridge","surface_form":"Tower Bridge","offset":169},{"uri":"Southwark_Cathedral","surface_form":"Southwark Cathedral","offset":219},{"uri":"London_Bridge_station","surface_form":"London Bridge station","offset":243},{"uri":"Great_Fire_of_London","surface_form":"Great Fire of London","offset":308},{"uri":"Bank_and_Monument_stations","surface_form":"Monument tube station","offset":333},{"uri":"Kingston_upon_Thames","surface_form":"Kingston","offset":422},{"uri":"Putney_Bridge","surface_form":"Putney Bridge","offset":437},{"uri":"Greater_London_Authority","surface_form":"Greater London Authority","offset":663},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":760},{"uri":"Tower_Bridge","surface_form":"Tower Bridge","offset":842},{"uri":"Roman_Britain","surface_form":"Roman","offset":981},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1101},{"uri":"Pontoon_bridge","surface_form":"pontoon bridge","offset":1110},{"uri":"Pile","surface_form":"pile","offset":1208},{"uri":"Trading","surface_form":"trading","offset":1274},{"uri":"Boudicca","surface_form":"Queen Boudicca","offset":1391},{"uri":"Stane_Street","surface_form":"Stane Street","offset":1723},{"uri":"Watling_Street","surface_form":"Watling Street","offset":1755},{"uri":"Westminster_Bridge","surface_form":"Westminster Bridge","offset":1922},{"uri":"London_Bridge_(Lake_Havasu_City)_London_Bridge","surface_form":"London Bridge (Lake Havasu City) London Bridge","offset":2109},{"uri":"Lake_Havasu_City","surface_form":"Lake Havasu City","offset":2160},{"uri":"Colorado_River","surface_form":"Colorado River","offset":2216},{"uri":"Route","surface_form":"route","offset":2358},{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":2367},{"uri":"Diamond_Jubilee","surface_form":"Diamond Jubilee","offset":2388},{"uri":"British_Summer_Time","surface_form":"BST","offset":2449},{"uri":"Borough_Market","surface_form":"Borough Market","offset":2567}]}
