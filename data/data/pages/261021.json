{"id":261021,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory","text":"e=\"preserve\">Wheel theory is the theory of wheels. A wheel is an algebraic structure where division by 0 has meaning. The term \"wheel\" was inspired by the topological picture formula_1.\nDefinition.\nWheels replace the usual division with a unary operator applied to one argument formula_1 similar (but not identical) to the multiplicative inverse formula_1, such that formula_1 becomes shorthand for formula_1. Also, formula_1 replaces the fraction formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algebraic_structure","surface_form":"algebraic structure","offset":65},{"uri":"Unary_operation","surface_form":"unary operator","offset":239},{"uri":"Multiplicative_inverse","surface_form":"multiplicative inverse","offset":323}]}
