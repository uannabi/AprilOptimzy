It is often called just 'The Borough'. Southwark was once a separate town in Surrey, and was made part of London in 1889.\nSouthwark has several important buildings: Southwark Cathedral, London Bridge station and the Tate Modern art gallery. Two Roman roads met in Southwark: Watling Street and Stane Street. The area was marshy with islands in Roman times. They built the first London Bridge here.\nThe word 'Southwark' is pronounced \"Suthuk\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Southwark","surface_form":"London Borough of Southwark","offset":43},{"uri":"Thames","surface_form":"Thames","offset":85},{"uri":"London_Bridge","surface_form":"London Bridge","offset":102},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":194},{"uri":"Southwark_Cathedral","surface_form":"Southwark Cathedral","offset":282},{"uri":"London_Bridge_station","surface_form":"London Bridge station","offset":303},{"uri":"Tate","surface_form":"Tate Modern","offset":333},{"uri":"Art_gallery","surface_form":"art gallery","offset":345},{"uri":"Roman_roads","surface_form":"Roman roads","offset":362},{"uri":"Watling_Street","surface_form":"Watling Street","offset":392},{"uri":"Stane_Street","surface_form":"Stane Street","offset":411},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marsh","offset":438},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":450}]}
