{"id":26105,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk","text":"A skunk is a mammal, usually black with a white stripe on its back and a fluffy tail, but some skunks can be brown or gray. Its most special part is that it can shoot out a bad-smelling spray from under its tail; it does this to scare away things that could hurt it. Some people keep skunks as pets.\nIt can eat both plants and small animals like earthworms, frogs, snakes, birds and eggs. It usually eats berries, leaves, grasses and nuts. In places where humans live, skunks often steal food from garbage or pet bowls.\nThe striped skunk is the most well-known kind of skunk. It weighs 2.5 to 14 pounds (1.2\u20136.3\u00A0kg) with a body length (without the tail) of 13 to 18\u00A0inches (33\u201346\u00A0cm). The tail is 7 to 10\u00A0inches long (18\u201325\u00A0cm), and sometimes has a white tip.\nMost types of skunk live in the United States and Canada, but there are also types that live in Indonesia and the Philippines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":13},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":80},{"uri":"Olfaction","surface_form":"smelling spray","offset":177},{"uri":"Pets","surface_form":"pets","offset":294},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":316},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":333},{"uri":"Earthworms","surface_form":"earthworms","offset":346},{"uri":"Frogs","surface_form":"frogs","offset":358},{"uri":"Snakes","surface_form":"snakes","offset":365},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":373},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":383},{"uri":"Berries","surface_form":"berries","offset":405},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":414},{"uri":"Grasses","surface_form":"grasses","offset":422},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":434},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":792},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":810},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":856},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":874}]}
