{"id":261088,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_station","text":"St Pancras station, also known since 2007 as St Pancras International, is a central London railway terminus celebrated for its Victorian architecture.\nThe Grade\u00A0I listed building stands on Euston Road between the British Library, King's Cross station and the Regent's Canal. It was opened in 1868 by the Midland Railway as its southern terminus. The company became the LMS: the London, Midland and Scottish railway. When the station opened, the arched train shed was the largest single-span roof in the world.\nAfter escaping planned demolition in the 1960s, the complex was renovated and expanded during the 2000s at a cost of \u00A3800\u00A0million. A secure terminal area was constructed for Eurostar services to continental Europe\u2014via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel\u2014along with platforms for domestic connections to the north and south-east of England. The restored station houses fifteen platforms, a shopping centre and a bus station, in addition to London Underground services from King's Cross St. Pancras tube station. St Pancras is owned by London and Continental Railways along with the adjacent urban regeneration area known as King's Cross Central.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":84},{"uri":"Terminal_station","surface_form":"railway terminus","offset":91},{"uri":"Victorian_architecture","surface_form":"Victorian architecture","offset":127},{"uri":"Listed_building","surface_form":"listed building","offset":163},{"uri":"Euston_Road","surface_form":"Euston Road","offset":189},{"uri":"British_Library","surface_form":"British Library","offset":213},{"uri":"King%27s_Cross_station","surface_form":"King's Cross station","offset":230},{"uri":"Regent%27s_Canal","surface_form":"Regent's Canal","offset":259},{"uri":"Eurostar","surface_form":"Eurostar","offset":684},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":717},{"uri":"High_Speed_1","surface_form":"High Speed 1","offset":728},{"uri":"Channel_Tunnel","surface_form":"Channel Tunnel","offset":749},{"uri":"Shopping_centre","surface_form":"shopping centre","offset":899},{"uri":"Bus_station","surface_form":"bus station","offset":921},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":949},{"uri":"King%27s_Cross_St._Pancras_tube_station","surface_form":"King's Cross St. Pancras tube station","offset":982}]}
