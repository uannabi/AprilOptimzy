{"id":26109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sustainable development is a way for people to use resources without the resources running out. It means doing development without damaging or affecting the environment.\nThe term used by the Brundtland Commission defined it as development with sustainability that \"meets the needs of the present and also compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"\nBut many people now realise that if we are to tackle one issue, then we'll probably have to tackle the others as well. For instance, new shops are unlikely to open in an area where crime and poverty levels are very high. Similarly crime is unlikely to fall in an area where the housing has been improved unless there are jobs available. People may move into an area where housing and jobs are available, but if the surroundings are run-down and public transport is poor, they may well not want to stay\nThis is not just a local issue. The same problems are faced at a national level. If the governments of the world are to deal with poverty, they do not just need to provide money and food aid, they need to help local people get educated and get jobs. People also need a safe environment with adequate homes and drinking water. To make these things work, governments also need to make sure that people have an effective voice in deciding what happens where they live.\nThis approach is called \u2018sustainable development\u2019. While this phrase can be confusing, it's now used in many government documents and in funding programmes. Sustainable development has three parts: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and sociopolitical sustainability.\nAt the core of this idea is the matter of meeting people's needs \u2013 for a home, for a decent job, for education for their children, for good health care, and for a safe and healthy neighbourhood to live in.\nMost people in the rich nations have most of these needs, but there are still many people living in poverty and in poor quality homes. Even if these basic needs are met there are still plenty of ways in which their \u2018quality of life\u2019 is under threat: from crime, from pollution, or from living in neighbourhoods where no-one in authority seems to care.\nMany areas have programmes to promote \u2018local sustainability\u2019: many are called \u2018Local Agenda 21\u2019 plans, named after the international Agenda 21 action plan for sustainable development agreed at the United Nations Earth Summit held in 1992.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":25},{"uri":"Brundtland_Commission","surface_form":"Brundtland Commission","offset":204},{"uri":"Sustainability","surface_form":"sustainability","offset":257},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":353},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":572},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":582},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":712},{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"public transport","offset":836},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":981},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"educated","offset":1120},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":1137},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1212},{"uri":"Home","surface_form":"home","offset":1719},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":1738},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":1747},{"uri":"Health_care","surface_form":"health care","offset":1786},{"uri":"Agenda_21","surface_form":"Agenda 21","offset":2337},{"uri":"United_Nations_Earth_Summit","surface_form":"United Nations Earth Summit","offset":2401}]}
