{"id":261101,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(title)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Doctor is an academic degree, awarded by a university or similar institution. \"Doctor\" is used to refer to a person with a doctorate.\nTo obtain the degree, people need to pass a special exam, called a doctorate, or by writing a thesis. The requirements vary according to the subject-matter. A doctorate is usually regarded as a higher degree than a bachelor's degree (such as B.A. or B.Sc)\nPeople who have a doctor's degree may use the title \"doctor\", though in practice it is often used only by medical doctors. Medical doctors examine, diagnose and treat patients. They can specialize in a number of medical areas, such as pediatrics, anesthesiology or cardiology, or they can work as general practice physicians. Becoming a medical doctor requires a doctoral degree in medicine and participating in clinical training. Medical doctors need a licence, and certification may also be required for many specialists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"academic degree","offset":26},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":56},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctorate","offset":214},{"uri":"Thesis","surface_form":"thesis","offset":241},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor's degree","offset":362},{"uri":"B.A.","surface_form":"B.A.","offset":389},{"uri":"B.Sc","surface_form":"B.Sc","offset":397},{"uri":"Pediatrics","surface_form":"pediatrics","offset":638},{"uri":"Cardiology","surface_form":"cardiology","offset":668},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":717}]}
