{"id":261103,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(dog)","text":"The Newfoundland is a large breed of dog that originated in Newfoundland. They were first used by fishermen and sailors to carry goods and would jump overboard to save people from drowning. Newfoundlands are great swimmers because of their waterproof fur, their webbed feet and their strong muscles.\nThe Newfoundland is a very large dog breed, standing 26\u201328 inches (66\u201371\u00A0cm) and weighing 100\u2013150 pounds (45\u201368\u00A0kg). The largest Newfoundland found was 72 inches (180\u00A0cm) long and weighed 160 pounds (73\u00A0kg). Their coat of fur is usually long and a black, brown or gray color. Their facial hair is very short. The head is very large and the face is smooth with few wrinkles. The ears are long and wide, and reach below the jaw. The neck is strong and muscular. The Newfoundland's chest is large and wide with a large lung capacity. Because Newfoundlands are excellent swimmers, their thighs are very strong and muscular and their feet are tight. Their tail is very strong and is important for them to swim well.\nNewfoundlands can suffer from a lot of health problems. They are the fifth most likely breed to have hip dysplasia. Newfoundlands can have problems with cystinuria in a similar way to humans. Newfoundlands can inherit subvalvular aortic stenosis, a trait which hurts the heart.\nNewfoundlands are known to be very gentle and loyal dogs. Because of their protective nature for children, Newfoundlands have been used as watchdogs. They have very thick fur so owners need to brush it once a week.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":28},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":37},{"uri":"Origin","surface_form":"originated","offset":46},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":60},{"uri":"Fishermen","surface_form":"fishermen","offset":98},{"uri":"Sailor","surface_form":"sailor","offset":112},{"uri":"Drowning","surface_form":"drowning","offset":180},{"uri":"Swimmer","surface_form":"swimmer","offset":214},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":251},{"uri":"Muscles","surface_form":"muscles","offset":291},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":359},{"uri":"Cm","surface_form":"cm","offset":373},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"pounds","offset":398},{"uri":"Kg","surface_form":"kg","offset":412},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coat","offset":514},{"uri":"Smooth","surface_form":"smooth","offset":648},{"uri":"Wrinkle_(face)","surface_form":"wrinkles","offset":664},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":816},{"uri":"Capacity","surface_form":"capacity","offset":821},{"uri":"Hip_dysplasia_(canine)","surface_form":"hip dysplasia","offset":1112},{"uri":"Cystinuria","surface_form":"cystinuria","offset":1164},{"uri":"Humans","surface_form":"humans","offset":1195},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"inherit","offset":1221},{"uri":"Subvalvular_aortic_stenosis_(non-human)","surface_form":"subvalvular aortic stenosis","offset":1229}]}
