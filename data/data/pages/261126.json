{"id":261126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate","text":"=\"preserve\">Calcium phosphate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ca3(PO4)2, although there are other formulas, like Ca2HPO4 (dicalcium phosphate) and Ca(H2PO4)2 (monocalcium phosphate). It is made of calcium and phosphate ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a white or gray solid. It becomes more insoluble when heated; most chemicals become more soluble (more easily dissolved).\nOccurrence.\nIt is found in teeth, bones, and milk. It is found in the ground, too.\nUses.\nIt is used to make phosphoric acid. It is used to make fertilizer.\nIt is also used in bovine milk","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":35},{"uri":"Dicalcium_phosphate","surface_form":"dicalcium phosphate","offset":138},{"uri":"Monocalcium_phosphate","surface_form":"monocalcium phosphate","offset":175},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":213},{"uri":"Phosphate","surface_form":"phosphate","offset":225},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":235},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"insoluble","offset":298},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":489},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":525}]}
