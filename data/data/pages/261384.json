{"id":261384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfate","text":"=\"preserve\">Hydrogen sulfate, also known as bisulfate, is an ion. Its chemical formula is HSO4-. It is formed as part of sulfuric acid, H2SO4.\nChemical compounds containing this ion are known as bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates. An example would be sodium bisulfate. Hydrogen sulfates are acidic. They can be used as a weaker form of acid than sulfuric acid. It is a salt of sulfuric acid. In these compounds, sulfuric acid is deprotonated once. In the sulfate ion, it is deprotonated twice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":61},{"uri":"Sulphuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":121},{"uri":"Chemical_compounds","surface_form":"Chemical compounds","offset":143},{"uri":"Sodium_bisulfate","surface_form":"sodium bisulfate","offset":248},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":288},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":343},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":366},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonated","offset":426},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":452}]}
