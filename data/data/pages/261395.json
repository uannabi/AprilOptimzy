{"id":261395,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_sulfate","text":"Potassium sulfate, also known as arcanite, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is K2SO4. It contains potassium and sulfate ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a white crystalline solid. It dissolves in water easily. It does not dissolve in potassium hydroxide or concentrated ethanol. It can react with additional sulfuric acid to make potassium bisulfate.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting potassium hydroxide and sulfuric acid. It can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with sulfuric acid. It can also be made by reacting sulfur dioxide, oxygen, and potassium chloride with some water.\nUses.\nIt is used in fertilizer. It is sometimes used to make glass.\nOccurrence.\nArcanite is the mineral form of potassium sulfate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":48},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":110},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":124},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":132},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":164},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":237},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":273},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":311},{"uri":"Potassium_chloride","surface_form":"potassium chloride","offset":461},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":532},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":548},{"uri":"Potassium_chloride","surface_form":"potassium chloride","offset":560},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":616},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":657},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":692}]}
