{"id":26140,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale","text":"e=\"preserve\">The International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) is a system introduced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It was introduced to allow people to communicate how serious a nuclear accident is. Other people are then able to react faster to take protection measures. For each level, there is a list of criteria (things) that must be there, for the accident to be of that level.\nDetails.\nLevel 7 is the highest level. Accidents of this type have a large impact (pollution, radiation) outside the site where they occur. The health of many people is put in danger. There are big effects on the environment. Examples: Fukushima nuclear disaster - 2011, Chernobyl disaster (former Soviet Union) - 1986.\nLevel 6 Accidents of this type have a large impact (pollution, radiation) outside the site where they occur. Several governments may need to take the full set of countermeasures to protect their population. Example: Mayak (former Soviet Union)- 1957.\nLevel 5 Accidents of this type do release some radiation. Some groups of people which are at risk may need special countermeasures. Examples: Windscale fire (United Kingdom) - 1957, Three Mile Island accident (United States) - 1979.\n\"The Levels 5-7 are related to severe damage of the reactor core and the radiological barriers.\"\nLevel 4 is related to significant damage of the reactor core / radiological barriers and/or a fatal exposure of a worker (or more), but the off-site impact is minor, resulting in public exposure of the order of the prescribed limits. Examples: Windscale (United Kingdom) - 1973, Saint-Laurent (France) - 1980, Buenos Aires (Argentina) - 1983.\nLevel 3 is characterized by very small off-site impact, although related to severe spread of contamination on-site / acute health effects to a worker (or more). It is a \"near accident\" event, when no safety layers are remaining. Example: Vandellos (Spain) - 1989, THORP plant Sellafield (United Kingdom) - 2005.\nLevel 2 is an incident with no off-site impact, related to significant spread of contamination on-site / overexposure of a worker.\nLevel 1 is an anomaly beyond the authorized operating regime.\nLevel 0 is a \"below-scale event\" of no safety significance.\nThere are also events of no safety relevance, characterized as \"out of scale\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_Atomic_Energy_Agency","surface_form":"International Atomic Energy Agency","offset":88},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":158},{"uri":"Nuclear_accident","surface_form":"nuclear accident","offset":194},{"uri":"Level","surface_form":"level","offset":296},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"pollution","offset":481},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":492},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":542},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":611},{"uri":"Fukushima_nuclear_disaster","surface_form":"Fukushima nuclear disaster","offset":634},{"uri":"Chernobyl_disaster","surface_form":"Chernobyl disaster","offset":669},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":696},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":712},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":835},{"uri":"Mayak","surface_form":"Mayak","offset":934},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":963},{"uri":"Windscale_fire","surface_form":"Windscale fire","offset":1111},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1127},{"uri":"Three_Mile_Island_accident","surface_form":"Three Mile Island accident","offset":1151},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1179},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":1196},{"uri":"Windscale","surface_form":"Windscale","offset":1543},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":1572},{"uri":"Saint-Laurent","surface_form":"Saint-Laurent","offset":1578},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1593},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":1603},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":1609},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1623},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":1636},{"uri":"Vandellos","surface_form":"Vandellos","offset":1880},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1891},{"uri":"1989","surface_form":"1989","offset":1900},{"uri":"Thorp_nuclear_fuel_reprocessing_plant","surface_form":"THORP plant","offset":1906},{"uri":"Sellafield","surface_form":"Sellafield","offset":1918}]}
