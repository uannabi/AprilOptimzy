{"id":261453,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(official)","text":"=\"preserve\">A Canon in a church is an official. He may or may not be a priest. The Chapter of a cathedral is an official group made up of the Dean and Chapter of canons, who meet in a chapterhouse. They run the cathedral, especially the business affairs of the cathedral. They are the body which has legal responsibility for the cathedral, and for electing the (arch)bishop.\nOriginally, a canon was a cleric who lived in the precinct of the cathedral. The word meant a priest who was under (ruled by) a bishop.\nIn the Anglican church, some canons are laypersons (not ordained). The title is also given to some senior or retired priests as an honorary title.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":25},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":38},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":71},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":96},{"uri":"Dean","surface_form":"Dean","offset":142},{"uri":"Chapterhouse","surface_form":"chapterhouse","offset":184},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":300},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":367},{"uri":"Precinct","surface_form":"precinct","offset":425}]}
