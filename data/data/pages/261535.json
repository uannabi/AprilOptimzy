It replaced No Way Out as WWE's February pay-per-view.\nThe idea of the show was that the two main event matches, one for the World Heavyweight Championship and one for the WWE Championship, would be in an Elimination Chamber. Each match had six wrestler in it: the defending champion and five challengers. Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Randy Orton, John Cena, and Kofi Kingston in the Raw Elimination Chamber. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and R-Truth. On the undercard, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter, and Maryse and Gail Kim wrestled against Team Lay-Cool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in a tag team match.\n__NOTOC__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":49},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"pro wrestling","offset":64},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":78},{"uri":"World_Wrestling_Entertainment","surface_form":"World Wrestling Entertainment","offset":104},{"uri":"Scottrade_Center","surface_form":"Scottrade Center","offset":186},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis, Missouri","offset":206},{"uri":"WWE_No_Way_Out","surface_form":"No Way Out","offset":239},{"uri":"World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)","surface_form":"World Heavyweight Championship","offset":352},{"uri":"WWE_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Championship","offset":399},{"uri":"Elimination_Chamber","surface_form":"Elimination Chamber","offset":432},{"uri":"Sheamus","surface_form":"Sheamus","offset":533},{"uri":"Triple_H","surface_form":"Triple H","offset":579},{"uri":"Ted_DiBiase%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Ted DiBiase","offset":589},{"uri":"Randy_Orton","surface_form":"Randy Orton","offset":602},{"uri":"John_Cena","surface_form":"John Cena","offset":615},{"uri":"Kofi_Kingston","surface_form":"Kofi Kingston","offset":630},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"Raw","offset":651},{"uri":"The_Undertaker","surface_form":"The Undertaker","offset":720},{"uri":"Chris_Jericho","surface_form":"Chris Jericho","offset":787},{"uri":"John_Morrison_(wrestler)","surface_form":"John Morrison","offset":802},{"uri":"Rey_Mysterio%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Rey Mysterio","offset":817},{"uri":"CM_Punk","surface_form":"CM Punk","offset":831},{"uri":"Ron_Killings","surface_form":"R-Truth","offset":843},{"uri":"Drew_McIntyre","surface_form":"Drew McIntyre","offset":870},{"uri":"WWE_Intercontinental_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Intercontinental Championship","offset":897},{"uri":"Kane_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Kane","offset":939},{"uri":"Mike_Mizanin","surface_form":"The Miz","offset":945},{"uri":"WWE_United_States_Championship","surface_form":"WWE United States Championship","offset":966},{"uri":"Montel_Vontavious_Porter","surface_form":"Montel Vontavious Porter","offset":1005},{"uri":"Maryse_Ouellet","surface_form":"Maryse","offset":1035},{"uri":"Gail_Kim","surface_form":"Gail Kim","offset":1046},{"uri":"Layla_El","surface_form":"Layla","offset":1087},{"uri":"Michelle_McCool","surface_form":"Michelle McCool","offset":1097},{"uri":"Tag_team","surface_form":"tag team","offset":1119}]}
