{"id":261580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamatai","text":"=\"preserve\">The Yamatai was the strongest country in Wa, beginning from the early 2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. Wa is the oldest written name of Japan.\nThe Wei Zhi Worenshuan is a Chinese text that tells about this country. Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko. Yamatai is also famous for trading with Wei, which is a Chinese dynasty. No one knows where the Yamatai can be found. Some archaeologists dispute whether the Yamatai Kingdom was located in northern Kyushu or in the central Kinki region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2nd_century","surface_form":"2nd century","offset":82},{"uri":"3rd_century","surface_form":"3rd century","offset":112},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":158},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":193},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"queen","offset":326},{"uri":"Himiko","surface_form":"Himiko","offset":338},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"dynasty","offset":410},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":469},{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"dispute","offset":484},{"uri":"Kyushu","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":544},{"uri":"Kinki","surface_form":"Kinki","offset":569}]}
