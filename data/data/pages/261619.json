It measured about 2 meters in length and weighed 20 kilograms.\nIt was named by paleontologist Jose Bonaparte in 1991. It walked on two legs, had a long tail, and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner. It may have eaten insects. It was more primitive than other, better-known members of its family, such as \"Mononykus\" and \"Shuvuuia\".\nIn popular culture.\n\"Alvarezsaurus\" was featured in the Discovery Channel television series \"Dinosaur Planet\", which speculated that it was a predator of young \"Saltasaurus\", although these species did not exist at the same time, \"Alvarezsaurus\" being about 5 million years older than \"Saltasaurus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":43},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":63},{"uri":"Paleontologist","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":184},{"uri":"Jose_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Jose Bonaparte","offset":199},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":339},{"uri":"Mononykus","surface_form":"Mononykus","offset":427},{"uri":"Shuvuuia","surface_form":"Shuvuuia","offset":443},{"uri":"Discovery_Channel","surface_form":"Discovery Channel","offset":510},{"uri":"Dinosaur_Planet","surface_form":"Dinosaur Planet","offset":547},{"uri":"Saltasaurus","surface_form":"Saltasaurus","offset":615}]}
