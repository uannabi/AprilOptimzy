{"id":261805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Super_Licence","text":"e=\"preserve\">The FIA Super Licence is a qualification allowing the licence (license) holder to take part in Formula One Grands Prix as a driver. The licence is issued by the FIA upon request.\nIn rare and special cases, Appendix L allows the FIA to award a Super Licence to a driver who does not meet the normal requirements. A yes vote by all the members is required. The driver must also completed 300 kilometres of testing at racing speeds in a current car.\nNationality of drivers ==.\nThe nationality that appears on the racing licence is the same one that appears on the driver's passport. This does not need to be the same as the country issuing the racing licence. A Frenchman living in Germany can race with a German licence, but the nationality displayed would still be French. In order to race as German, the driver would need to have German nationality as well. For drivers with multiple citizenships, the driver chooses which country to drive for.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"FIA","surface_form":"FIA","offset":17},{"uri":"Professional_certification","surface_form":"qualification","offset":40},{"uri":"License","surface_form":"licence","offset":67},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":108},{"uri":"Nationality","surface_form":"nationality","offset":491},{"uri":"Passport","surface_form":"passport","offset":583}]}
