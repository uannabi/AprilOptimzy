He is a member of the Liberal Democrats. He was the Member of Parliament for Eastleigh from May 2005 until February 2013. He was the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from May 2010 until February 2012. When he was in that job, he decided on the most efficient ways of having electricity and other important resources in Britain. There was an article in the newspaper that said Huhne wanted to have more nuclear power stations. A lot of people think this is wrong.\nHuhne was married to Greek economist Vicky Pryce (born 1952) from 1984 until they separated in 2010 and divorced in 2011. Huhne and Pryce had three children together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":85},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":93},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":120},{"uri":"Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Liberal Democrats","offset":150},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":180},{"uri":"Eastleigh_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"Eastleigh","offset":205},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":261},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State_for_Energy_and_Climate_Change","surface_form":"Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change","offset":278},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":382},{"uri":"Decide","surface_form":"decide","offset":390},{"uri":"Efficient","surface_form":"efficient","offset":410},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":435},{"uri":"Important","surface_form":"important","offset":457},{"uri":"Resources","surface_form":"resources","offset":467},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":517},{"uri":"Nuclear_power","surface_form":"nuclear power","offset":563},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":596},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":634},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":645},{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":651},{"uri":"Vicky_Pryce","surface_form":"Vicky Pryce","offset":661},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":728}]}
