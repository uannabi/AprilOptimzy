{"id":261849,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security","text":"e=\"preserve\">Social Security is the name given to programs to provide money for health care, unemployment benefit and pension to people who need it. In Europe, the term is very similar to welfare. In the United States, it refers to a program started in the New Deal. The program first gave money only to a few old people, but is now used by millions of people and is one of the largest and most costly programs in the federal government. Social Security in the United States is managed by the Social Security Administration, and a person in the program gets a number and has it forever, mainly because of tax reports.\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights law ensure such Security as \"right to an adequate standard of living\" as one of the human rights.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Health_care","surface_form":"health care","offset":80},{"uri":"Pension","surface_form":"pension","offset":118},{"uri":"Welfare","surface_form":"welfare","offset":188},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":204},{"uri":"New_Deal","surface_form":"New Deal","offset":257},{"uri":"Social_Security_Administration","surface_form":"Social Security Administration","offset":493},{"uri":"Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","surface_form":"Universal Declaration of Human Rights","offset":618},{"uri":"International_human_rights_law","surface_form":"international human rights law","offset":666},{"uri":"Right_to_an_adequate_standard_of_living","surface_form":"right to an adequate standard of living","offset":722},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":777}]}
