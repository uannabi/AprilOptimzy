In 1461 he was made dean of Westminster, and his subsequent promotion was rapid in both church and state. In 1461 he was made \"Master of the Rolls\", and in 1470 was sent as ambassador to the court of Castile. He became Bishop of Rochester on 15 March, Bishop of Worcester on 15 July 1476 and of Ely on 6 October 1486. He was Lord Chancellor, once from June 1475 to September 1475 and then again from October 1485 to March 1487.\nAlcock was one of the leading pre-Reformation churchmen; he was a man of deep learning and also a great architect. He founded a charity at Beverley and a grammar school at Kingston upon Hull. He restored many churches and colleges, but his greatest achievement was the building of Jesus College, Cambridge.\nAlcock died on 1 October 1500 and lies buried in the Alcock Chantry in Ely Cathedral.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beverley","surface_form":"Beverley","offset":80},{"uri":"Yorkshire","surface_form":"Yorkshire","offset":92},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":176},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":215},{"uri":"Crown_of_Castile","surface_form":"Castile","offset":387},{"uri":"Rochester%2C_Kent","surface_form":"Rochester","offset":416},{"uri":"Worcester","surface_form":"Worcester","offset":449},{"uri":"Ely%2C_Cambridgeshire","surface_form":"Ely","offset":482},{"uri":"Lord_Chancellor","surface_form":"Lord Chancellor","offset":512},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Reformation","offset":649},{"uri":"Kingston_upon_Hull","surface_form":"Kingston upon Hull","offset":787},{"uri":"Ely_Cathedral","surface_form":"Ely Cathedral","offset":993}]}
