He is the second highest ranking of the Great Officers of State after the Lord High Steward. The Lord Chancellor is appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. Before the Union there were separate Lord Chancellors of England and Scotland.\nUntil Tony Blair became Prime Minister the Lord Chancellor was required to be a member of the House of Lords,was its presiding officer,and was Britain's highest-ranking judge.\nBlair tried to abolish the position and wound up removing some of its responsibilities and dividing others,and now the holder is usually in the House of Commons.\nThe Lord Chancellor remains responsible for the Great Seal and for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts. The current Lord Chancellor is Robert Buckland.\nFormerly, there were separate Chancellors of England, Scotland and Ireland. When the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the Acts of Union 1707 the offices of the Chancellor of England and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland were combined to form a single office of Lord Chancellor for the new state.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Political post"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":107},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":125},{"uri":"Lord_High_Steward","surface_form":"Lord High Steward","offset":215},{"uri":"British_monarchy","surface_form":"Sovereign","offset":274},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":305},{"uri":"Acts_of_Union_1707","surface_form":"Union","offset":332},{"uri":"Tony_Blair","surface_form":"Tony Blair","offset":406},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":494},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":720},{"uri":"Great_Seal_of_the_Realm","surface_form":"Great Seal","offset":786},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":855},{"uri":"Robert_Buckland","surface_form":"Robert Buckland","offset":894},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"Kingdom of England","offset":996},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Scotland","offset":1023},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Kingdom of Great Britain","offset":1062},{"uri":"Acts_of_Union_1707","surface_form":"Acts of Union 1707","offset":1097},{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"state","offset":1262}]}
