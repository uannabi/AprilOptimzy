{"id":261896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_zone","text":"=\"preserve\">The littoral zone refers to that part of a sea, lake or river which is close to the shore. In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the high water mark, which is rarely under water, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. It always includes this intertidal zone and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone. However, the meaning of \"littoral zone\" can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.\nIn oceanography and marine biology, the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the continental shelf.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":55},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":60},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":68},{"uri":"Shore","surface_form":"shore","offset":96},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":106},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":114},{"uri":"High_water_mark","surface_form":"high water mark","offset":162},{"uri":"Intertidal_zone","surface_form":"intertidal zone","offset":283},{"uri":"Oceanography","surface_form":"oceanography","offset":445},{"uri":"Marine_biology","surface_form":"marine biology","offset":462},{"uri":"Continental_shelf","surface_form":"continental shelf","offset":547}]}
