{"id":261918,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(II)_chloride","text":"=\"preserve\">Chromium(II) chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CrCl2. It is a white crystalline chemical. It dissolves in water to produce a bright blue solution. It is a strong reducing agent. If the water has a little acid in it, hydrogen is produced. If the water has a little base in it, chromium(II) oxide is produced. The water needs to be very pure.\nIt is made by reacting chromium(III) chloride and hydrogen at a high temperature. It can also be made by reduction of chromium(III) chloride with zinc. It is used in science research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":39},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":103},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":197},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":251},{"uri":"Chromium(II)_oxide","surface_form":"chromium(II) oxide","offset":311},{"uri":"Chromium(III)_chloride","surface_form":"chromium(III) chloride","offset":399},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":426},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduction","offset":481},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":522}]}
