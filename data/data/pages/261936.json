{"id":261936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury(I)_nitrate","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mercury(I) nitrate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Hg2(NO3)2. It has mercury and nitrate ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a white solid. It is a weak reducing agent in air. It oxidizes to mercury(II) oxide and mercury(II) nitrate. It reacts slowly with water when it is dissolved in water. This makes a basic mercury(I) nitrate and some nitric acid. The basic mercury(I) nitrate is yellow. Mercury(I) nitrate can kill you if you eat or inhale it.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting mercury with a dilute solution of nitric acid. A concentrated solution of nitric acid makes mercury(II) nitrate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":37},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":98},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":110},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":118},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":155},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":218},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_oxide","surface_form":"mercury(II) oxide","offset":256},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_nitrate","surface_form":"mercury(II) nitrate","offset":278},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":405},{"uri":"Inhale","surface_form":"inhale","offset":504},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":573}]}
