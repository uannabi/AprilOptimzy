Its chemical formula is Hg(NO3)2. It contains mercury and nitrate ions. The mercury is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nMercury(II) nitrate is a white crystalline solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting mercury with concentrated nitric acid; dilute nitric acid would make mercury(I) nitrate.\nUses.\nIt was used to make felt from fur. People would get poisoned when using it to make hats, making the term \"mad hatter\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":70},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":135},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":147},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":155},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":186},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":246},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":280},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":359},{"uri":"Mercury(I)_nitrate","surface_form":"mercury(I) nitrate","offset":402},{"uri":"Felt","surface_form":"felt","offset":448},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":458}]}
