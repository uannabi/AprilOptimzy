It has mercury and iodide ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow solid. When light is shined on it, it breaks down (by disproportionation) to mercury(II) iodide and iodine. It is toxic, as are all mercury compounds.\nPreparation and use.\nIt is made by reacting mercury and iodine. It was once used as a medicine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":68},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":125},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":137},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":144},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":181},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionation","offset":279},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_iodide","surface_form":"mercury(II) iodide","offset":302},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":325},{"uri":"Mercury_compounds","surface_form":"mercury compounds","offset":357},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":432}]}
