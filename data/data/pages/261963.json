{"id":261963,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildhall_School_of_Music_and_Drama","text":"Guildhall School of Music and Drama is a school for music and drama in London, England. It was founded in 1880. Students can study Music, Opera, Drama, Stage Management and Technical Theatre.\nHistory.\nThe first Guildhall School was in an old warehouse, but it was soon too small. A new building was especially built and opened in 1886. Before 1935 it was known as the Guildhall School of Music. Since 1977 it has been next to the Barbican Arts Centre in the Barbican Complex.\nThe Guildhall School does not just teach students at the school. They also organize music examinations in the whole of Britain for anyone learning musical instruments. In 2004 these examinations joined with those of Trinity College London to form Trinity Guildhall Examinations. Today, Trinity Guildhall offers qualifications in performing and teaching in music, speech and drama, and dance to external students (students who are not studying at the school).\nToday the school has a 308-seat drama and opera theatre, concert hall, lecture / recital hall and a small studio theatre. The students of the school regularly perform all over London. In 2008 work began on a large extension to the School. It will cost about \u00A390 million.\nFamous musicians who studied there include the trumpeter Alison Balsom, the composer Thomas Ad\u00E8s, the flautist Sir James Galway, the pianist Paul Lewis, the violinist Tasmin Little and the singers Kate Royal and Bryn Terfel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":52},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":62},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":71},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":79},{"uri":"1880","surface_form":"1880","offset":106},{"uri":"1886","surface_form":"1886","offset":330},{"uri":"Barbican_Arts_Centre","surface_form":"Barbican Arts Centre","offset":430},{"uri":"Barbican_Complex","surface_form":"Barbican Complex","offset":458},{"uri":"Trinity_College_London","surface_form":"Trinity College London","offset":692},{"uri":"Trinity_Guildhall","surface_form":"Trinity Guildhall","offset":723},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":861},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":1253},{"uri":"Alison_Balsom","surface_form":"Alison Balsom","offset":1263},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":1282},{"uri":"Thomas_Ad%C3%A8s","surface_form":"Thomas Ad\u00E8s","offset":1291},{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flautist","offset":1308},{"uri":"James_Galway","surface_form":"James Galway","offset":1321},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"pianist","offset":1339},{"uri":"Paul_Lewis","surface_form":"Paul Lewis","offset":1347},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":1363},{"uri":"Tasmin_Little","surface_form":"Tasmin Little","offset":1373},{"uri":"Kate_Royal","surface_form":"Kate Royal","offset":1403},{"uri":"Bryn_Terfel","surface_form":"Bryn Terfel","offset":1418}]}
