{"id":262,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February","text":"February (Feb.) is the second month of the year, coming between January and March, with 28 days in common years, and 29 days in leap years. In Sweden in 1732 the month had 30 days. This was to make the calendar match to the rest of the world. In 1930 and 1931, February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. This year (2020), February will have 29 days in it because 2020 is a leap year. The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from \"februa\", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.\nFebruary begins on the same day of the week as March and November in common years, and August in leap years. February always ends on the same day of the week as October, and additionally, January in common years.\nThe Month.\nFebruary is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year (the other is January). This is because in the original Roman calendar, the two months of winter, when not much would happen in agriculture, did not have names.\nFebruary is the second month of the year, coming between January and March, and is also the shortest month, with 28 days in a common year, and 29 days in a leap year. February begins on the same day of the week as March and November in common years and on the same day of the week as August in leap years. February ends on the same day of the week as January in common years and October every year, as each other's last days are exactly 4 weeks (28 days) and 35 weeks (245 days) apart respectively. In a leap year, February is the only month to begin and end on the same day of the week.\nEvery year, February starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year, as each other's first days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In common years, February finishes on the same day of the week as May of the previous year, and in leap years, August and November of the previous year.\nIn common years immediately before other common years, February starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, May of the following year. In years immediately before common years, February finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, April and December of the following year.\nFebruary is also the only month of the calendar that, once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively, either back into the past or forward into the future, will have four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday, this was observed in 2010 and can be traced back 11 years to 1999, 6 years back to 1993, 11 years back to 1982, 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965, and will be observed in 2021. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday, with the next occurrence in 2026, and previous occurrences in 2015 (11 years earlier than 2026), 2009 (6 years earlier than 2015), 1998 (11 years earlier than 2009) and 1987 (11 years earlier than 1998). This works unless the pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.\nFrom circa 700\u00A0BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46\u00A0BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise. Leap year Day, February 29, is added in every year that can be divided equally by four, such as 2012 and 2016, but this does not apply when the year ending in \"00\" at the turn of the century does not divide equally into 400. This means that 1600 and 2000 were leap years in the Gregorian calendar, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were rather common years. This is where the Julian calendar calculated dates differently, as it always repeated February 29 every four years.\nFebruary is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of August in the other. In weather lore, Groundhog Day, in the United States, is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the winter.\nFebruary's flower is the violet and its birthstone is the amethyst. The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity. The zodiac signs for February are Aquarius (January 21 to February 19), and Pisces (February 20 to March 20).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":30},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":43},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":64},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":76},{"uri":"Common_year","surface_form":"common year","offset":99},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":128},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":143},{"uri":"1732","surface_form":"1732","offset":153},{"uri":"1930","surface_form":"1930","offset":246},{"uri":"1931","surface_form":"1931","offset":255},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":289},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":437},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":647},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":657},{"uri":"Common_year","surface_form":"common year","offset":669},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":687},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":697},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":761},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":788},{"uri":"Common_year","surface_form":"common year","offset":799},{"uri":"Roman_calendar","surface_form":"Roman calendar","offset":976},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":1010},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":1138},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":1150},{"uri":"Common_year","surface_form":"common year","offset":1207},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":1237},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":1295},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":1305},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":1365},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":1460},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":1585},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":1728},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":1887},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":1932},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":1943},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":2076},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":2159},{"uri":"July","surface_form":"July","offset":2277},{"uri":"April","surface_form":"April","offset":2349},{"uri":"December","surface_form":"December","offset":2359},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"Leap year","offset":3647},{"uri":"February_29","surface_form":"February 29","offset":3662},{"uri":"2012","surface_form":"2012","offset":3743},{"uri":"2016","surface_form":"2016","offset":3752},{"uri":"Century","surface_form":"century","offset":3830},{"uri":"1600","surface_form":"1600","offset":3888},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":3897},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":3907},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":3925},{"uri":"1700","surface_form":"1700","offset":3949},{"uri":"1800","surface_form":"1800","offset":3955},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":3965},{"uri":"Julian_calendar","surface_form":"Julian calendar","offset":4014},{"uri":"February_29","surface_form":"February 29","offset":4082},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":4126},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":4146},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":4172},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":4192},{"uri":"Hemisphere","surface_form":"hemisphere","offset":4221},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":4243},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":4266},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":4290},{"uri":"Lore","surface_form":"lore","offset":4298},{"uri":"Groundhog_Day","surface_form":"Groundhog Day","offset":4304},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":4326},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":4408},{"uri":"Violet_(plant)","surface_form":"violet","offset":4441},{"uri":"Birthstone","surface_form":"birthstone","offset":4456},{"uri":"Amethyst","surface_form":"amethyst","offset":4474},{"uri":"Zodiac","surface_form":"zodiac","offset":4530},{"uri":"Aquarius_(astrology)","surface_form":"Aquarius","offset":4560},{"uri":"January_21","surface_form":"January 21","offset":4570},{"uri":"February_19","surface_form":"February 19","offset":4584},{"uri":"Pisces_(astrology)","surface_form":"Pisces","offset":4602},{"uri":"February_20","surface_form":"February 20","offset":4610},{"uri":"March_20","surface_form":"March 20","offset":4625}]}
