{"id":262141,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_lamp","text":"A neon lamp is a light bulb that can make many colors when Noble gasses are inside of the bulb. For example, helium would give a light yellow color and neon would make a red or orange color when an electric current is run in the tube. It is normally used to make letters for signs. Different gases make different colors. Neon Lamps are used to make neon signs.\nThe different colors neon lamps can make.\nFrom left to right: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, and Xenon.\nA neon glow lamp is a little orange light bulb. There is an electric current that flows between the two electrodes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Light_bulb","surface_form":"light bulb","offset":17},{"uri":"Noble_gas","surface_form":"Noble gasses","offset":59},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":109},{"uri":"Neon","surface_form":"neon","offset":152},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":170},{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":177},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":198},{"uri":"Neon_sign","surface_form":"neon sign","offset":349},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"Helium","offset":423},{"uri":"Neon","surface_form":"Neon","offset":431},{"uri":"Argon","surface_form":"Argon","offset":437},{"uri":"Krypton","surface_form":"Krypton","offset":444},{"uri":"Xenon","surface_form":"Xenon","offset":457},{"uri":"Light_bulb","surface_form":"light bulb","offset":500},{"uri":"Electrode","surface_form":"electrode","offset":568}]}
