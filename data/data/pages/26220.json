{"id":26220,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve","text":"Adam and Eve are the parents of all humans in the Abrahamic religions. In the Book of Genesis in the Bible, as well as the Qu'ran and the Aqdas, they are the first two people made by God. The Bible says that the Devil entered into the Garden of Eden as a serpent and tempted Eve. The Tempter convinced Eve to go against God's command. Satan told her that God knew that Eve would become self-aware and have the same knowledge as God had if she ate from the fruit of the tree. When Adam and Eve sinned, they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and cursed with pain, death, and sickness. When Adam and Eve were cast out, so was the one who tempted them, Satan. He was cast to the ground and sentenced to always having to wriggle on the ground like a snake.\nAdam.\nThe second chapter of Genesis says that God made Adam from the dust of the ground. Then, God breathed life into him. God made a garden, called the Garden of Eden, for him to live in and take care of. Adam named the animals that God made. God did not provide clothing for Adam or Eve until they disobeyed him. He gave them tunics made out of animal fur when he banished them from Eden. Adam is \"The Chosen One\".\nEve.\nGod knew that the animals were not good enough friends for Adam, who needed a partner like him. So God took a rib from Adam and used it to make Eve (meaning \"mother of all living\"). Adam did not give her this name until God banished from Eden when he provided clothing for them out of animal fur after they disobeyed him.\nThe fall and punishment.\nChapter three of Genesis says that Adam and Eve had everything they needed in the garden. There was only one thing that God told them that they should \"not\" do: eat from the Tree of Knowledge; only from the Tree of Life. A serpent said them that God does not want you both to be as intelligent as he is so this forced Eve to disobey God's orders. And they ate the Forbidden fruit. So they were forced to leave Eden. Not only that but God said that women will have pain in childbirth, and that men need to work hard to grow food, and would return at death to the soil from where he once came.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religion","offset":50},{"uri":"Book_of_Genesis","surface_form":"Book of Genesis","offset":78},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":101},{"uri":"Qu%27ran","surface_form":"Qu'ran","offset":123},{"uri":"Aqdas","surface_form":"Aqdas","offset":138},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":168},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":183},{"uri":"Book_of_Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":782},{"uri":"Garden_of_Eden","surface_form":"Garden of Eden","offset":907},{"uri":"Book_of_Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":1540},{"uri":"Forbidden_fruit","surface_form":"Forbidden fruit","offset":1887}]}
