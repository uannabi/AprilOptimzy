{"id":262223,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_aluminium_sulfate","text":"Potassium aluminium sulfate, or potash alum, or potassium alum, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KAl(SO4)2. It contains potassium, aluminium, and sulfate ions. Crystals of it are transparent, and it is white when made into a powder.\nProperties.\nIt is a acidic solid at room temperature. It does not have a colour; its crystals are transparent, and its powder is white. It reacts with sodium bicarbonate to make carbon dioxide gas. It exists naturally, and can be found as a mineral.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting aluminium sulfate with potassium sulfate.\nUses.\nIt is used to purify water. It is also used in deodorants. It is an antiseptic. It had several uses in the past, such as in dyeing clothes.\nCrystals can be grown from a solution of potassium aluminium sulfate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":69},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":135},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":146},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":161},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":169},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":268},{"uri":"Sodium_bicarbonate","surface_form":"sodium bicarbonate","offset":399},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":426},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":489},{"uri":"Aluminium_sulfate","surface_form":"aluminium sulfate","offset":534},{"uri":"Potassium_sulfate","surface_form":"potassium sulfate","offset":557},{"uri":"Deodorant","surface_form":"deodorant","offset":629},{"uri":"Antiseptic","surface_form":"antiseptic","offset":650}]}
