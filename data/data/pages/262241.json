{"id":262241,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bakovic","text":"Peter Bakovic (born January 31, 1965 in Thunder Bay, Ontario) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey left wing who played briefly in the National Hockey League in the late 1980s for the Vancouver Canucks.\nBakovic played his junior hockey for the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League but was never drafted. After a strong final year of junior, he was signed as a free agent by the Calgary Flames in 1985. A tough player who fought often, Bakovic spent three seasons playing minor pro in the Flames' system without seeing an NHL game. In two years with the Moncton Golden Flames of the AHL, he lead the team in penalty minutes both years, but also posted good offensive totals, notching 54 and 51 points. In his only year with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, Bakovic posted 43 points in 39 games along with 221 PIM.\nLate in the 1987\u201388 season, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks. Vancouver immediately promoted him to their NHL team, and he played 10 games for the Canucks, recording 2 goals and 48 PIM. However, injuries struck the next year and he found himself back in the IHL with the Milwaukee Admirals. Bakovic would play three more seasons in Milwaukee without seeing another NHL game before retiring in 1991.\nFollowing his retirement, Bakovic stayed in Milwaukee and remained with the Admirals organization as an assistant coach until 1998. He continues to live in Milwaukee and coaches high school hockey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thunder_Bay","surface_form":"Thunder Bay","offset":40},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":53},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":67},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":97},{"uri":"Winger_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"left wing","offset":108},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":144},{"uri":"Vancouver_Canucks","surface_form":"Vancouver Canucks","offset":193},{"uri":"Windsor_Spitfires","surface_form":"Windsor Spitfires","offset":253},{"uri":"Ontario_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Ontario Hockey League","offset":278},{"uri":"Free_agent","surface_form":"free agent","offset":379},{"uri":"Calgary_Flames","surface_form":"Calgary Flames","offset":397},{"uri":"Moncton_Golden_Flames","surface_form":"Moncton Golden Flames","offset":572},{"uri":"Penalty_minutes","surface_form":"penalty minutes","offset":626},{"uri":"Salt_Lake_Golden_Eagles","surface_form":"Salt Lake Golden Eagles","offset":746},{"uri":"1987%E2%80%9388_NHL_season","surface_form":"1987\u201388","offset":840},{"uri":"Vancouver_Canucks","surface_form":"Vancouver Canucks","offset":876},{"uri":"International_Hockey_League_(1945%E2%80%932001)","surface_form":"IHL","offset":1091},{"uri":"Milwaukee_Admirals","surface_form":"Milwaukee Admirals","offset":1104}]}
