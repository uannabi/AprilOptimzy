{"id":262400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REN21","text":"e=\"preserve\">REN21, the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, is an organization which provides a forum for international leadership in renewable energy policy, in order to promote the rapid growth of renewable energy technologies in developing countries and industrialised economies.\nThe network was launched in June 2005 as a result of discussion held the previous year at the International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn, Germany. Its secretariat operates from offices in Paris, France, and is provided by the United Nations Environment Programme and the \"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Technische Zusammenarbeit\" (German Technical Cooperation), in collaboration with the International Energy Agency.\nREN21 has produced a number of internationally recognised reports on renewable energy policy and the development of the renewables marketplace. Since 2005 REN21 has produced an annual \"Renewables Global Status Report\", with Eric Martinot and Janet Sawin as lead authors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Renewable_energy_policy","surface_form":"renewable energy policy","offset":152},{"uri":"Renewable_energy_commercialization","surface_form":"rapid growth of renewable energy","offset":201},{"uri":"Developing_country","surface_form":"developing countries","offset":250},{"uri":"Developed_country","surface_form":"industrialised economies","offset":275},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":446},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":452},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":502},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":509},{"uri":"United_Nations_Environment_Programme","surface_form":"United Nations Environment Programme","offset":540},{"uri":"Deutsche_Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Technische_Zusammenarbeit","surface_form":"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Technische Zusammenarbeit","offset":586},{"uri":"International_Energy_Agency","surface_form":"International Energy Agency","offset":697},{"uri":"Renewable_energy_industry","surface_form":"renewables marketplace","offset":846},{"uri":"Eric_Martinot","surface_form":"Eric Martinot","offset":950}]}
