{"id":262403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_engine","text":"A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft is at a right angle (90\u00B0) to the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use a transverse engine mounting design. The majority of rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine design, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the vehicle.\nHistory.\nThe first car known to use such an arrangement was a 1911 front-wheel drive car. It had a clutch at each end of the engine, driving the front wheels directly. The first successful transverse-engine cars were the two-cylinder DKW \"Front\" series of cars. These first appeared in 1931. After the World War II, SAAB used the configuration in their first model, the Saab 92, in 1947.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":26},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":46},{"uri":"Crankshaft","surface_form":"crankshaft","offset":75},{"uri":"Front_wheel_drive","surface_form":"front wheel drive","offset":140},{"uri":"Rear_wheel_drive","surface_form":"rear wheel drive","offset":224},{"uri":"Longitudinal_engine","surface_form":"longitudinal engine","offset":256},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel","offset":322},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":649},{"uri":"Saab","surface_form":"Saab","offset":717}]}
