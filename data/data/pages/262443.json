{"id":262443,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception","text":"\"Inception\" is a 2010 British-American science fiction action heist movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the movie with his wife, Emma Thomas. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\nThe idea behind \"Inception\" was first developed over nine years before it was released. After the 2002 completion of \"Insomnia\", Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment for a horror movie envisioning \"dream-stealers\", presenting the idea to Warner Bros. based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation.\nDeciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005's \"Batman Begins\", 2006's \"The Prestige\", and \"The Dark Knight\" in 2008. He spent six months polishing up the script for \"Inception\" before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009. Filming spanned in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and finishing in Canada in November 22. It was officially budgeted at $160 million, a cost which was shared between Warner Bros. and Legendary. Nolan's success with \"The Dark Knight\" helped gain the movie $100 million to spend on advertising.\n\"Inception\" was first screened in London on July 8, 2010 and was shown in standard and IMAX theatres on July 16, 2010. \"Inception\" grossed over $828 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing movie of 2010. Considered one of the best movies of the 2010s, \"Inception\" received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, action sequences, visual effects, musical score, and ensemble cast. It won four Academy Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":39},{"uri":"Action_movie","surface_form":"action","offset":55},{"uri":"Heist_movie","surface_form":"heist movie","offset":62},{"uri":"Christopher_Nolan","surface_form":"Christopher Nolan","offset":98},{"uri":"Emma_Thomas","surface_form":"Emma Thomas","offset":160},{"uri":"Leonardo_DiCaprio","surface_form":"Leonardo DiCaprio","offset":189},{"uri":"Subconscious","surface_form":"subconscious","offset":274},{"uri":"Ken_Watanabe","surface_form":"Ken Watanabe","offset":476},{"uri":"Joseph_Gordon-Levitt","surface_form":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","offset":490},{"uri":"Marion_Cotillard","surface_form":"Marion Cotillard","offset":512},{"uri":"Ellen_Page","surface_form":"Ellen Page","offset":530},{"uri":"Tom_Hardy","surface_form":"Tom Hardy","offset":542},{"uri":"Dileep_Rao","surface_form":"Dileep Rao","offset":553},{"uri":"Cillian_Murphy","surface_form":"Cillian Murphy","offset":565},{"uri":"Tom_Berenger","surface_form":"Tom Berenger","offset":581},{"uri":"Michael_Caine","surface_form":"Michael Caine","offset":599},{"uri":"Insomnia_(movie)","surface_form":"Insomnia","offset":732},{"uri":"Movie_treatment","surface_form":"treatment","offset":766},{"uri":"Horror_movie","surface_form":"horror movie","offset":782},{"uri":"Warner_Bros.","surface_form":"Warner Bros.","offset":848},{"uri":"Lucid_dreaming","surface_form":"lucid dreaming","offset":879},{"uri":"Dream_incubation","surface_form":"dream incubation","offset":898},{"uri":"Batman_Begins","surface_form":"Batman Begins","offset":1070},{"uri":"The_Prestige_(movie)","surface_form":"The Prestige","offset":1094},{"uri":"The_Dark_Knight_(movie)","surface_form":"The Dark Knight","offset":1114},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1332},{"uri":"Warner_Bros.","surface_form":"Warner Bros.","offset":1431},{"uri":"Legendary_Pictures","surface_form":"Legendary","offset":1448},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1592},{"uri":"IMAX","surface_form":"IMAX","offset":1645},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":1982},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography","surface_form":"Best Cinematography","offset":1998},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Sound_Editing","surface_form":"Best Sound Editing","offset":2019},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Sound_Mixing","surface_form":"Best Sound Mixing","offset":2039},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects","surface_form":"Best Visual Effects","offset":2062},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture","surface_form":"Best Picture","offset":2116},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay","surface_form":"Best Original Screenplay","offset":2130},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Art_Direction","surface_form":"Best Art Direction","offset":2156},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score","surface_form":"Best Original Score","offset":2180}]}
