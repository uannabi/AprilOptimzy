{"id":262445,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_iodide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Methyl iodide is a chemical compound. It is made of methyl and iodide ions. Its chemical formula is CH3I.\nProperties.\nIt is a liquid that evaporates easily. When it is exposed to light, it turns purple because of iodine. This can be stopped by keeping it with copper. It breaks down when heated to make carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen iodide.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting iodine, red phosphorus, and methanol all at the same time. Phosphorus(III) iodide is formed during the reaction. Another way to make it is to react methanol with potassium iodide and some sulfuric acid.\nUses.\nIt is used to add methyl to some organic compounds. It can also be used as a pesticide. It is used to make dimethylmercury and other chemicals.\nSafety.\nIt causes nausea and dizziness when breathed. It can cause burns when put on skin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":32},{"uri":"Methyl","surface_form":"methyl","offset":65},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":76},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":83},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"evaporates","offset":151},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":226},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":273},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":316},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"carbon monoxide","offset":332},{"uri":"Hydrogen_iodide","surface_form":"hydrogen iodide","offset":353},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":406},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":418},{"uri":"Methanol","surface_form":"methanol","offset":434},{"uri":"Phosphorus(III)_iodide","surface_form":"Phosphorus(III) iodide","offset":465},{"uri":"Potassium_iodide","surface_form":"potassium iodide","offset":568},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":594},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":648},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":692},{"uri":"Dimethylmercury","surface_form":"dimethylmercury","offset":722},{"uri":"Nausea","surface_form":"nausea","offset":777},{"uri":"Dizzy","surface_form":"dizziness","offset":788},{"uri":"Burn","surface_form":"burn","offset":826}]}
