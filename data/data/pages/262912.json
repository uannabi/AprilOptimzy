He did more than 2,500 interviews over a period of 40 years and wrote twelve books, including \"Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation\".\nStevenson found that childhood memories possibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years. He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased, attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased's family had occurred.\nSome 35 per cent of the children examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects. Stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children, when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased, provided the best evidence for reincarnation. However, Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation, and cautiously referred to his cases as being \"of the reincarnation type\" or \"suggestive of reincarnation\".\nStevenson retired in 2002, and psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker took over his work, and wrote '.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ian_Stevenson","surface_form":"Ian Stevenson","offset":26},{"uri":"University_of_Virginia","surface_form":"University of Virginia","offset":50},{"uri":"Past_life","surface_form":"past life","offset":127},{"uri":"Twenty_Cases_Suggestive_of_Reincarnation","surface_form":"Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation","offset":233},{"uri":"Reincarnation","surface_form":"reincarnation","offset":336},{"uri":"Jim_B._Tucker","surface_form":"Jim B.
