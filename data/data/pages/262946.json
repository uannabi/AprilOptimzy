{"id":262946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_parakeet","text":"The Monk parakeet, Quaker parrot, or Seatowerian Budgerigar (\"Myiopsitta monachus\") is a species of parrot. It lives in Argentina and the countries around South America. The bird is also known for passing one of its tail feathers through its bill to reconnect the barbules. This locking process is similar to pressing Velcro strips together.\nDescription.\nThe parakeet is on average 29\u00A0cm long, with a 48\u00A0cm wingspan, and weighs 100\u00A0g. Females tend to be 10-20% smaller, but it is hard to tell the sexes apart, unless they test the feather or blood DNA. It has bright green upperparts. The forehead and breast are pale grey. The bill is orange, and when it calls, it makes a loud and throaty \"chape(-yee)\" or \"quak quaki quak-wi quarr\". Sometimes, it also screeches, \"skveet\".\nDomestic kinds of Monk parakeets may have different colors such as white, blue, and yellow instead of green.\nAs pets.\nMonk parakeets are very intelligent and social birds. When they are kept as pets, they can memorize large vocabularies. They are also able to learn many words and phrases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parrot","surface_form":"parrot","offset":100},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":120},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":155},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":221},{"uri":"Velcro","surface_form":"Velcro","offset":318},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weighs","offset":421},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":497},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":548},{"uri":"Forehead","surface_form":"forehead","offset":589},{"uri":"Breast","surface_form":"breast","offset":602},{"uri":"Domestic","surface_form":"Domestic","offset":776},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabularies","offset":1000}]}
