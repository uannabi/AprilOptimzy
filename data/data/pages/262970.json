{"id":262970,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau","text":"Jean Cocteau (Jean Maurice Eug\u00E8ne Cl\u00E9ment Cocteau, 5 July 1889 \u2013 11 October 1963) was a French artist, poet, novelist, dramatist, designer, boxing manager, playwright, moviemaker and actor.\nCocteau wrote or worked on 21 stage performances, some of which were ballets, and some were plays. Cocteau's movies, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced the upcoming French New Wave genre.\nHe also worked with Pablo Picasso on several projects and was friends with most of the European art community. In all his creative work, he was a modernist.\nIn 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the \"Acad\u00E9mie Fran\u00E7aise\" and The Royal Academy of Belgium. During his life Cocteau was made a Commander of the \"L\u00E9gion d'honneur\".\nLife.\nCocteau was bisexual. His circle of associates, friends and lovers included Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, Mar\u00EDa F\u00E9lix, \u00C9dith Piaf (whom he cast in one of his one-act plays entitled \"Le Bel Indifferent\" in 1940), and Raymond Radiguet.\nIn the 1930s, Cocteau had an affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the beautiful daughter of a Romanov grand duke. She became pregnant. To Cocteau's distress and Paley's life-long regret, the foetus was aborted. Cocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with the French actors Jean Marais (who played 'tough guy' roles in movies and TV), and \u00C9douard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in four of his movies.\nAt times, Cocteau was addicted to opium.\nBiographer James S. Williams describes Cocteau's politics as \"naturally right-leaning\".p123 In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the F\u00FChrer's sexuality. His views became known, and he was arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war. He was cleared of any wrongdoing: it turned out that he had used his contacts to try and save friends from the Nazis.p182\nCocteau died of a heart attack in Milly-la-Foret, Essonne.\nTheatre and ballet.\nCocteau wrote or worked on 21 stage performances, some of which were ballets, and some were plays.\nHe was involved in Diaghilev's \"Ballets Russes\" from the first season in Paris, 1909. He wrote scenarios (\"librettos\") for Fokine's \"Le Dieu Blue\" in 1912, Massine's \"Parade\" in 1917 and Nijinska's \"Le Train Bleu\" in 1924. He also design company posters, and worked for several other ballet companies. He wrote many articles on dance, and made sketches of many in Diaghilev's circle.\nIn 1940, \"Le Bel Indiff\u00E9rent\", Cocteau's play written for and starring \u00C9dith Piaf, was enormously successful.\nFilm.\nCocteau directed eleven movies in \"avant-gard\" style, wrote scripts for six movies and dialogue for three, and directed the photography for one more. Some of his most well-known were \"Blood of a Poet\" (1930), \"Les Parents terribles\" (1948), and \"Orpheus\" (1949).\nWriting.\nCocteau wrote extensively. including poetry. All of it is in French, but some is available in translation.\nCocteau wrote five novels. The most important of these was probably \"Les Enfants terribles\" (1929). He also published 23 books or pamphlets of original poetry, and 26 volumes of poetic criticism and collections. He illustrated 12 works of poetry. He made a number of recordings, mostly spoken poems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":88},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":95},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":103},{"uri":"Novelist","surface_form":"novelist","offset":109},{"uri":"Dramatist","surface_form":"dramatist","offset":119},{"uri":"Designer","surface_form":"designer","offset":130},{"uri":"Boxing","surface_form":"boxing","offset":140},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":156},{"uri":"Filmmaking","surface_form":"moviemaker","offset":168},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":183},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":259},{"uri":"Cinema_of_France","surface_form":"French cinema","offset":413},{"uri":"New_Wave","surface_form":"New Wave","offset":462},{"uri":"Pablo_Picasso","surface_form":"Pablo Picasso","offset":498},{"uri":"Modernism","surface_form":"modernist","offset":624},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Fran\u00E7aise","offset":678},{"uri":"L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur","surface_form":"L\u00E9gion d'honneur","offset":785},{"uri":"Bisexual","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":822},{"uri":"Jean_Hugo","surface_form":"Jean Hugo","offset":901},{"uri":"Jean_Marais","surface_form":"Jean Marais","offset":912},{"uri":"Henri_Bernstein","surface_form":"Henri Bernstein","offset":925},{"uri":"Marlene_Dietrich","surface_form":"Marlene Dietrich","offset":942},{"uri":"Coco_Chanel","surface_form":"Coco Chanel","offset":960},{"uri":"Erik_Satie","surface_form":"Erik Satie","offset":973},{"uri":"Mar%C3%ADa_F%C3%A9lix","surface_form":"Mar\u00EDa F\u00E9lix","offset":985},{"uri":"%C3%89dith_Piaf","surface_form":"\u00C9dith Piaf","offset":998},{"uri":"Raymond_Radiguet","surface_form":"Raymond Radiguet","offset":1095},{"uri":"Natalie_Paley","surface_form":"Natalie Paley","offset":1163},{"uri":"Romanov","surface_form":"Romanov","offset":1206},{"uri":"Grand_Duke","surface_form":"grand duke","offset":1214},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":1237},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"aborted","offset":1314},{"uri":"Jean_Marais","surface_form":"Jean Marais","offset":1391},{"uri":"%C3%89douard_Dermit","surface_form":"\u00C9douard Dermit","offset":1456},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adopted","offset":1494},{"uri":"Drug_addiction","surface_form":"addicted","offset":1568},{"uri":"Opium","surface_form":"opium","offset":1580},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":1738},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":1986},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":2015},{"uri":"Milly-la-Foret","surface_form":"Milly-la-Foret","offset":2031},{"uri":"Essonne","surface_form":"Essonne","offset":2047},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"stage","offset":2106},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":2145},{"uri":"Diaghilev","surface_form":"Diaghilev","offset":2194},{"uri":"Ballets_Russes","surface_form":"Ballets Russes","offset":2207},{"uri":"Fokine","surface_form":"Fokine","offset":2298},{"uri":"Le_Dieu_Blue","surface_form":"Le Dieu Blue","offset":2308},{"uri":"L%C3%A9onide_Massine","surface_form":"Massine","offset":2331},{"uri":"Nijinska","surface_form":"Nijinska","offset":2362},{"uri":"%C3%89dith_Piaf","surface_form":"\u00C9dith Piaf","offset":2630},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"scripts","offset":2735},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":3073},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":3175},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":3206},{"uri":"Recording","surface_form":"recording","offset":3321}]}
