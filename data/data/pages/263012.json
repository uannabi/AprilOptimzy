{"id":263012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine","text":"Hydrazine, also known as diazine, is a chemical compound. It is composed of nitrogen and hydrogen ions. Its chemical formula is N2H4. It contains hydrogen in its +1 and nitrogen in its -2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless liquid. It smells like ammonia, but it is more reactive than ammonia. It is a strong reducing agent. It is explosive. It can mix with water. It is a base similar to ammonia.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting sodium hypochlorite with liquid (not household) ammonia. If it is reacted with household ammonia, toxic fumes will be released. It can be made by reacting urea with sodium hypochlorite.\nUses.\nIt is used to make foam. It is also used in rocket fuels. It can be used in fuel cells. It is used to make sodium azide by reacting sodium amide with sodium nitrite.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":39},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":76},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":89},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":98},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":188},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":258},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":320},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":342},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":384},{"uri":"Sodium_hypochlorite","surface_form":"sodium hypochlorite","offset":445},{"uri":"Household_ammonia","surface_form":"household","offset":482},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":493},{"uri":"Urea","surface_form":"urea","offset":600},{"uri":"Foam","surface_form":"foam","offset":656},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":681},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":688},{"uri":"Fuel_cell","surface_form":"fuel cell","offset":713},{"uri":"Sodium_azide","surface_form":"sodium azide","offset":744},{"uri":"Sodium_amide","surface_form":"sodium amide","offset":769},{"uri":"Sodium_nitrite","surface_form":"sodium nitrite","offset":787}]}
