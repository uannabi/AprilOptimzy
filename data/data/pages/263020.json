{"id":263020,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_nitride","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lithium nitride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li3N. It contains lithium and nitride ions.\nProperties.\nLithium nitride is a red or purple solid. It reacts with water to make lithium hydroxide and ammonia. It is the only alkali metal nitride that is stable. It is a very strong base. It reacts with hydrogen to make lithium hydride and lithium amide.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting lithium with nitrogen. This is unusual because almost no other elements react with nitrogen at room temperature like lithium. It can also be made by reacting nitrogen with lithium dissolved in sodium.\nUses.\nIt can be used to store hydrogen. It can also be used as a source of the nitride ion.\nSafety.\nLithium nitride is toxic and corrosive. It releases ammonia when put in water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":34},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":95},{"uri":"Nitride","surface_form":"nitride","offset":107},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":115},{"uri":"Lithium_hydroxide","surface_form":"lithium hydroxide","offset":204},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":226},{"uri":"Alkali_metal","surface_form":"alkali metal","offset":250},{"uri":"Nitride","surface_form":"nitride","offset":263},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":307},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":416},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":429},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":609},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":647}]}
