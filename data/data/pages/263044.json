{"id":263044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Braque","text":"Georges Braque (Argenteuil, 13 May 1882 \u2013 Paris, 31 August 1963) was a major 20th century French painter and sculptor who, with Pablo Picasso, developed the art movement known as Cubism.\nFrench art critic Louis Vauxcelles first used the term \"Cubism\", or \"bizarre cubiques\", in 1908 after seeing a picture by Braque. He described it as 'full of little cubes', after which the term quickly gained wide use. Art historian Ernst Gombrich described cubism as \"the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity, and to enforce one reading of the picture \u2013 that of a man-made construction, a colored canvas\". The Cubist movement spread quickly throughout Paris and Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argenteuil","surface_form":"Argenteuil","offset":16},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":42},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":90},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":97},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":109},{"uri":"Pablo_Picasso","surface_form":"Pablo Picasso","offset":128},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"Cubism","offset":179},{"uri":"Ernst_Gombrich","surface_form":"Ernst Gombrich","offset":420},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"Cubist","offset":605}]}
