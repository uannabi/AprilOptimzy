{"id":263086,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide","text":"=\"preserve\">Amide can refer to two different things.\nAmides in inorganic chemistry.\nAn amide ion is different from an amide in organic chemistry. The amide ion is made by deprotonating ammonia. This is ammonia acting as an acid, although a very weak one. Amides made by deprotonating ammonia are very strong bases. Sodium amide is an example.\nAmides in organic chemistry.\nAmides are also chemical compounds. They are made by reacting carboxylic acids like acetic acid with amines. There are many ways to make them. They are also used in many chemical reactions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":93},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonating","offset":171},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":185},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":223},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":308},{"uri":"Sodium_amide","surface_form":"Sodium amide","offset":315},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":388},{"uri":"Acetic_acid","surface_form":"acetic acid","offset":456}]}
