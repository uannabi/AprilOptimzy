{"id":263099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_azide","text":"=\"preserve\">Lead azide, also known as lead(II) azide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Pb(N3)2. It contains lead and azide ions. It contains lead in its +2 oxidation state.\nLead azide is an explosive. Most other azides just burn rapidly. It is used as a detonator to detonate other explosives. It is made by reacting lead(II) nitrate and sodium azide. It can be destroyed by sodium dichromate. It can react with other metals such as copper to make even more sensitive azide explosives. It does not become less of an explosive when wet. It will explode if it is dropped.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":59},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":123},{"uri":"Azide","surface_form":"azide","offset":132},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":138},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":171},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":205},{"uri":"Detonation","surface_form":"detonate","offset":282},{"uri":"Lead(II)_nitrate","surface_form":"lead(II) nitrate","offset":332},{"uri":"Sodium_azide","surface_form":"sodium azide","offset":353},{"uri":"Sodium_dichromate","surface_form":"sodium dichromate","offset":390},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":448}]}
