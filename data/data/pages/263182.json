{"id":263182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_sulfate","text":"Cobalt(II) sulfate, also known as cobaltous sulfate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CoSO4. It contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state. It contains cobalt and sulfate ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a reddish crystalline solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is reddish without water (anhydrous) and pink with water (hydrated).\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting cobalt, cobalt(II) oxide, or cobalt(II) hydroxide with sulfuric acid. It is very rarely found in the earth.\nUses.\nIt is used as a pigment. It is also used to make other cobalt salts. It can be used in electroplating cobalt. It was added to beer in the past but that poisoned people.\nSafety.\nCobalt(II) sulfate is slightly carcinogenic. It is poisonous in large quantities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":58},{"uri":"Cobalt","surface_form":"cobalt","offset":120},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":137},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":177},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":185},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":219},{"uri":"Cobalt(II)_oxide","surface_form":"cobalt(II) oxide","offset":388},{"uri":"Cobalt(II)_hydroxide","surface_form":"cobalt(II) hydroxide","offset":409},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":435},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":556},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":581},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":702}]}
