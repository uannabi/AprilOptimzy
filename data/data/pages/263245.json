{"id":263245,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeborg","text":"e=\"preserve\">An eyeborg or eye-borg is an electronic eye that allows people to hear colors. It is mostly used by blind people or by people with color blindness. It works by using a head mounted camera that reads the colors directly in front of a person, and converts them into musical notes.\nThe first eyeborg was made in England in 2003 by Adam Montandon in collaboration with colourblind artist Neil Harbisson. The invention won a British award in Innovation (Submerge 2004) and a European award in Content Tools and Interface Design (Europrix 2004). In 2007, Peter Kese, a software developer from Slovenia, made further developments to the eyeborg by increasing the number of colors to 360 and adding color intensity through different volume levels. Matias Lizana, a student from Universitat Polit\u00E8cnica de Catalunya is currently developing the eyeborg into a smaller chip as part of his final year project. The new chip will allow users to hear colors in stereo and to embed the device.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Color_blindness","surface_form":"color blindness","offset":144},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":600}]}
