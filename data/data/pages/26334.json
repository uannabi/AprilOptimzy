{"id":26334,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics)","text":"=\"preserve\">A projection in geometry is something like a shadow, that an object casts onto another object. When a three-dimensional sphere is projected onto a plane, its projection will either be a circle or an ellipse.\nIn higher mathematics, projections are changes of one thing into something else. They may also be applications of functions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":28},{"uri":"Shadow","surface_form":"shadow","offset":57},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":73},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":132},{"uri":"Plane_(geometry)","surface_form":"plane","offset":159},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":198},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"ellipse","offset":211},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":230},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":334}]}
