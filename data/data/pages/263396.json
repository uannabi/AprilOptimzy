{"id":263396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Versace","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gianni Versace (Reggio Calabria, 2 December 1946 \u2013 Miami Beach, Florida, 15 July 1997) was an Italian fashion designer and founder of Versace S.p.A., an international fashion house.\nThe fashion house also produces accessories, fragrances, makeup and home furnishings as well as clothes. Versaci also designed costumes for the theatre and movies, and was a friend of Elton John, Sting, and Princess Diana among many others.\nOpenly gay, Versace and his partner Antonio D'Amico were regulars on the international party scene. Versace was murdered outside his Miami Beach home, the former Casa Casuarina, at the age of 50 by spree killer Andrew Cunanan.\nDeath and legacy.\nVersace was shot dead on 15 July 1997, aged 50, on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion, as he returned from a morning walk on Ocean Drive. It was his custom to take a stroll to a coffee shop that received international periodicals, to read the Italian-language newspapers. He was murdered by Andrew Cunanan, who used the same gun to commit suicide on a boat several days later. Cunanan previously killed real estate developer Lee Miglin in Chicago. Versace's body was cremated and his ashes returned to the family's estate near Cernobbio, Italy.\nIn September 1997, it was announced Versace's brother, Santo Versace, and Jorge Saud would serve as the new CEOs of Gianni Versace S.P.A. Versace's sister, Donatella, became the new head of design.\nIn his will, Gianni Versace left 50 percent of his fashion empire to his niece Allegra Versace, daughter of Donatella. Allegra inherited this stake, worth around half a billion dollars, when she turned 18 in 2004. Her younger brother, Daniel, inherited Versace's rare artwork collection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reggio_Calabria","surface_form":"Reggio Calabria","offset":29},{"uri":"Miami_Beach%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Miami Beach, Florida","offset":64},{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":107},{"uri":"Fashion","surface_form":"fashion","offset":115},{"uri":"Designer","surface_form":"designer","offset":123},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":166},{"uri":"Perfume","surface_form":"fragrances","offset":240},{"uri":"Makeup","surface_form":"makeup","offset":252},{"uri":"Elton_John","surface_form":"Elton John","offset":379},{"uri":"Sting_(musician)","surface_form":"Sting","offset":391},{"uri":"Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales","surface_form":"Princess Diana","offset":402},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":443},{"uri":"Antonio_D%27Amico","surface_form":"Antonio D'Amico","offset":472},{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"spree killer","offset":634},{"uri":"Andrew_Cunanan","surface_form":"Andrew Cunanan","offset":647},{"uri":"Miami_Beach%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Miami Beach","offset":749},{"uri":"Ocean_Drive_(South_Beach)","surface_form":"Ocean Drive","offset":808},{"uri":"Andrew_Cunanan","surface_form":"Andrew Cunanan","offset":974},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":1022},{"uri":"Lee_Miglin","surface_form":"Lee Miglin","offset":1108},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":1122},{"uri":"Cremation","surface_form":"cremated","offset":1150},{"uri":"Cernobbio","surface_form":"Cernobbio","offset":1210},{"uri":"CEO","surface_form":"CEO","offset":1336},{"uri":"Donatella_Versace","surface_form":"Donatella","offset":1384},{"uri":"Allegra_Versace","surface_form":"Allegra Versace","offset":1505}]}
