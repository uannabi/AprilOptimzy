{"id":263439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_nationalism","text":"Pakistani nationalism refers to the political, cultural, linguistic, historical and religious expression of patriotism by people of Pakistan, of pride in the History of Pakistan, Culture of Pakistan, identity and Cultural heritage of Pakistan, and visions for its future.\nMost of modern-day Pakistani nationalism is centered around a common Indo-Iranians/Indo-Iranic identity and heritage of 99% of the population. Kashmiris, Sindhis, Balochis, Punjabis, Pashtuns and other minorities are mainly of Indo-Iranic stock. It also refers to the consciousness and expression of religious influences that help mould the national consciousness. Nationalism describes the many underlying forces that moulded the Pakistan Movement, and strongly continue to influence the Politics of Pakistan.\nFrom a political point of view and in the years leading up to the independence of Pakistan, the particular political and ideological foundations for the actions of the Muslim League can be called a Pakistani nationalist ideology. It is a unique and singular combination of philosophical, nationalistic, cultural and religious elements.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":132},{"uri":"History_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"History of Pakistan","offset":158},{"uri":"Culture_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Culture of Pakistan","offset":179},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":234},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"Nationalism","offset":637},{"uri":"Pakistan_Movement","surface_form":"Pakistan Movement","offset":703},{"uri":"Politics_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Politics of Pakistan","offset":761},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":865},{"uri":"All-India_Muslim_League","surface_form":"Muslim League","offset":951}]}
