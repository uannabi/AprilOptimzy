{"id":263518,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassily_Ivanchuk","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vassily Ivanchuk, born 18 March 1969, is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.\nChucky, as he is affectionately known, has been a leading player in the world since 1988, at times reaching the second spot on the FIDE list, but has never won the World Chess Championship. Ivanchuk has often had erratic results. Since 2007 his world ranking has ranged from twelfth to second, before dropping to 30th in July 2009.\nHe was the 2007\u20132008 World Blitz Chess champion.\nHe won Amber blindfold and rapid chess championship in 1992 and 2010.\nCharacter.\nWhen he plays, Ivanchuk rarely looks at the board. Instead he stares at the ceiling and at the walls with a blank stare (although this is not uncommon with top players who calculate without looking at the board). His playing style is unpredictable and highly original, making him a threat to any chess player, although it sometimes also leads to quick losses.\nAfter a string of unsuccessful games culminated in his elimination at the early stages of the 2009 Chess World Cup, Ivanchuk announced, in a highly emotional interview, his retirement from professional chess. However, he soon recanted this decision.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":56},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":66},{"uri":"Grandmaster_(chess)","surface_form":"grandmaster","offset":72},{"uri":"FIDE","surface_form":"FIDE","offset":216},{"uri":"World_Chess_Championship","surface_form":"World Chess Championship","offset":249},{"uri":"Blitz_chess","surface_form":"Blitz","offset":444}]}
