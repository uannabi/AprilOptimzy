{"id":263538,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese(III)_fluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Manganese(III) fluoride, also known as manganese trifluoride, is a chemical compound. It contains manganese and fluoride ions. The manganese ions are in the +3 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is MnF3. It is a purple-pink powder. It is used to add fluoride ions to other chemical compounds. It is an oxidizing agent. It is made by heating manganese(II) fluoride with fluorine. These are in a solution of hydrofluoric acid. It decomposes to manganese(II) fluoride when heated.\nIt can form hydrofluoric acid when dissolved in water, so it can be dangerous. It should not be stored in glass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":79},{"uri":"Manganese","surface_form":"manganese","offset":110},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":124},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":133},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":172},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":317},{"uri":"Manganese(II)_fluoride","surface_form":"manganese(II) fluoride","offset":356},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":384},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":421}]}
