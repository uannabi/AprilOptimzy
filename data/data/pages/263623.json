{"id":263623,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siphonophore","text":"The Siphonophores are an order of cnidarian invertebrates in the class Hydrozoa. The Portuguese man o' war is an example.\nA siphonophore is not a single animal. It is a colony of four kinds of zooids. Zooids are very small, highly modified individuals. All the zooids in a colony are genetically identical. These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids.\nThough structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid is not self-sufficient. It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.\nSo close do the zooids fit together that the colony looks like a single individual. It was a triumph of 19th century biology to discover the real nature of the siphonophores.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":25},{"uri":"Cnidaria","surface_form":"cnidaria","offset":34},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":44},{"uri":"Hydrozoa","surface_form":"Hydrozoa","offset":71},{"uri":"Portuguese_man_o%27_war","surface_form":"Portuguese man o' war","offset":85},{"uri":"Colony_(biology)","surface_form":"colony","offset":169},{"uri":"Zooid","surface_form":"zooid","offset":193},{"uri":"Polyp","surface_form":"polyp","offset":336},{"uri":"Medusa_(biology)","surface_form":"medusoids","offset":347}]}
