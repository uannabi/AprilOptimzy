{"id":263635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_manganate","text":"Potassium manganate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is K2MnO4. It contains potassium and manganate ions.\nProperties.\nPotassium manganate is a green solid. It can disproportionate into potassium permanganate and manganese(IV) oxide. This happens in acidic pH. This reaction, because of its color change, is known as a \"chemical chameleon\".\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting manganese(IV) oxide with very hot potassium hydroxide. Sometimes oxygen or potassium nitrate is used as the oxidizing agent. This makes potassium manganate. Normally the potassium manganate is converted to potassium permanganate. Potassium permanganate is more common. Potassium iodide can reduce potassium permanganate to potassium manganate. It can also be made by reacting hot potassium permanganate with potassium hydroxide. This makes oxygen and potassium manganate.\nUses.\nPotassium manganate does not have many uses. It is mainly made when potassium permanganate is made.\nSafety.\nPotassium manganate is a moderate oxidizing agent. When it is reduced, it can made black or brown stains on glass, clothing, or skin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":25},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":88},{"uri":"Manganate","surface_form":"manganate","offset":102},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":112},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionate","offset":175},{"uri":"Potassium_permanganate","surface_form":"potassium permanganate","offset":197},{"uri":"Manganese(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"manganese(IV) oxide","offset":224},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":261},{"uri":"Manganese(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"manganese(IV) oxide","offset":388},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":422},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":453},{"uri":"Potassium_nitrate","surface_form":"potassium nitrate","offset":463},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":496},{"uri":"Potassium_iodide","surface_form":"Potassium iodide","offset":657},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduce","offset":678},{"uri":"Moderate","surface_form":"moderate","offset":999}]}
