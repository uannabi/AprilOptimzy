The storm was the first major storm to affect Long Island and New York state directly since Hurricane Donna 25 years before.\nThe storm started as a tropical depression on September 16; it became Tropical Storm Gloria on September 17.\nOn September 18, it weakened back to a tropical depression. Two days later, it became a tropical storm again.\nAfter being a weak tropical cyclone for several days, on September 22, Gloria became a hurricane. It quickly became stronger on September 24; the next day, its winds peaked at 145\u00A0mph. A 2008 reanalysis later found the winds had been even stronger.\nOn September 27, the hurricane struck eastern North Carolina as a Category 2 storm. It then moved up the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, the storm struck western Long Island, with winds of 85\u00A0mph. One hour after striking Long Island, it hit near Westport, Connecticut.\nGloria moved northeast through Atlantic Canada.\nDamage from the storm was $900 million.\nThe death toll from the storm was fourteen.\nThe name \"Gloria\" was later retired and replaced with \"Grace\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":24},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":33},{"uri":"Long_Island","surface_form":"Long Island","offset":115},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":131},{"uri":"Hurricane_Donna","surface_form":"Hurricane Donna","offset":161},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":708},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"East Coast of the United States","offset":767},{"uri":"Westport%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Westport, Connecticut","offset":925},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":988}]}
