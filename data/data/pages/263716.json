{"id":263716,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfur_decafluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Disulfur decafluoride, also known as sulfur pentafluoride and sulfur(V) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is S2F10. It contains sulfur in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nDisulfur decafluoride is a colorless liquid. It has no odor. It is very toxic. It disproportionates to sulfur hexafluoride and sulfur tetrafluoride when heated. It reacts with sulfur dioxide. It also can react with chlorine, bromine, and ammonia. It is more toxic than phosgene.\nUses.\nIt was thought of as a poison gas in World War II, but it was never used. It has almost no uses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":99},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":161},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":178},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionates","offset":289},{"uri":"Sulfur_hexafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur hexafluoride","offset":310},{"uri":"Sulfur_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur tetrafluoride","offset":334},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":383},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":422},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":432},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":445},{"uri":"Phosgene","surface_form":"phosgene","offset":476},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":529}]}
