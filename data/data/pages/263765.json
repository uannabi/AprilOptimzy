{"id":263765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_tetrafluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Sulfur tetrafluoride, also known as sulfur(IV) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SF4. It contains sulfur in its +4 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nSulfur tetrafluoride is a colorless gas. It is toxic and corrosive. It releases hydrogen fluoride when exposed to water.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting sodium fluoride, chlorine, and sulfur dichloride. The chlorine does not have to be included. If no chlorine is used, other products form that need to be taken out.\nUses.\nSulfur tetrafluoride is used to make organic molecules containing fluoride ions. It is not used much.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":74},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":134},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":151},{"uri":"Corrosive","surface_form":"corrosive","offset":237},{"uri":"Hydrogen_fluoride","surface_form":"hydrogen fluoride","offset":260},{"uri":"Sodium_fluoride","surface_form":"sodium fluoride","offset":337},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":354},{"uri":"Sulfur_dichloride","surface_form":"sulfur dichloride","offset":368},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":544},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":573}]}
