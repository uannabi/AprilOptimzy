{"id":263767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dichloride","text":"=\"preserve\">Sulfur dichloride, also known as sulfur(II) chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SCl2. It contains sulfur in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains chloride ions.\nProperties.\nSulfur dichloride is a red liquid. It has a strong odor. It is a common sulfur chloride. It reacts with water to make hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide. When it is old, it might have some chlorine in it. It reacts with fluorides to make sulfur tetrafluoride.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting chlorine with sulfur. Disulfur dichloride is an intermediate. It is also a common impurity in sulfur dichloride.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":71},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":94},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":132},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":149},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":183},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":192},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":233},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":237},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"odor","offset":261},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":328},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":350},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":401},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":432},{"uri":"Sulfur_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur tetrafluoride","offset":450},{"uri":"Disulfur_dichloride","surface_form":"Disulfur dichloride","offset":530},{"uri":"Impurity","surface_form":"impurity","offset":590}]}
