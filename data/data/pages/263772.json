{"id":263772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfur_dichloride","text":"=\"preserve\">Disulfur dichloride, also known as sulfur(I) chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is S2Cl2. It contains sulfur in its +1 oxidation state. It contains chlorine in its -1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow or orange liquid. It smokes in air because it reacts with water. It releases sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and hydrochloric acid when reacted with water. It reacts with chlorine to make sulfur dichloride. It can dissolve sulfur.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting a little chlorine with sulfur. A lot of chlorine would make sulfur dichloride.\nUses.\nIt is used to place sulfur atoms some organic compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":72},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":134},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":151},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":180},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":199},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":320},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":328},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":348},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":406},{"uri":"Sulfur_dichloride","surface_form":"sulfur dichloride","offset":423},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":625}]}
