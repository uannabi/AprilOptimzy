{"id":263790,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrasulfur_tetranitride","text":"e=\"preserve\">Tetrasulfur tetranitride, also known as tetrasulphur tetranitride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is S4N4. It contains sulfur in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitride ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a gold solid. It is an explosive, releasing sulfur and nitrogen when detonated. The purer the substance is, the more easily it explodes. It is pale yellow when cold, orange at normal temperature, and red when hot. It reacts with bases. It can be split into disulfur dinitride when it is reacted with silver. It does not dissolve in water.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting disulfur dichloride with ammonia. It can also be made by reacting ammonium chloride with disulfur dichloride.\nUses.\nIt can be used to react with many organic compounds.\nSafety.\nIt is an explosive, so it should not be ground. Explosion releases harmless nitrogen and sulfur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":85},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":163},{"uri":"Nitride","surface_form":"nitride","offset":197},{"uri":"Detonation","surface_form":"detonated","offset":298},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":458},{"uri":"Disulfur_dinitride","surface_form":"disulfur dinitride","offset":486},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":529},{"uri":"Disulfur_dichloride","surface_form":"disulfur dichloride","offset":608},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":633},{"uri":"Ammonium_chloride","surface_form":"ammonium chloride","offset":674},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":758}]}
