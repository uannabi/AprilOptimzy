{"id":263803,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfur_dinitride","text":"=\"preserve\">Disulfur dinitride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is S2N2. It contains sulfur in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitride ions.\nProperties.\nDisulfur dinitride is a colorless crystalline solid. It is explosive, similar to tetrasulfur tetranitride. It easily evaporates. It does not dissolve in water. It turns back into tetrasulfur tetranitride when exposed to water.\nPreparation.\nDisulfur dinitride is produced by reacting elemental silver with tetrasulfur tetranitride. This forms silver(I) sulfide, which acts as a catalyst. This reaction happens in a vacuum.\nUses.\nIt reacts with some chemical compounds that are acids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":36},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":97},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":114},{"uri":"Nitride","surface_form":"nitride","offset":148},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":156},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":208},{"uri":"Tetrasulfur_tetranitride","surface_form":"tetrasulfur tetranitride","offset":255},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":467},{"uri":"Tetrasulfur_tetranitride","surface_form":"tetrasulfur tetranitride","offset":479},{"uri":"Silver(I)_sulfide","surface_form":"silver(I) sulfide","offset":516},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":551},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":588},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":650}]}
