{"id":263925,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver(I)_fluoride","text":"Silver(I) fluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AgF. It contains silver in its +1 oxidations state. It also contains fluoride ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow-brown solid. It can turn black when in moist air. It dissolves easily in water. It is an oxidizing agent because of the silver ion.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting silver(I) carbonate with hydrofluoric acid.\nUses.\nIt is used to add fluoride to organic compounds.\nSafety.\nSilver compounds can stain skin. They are also oxidizing agents and should be kept away from metal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":24},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":84},{"uri":"Oxidations_state","surface_form":"oxidations state","offset":101},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":136},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":145},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":267},{"uri":"Silver(I)_carbonate","surface_form":"silver(I) carbonate","offset":346},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":371},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":426}]}
