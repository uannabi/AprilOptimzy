{"id":263931,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_chloride","text":"Silver chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AgCl. It contains silver in its +1 oxidation state. It also contains chloride ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a white crystalline solid. It does not dissolve in water. When it is exposed to light, it turns back into silver and chlorine. It dissolves in several solutions, such as ammonia.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting a common chloride such as sodium chloride with silver nitrate.\nUses.\nIt is used in photographic film. It darkens when exposed to light, which makes a picture. It is also used in electrochemistry. It is used as a disinfectant in bandages. It is also used to make stained glass. It can be used when someone is poisoned with mercury.\nSafety.\nIt can irritate skin. It can also stain the skin. It is a weak oxidizing agent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":21},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":82},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":99},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":133},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":142},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":174},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":283},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":336},{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"sodium chloride","offset":411},{"uri":"Silver_nitrate","surface_form":"silver nitrate","offset":432},{"uri":"Photographic_film","surface_form":"photographic film","offset":468},{"uri":"Electrochemistry","surface_form":"electrochemistry","offset":563},{"uri":"Stained_glass","surface_form":"stained glass","offset":647},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":707}]}
