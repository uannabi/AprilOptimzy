{"id":263938,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_iodide","text":"Silver iodide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AgI. It contains silver in its +1 oxidation state. It also contains iodide ions.\nProperties.\nSilver iodide is a yellow solid. It does not dissolve in water. It turns dark when light is shined on it. The darkening is caused by a chemical reaction. The silver iodide turns into silver and iodine.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting an iodide such as sodium iodide with silver nitrate.\nUses.\nSilver iodide is sprinkled in clouds to make rain. It can also be used in photographic film.\nSafety.\nSilver iodide is toxic. It can stain skin. It is not as toxic as other silver compounds that dissolve in water. The iodide also is toxic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":19},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":79},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":96},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":130},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":137},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":349},{"uri":"Sodium_iodide","surface_form":"sodium iodide","offset":411},{"uri":"Silver_nitrate","surface_form":"silver nitrate","offset":430},{"uri":"Photographic_film","surface_form":"photographic film","offset":526}]}
