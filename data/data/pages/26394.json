{"id":26394,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo","text":"In a group, a taboo is something that the group thinks is bad and should not be done. Sometimes even talking about taboos is taboo. Some actions that are thought of as taboo may also be against the law. Breaking the taboo may be punished hard by those states. Breaking other taboos can result in feeling embarrassed, or ashamed. Breaking a taboo is sometimes seen as.\nOrigins of the word.\nThe English word is traced back to Tongan \"tapu\" or the Fijian \"tabu\". These words usually mean \"not allowed\", or \"forbidden\". In its current use in Tonga, the word \"tapu\" also means \"sacred\" or \"holy\", in the sense of being restricted or protected by custom or by law. For example, the main island in the Kingdom of Tonga, where the capital Nuku'alofa is located and most of the population resides, is called \"Tongatapu\".\nSome Solomon Islanders say that their languages have a word \"tabu\" (said like \"ta-boo\") that means holy. It refers to places in the bush where holy spirits live. Those areas should not be disturbed unless a ceremony or ritual is taking place. As taboo, they are places that should not be touched.\nExamples of taboos.\nSome taboos are because a religious, legal or social authority did something, over and over. Taboos can be talked about or joked about, outside \"polite society\". Comedy and satire such as \"South Park\", \"The Simpsons\" or \"Beavis and Butthead\" frequently do this.\nAnthropological approach.\nOne suggestion is that taboos are the result of history and certain cultural experiences (which is called \"Anthropolcial approach\"). Steven Pinker suggests that taboos have developed culturally from more basic instincts. For taboos regarding the dead, he proposes that the human brain may have developed a hard-wired repulsion to many carriers of disease \u2013 an \"intuitive microbiology\". Only with the modern development of scientific microbiology have humans been able to rationalize these taboos. Pinker suggests similar explanations for the incest taboo and other things that cause the reflex emotion of disgust.\nPsychoanalytical approach.\nThe other proposal is that taboos are the result of unconscious phenomena that are passed on (and this is called \"Psychoanalytical approach\"). Sigmund Freud provided an analysis of taboo behaviours. He highlighted strong subconscious motivations behind such prohibitions. In this system, described in his collection of essays \"Totem and Taboo\", Freud says there is a link between forbidden behaviours and the sanctification of objects to certain kinship groups. Freud also states that the only two \"universal\" taboos are that of incest and patricide, which formed the eventual basis of modern society.\nAnd so, \"Anyone who has violated a taboo becomes taboo himself because he possesses the dangerous quality of tempting others to follow his example.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"group","offset":5},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":198},{"uri":"Embarrassment","surface_form":"embarrassed","offset":304},{"uri":"Shame","surface_form":"ashamed","offset":320},{"uri":"Tongan_language","surface_form":"Tongan","offset":424},{"uri":"Tapu_(Polynesian_culture)","surface_form":"tapu","offset":432},{"uri":"Fiji","surface_form":"Fiji","offset":445},{"uri":"Solomon_Islands","surface_form":"Solomon Islanders","offset":817},{"uri":"Joke","surface_form":"joke","offset":1252},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"Comedy","offset":1291},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":1302},{"uri":"South_Park","surface_form":"South Park","offset":1318},{"uri":"The_Simpsons","surface_form":"The Simpsons","offset":1332},{"uri":"Beavis_and_Butthead","surface_form":"Beavis and Butthead","offset":1350},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":1465},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":1485},{"uri":"Steven_Pinker","surface_form":"Steven Pinker","offset":1550},{"uri":"Instinct","surface_form":"instinct","offset":1627},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"developed","offset":1711},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":1764},{"uri":"Microbiology","surface_form":"microbiology","offset":1788},{"uri":"Incest_taboo","surface_form":"incest taboo","offset":1959},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":2201},{"uri":"Incest","surface_form":"incest","offset":2587},{"uri":"Patricide","surface_form":"patricide","offset":2598}]}
