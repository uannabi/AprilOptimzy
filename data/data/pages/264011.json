{"id":264011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are some materials\u00A0which offer some resistance to the current flow; they are not good Electrical conductor<nowiki/>s or good Electrical insulator<nowiki/>s. They are resistive materials, for example graphite, iron, and certain synthetic materials.\nwhere formula_1 is resistance in ohms, formula_1 is voltage in volts, and formula_1 the current in amperes.\nThe ohm was named after Georg Ohm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electrical_resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":55},{"uri":"Electrical_conductor","surface_form":"Electrical conductor","offset":105},{"uri":"Electrical_insulator","surface_form":"Electrical insulator","offset":144},{"uri":"Electrical_resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":286},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"volt","offset":330},{"uri":"Ampere","surface_form":"ampere","offset":366},{"uri":"Georg_Ohm","surface_form":"Georg Ohm","offset":399}]}
