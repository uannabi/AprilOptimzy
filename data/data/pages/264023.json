{"id":264023,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark","text":"Quotation marks or inverted commas (informally known as quotes and speech marks) are punctuation marks used in pairs to mark a section of text as speech, a quotation, a phrase, or an unusual word. They are used in groups of 2, as a pair of opening and closing marks. They are used in either of two forms: or.\nDepending on the typeface, the opening and closing quotation marks may be identical in form (called \u201Cvertical\u201D or \u201Cstraight\u201D or \u201Ctypewriter\u201D quotation marks), or they may be distinctly left-handed and right-handed (\u201Ctypographic\u201D or, colloquially, \u201Ccurly\u201D quotation marks). The closing single quotation mark is identical or similar in form to the apostrophe, and similar to the prime symbol. However, these three characters have quite different purposes. See also: ditto mark.\nQuotations and speech.\nIf such a passage is further quoted in another publication, then all of their forms have to be shifted over by one level.\nAs noted below, in some older texts, the quotation mark is repeated every line, rather than every paragraph. The Spanish convention uses closing quotation marks at the beginning of all subsequent paragraphs beyond the first.\nIt is incorrect to use quotation marks for paraphrased speech. This is because a paraphrase is an indirect quote, and in the course of any composition, it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is using a paraphrased idea.\nHowever, another convention when quoting text in the body of a paragraph or sentence\u2014for example, in an essay\u2014is to recognize double quotation marks as marking an exact quotation, and single quotation marks as marking a paraphrased quotation or a quotation where grammar, pronouns, or plurality have been changed in order to fit the sentence containing the quotation (see reported speech).\nIrony.\nQuotes indicating irony, or other special use, are sometimes called scare quotes. They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes.\nSignaling unusual usage.\nQuotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realizes that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense.\nDawkins\u2019s concept of a meme could be described as an \u201Cevolving idea\u201D.\nThe \"Chicago Manual of Style\" (CMS), 15th edition acknowledges this type of use but cautions against overuse in section 7.58, \u201CQuotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard, ironic, or other special sense [\u2026] They imply \u2018This is not my term,\u2019 or \u2018This is not how the term is \"usually\" applied.\u2019 Like any such device, scare quotes lose their force and irritate readers if overused.\u201D\nUse\u2013mention distinction.\nUsing either quotation marks or italics can emphasize that an instance of a word refers to the word itself, rather than its associated concept.\nThe logic, for this form, derives from the need to distinguish use forms, coupled with the mandate to retain consistent notation for like use forms. The switching between double and single quotes in nested citation quotes reveals the same literary device for reducing ambiguity.\nTitles of artistic works.\nQuotation marks, rather than italics, are generally used for the titles of shorter works. Whether these are single or double is again a matter of style; however, many styles, especially for poetry, prefer the use of single quotation marks.\nAs a rule, a whole publication would be italicised, whereas the titles of minor works (such as poems or short stories inside the collection) would be written with quotation marks.\nNicknames and false titles.\nQuotation marks can also offset a nickname embedded in an actual name, or a false or ironic title embedded in an actual title; for example, Nat \u201CKing\u201D Cole, Miles \u201CTails\u201D Prower, or John \u201CHannibal\u201D Smith.\nEmphasis (incorrect usage).\nQuotes are sometimes used incorrectly for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics, most commonly on signs or placards. This usage can be confused with ironic or altered-usage quotation, sometimes with unintended humor. For example, \"For sale: \u201Cfresh\u201D fish, \u201Cfresh\u201D oysters\", could be construed to imply that \"fresh\" is not used with its everyday meaning, or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh. And again, \"Cashiers\u2019 desks open until noon for your \u201Cconvenience\u201D\" might mean that the convenience was for the bank employees, not the customers.\nPunctuation.\nWith quotation marks that are next to other punctuation marks, there are two main systems. They are called \u201CAmerican\u201D and \u201CBritish,\u201D but some American writers and organizations use the British style and vice versa. Both systems have the same rules for question marks, exclamation points, colons, and semicolons. They have different rules for periods and commas.\nIn both systems, question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside or outside quoted material depending on whether they are for the whole sentence or just the quoted words, but colons and semicolons always go outside.\nIn American style, commas and periods almost always go inside closing quotation marks.\nThis style of punctuation is common in the U.S., Canada, and it is also used in the U.K. in fiction and journalism.\nIn British style, which is sometimes called logical punctuation, the rule is the same as for question marks and exclamation points: the comma or period goes outside if it is for the whole sentence but inside if it is for just the quoted words. This is called \u201Cplacement according to sense.\u201D\nFor quoting direct speech, American rules place periods and commas inside the quotation marks all the time. In fiction, both styles are the same. In non-fiction, British publishers may permit placing punctuation that is not part of the person\u2019s speech inside the quotation marks but prefer that it be placed outside. According to the \"Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders\", periods and commas that \"are\" part of the person\u2019s speech are permitted inside the quotation marks regardless.\nReferences: \"Chicago Manual of Style\", 15th edition; \"Hart\u2019s Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University Press, Oxford\"; \"Merriam-Webster\u2019s Guide to Punctuation and Style\", second edition.\nSpacing.\nIn English, when a quotation follows other writing on a line of text, a space precedes the opening quotation mark unless the preceding symbol, such as a dash, requires that there be no space. When a quotation is followed by other writing on a line of text, a space follows the closing quotation mark unless it is immediately followed by other punctuation within the sentence, such as a colon or closing punctuation. (These exceptions are ignored by some Asian computer systems that systematically display quotation marks with the included spacing, as this spacing is part of the fixed-width characters.)\nThere is generally no space between an opening quotation mark and the following word, or a closing quotation mark and the preceding word. When a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark immediately follows the other, proper spacing for legibility requires that a non-breaking space be inserted.\nNon-language related usage.\nStraight quotation marks (or italicized straight quotation marks) are often used to approximate the prime and double prime. For example, when signifying feet and inches, arcminutes and arcseconds, or minutes and seconds, where the quotation mark symbolises the latter part of the pair. For instance, 5 feet and 6\u00A0inches is often written 5' 6\", and 40 degrees, 20 arcminutes and 50 arcseconds is written 40\u00B0 20' 50\". When available, however, the prime should be used instead (e.\u00A0g., 5\u2032 6\u2033, and 40\u00B0 20\u2032 50\u2033). Prime and double prime are not present in most character sets, including ASCII and Latin-1, but are present in Unicode, as characters U+2032 (dec. 8242) and U+2033 (dec. 8243), and as HTML entities &amp;prime; and &amp;Prime;. Double quotation marks are also often used to represent the ditto mark.\nStraight single and double quotation marks are used in most programming languages to delimit strings or literal characters. In some languages (e.\u00A0g. Pascal) only one type is allowed, in some (e.\u00A0g. C and its derivatives) both are used with different meanings and in others (e.\u00A0g. Python) both are used interchangeably. In some languages, if it is desired to include the same quotation marks used to delimit a string inside the string, the quotation marks are doubled. For example, to represent the string eat 'hot' dogs in Pascal one uses 'eat \"hot\" dogs'. Other languages use an escape character, often the backslash, as in 'eat \\'hot\\' dogs'.\nTyping quotation marks on a computer keyboard.\nStandard English computer keyboard layouts inherited the single and double \u201Cstraight\u201D quotation marks from the typewriter (the single quotation mark also doubling as an apostrophe), and they do not include individual keys for left-handed and right-handed typographic quotation marks. However, most computer text-editing programs provide a \u201Csmart quotes\u201D feature (see below) to automatically convert \u201Cstraight\u201D quote marks into typographic punctuation. Generally, this \u201Csmart quote\u201D feature is enabled by default. Some websites do not allow typographic quotation marks or apostrophes in posts (one such example being YouTube). One can skirt these limitations, however, by using the HTML character codes or entities.\nSmart quotes.\nTo make typographic quotation marks easier to enter, publishing software often automatically converts typewriter quotation marks (and apostrophes) to typographic form during text entry (with or without the user being aware of it). This is known as the \u201Csmart quotes\u201D feature. Quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as \u201Cdumb quotes\u201D. Some implementations incorrectly produce an opening single quotation mark in places where an apostrophe is required, for example, in abbreviated years like \"\u201908\" for \"2008\".\nHistory.\nIn the first centuries of typesetting, writers showed quoted speech by saying who was speaking. Some versions of the Bible still do it this way. During the Renaissance, writers showed quoted speech by using a typeface different from the main body text, like we use italics today. Long quotations were also set this way, at full size and full measure.\nQuotation marks were first cut in metal type during the middle of the sixteenth century, printers were using them a lot by the seventeenth. In some Baroque and Romantic-period books, quotation marks would be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation. When printers stopped doing this, they still kept the empty margin, which is where we get our modern practice of indenting before block quotation.\nIn Early Modern English, quotation marks were used only to denote pithy comments. Writers first began to use them for direct speech in 1714. By 1749, writers were using single quotation marks, or inverted commas, for direct speech.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":85},{"uri":"Quotation","surface_form":"quotation","offset":156},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"typeface","offset":326},{"uri":"Apostrophe","surface_form":"apostrophe","offset":655},{"uri":"Prime_(symbol)","surface_form":"prime","offset":686},{"uri":"Ditto_mark","surface_form":"ditto mark","offset":773},{"uri":"Publication","surface_form":"publication","offset":855},{"uri":"Paraphrase","surface_form":"paraphrase","offset":1198},{"uri":"Indirect_quote","surface_form":"indirect quote","offset":1253},{"uri":"Reported_speech","surface_form":"reported speech","offset":1782},{"uri":"Scare_quotes","surface_form":"scare quotes","offset":1875},{"uri":"Air_quotes","surface_form":"air quotes","offset":1938},{"uri":"Meme","surface_form":"meme","offset":2135},{"uri":"Chicago_Manual_of_Style","surface_form":"Chicago Manual of Style","offset":2187},{"uri":"Italics","surface_form":"italics","offset":2660},{"uri":"Mandate","surface_form":"mandate","offset":2863},{"uri":"Literary_device","surface_form":"literary device","offset":3011},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":3559},{"uri":"Ironic","surface_form":"ironic","offset":3610},{"uri":"Nat_King_Cole","surface_form":"Nat \u201CKing\u201D Cole","offset":3665},{"uri":"Miles_%26quot%3BTails%26quot%3B_Prower","surface_form":"Miles \u201CTails\u201D Prower","offset":3682},{"uri":"John_%26quot%3BHannibal%26quot%3B_Smith","surface_form":"John \u201CHannibal\u201D Smith","offset":3707},{"uri":"Emphasis","surface_form":"emphasis","offset":3800},{"uri":"Italics","surface_form":"italics","offset":3835},{"uri":"Placard","surface_form":"placard","offset":3870},{"uri":"Chicago_Manual_of_Style","surface_form":"Chicago Manual of Style","offset":5949},{"uri":"Hart%27s_Rules","surface_form":"Hart\u2019s Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University Press, Oxford","offset":5990},{"uri":"Dash","surface_form":"dash","offset":6295},{"uri":"Non-breaking_space","surface_form":"non-breaking space","offset":7017},{"uri":"Prime_(symbol)","surface_form":"prime","offset":7177},{"uri":"Foot_(length)","surface_form":"feet","offset":7230},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":7239},{"uri":"Arcminute","surface_form":"arcminute","offset":7247},{"uri":"Arcsecond","surface_form":"arcsecond","offset":7262},{"uri":"Minute","surface_form":"minute","offset":7277},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":7289},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":7695},{"uri":"HTML_entities","surface_form":"HTML entities","offset":7768},{"uri":"Ditto_mark","surface_form":"ditto mark","offset":7871},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":7943},{"uri":"String_(computer_science)","surface_form":"strings","offset":7976},{"uri":"Character_(computing)","surface_form":"characters","offset":7995},{"uri":"Pascal_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Pascal","offset":8032},{"uri":"C_(programming_language)","surface_form":"C","offset":8081},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":8163},{"uri":"Escape_character","surface_form":"escape character","offset":8463},{"uri":"Apostrophe","surface_form":"apostrophe","offset":8744},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":9191},{"uri":"Typographic","surface_form":"typographic","offset":9312},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishing","offset":9357},{"uri":"Typewriter","surface_form":"typewriter","offset":9406},{"uri":"Smart_quotes","surface_form":"smart quotes","offset":9557},{"uri":"Typesetting","surface_form":"typesetting","offset":9889},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":10019},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"typeface","offset":10072},{"uri":"Italic_type","surface_form":"italics","offset":10128},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":10362},{"uri":"Romantic_period","surface_form":"Romantic-period","offset":10374},{"uri":"Block_quotation","surface_form":"block quotation","offset":10613},{"uri":"Early_Modern_English","surface_form":"Early Modern English","offset":10633}]}
