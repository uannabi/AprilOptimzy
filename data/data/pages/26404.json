{"id":26404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number","text":"=\"preserve\">An even number is an integer that can be divided by two and remain an integer or has no remainder. Examples of even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8.\nAlso, all numbers which end in 2,4,6,8 and 0 are also even numbers.\nAn integer that is not an even number is an odd number. If an even number is divided by two, the result is another integer. On the other hand, an odd number, when divided by two, will result in a non-integer.\nSince even numbers are integers, negative numbers can be even.\nEven numbers when multiplied by any number always result in an even number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":33},{"uri":"Two","surface_form":"two","offset":64},{"uri":"Odd_number","surface_form":"odd number","offset":264},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":452},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative number","offset":462}]}
