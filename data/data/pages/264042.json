{"id":264042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Bob","text":"Hurricane Bob was an Atlantic tropical cyclone during August 1991. It was one of the costliest hurricanes in the history of New England.\nThe storm began from an area of low pressure near the Bahamas. The area steadily became stronger and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bob later on August 16.\nIt curved to the north-northwest at first. However, after the storm became a hurricane, it turned to the north-northeast on August 17.\nThe track of Hurricane Bob by August 18 and 19 was similar to 1954's Hurricane Carol, another storm that affected North Carolina and New England. Bob brushed eastern North Carolina on August 18 and early on the 19th.\nThe storm moved up the Mid Atlantic on August 19; it passed just east of Long Island. The storm then crossed Block Island, Rhode Island, and later hit near Newport that afternoon.\nWhile Bob affected Rhode Island, the strong winds moved westward into Connecticut. In that state, winds peaked near 75 mph.\nThe most damage happened in Massachusetts. Total damage there was $1 billion.\nThe storm weakened to a strong tropical storm; it then hit Maine with 70 mph winds and heavy rain.\nDamage from Bob totaled $1.5 billion. Eighteen people were killed as a result of the storm.\nThe name \"Bob\" was retired in the spring of 1992 and replaced with \"Bill\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":21},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":30},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":124},{"uri":"Low_pressure_area","surface_form":"an area of low pressure","offset":158},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":191},{"uri":"Hurricane_Carol","surface_form":"Hurricane Carol","offset":497},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":542},{"uri":"Mid-Atlantic_States","surface_form":"Mid Atlantic","offset":668},{"uri":"Long_Island","surface_form":"Long Island","offset":718},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":768},{"uri":"Newport%2C_Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Newport","offset":801},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":895},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":977},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":1086},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":1120}]}
