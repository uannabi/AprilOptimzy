It can also be a remark or question, often disparaging (also called insinuation), that works indirectly by allusion. In the latter sense, the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that the words as used, taken literally, seem to be innocent in the direct meaning (but have a negative unspoken meaning).\nAn innuendo is \"an oblique hint or remark\"; The word is often used to express disapproval.\nThe term sexual innuendo has a specific meaning, namely that of a \"risqu\u00E9\" \"double sens\" (double meaning) by playing on a possibly sexual meaning of an otherwise innocent statement.\nBullying.\nInnuendo is a tool of bullying.\nIn popular culture.\nMany TV shows\\movies aimed at little kids often use innuendoes as a way of attracting older people.
