{"id":26417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Your_Luck","text":"\"Press Your Luck\" was an American game show that aired from 1983 to 1986 and later in reruns, and was hosted by Peter Tomarken. The three contestants on each show would earn spins by answering questions that they could later use on The Big Board. On the board, they could earn thousands of dollars in cash and prizes, but had to beware of the Whammy, a cartoon demon who stole players' money and prizes. If a Whammy was hit, the contestant lost all earnings up to that point. Four Whammies took a player out of the game. The winner returned on the next show.\nThe show came back on the air in 2002 on Game Show Network as \"Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck\". It featured a new \"Big Bank\" feature, which gave the player a chance to earn all the money and prizes lost to the Whammy. It was hosted by Todd Newton and ran until 2003.\nThe original version of \"Press Your Luck\" was called \"Second Chance\", which aired on television in 1977. Instead of the Whammy, players had to face a cartoon \"Devil.\" It was hosted by Jim Peck, but did not last very long.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":25},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":34},{"uri":"Rerun","surface_form":"rerun","offset":86},{"uri":"Peter_Tomarken","surface_form":"Peter Tomarken","offset":112},{"uri":"Game_Show_Network","surface_form":"Game Show Network","offset":600},{"uri":"Whammy%21_The_All-New_Press_Your_Luck","surface_form":"Whammy!
