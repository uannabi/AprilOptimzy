{"id":264174,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem","text":"e=\"preserve\">In probability theory and applications, Bayes' theorem shows the relation between a conditional probability and its reverse form. For example, the probability of a hypothesis given some observed pieces of evidence, and the probability of that evidence given the hypothesis. This theorem is named after Thomas Bayes (or \"bays\") and is often called Bayes' law or Bayes' rule'\".\nFormula.\nIn many scenarios, P(\"B\") is calculated indirectly using the formula formula_1, which simply states that the probability of \"B\" is the sum of the conditional probabilities based on whether \"A\" has occurred or not.\nExample.\nA simple example is as follows: There is a 40% chance of rain on Sunday. If it rains on Sunday, there is a 10% chance of rain on Monday. If it did not rain on Sunday, then there is an 80% chance that it will rain on Monday.\n\"Raining on Sunday\" is event A, and \"Raining on Monday\" is event B.\nHowever, we were asked to calculate the probability that it rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, then this is where Bayes' theorem comes in. It allows us to calculate the probability of an earlier event, given the result of a later event.\nIn our case, \"Rain on Sunday\" is event A, and \"Rain on Monday\" is event B.\nIn other words, if it rained on Monday, then there is a 7.69% chance it rained on Sunday.\nIntuitive explanation.\nIn this regard, Bayes' theorem is just another way to write that equation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":16},{"uri":"Conditional_probability","surface_form":"conditional probability","offset":97},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":177},{"uri":"Thomas_Bayes","surface_form":"Thomas Bayes","offset":315}]}
