{"id":264183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Plain","text":"Salisbury Plain is in the central southern England covering. It largely lies within the county of Wiltshire, with a little in Hampshire.\nThe Plain is famous for its rich archaeology, including Avebury and Stonehenge, which are a joint World Heritage Site. The Plain is sparsely populated and is the largest remaining area of calcareous grassland in north-west Europe. The Plain also has arable land, and a few small areas of beech trees and coniferous woodland.\nOn the Plain is the British Army's largest training ground in England. It is suitable terrain for tank manoeuvres; buildings such as Imber are used for urban warfare training.\nBoundaries.\nThe boundaries of Salisbury Plain have never been defined, and there is some difference of opinion as to its exact area. The river valleys surrounding it, and other downs and plains beyond them loosely define its boundaries. To the north the scarp of the downs overlooks the Vale of Pewsey, and to the north west the Avon. The River Wylye runs along the south west, and the River Bourne runs to the east.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":43},{"uri":"Wiltshire","surface_form":"Wiltshire","offset":98},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":126},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeology","offset":170},{"uri":"Avebury","surface_form":"Avebury","offset":193},{"uri":"Stonehenge","surface_form":"Stonehenge","offset":205},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":235},{"uri":"Calcareous","surface_form":"calcareous","offset":325},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":336},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":360},{"uri":"Arable","surface_form":"arable","offset":387},{"uri":"Beech","surface_form":"beech trees","offset":425},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":441},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":452},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":482},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":548},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tank","offset":560},{"uri":"Manoeuvre","surface_form":"manoeuvre","offset":565},{"uri":"Imber","surface_form":"Imber","offset":595},{"uri":"Urban_warfare","surface_form":"urban warfare","offset":614},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"river valleys","offset":775},{"uri":"Downland","surface_form":"downs","offset":815},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":825},{"uri":"Escarpment","surface_form":"scarp","offset":892},{"uri":"Pewsey","surface_form":"Pewsey","offset":933},{"uri":"River_Avon","surface_form":"Avon","offset":967}]}
