{"id":26419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy","text":"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder. It happens when the nervous system does not work properly. People with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep during the daytime, even if they do not want to. Very often, they do not sleep well at night, and during the day they fall asleep uncontrollably. There are two different forms. The classical (more common) form is the one with muscle failure (called cataplexy). There is also a less common form without cataplexy.\nNarcolepsy affects the way the nerves work. It is not a mental illness, or caused by psychological problems. It is estimated that between 25 and 50 people, per 100,000 suffer from narcolepsy. Very few cases are reported.\nThe first description was given in 1877. Jean-Baptiste G\u00E9lineau, a military doctor, first used the name narcolepsy in 1880.\nIn certain countries, people diagnosed with narcolepsy may not drive a car.\nSymptoms.\nHallucinations, sleep paralysis, and automatic behaviour can also occur in people who are not narcoleptics. This usually happens when people are very tired, and have not slept for a long time.\nCauses.\nSome scientists think that narcolepsy is caused by a lack of hypocretin. Hypocretin is a chemical in the brain which wakes people up and regulates sleep. However, It is not yet known for sure what causes it. Quite a few sufferers also have another family member with the disease. This may point to the fact that some of the things that cause the disease may be passed from the parents to the children through genes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sleep_disorder","surface_form":"sleep disorder","offset":16},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":52},{"uri":"Cataplexy","surface_form":"cataplexy","offset":383},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":503},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychological problems","offset":532},{"uri":"Hypocretin","surface_form":"hypocretin","offset":1140},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":1168},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":1184},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":1488}]}
