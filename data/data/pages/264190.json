{"id":264190,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-skirt","text":"The mini-skirt, or miniskirt, is a skirt well above the knees, close to the buttocks. If the top and skirt are all-in-one, then it is a minidress. Microskirts are \"extremely\" brief, and usually worn only for publicity events.\nMini-skirts were invented by Mary Quant, who also invented, or promoted, hot pants. There is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first; some say Andr\u00E9 Courr\u00E8ges or John Bates. The short- and ever-shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion-minded young women: the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style. In Quant's case, she gave it the name. Mary Quant named the mini-skirt after her favorite make of car, the Mini. She loved the car so much, she had one designed especially for her.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skirt","surface_form":"skirt","offset":35},{"uri":"Buttock","surface_form":"buttock","offset":76},{"uri":"Mary_Quant","surface_form":"Mary Quant","offset":255},{"uri":"Hot_pants","surface_form":"hot pants","offset":299},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Courr%C3%A8ges","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Courr\u00E8ges","offset":380},{"uri":"John_Bates_(designer)","surface_form":"John Bates","offset":399},{"uri":"Mini","surface_form":"Mini","offset":666}]}
