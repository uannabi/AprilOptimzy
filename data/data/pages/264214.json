{"id":264214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix","text":"The Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race. The first event was held in 1964 at a race track on the Zeltweg Airfield. The track was deemed too dangerous. It was narrow and very bumpy. Spectators complained of poor viewing areas. The FIA removed the race from the F1 calendar until a better circuit was built.\nFrom 1970 until 1987, the event was held at the \u00D6sterreichring, near Zeltweg. In 1975, it was called the European Grand Prix. In 1987, the FIA decided that the circuit was too dangerous. The race was dropped for a decade.\nIn 1995 and 1996, the track was modified and brought up to modern standards. The race returned to F1 in 1997. The circuit was renamed the A1-Ring, after a sponsor. Most of the new track is in Spielberg. Spielberg was now used as the location of the Grand Prix. The final Austrian Grand Prix was held in 2003. The Grand Prix returned to the Formula One calendar in 2014.\nRepeat winners (drivers).\n\"Drivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (constructors).\n\"Teams in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (engine manufacturers).\n\"Manufacturers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nYear by year.\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":30},{"uri":"Auto_racing","surface_form":"motor race","offset":42},{"uri":"Race_track","surface_form":"race track","offset":92},{"uri":"Zeltweg_Airfield","surface_form":"Zeltweg Airfield","offset":110},{"uri":"FIA","surface_form":"FIA","offset":243},{"uri":"%C3%96sterreichring","surface_form":"\u00D6sterreichring","offset":367},{"uri":"European_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"European Grand Prix","offset":424},{"uri":"A1-Ring","surface_form":"A1-Ring","offset":679},{"uri":"Spielberg%2C_Austria","surface_form":"Spielberg","offset":733}]}
