{"id":264230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg_Grand_Prix","text":"The Luxembourg Grand Prix () was a Formula One motor race for two years in the 1990s. The FIA created the Luxembourg GP to keep a race at N\u00FCrburgring, and allow the European GP to be held in another country.\nThe FIA only allowed one Formula One per country. They would allow a second race within a country if it had a different Grand Prix name. For several years, the German Grand Prix had been held at Hockenheimring, and the European Grand Prix at N\u00FCrburgring. There was unease that the N\u00FCrburgring was being given a monopoly for the European GP. The border of Luxembourg lies about 50 miles away from the N\u00FCrburgring track.\nWinners of the Luxembourg Grand Prix.\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":35},{"uri":"Auto_racing","surface_form":"motor race","offset":47},{"uri":"FIA","surface_form":"FIA","offset":212},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":233},{"uri":"German_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"German Grand Prix","offset":368},{"uri":"Hockenheimring","surface_form":"Hockenheimring","offset":403},{"uri":"European_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"European Grand Prix","offset":427},{"uri":"N%C3%BCrburgring","surface_form":"N\u00FCrburgring","offset":450},{"uri":"Monopoly","surface_form":"monopoly","offset":519}]}
