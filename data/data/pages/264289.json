{"id":264289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Grand_Prix","text":"The Detroit Grand Prix is a car racing event held in Detroit, Michigan, USA. From 1982 to 1988 it was a part of the Formula One series. It has been a part of the IndyCar Series since 1988.\nIn 1982, the U.S. became the first country to host three World Championship Grands Prix in one season. As of 2010, it is the only one to do so. In addition to the US GP West and Caesars Palace GP races, the new event was held on another street course, in the Renaissance Center of Detroit.\nThe original circuit had seventeen corners in 2.493 miles, and included a tunnel and a railroad track crossing. For 1989, it was planned to move the Grand Prix to a new circuit at Belle Isle. However, an agreement could not be reached, and the Grand Prix moved to Phoenix in 1989. Upon the departure of F1, the Detroit race was replaced by an event sanctioned by CART, which was held on the same track except the 18th turn, a chicane, was removed. In 1992, the race was moved to Belle Isle, an island in the Detroit River. Since then, the race has been held at Belle Isle. It was canceled after the 2001 race before being held in 2007 and 2008. The race returned for 2012 and has been on the IndyCar series schedule since.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Detroit%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Detroit, Michigan","offset":53},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":72},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":116},{"uri":"IndyCar_Series","surface_form":"IndyCar Series","offset":162},{"uri":"United_States_Grand_Prix_West","surface_form":"US GP West","offset":352},{"uri":"Caesars_Palace_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Caesars Palace GP","offset":367},{"uri":"Belle_Isle_(Michigan)","surface_form":"Belle Isle","offset":659},{"uri":"Phoenix%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Phoenix","offset":743},{"uri":"Champ_Car","surface_form":"CART","offset":842}]}
