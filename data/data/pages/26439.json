{"id":26439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri","text":"Alpha Centauri is the brightest star in the southern Centaurus constellation. It is the fourth brightest star in the night sky, with a magnitude of -0.01. It is visible in the Southern Hemisphere, and is too far south for most of the Northern Hemisphere to see.\nAlpha Centauri is a binary star system of two stars A & B. The distance between them is quite close. To the naked eye, the stars are too close for the eye to be able to see them as separate. Their orbit is about the distance of the giant planets from our Sun.\nThere is a third star, Proxima Centauri (or Alpha Centauri C). This is usually considered separately, but in fact it is also gravitationally connected to the other two. It is actually slightly closer to us, with a very much larger orbit around A and B.\nSystem.\nViewed as a triple star system, Alpha Centauri is the closest to our own, being 4.2-4.4 light years (ly) away. It consists of two main stars, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B (which form a binary star together) at a distance of 4.36 ly, and a dimmer red dwarf named Proxima Centauri at a distance of 4.22 ly. Both of the two main stars are rather similar to the Sun. The larger star, Alpha Centauri A, is the most similar to the Sun, but a little larger and brighter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":32},{"uri":"Centaurus","surface_form":"Centaurus","offset":53},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":63},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"magnitude","offset":135},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":176},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":234},{"uri":"Naked_eye","surface_form":"naked eye","offset":370},{"uri":"Proxima_Centauri","surface_form":"Proxima Centauri","offset":545},{"uri":"Gravitation","surface_form":"gravitation","offset":647},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light year","offset":871},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":977},{"uri":"Red_dwarf","surface_form":"red dwarf","offset":1038},{"uri":"Proxima_Centauri","surface_form":"Proxima Centauri","offset":1054},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":1150}]}
