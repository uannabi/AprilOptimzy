{"id":26444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV","text":"The TGV (Train \u00E0 Grande Vitesse, French for \"high-speed train\"), is a category of high speed trains. They are used in France. They are also used for some travel between France and England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. The trains normally travel at speeds between 270 km/h and 320 km/h. They are the fastest normal trains in the world, their average travel speed is at 279,4 km/h.\nIn 2007, a special TGV set the speed record for rail vehicles, reaching 574,8 km/h.\nInside France, there are the following high speed lines\nLines to Spain and Italy are being planned. A High speed line to Germany is being built.\nThe building of the network has made travel times much shorter. Paris to Marseille (750km) can now be done in 3 hours. Two thirds of the traffic volume is done by the TGV, only one third is done by airplanes.\nTGVs for other uses.\nSince the beginning of the high-speed rail network, the French Poste uses TGVs to transport mail, mostly between Paris, M\u00E2con and Cavaillon.But the train was retired in 2015. These use the high-speed lines (LGV Sud-Est) during the night.\nIn the north of France, the high-speed lines are also used to run regional trains over longer distances. There are currently train from Lille to Dunkerque. This takes half an hour. Other lines run to Calais, in forty minutes, or to Boulogne-sur-Mer in 55. In 2007, a line to Arras was opened, which is also very successful. Unfortunately, there are some problems with this approach. First, only high-speed lines can be used that are not saturated, because these trains run slower than regular TGVs. Secondly, using a TGV line costs more to the client, they have to pay extra. This makes these services more expensive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"trains","offset":93},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":118},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":154},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":180},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":189},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":202},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":215},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":224},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":237},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":247},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":565},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":575},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":621},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":843},{"uri":"La_Poste_(France)","surface_form":"Poste","offset":938},{"uri":"Mail","surface_form":"mail","offset":967},{"uri":"M%C3%A2con","surface_form":"M\u00E2con","offset":995},{"uri":"Cavaillon","surface_form":"Cavaillon","offset":1005},{"uri":"Lille","surface_form":"Lille","offset":1249},{"uri":"Dunkerque","surface_form":"Dunkerque","offset":1258},{"uri":"Calais","surface_form":"Calais","offset":1313},{"uri":"Boulogne-sur-Mer","surface_form":"Boulogne-sur-Mer","offset":1345},{"uri":"Arras","surface_form":"Arras","offset":1388}]}
