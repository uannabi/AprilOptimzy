{"id":264487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_chloride","text":"Copper(II) chloride, also known as cupric chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuCl2. It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains chloride ions.\nProperties.\nCopper(II) chloride is light brown when anhydrous. It is green when hydrated. It is a weak oxidizing agent. It reacts with aluminium foil to make hydrogen, copper(I) oxide, and aluminium chloride. This is used in school demonstrations. It releases chlorine and turns into copper(I) chloride when heated very hot. It reacts with sodium hydroxide to make copper(II) hydroxide. Copper(II) chloride reacts with metals to make metal chlorides and copper. It puts out blue flames if it is heated in a flame. It reacts with sulfur dioxide to make copper(I) chloride. It dissolves in water to make a blue solution. When more chloride is added, it turns green, then yellow.\nPreparation.\nCu + H2O2 \u2192 CuO + H2O\nCuO + 2HCl \u2192 CuCl2 + H2O\nUses.\nCopper(II) chloride is used to make fungicides. It is also used to make organic compounds. It is also used to make acetaldehyde from ethane.\nSafety.\nIt is toxic, with toxicity similar to copper sulfate It is therefore harmful.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":57},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":119},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":136},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":170},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":179},{"uri":"Anhydrous","surface_form":"anhydrous","offset":237},{"uri":"Hydrated","surface_form":"hydrated","offset":265},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":288},{"uri":"Aluminium_foil","surface_form":"aluminium foil","offset":320},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":343},{"uri":"Copper(I)_oxide","surface_form":"copper(I) oxide","offset":353},{"uri":"Aluminium_chloride","surface_form":"aluminium chloride","offset":374},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":445},{"uri":"Copper(I)_chloride","surface_form":"copper(I) chloride","offset":469},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":525},{"uri":"Copper(II)_hydroxide","surface_form":"copper(II) hydroxide","offset":550},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":714},{"uri":"Fungicide","surface_form":"fungicide","offset":964},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":1000},{"uri":"Acetaldehyde","surface_form":"acetaldehyde","offset":1043},{"uri":"Ethene","surface_form":"ethane","offset":1061},{"uri":"Copper_sulfate","surface_form":"copper sulfate","offset":1115}]}
