He was a statistician, professor, author, lecturer, and consultant. He is perhaps best known for his work in Japan. Starting in 1950, he taught top Japanese business managers how to improve design, product quality, testing and sales. He taught the importance of using Statistical Process Control (SPC), to manage quality by measuring, or counting, many steps of complex manufacturing and services, in order to reduce the variation in results. This should reduce defects and errors. Deming described periodic monitoring, by repeating the steps of Plan-Do-Check-Act, known as the Deming Cycle.\nEducation.\nhe went to triton central highschool. He entered the University of Wyoming at Laramie in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He earned a BSc in electrical engineering. He then went to graduate school. In 1925, he received an M.S. from the University of Colorado. In 1928, he received a Ph.D. from Yale University. Both graduate degrees were in mathematics and mathematical physics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":69},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":78},{"uri":"Statistician","surface_form":"statistician","offset":147},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":161},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":172},{"uri":"Lecturer","surface_form":"lecturer","offset":180},{"uri":"Consultant","surface_form":"consultant","offset":194},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":247},{"uri":"Statistical_Process_Control","surface_form":"Statistical Process Control","offset":406},{"uri":"Variation","surface_form":"variation","offset":559},{"uri":"Monitoring","surface_form":"monitoring","offset":646},{"uri":"University_of_Wyoming","surface_form":"University of Wyoming","offset":794},{"uri":"Electrical_engineering","surface_form":"electrical engineering","offset":877},{"uri":"University_of_Colorado","surface_form":"University of Colorado","offset":972},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":1019},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":1030}]}
