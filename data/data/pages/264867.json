{"id":264867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician","text":"e=\"preserve\">A statistician is someone who works with theoretical or applied statistics. The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. The core of that work is to measure, interpret, and describe some events in the world and spot patterns within them. The field shares much common history with social science, but often with a greater view on complex mathematical methods. Statisticians commonly have higher college degrees or other credentials as proof that they are qualified for the job.\nIt is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects. The applications are varied. Statisticians apply their knowledge to production, research, finance, medicine, insurance, census-taking, government, etc. They often are employed to support managerial decisions or to supervise quality control in manufacturing.\nNature of the work.\nAccording to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2008, there were 22,600 jobs listed as \"statistician\" in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30% worked for governments (federal, state, or local). Additionally, there are substantial numbers of persons who use statistics in their work but have job titles other than \"statistician\". The job of statistician is considered a profession. Most statisticians work in offices and have regular working hours and can therefore be considered to be white-collar workers. A lower number of statisticians are self-employed as statistical consultants.\nMost employment as a statistician requires a minimum of a masters degree in statistics or a related field. Many professional statisticians have a PhD.\nHistory.\nCivilizations have used the work of statisticians for thousands of years. Statistics was employed in ancient Egypt in censuses of population and cattle. Typical work might involve developing a model and sampling plans, analyzing survey results, or making agricultural or econometric forecasts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":54},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":77},{"uri":"Public_sector","surface_form":"public sector","offset":135},{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measure","offset":179},{"uri":"Social_science","surface_form":"social science","offset":310},{"uri":"Mathematical","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":367},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":686},{"uri":"Insurance","surface_form":"insurance","offset":696},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":707},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":722},{"uri":"Quality_control","surface_form":"quality control","offset":811},{"uri":"Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","surface_form":"Bureau of Labor Statistics","offset":896},{"uri":"Profession","surface_form":"profession","offset":1267},{"uri":"White-collar_worker","surface_form":"white-collar worker","offset":1383},{"uri":"Consultant","surface_form":"consultant","offset":1470},{"uri":"Masters_degree","surface_form":"masters degree","offset":1541},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":1629},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"ancient Egypt","offset":1744},{"uri":"Sampling_(statistics)","surface_form":"sampling","offset":1846},{"uri":"Econometric","surface_form":"econometric","offset":1914}]}
