{"id":264912,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks","text":"Alvin and the Chipmunks is an American animated music group. It was created by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. in 1958. The group is made up of three animated chipmunks who sing and talk. They are Alvin, Simon and Theodore. The trio is managed by a fictional man named Dave Seville, who adopted the chipmunks. In reality, \"David Seville\" was Bagdasarian's stage name, and the chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label. The characters became a success, and were recreated in animated cartoons and eventually movies.\nThe voices of the group were all done by Bagdasarian. He recorded his voice and then sped up the playback to create high-pitched voices. It was so unusual and well-done that it earned the record two Grammy Awards for musical engineering. Bagdasarian, performing as the Chipmunks, released a long series of albums and singles. Bagdasarian died in 1972. The characters were revived in the 1980s and 1990s, with the voices being performed by Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and his wife Janice Karman.\nA computer-animated movie based on the characters was released in 2007, called \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\". It had three sequels: one in 2009, one in 2011 and one in 2015. The actors Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney performed the talking voices of the Chipmunks. Bagdasarian, Jr. and Karman performed the singing voices for Alvin, Theodore and the Chipettes, but Steve Vining does Simon's singing voice. The project has earned five Grammy Awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award, and three Kids' Choice Awards, and has been nominated for three Emmy awards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":39},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"music group","offset":48},{"uri":"Ross_Bagdasarian%2C_Sr.","surface_form":"Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.","offset":79},{"uri":"Chipmunk","surface_form":"chipmunk","offset":149},{"uri":"Anthropomorphism","surface_form":"sing and talk","offset":163},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adopted","offset":277},{"uri":"Stage_name","surface_form":"stage name","offset":346},{"uri":"Executive_producer","surface_form":"executives","offset":407},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":436},{"uri":"Animated_cartoon","surface_form":"animated cartoon","offset":505},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":538},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":745},{"uri":"Audio_engineering","surface_form":"musical engineering","offset":763},{"uri":"Ross_Bagdasarian%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.","offset":985},{"uri":"Janice_Karman","surface_form":"Janice Karman","offset":1020},{"uri":"Computer_animation","surface_form":"computer-animated","offset":1037},{"uri":"Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks_(movie)","surface_form":"Alvin and the Chipmunks","offset":1115},{"uri":"The_Squeakquel","surface_form":"one in 2009","offset":1163},{"uri":"Chipwrecked","surface_form":"one in 2011","offset":1176},{"uri":"The_Road_Chip","surface_form":"one in 2015","offset":1192},{"uri":"Justin_Long","surface_form":"Justin Long","offset":1216},{"uri":"Matthew_Gray_Gubler","surface_form":"Matthew Gray Gubler","offset":1229},{"uri":"Jesse_McCartney","surface_form":"Jesse McCartney","offset":1253},{"uri":"Steve_Vining","surface_form":"Steve Vining","offset":1416},{"uri":"American_Music_Award","surface_form":"American Music Award","offset":1503},{"uri":"Golden_Reel_Award","surface_form":"Golden Reel Award","offset":1527},{"uri":"Kids%27_Choice_Award","surface_form":"Kids' Choice Award","offset":1556},{"uri":"Emmy","surface_form":"Emmy","offset":1610}]}
