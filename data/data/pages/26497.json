{"id":26497,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_number","text":"=\"preserve\">An odd number is an integer when divided by two, either leaves a remainder or the result is a fraction. One is the first odd positive number but it does not leave a remainder 1. Some examples of odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.\nAn integer that is not an odd number is an even number.\nIf an even number is divided by two, the result is another integer.\nOn the other hand, an odd number, when divided by two, will result in a fraction.\nSince odd numbers are integers, negative numbers can be odd.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":32},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":77},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":106},{"uri":"One","surface_form":"One","offset":116},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive number","offset":137},{"uri":"Even_number","surface_form":"even number","offset":289},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":474},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative number","offset":484}]}
