{"id":265091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-Schmidt_process","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Gram-Schmidt process is a way of converting one set of vectors that forms a basis into another, more friendly one.\nSuppose we have a set of vectors formula_1 that form a basis for formula_1, and that we wish to convert these into a friendly basis. We begin by finding out which component of a vector is being unfriendly to a second vector, which we may do with inner products. If we have two vectors formula_1, then we may find the component of formula_1 being unfriendly to formula_1 with formula_1. By subtracting this from formula_1, we get the component friendly to formula_1. By returning to our abstract set formula_1, we may make use of this observation to construct a general algorithm to convert an arbitrary basis into a friendly basis. Like from our original set, each time we use the process on a new vector, it is guaranteed to be mutually friendly with all the previous vectors.\nformula_1 = formula_1\nformula_1 = formula_1\nformula_1\nShould we wish to make this a friendly and cute basis, we can simply make each new element of the basis cute, by replacing both formula_1 with formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":72},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":701},{"uri":"Arbitrary","surface_form":"arbitrary","offset":725}]}
