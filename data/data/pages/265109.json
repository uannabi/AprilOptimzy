{"id":265109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_insurance","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Umbrella insurance\" protects all items of economic value and future income. It is also known as a type of liability insurance. A liability is a legal debt or obligation. The umbrella refers to how the policy shields insured assets. It covers damages caused by you and your dependents. People who have large sums of money usually have this type of insurance because they have high premiums. Premiums are the total cost of the policy. It guarantees you higher liability limits. It provides additional limits of coverage if you are at risk of being sued.\nThe umbrella policy is there to fill the gaps in other insurance policies. Where one policy does not cover, the umbrella policy picks up where it doesn\u2019t cover. The umbrella policy covers all insurances such as house, car, etc. The umbrella policy covers in increments of 1,000,000 dollars. So if you had car insurance that only covered 200,000 dollars, the coverage would then be 1,200,000 dollars. The same goes for home owners insurance, if you had 500,000 dollars in coverage the total coverage would become 1,500,000 dollars in coverage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liability_insurance","surface_form":"liability insurance","offset":120}]}
