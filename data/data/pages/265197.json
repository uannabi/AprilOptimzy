{"id":265197,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel(II)_chloride","text":"Nickel(II) chloride, also known as nickelous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NiCl2. It contains nickel in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains chloride ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow-green solid. It dissolves in water. It normally is attached to water molecules (hydrated). It reacts with ammonia to make a purple solution. It also reacts with hydrochloric acid to make a yellow solution. It reacts with bases to make nickel(II) hydroxide. Solutions of nickel(II) chloride have a pH of 4.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving nickel metal in hydrochloric acid. It also can be made by reacting nickel(II) oxide, nickel(II) carbonate, or nickel(II) hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.\nUses.\nIt is used to electroplate nickel metal on metal objects. It is also used as a catalyst.\nSafety.\nNickel(II) chloride irritates skin and eyes. It can also cause cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":60},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":122},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":139},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":173},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":182},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":321},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":376},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":436},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_hydroxide","surface_form":"nickel(II) hydroxide","offset":450},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":512},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_oxide","surface_form":"nickel(II) oxide","offset":626},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_carbonate","surface_form":"nickel(II) carbonate","offset":644},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplate","offset":734},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":799},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":880}]}
