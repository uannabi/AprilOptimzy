It contains nickel in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains hydroxide ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a light green solid. It does not dissolve in water. It dissolves in acids to make other nickel(II) salts.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting a base containing hydroxide ions with a nickel(II) salt, such as nickel(II) chloride.\nUses.\nNickel(II) hydroxide is used in the nickel cadmium battery and the nickel-metal hydride battery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":62},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":126},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":143},{"uri":"Hydroxide","surface_form":"hydroxide","offset":177},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":187},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":310},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":355},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_chloride","surface_form":"nickel(II) chloride","offset":418},{"uri":"Nickel_cadmium_battery","surface_form":"nickel cadmium battery","offset":481},{"uri":"Nickel-metal_hydride_battery","surface_form":"nickel-metal hydride battery","offset":512}]}
