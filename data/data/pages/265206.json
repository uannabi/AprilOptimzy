{"id":265206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel(II)_carbonate","text":"Nickel(II) carbonate, also known as nickelous carbonate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NiCO3. It contains nickel in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains carbonate ions.\nProperties.\nNickel(II) carbonate is a pale green solid. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with acids to make carbon dioxide. It turns into carbon dioxide and nickel(II) oxide when heated.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting sodium carbonate with nickel(II) chloride or nickel(II) sulfate.\nUses.\nIt is used in pigments and catalysts that have nickel in them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":62},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":124},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":141},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":175},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":185},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":293},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":307},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_oxide","surface_form":"nickel(II) oxide","offset":356},{"uri":"Sodium_carbonate","surface_form":"sodium carbonate","offset":422},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_chloride","surface_form":"nickel(II) chloride","offset":444},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_sulfate","surface_form":"nickel(II) sulfate","offset":467},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":507},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":520}]}
