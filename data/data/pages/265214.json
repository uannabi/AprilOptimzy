{"id":265214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel(II)_sulfate","text":"Nickel(II) sulfate, also known as nickelous sulfate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NiSO4. It contains nickel in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains sulfate ions.\nProperties.\nNickel(II) sulfate is a bluish solid. It dissolves in water. It is normally attached to some water molecules (hydrated). When it is anhydrous (not attached to water molecules), it is yellow. It reacts with bases to make nickel(II) hydroxide.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving nickel(II) oxide or nickel metal in sulfuric acid.\nUses.\nNickel(II) sulfate is used to make other nickel compounds. It is also used in the electroplating of nickel on metal objects. It is used in the lab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":58},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":120},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":137},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":171},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":179},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":403},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_hydroxide","surface_form":"nickel(II) hydroxide","offset":417},{"uri":"Nickel(II)_oxide","surface_form":"nickel(II) oxide","offset":477},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":513},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":616}]}
