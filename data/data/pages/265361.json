{"id":265361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_eagle","text":"The harpy eagle (\"Harpia harpyja\") is one of the largest eagles and most powerful birds of prey in the world. It is a magnificent meat-eater that lives in Central and South American rainforests. It is colored black and white.\nThis large eagle makes whistling and clicking calls. It is an endangered species because of the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat through logging, and also because of hunting.\nThe harpy eagle mostly eats large mammals, including monkeys and sloths. It eats howler monkeys, pygmy sloths, capybaras (the largest rodent in the world), foxes, capuchin monkeys, and some birds. Its talons reach to 5 inches, more than 2 times the length of a grizzly bear's claw.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":57},{"uri":"Bird_of_prey","surface_form":"birds","offset":82},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central","offset":155},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":167},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":182},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":237},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":447},{"uri":"Howler_monkey","surface_form":"howler monkey","offset":494},{"uri":"Pygmy_sloth","surface_form":"pygmy sloth","offset":510},{"uri":"Capybara","surface_form":"capybara","offset":524},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":569},{"uri":"Capuchin_monkey","surface_form":"capuchin monkey","offset":576},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":603},{"uri":"Grizzly_bear","surface_form":"grizzly bear","offset":674}]}
