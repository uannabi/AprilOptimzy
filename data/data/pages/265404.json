{"id":265404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_nitrate","text":"Iron(III) nitrate, also known as ferric nitrate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Fe(NO3)3. It contains iron in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitrate ions.\nProperties.\nIron(III) nitrate is a light purple solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It is acidic. It absorbs water easily to make a hydrate (chemical with water molecules attached to it).\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting iron or iron(III) oxide with nitric acid. The reaction of iron with nitric acid makes nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is a brown and toxic gas.\nUses.\nIt is used to etch silver alloys. It is also used to make sodium amide. It acts as a catalyst in this reaction.\nIt can be mixed with clay to make an oxidant clay. This oxidant clay can be used to make organic molecules.\nSafety.\nIron(III) nitrate is oxidizing, so it can catch things on fire. It is also corrosive to metal and can burn skin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":54},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":119},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":134},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":168},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":176},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":276},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":299},{"uri":"Iron(III)_oxide","surface_form":"iron(III) oxide","offset":441},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":462},{"uri":"Nitrogen_dioxide","surface_form":"nitrogen dioxide","offset":519},{"uri":"Etch","surface_form":"etch","offset":600},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":605},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":612},{"uri":"Sodium_amide","surface_form":"sodium amide","offset":644},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":671},{"uri":"Oxidant","surface_form":"oxidant","offset":735},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":787},{"uri":"Combustion","surface_form":"catch things on fire","offset":856}]}
