It was given a full blessing from Sultan Mohammed V. It was built in only six weeks. The site hosted an non-championship F1 race in 1957. On 19 October 1958 the course was the venue for the Moroccan Grand Prix, the final round in the Formula One season. It was won by Stirling Moss driving a Vanwall, completing the 53 laps in 2h 09m 15.1s.\nThere was a terrible accident during the race. The engine on the Vanwall of Stuart Lewis-Evans seized up. The car spun and crashed. He was severely burned, and died in a hospital in England six days later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":27},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":92},{"uri":"Casablanca","surface_form":"Casablanca","offset":154},{"uri":"Mohammed_V_of_Morocco","surface_form":"Sultan Mohammed V","offset":297},{"uri":"Moroccan_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Moroccan Grand Prix","offset":453},{"uri":"Stirling_Moss","surface_form":"Stirling Moss","offset":531},{"uri":"Vanwall","surface_form":"Vanwall","offset":555},{"uri":"Stuart_Lewis-Evans","surface_form":"Stuart Lewis-Evans","offset":680}]}
