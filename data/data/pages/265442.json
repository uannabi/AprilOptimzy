{"id":265442,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP2_Series","text":"The GP2 Series, GP2 for short, is a form of open wheel motor racing. GP2 was started in 2005 after the Formula 3000 was stopped. The format was conceived by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, while Ecclestone also has the rights to the name GP1. In 2010 the GP3 Series class was launched, as a feeder class for the GP2 series.\nGP2 was designed to be an affordable racing series and a training series for Formula One. GP2 requires all of the teams to use the same chassis, engine and tyre supplier. Almost all races have taken place as support races on Formula One race weekends. Many drivers have used GP2 as a stepping stone into Formula One.\nGP2 Series cars.\nThe GP2 Series car is used by all of the teams, and features a Dallara chassis powered by a V8 Renault engine and Bridgestone tyres.\nThe 4\u00A0L Renault V8 engine features design and software upgrades designed to improve performance and fuel consumption. The engine produces about 620 bhp (432.5\u00A0kW). GP2 Series engines are rev-limited to 10,000 rpm.\nBridgestone supplying three slick tyre compounds for racing on dry (soft, medium and hard). They also provide a wet weather tyre. The choice of tyre to be raced is made by the Bridgestone and the GP2 Series organizers prior to each event.\nRace weekend.\nOn Friday, drivers have a 30-minute practice session and a 30-minute qualifying session. The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturday's race which has a length of 180\u00A0kilometers.\nDuring Saturday's race, each driver has to make a pit stop in which at least two tyres have to be changed.\nOn Sunday there is a sprint race of 120\u00A0km. The grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place.\nPoint system.\nWith this points system, the most number of points anyone can score in one round is 20 by claiming pole position, winning both races with the fastest lap in each race. This has only been achieved twice in GP2 Racing's short history. By Brazilian Nelson Piquet, Jr. in the 9th round of the 2006 season in Hungary and by German Nico H\u00FClkenberg in the 5th round of the 2009 season in Germany.\nDrivers graduated to F1.\nDrivers are listed by their last year in GP2 Series. Usually they started in F1 at the start of the following season.\nNote: Timo Glock had four Grand Prix starts in 2004, drove in GP2 Series in 2006-07 before moving to F1 in 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["motorsport championship"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Open_wheel_car","surface_form":"open wheel","offset":44},{"uri":"International_Formula_3000","surface_form":"Formula 3000","offset":103},{"uri":"Bernie_Ecclestone","surface_form":"Bernie Ecclestone","offset":157},{"uri":"Flavio_Briatore","surface_form":"Flavio Briatore","offset":179},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":408},{"uri":"Dallara","surface_form":"Dallara","offset":728},{"uri":"Bridgestone","surface_form":"Bridgestone","offset":779},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"L","offset":804},{"uri":"Renault","surface_form":"Renault","offset":806},{"uri":"V8_engine","surface_form":"V8 engine","offset":814},{"uri":"Bridgestone","surface_form":"Bridgestone","offset":1012},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":2044},{"uri":"Nelson_Piquet%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Nelson Piquet, Jr.","offset":2054},{"uri":"Hungaroring","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":2112},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":2127},{"uri":"Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg","surface_form":"Nico H\u00FClkenberg","offset":2134},{"uri":"N%C3%BCrburgring","surface_form":"Germany","offset":2189},{"uri":"Timo_Glock","surface_form":"Timo Glock","offset":2347}]}
