{"id":265524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_hydroxide","text":"Zinc hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Zn(OH)2. It contains zinc and hydroxide ions.\nProperties.\nZinc hydroxide is a white solid. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with acids to make zinc salts. It dissolves in concentrated bases. It dissolves in ammonia to make a colorless solution. It can be heated to make zinc oxide.\nOccurrence.\nZinc hydroxide is found as a few rare minerals. It is not a main zinc ore.\nPreparation.\nZinc hydroxide can be made by reacting zinc chloride or zinc sulfate with sodium hydroxide. A dilute solution of sodium hydroxide was used so the zinc hydroxide didn't dissolve.\nUses.\nZinc hydroxide is used to absorb blood in large bandages. These bandages are used after surgery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":20},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":84},{"uri":"Hydroxide","surface_form":"hydroxide","offset":93},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":103},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":200},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":219},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":255},{"uri":"Zinc_oxide","surface_form":"zinc oxide","offset":341},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":435},{"uri":"Zinc_chloride","surface_form":"zinc chloride","offset":492},{"uri":"Zinc_sulfate","surface_form":"zinc sulfate","offset":509},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":527}]}
