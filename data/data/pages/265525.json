{"id":265525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_phosphate","text":"Zinc phosphate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Zn3(PO4)2. It contains zinc and phosphate ions.\nProperties.\nZinc phosphate is a white solid. It does not dissolve in water. It can react with strong acids to make phosphoric acid and a zinc salt.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting zinc with phosphoric acid. It is normally made by reacting zinc oxide and magnesium oxide with a mixture of phosphoric acid, water, and a buffer.\nUses.\nIt is used as a cement in dentistry. It rarely is found as a mineral.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":20},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":86},{"uri":"Phosphate","surface_form":"phosphate","offset":95},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":105},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":212},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":226},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":253},{"uri":"Zinc_oxide","surface_form":"zinc oxide","offset":358},{"uri":"Magnesium_oxide","surface_form":"magnesium oxide","offset":373},{"uri":"Buffer","surface_form":"buffer","offset":437},{"uri":"Cement","surface_form":"cement","offset":467},{"uri":"Dentistry","surface_form":"dentistry","offset":477},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":512}]}
