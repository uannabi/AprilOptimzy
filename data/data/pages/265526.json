{"id":265526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_bromide","text":"Zinc bromide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ZnBr2. It contains zinc and bromide ions.\nProperties.\nZinc bromide is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water. It makes an acidic solution.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting barium bromide with zinc sulfate. This forms barium sulfate which can be filtered out. It can also be made by reacting zinc with bromine. It can also be made by reacting zinc with hydrogen bromide or hydrobromic acid.\nUses.\nIt can be used in organic chemistry. It can be used as a shield against radiation. There is a battery that uses zinc bromide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":18},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"Zn","offset":61},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"Br","offset":63},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":80},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":89},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":97},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":185},{"uri":"Barium_bromide","surface_form":"barium bromide","offset":242},{"uri":"Zinc_sulfate","surface_form":"zinc sulfate","offset":262},{"uri":"Barium_sulfate","surface_form":"barium sulfate","offset":287},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":371},{"uri":"Hydrogen_bromide","surface_form":"hydrogen bromide","offset":422},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":442},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":484},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":538},{"uri":"Battery","surface_form":"battery","offset":560}]}
