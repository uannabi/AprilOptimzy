{"id":265527,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_bromide","text":"=\"preserve\">Barium bromide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaBr2. It contains barium and bromide ions.\nProperties.\nBarium bromide is a colorless solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is very toxic because of the barium ions. It reacts with the sulfate ion to make insoluble (does not dissolve in water) barium sulfate.\nPreparation.\nBarium bromide can be made by reacting barium carbonate with hydrobromic acid. It can also be made by a violent reaction between barium and bromine.\nUses.\nIt can be used to make zinc bromide. It also is used to purify radium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":32},{"uri":"Barium","surface_form":"barium","offset":94},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":105},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":113},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":262},{"uri":"Barium_sulfate","surface_form":"barium sulfate","offset":321},{"uri":"Barium_carbonate","surface_form":"barium carbonate","offset":389},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":411},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":490},{"uri":"Zinc_bromide","surface_form":"zinc bromide","offset":528},{"uri":"Radium","surface_form":"radium","offset":568}]}
