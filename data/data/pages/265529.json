{"id":265529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_fluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Zinc fluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ZnF2. It contains zinc and fluoride ions.\nProperties.\nZinc fluoride is a colorless solid. It only dissolves a little in water. It reacts with bases to make zinc hydroxide.\nPreparation.\nZinc fluoride is made by reacting zinc chloride with a fluoride. It can also be made by reacting zinc with fluorine. It also can be made by reacting zinc with hydrofluoric acid to make hydrogen and zinc fluoride.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":31},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":92},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":101},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":110},{"uri":"Zinc_hydroxide","surface_form":"zinc hydroxide","offset":230},{"uri":"Zinc_chloride","surface_form":"zinc chloride","offset":293},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":366},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":408},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":418},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":444}]}
