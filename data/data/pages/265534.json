{"id":265534,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_sulfide","text":"=\"preserve\">Zinc sulfide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ZnS. It contains zinc and sulfide ions.\nProperties.\nZinc sulfide is white when pure. It does not dissolve in water. It can burn at a high temperature to make sulfur dioxide and zinc oxide. It reacts with strong acids to make hydrogen sulfide.\nPreparation.\nZinc sulfide can be made by igniting a mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur. Another way of making it is to react hydrogen sulfide with a zinc compound.\nUses.\nZinc sulfide is used to convert ultraviolet light to visible light. It can be doped with copper to make it glow in the dark.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":30},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":90},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":99},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":107},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":231},{"uri":"Zinc_oxide","surface_form":"zinc oxide","offset":250},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":284},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":298},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":397},{"uri":"Ultraviolet","surface_form":"ultraviolet","offset":519},{"uri":"Visible_light","surface_form":"visible light","offset":540},{"uri":"Doping","surface_form":"doped","offset":565},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":576}]}
