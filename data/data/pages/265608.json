It was responsible for $500 million in damage and eleven deaths. The storm formed from a westward moving tropical wave merged with the remnants of Pacific Hurricane Cosme. Despite the damage, the name \"Allison\" was not retired. However, in June 2001, another Tropical Storm Allison caused major damage in the same areas, causing the name \"Allison\" to be retired.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Right","surface_form":"Tropical Storm Allison in June 1989","offset":58},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":122},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":140},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":163},{"uri":"Tropical_Storm_Allison","surface_form":"Tropical Storm Allison","offset":450}]}
