{"id":265688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium","text":"\"Plasmodium\", commonly known as the malaria parasite, is a large genus of parasitic protozoa. There are about 200 species. Infection with these protozoans is called malaria, a deadly disease widespread in the tropics. The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle: a mosquito vector and a vertebrate host.\nThe genus \"Plasmodium\" was first described in 1885. At least ten species infect humans. Other species infect other animals, including birds, reptiles and rodents, while 29 species infect non-human primates. The Apicomplexa \u2013 the phylum to which \"Plasmodium\" belongs \u2013 are thought to have originated within the Dinoflagellates \u2013 a large group of photosynthetic protozoa.\nThe most common forms of human malaria are caused by \"Plasmodium falciparum\", \"Plasmodium vivax\", \"Plasmodium ovale\", and \"Plasmodium malariae\". \"P. falciparum\" malaria, common in sub-Saharan Africa, is especially dangerous.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":65},{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":74},{"uri":"Protozoa","surface_form":"protozoa","offset":84},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":114},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":165},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":183},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropics","offset":209},{"uri":"Biological_life_cycle","surface_form":"life cycle","offset":259},{"uri":"Mosquito","surface_form":"mosquito","offset":273},{"uri":"Vector_(biology)","surface_form":"vector","offset":282},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":295},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":446},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":453},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":466},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":509},{"uri":"Apicomplexa","surface_form":"Apicomplexa","offset":523},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":541},{"uri":"Dinoflagellate","surface_form":"Dinoflagellate","offset":622},{"uri":"Photosynthetic","surface_form":"photosynthetic","offset":657},{"uri":"Plasmodium_falciparum","surface_form":"Plasmodium falciparum","offset":736},{"uri":"Plasmodium_vivax","surface_form":"Plasmodium vivax","offset":761},{"uri":"Plasmodium_ovale","surface_form":"Plasmodium ovale","offset":781},{"uri":"Plasmodium_malariae","surface_form":"Plasmodium malariae","offset":805}]}
