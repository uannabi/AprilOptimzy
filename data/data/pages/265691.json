{"id":265691,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_peroxide","text":"Barium peroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaO2. It contains barium and peroxide ions.\nProperties.\nBarium peroxide is a gray-white solid. It reacts with water to make oxygen gas. When it is heated very hot, it releases oxygen and turns into barium oxide.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by heating barium oxide. This process used to be used to get oxygen from the air. Barium oxide was heated to around 300\u00B0C, absorbing oxygen and making barium peroxide. The barium peroxide was heated above 500\u00B0C, releasing the oxygen. Then it could be reused.\nUses.\nBarium peroxide can be used to make hydrogen peroxide by reaction with sulfuric acid. This also makes the solid barium sulfate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":21},{"uri":"Barium","surface_form":"barium","offset":82},{"uri":"Peroxide","surface_form":"peroxide","offset":93},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":102},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":188},{"uri":"Barium_oxide","surface_form":"barium oxide","offset":262},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":636},{"uri":"Barium_sulfate","surface_form":"barium sulfate","offset":677}]}
