{"id":265694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_oxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Barium oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaO. It contains barium and oxide ions.\nProperties.\nBarium oxide is a white solid. It dissolves in water to make barium hydroxide. It reacts with acids to make barium salts.\nPreparation.\nBarium oxide is made by heating barium carbonate with carbon. This prevents barium peroxide from forming when it is heated. It can also be made by heating barium nitrate.\nUses.\nBarium oxide can be added to glass instead of lead(II) oxide. It is also used in cathode ray tubes. It can be used as a catalyst.\nSafety.\nBarium oxide is very toxic when eaten.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":30},{"uri":"Barium","surface_form":"barium","offset":90},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":101},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":107},{"uri":"Barium_hydroxide","surface_form":"barium hydroxide","offset":186},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":219},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":240},{"uri":"Barium_carbonate","surface_form":"barium carbonate","offset":292},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":314},{"uri":"Barium_peroxide","surface_form":"barium peroxide","offset":336},{"uri":"Barium_nitrate","surface_form":"barium nitrate","offset":415},{"uri":"Lead(II)_oxide","surface_form":"lead(II) oxide","offset":483},{"uri":"Cathode_ray_tube","surface_form":"cathode ray tube","offset":518},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":557}]}
