{"id":265695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_nitrate","text":"Barium nitrate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ba(NO3)2. It contains barium and nitrate ions.\nProperties.\nBarium nitrate is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It releases a green flame when burned. It decomposes when heated to barium oxide, oxygen, and nitrogen dioxide. If it is heated in nitric oxide, it makes barium nitrite. It reacts with any sulfate or sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting barium carbonate with nitric acid. It can also be prepared by reacting the solutions of sodium nitrate with barium chloride.\nUses.\nBarium nitrate can be mixed with powdered aluminium and zinc. This makes an explosive. It is also used in fireworks to make a green color. It is also used to make barium oxide.\nSafety.\nBarium nitrate is very toxic. Sulfates can be given if someone eats barium, because they turn it into nontoxic barium sulfate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":20},{"uri":"Barium","surface_form":"barium","offset":85},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":96},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":104},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":191},{"uri":"Barium_oxide","surface_form":"barium oxide","offset":276},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":290},{"uri":"Nitrogen_dioxide","surface_form":"nitrogen dioxide","offset":302},{"uri":"Nitric_oxide","surface_form":"nitric oxide","offset":339},{"uri":"Nitrite","surface_form":"nitrite","offset":369},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":397},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":408},{"uri":"Barium_sulfate","surface_form":"barium sulfate","offset":430},{"uri":"Barium_carbonate","surface_form":"barium carbonate","offset":482},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":504},{"uri":"Sodium_nitrate","surface_form":"sodium nitrate","offset":570},{"uri":"Barium_chloride","surface_form":"barium chloride","offset":590},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":655},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":669},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":689}]}
