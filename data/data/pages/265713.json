The Advertising Council allows sponsor organizations to create advertising that are on social issues as well.\nHistory.\nThe Advertising Council was created in 1941, and shortly after, in February 1942, it was registered as The War Advertising Council for the purpose of being in the advertising industry in support of the Second World War effort. Early ads tried to tell people about the purchase of war bonds and saving of war things.\nAfter the Second World War, the War Advertising Council changed its name to the Advertising Council and shifted its focus to peacetime ads. In 1945, the Ad Council began working with the National Safety Council.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Public_service_announcement","surface_form":"public service announcement","offset":107},{"uri":"Behalf","surface_form":"behalf","offset":139},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States government","offset":202},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":439},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":673},{"uri":"War_bond","surface_form":"war bond","offset":751},{"uri":"National_Safety_Council","surface_form":"National Safety Council","offset":974}]}
