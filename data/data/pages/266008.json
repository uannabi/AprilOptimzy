{"id":266008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chlorite","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sodium chlorite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaClO2. It contains sodium and chlorite ions.\nProperties.\nSodium chlorite is a colorless solid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It disproportionates sometimes. It forms the unstable chlorous acid when reacted with a strong acid.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reducing chlorine dioxide in a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide.\nUses.\nSodium chlorite can be used to disinfect water. Since chlorine dioxide is too reactive to store, sodium chlorite is stored and converted to chlorine dioxide before use. It is also used as a disinfectant. It can be used in oxidation reactions in organic chemistry.\nSafety.\nIt is similar to chlorates in toxicity. Ingestion of about 10 grams would be fatal. A smaller amount could make someone very sick.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":34},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":97},{"uri":"Chlorite","surface_form":"chlorite","offset":108},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":117},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":190},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionates","offset":210},{"uri":"Chlorous_acid","surface_form":"chlorous acid","offset":261},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":302},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reducing","offset":335},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":344},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":366},{"uri":"Hydrogen_peroxide","surface_form":"hydrogen peroxide","offset":384},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":631},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":654},{"uri":"Chlorate","surface_form":"chlorate","offset":698}]}
