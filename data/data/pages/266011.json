{"id":266011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_chlorate","text":"=\"preserve\">Ammonium chlorate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NH4ClO3. It contains ammonium and chlorate ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless solid. The chlorate is an oxidizing agent and the ammonium is a reducing agent, making it a little explosive. It explodes when in sunlight for a few minutes. It should never be crystallized as it can explode without any detonation. It can catch flammable things on fire. It decomposes completely to nitrogen, chlorine, and oxygen when heated gently.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting ammonia or ammonium carbonate with chloric acid.\nUses.\nIt is used to make barium chlorate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":35},{"uri":"Ammonium","surface_form":"ammonium","offset":99},{"uri":"Chlorate","surface_form":"chlorate","offset":112},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":121},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":183},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":221},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":256},{"uri":"Detonation","surface_form":"detonation","offset":377},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":456},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":466},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":480},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":547},{"uri":"Ammonium_carbonate","surface_form":"ammonium carbonate","offset":558},{"uri":"Chloric_acid","surface_form":"chloric acid","offset":582},{"uri":"Barium_chlorate","surface_form":"barium chlorate","offset":621}]}
