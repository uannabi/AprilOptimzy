{"id":266012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_carbonate","text":"Ammonium carbonate, also known as baker's ammonia or sal volatile, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is (NH4)2CO3. It contains ammonium and carbonate ions.\nProperties.\nAmmonium carbonate is a white solid. It dissolves in water. It reacts with acids to make an ammonium salt and carbon dioxide. It has a slight smell of ammonia. It reacts with bases to make ammonia gas.\nPreparation.\nAmmonium carbonate is made by reacting ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and calcium carbonate in a furnace. The ammonium carbonate is exposed to air to decompose any bicarbonate and then is sold. It can also be made by reacting carbon dioxide with ammonia.\nUses.\nIt is used to make bread rise. It can also be used in cough syrup.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":72},{"uri":"Ammonium","surface_form":"ammonium","offset":138},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":151},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":161},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":254},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":289},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":354},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":368},{"uri":"Ammonium_sulfate","surface_form":"ammonium sulfate","offset":433},{"uri":"Ammonium_chloride","surface_form":"ammonium chloride","offset":451},{"uri":"Calcium_carbonate","surface_form":"calcium carbonate","offset":474},{"uri":"Bicarbonate","surface_form":"bicarbonate","offset":564}]}
