{"id":266265,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Indochina_War","text":"The First Indochina War was fought in French Indochina from December 19, 1946, until August 1, 1954. Other names for the war are the French Indochina War, Anti-French War, Franco-Vietnamese War, Franco-Vietminh War, Indochina War, Dirty War in France, and Anti-French Resistance War in contemporary Vietnam. The war was fought between the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps, led by France and supported by Emperor B\u1EA3o \u0110\u1EA1i's Vietnamese National Army on one side, and the Vi\u1EC7t Minh, led by H\u1ED3 Ch\u00ED Minh and V\u00F5 Nguy\u00EAn Gi\u00E1p on the other. Most of the fighting took place in Tonkin in Northern Vietnam, but the conflict spread over the entire country and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of Laos and Cambodia.\nThe French reoccupied Indochina after the Second World War. The territory had been part of the Empire of Japan before. The Vi\u1EC7t Minh launched a rebellion against the French authority. The first few years of the war involved a low-level rural insurgency against French authority. However, after the Chinese communists reached the Northern border of Vietnam in 1949, the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies which had modern weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union.\nFrench Union forces included colonial troops from the whole former empire (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Laotian, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities), French professional troops and units of the French Foreign Legion. The use of metropolitan recruits was forbidden by the governments to prevent the war from becoming even more unpopular at home. It was called the \"dirty war\" (\"la sale guerre\") by supporters of the Left in France and intellectuals (including Sartre) during the Henri Martin Affair in 1950.\nThe French had the strategy of pushing Vi\u1EC7t Minh into attacking a well defended base in a remote part of the country at the end of the logistical trail. This strategy was validated at the Battle of Na San. The big problem of the war was the lack of construction materials (especially concrete). Because of difficult terrain without roads, tanks could not be used, and providing air cover was difficult. This made it almost impossible to effectively defend the area.\nAfter the war, the Geneva Conference on July 21, 1954, made a provisional division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The Vi\u1EC7t Minh received control over the north, in a territory called Democratic Republic of Vietnam under H\u1ED3 Ch\u00ED Minh. The area south of the 17th parallel was turned into State of Vietnam under Emperor B\u1EA3o \u0110\u1EA1i. This was done to prevent H\u1ED3 Ch\u00ED Minh from gaining control of the entire country. A year later, B\u1EA3o \u0110\u1EA1i would be deposed by his prime minister, Ng\u00F4 \u0110\u00ECnh Di\u1EC7m, creating the Republic of Vietnam. Diem's refusal to enter into negotiations with North Vietnam about holding nationwide elections in 1956, as had been suggested by the Geneva Conference, would eventually lead to war breaking out again in South Vietnam in 1959 - the Second Indochina War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Military Conflict"],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_Indochina","surface_form":"French Indochina","offset":38},{"uri":"Indochina","surface_form":"Indochina","offset":140},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":299},{"uri":"French_Union","surface_form":"French Union","offset":339},{"uri":"French_Far_East_Expeditionary_Corps","surface_form":"French Far East Expeditionary Corps","offset":354},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":398},{"uri":"B%E1%BA%A3o_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i","surface_form":"B\u1EA3o \u0110\u1EA1i","offset":430},{"uri":"Vietnamese_National_Army","surface_form":"Vietnamese National Army","offset":440},{"uri":"Viet_Minh","surface_form":"Vi\u1EC7t Minh","offset":486},{"uri":"H%E1%BB%93_Ch%C3%AD_Minh","surface_form":"H\u1ED3 Ch\u00ED Minh","offset":504},{"uri":"V%C3%B5_Nguy%C3%AAn_Gi%C3%A1p","surface_form":"V\u00F5 Nguy\u00EAn Gi\u00E1p","offset":520},{"uri":"Tonkin","surface_form":"Tonkin","offset":584},{"uri":"Protectorate","surface_form":"protectorate","offset":716},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":733},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":742},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Empire of Japan","offset":847},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1221},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1243},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Moroccan","offset":1332},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":1342},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":1352},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laotian","offset":1362},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":1371},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":1382},{"uri":"French_Foreign_Legion","surface_form":"French Foreign Legion","offset":1472},{"uri":"Metropolitan_France","surface_form":"metropolitan","offset":1506},{"uri":"Left-wing_politics","surface_form":"Left","offset":1693},{"uri":"Jean-Paul_Sartre","surface_form":"Sartre","offset":1737},{"uri":"Henri_Martin_Affair","surface_form":"Henri Martin Affair","offset":1756},{"uri":"Battle_of_Na_San","surface_form":"Battle of Na San","offset":1973},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tank","offset":2124},{"uri":"Geneva_Conference_(1954)","surface_form":"Geneva Conference","offset":2270},{"uri":"Vietnamese_Demilitarized_Zone","surface_form":"17th parallel","offset":2352},{"uri":"North_Vietnam","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of Vietnam","offset":2436},{"uri":"South_Vietnam","surface_form":"State of Vietnam","offset":2538},{"uri":"List_of_Vietnamese_monarchs","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":2561},{"uri":"B%E1%BA%A3o_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i","surface_form":"B\u1EA3o \u0110\u1EA1i","offset":2569},{"uri":"Ngo_Dinh_Diem","surface_form":"Ng\u00F4 \u0110\u00ECnh Di\u1EC7m","offset":2721},{"uri":"South_Vietnam","surface_form":"Republic of Vietnam","offset":2749},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Second Indochina War","offset":3002}]}
