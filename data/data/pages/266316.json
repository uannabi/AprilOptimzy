Many governments and non-governmental organizations work at promoting healthy lifestyles.\u00A0 They measure the benefits with critical health numbers, including weight, blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. Healthy living is a lifelong effect. Being healthy includes healthy eating, physical activities, weight management, and stress management. Good health allows people to do many things.\nA healthy lifestyle also incorporates a balanced diet. This does not mean cutting out important food groups of your diet or limiting yourself on the amount of calories per day. A well-rounded diet involves employing mostly all of the food groups into every meal. Meats, dairy, fruits and vegetables are all important components of a meal that will ensure your body is full while still staying healthy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":81},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":109},{"uri":"Non-governmental_organization","surface_form":"non-governmental organization","offset":125},{"uri":"Blood_sugar","surface_form":"blood sugar","offset":269},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":282},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":308},{"uri":"Stress_management","surface_form":"stress management","offset":441}]}
