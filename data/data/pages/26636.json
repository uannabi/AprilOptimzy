{"id":26636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_plaice","text":"Alaska plaice (\"Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus\") are salt water fish that live in the north Pacific Ocean. Like most flatfish, they live on the bottom of the continental shelf, up to 600 metres deep. Their geographical range is from the Gulf of Alaska in the east, to the Chukchi Sea in the north, to the Sea of Japan in the west. Alaska plaice feed mostly on polychaetes, but also eat amphipods and echiurans.\nMost commercial fisheries do not want to catch Alaska plaice; but many are caught by trawlers trying to catch other bottom fish. So many Alaska plaice get caught anyway that, for example, the 2005 total allowable catch in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) was reached before the end of May of that year.\nAlaska plaice can live for up to 30 years, and grow to 60 centimetres (24 inches) long, but most that get caught are only seven or eight years old, and about 30\u00A0cm (12\u00A0in).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"salt water","offset":54},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":65},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":93},{"uri":"Flatfish","surface_form":"flatfish","offset":118},{"uri":"Continental_shelf","surface_form":"continental shelf","offset":159},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":188},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographical","offset":207},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Alaska","surface_form":"Gulf of Alaska","offset":238},{"uri":"Chukchi_Sea","surface_form":"Chukchi Sea","offset":273},{"uri":"Sea_of_Japan","surface_form":"Sea of Japan","offset":306},{"uri":"Polychaete","surface_form":"polychaete","offset":361},{"uri":"Amphipoda","surface_form":"amphipod","offset":387},{"uri":"Echiura","surface_form":"echiura","offset":401},{"uri":"Commercial_fishery","surface_form":"commercial fisheries","offset":417},{"uri":"Trawler","surface_form":"trawler","offset":497},{"uri":"Bottom_fish","surface_form":"bottom fish","offset":528},{"uri":"Total_allowable_catch","surface_form":"total allowable catch","offset":609},{"uri":"Bering_Sea_and_Aleutian_Islands_management_area","surface_form":"Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area","offset":638},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"centimetres","offset":799},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":815}]}
