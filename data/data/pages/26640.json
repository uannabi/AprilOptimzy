{"id":26640,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_plaice","text":"American plaice (\"Hippoglossoides platessoides\") are salt water fish that live in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Like most flatfish, they live on the bottom of the continental shelf, up to 700 metres deep, but spend most of the time at 90 to 200 meters. Their geographical range is from the coast of Labrador, south to the coast of the U.S. state of Rhode Island. The most are found off the eastern tip of Newfoundland. American plaice feed on sand dollars, brittle stars, crustaceans, polychaetes, and fish such as capelin and launce.\nLike many flatfish, American plaice are sometimes said to be a flounder or dab, even though both are names for other fish species.\nThe U.K.-based Marine Conservation Society rates American plaice as 5, the most threatened category of over-harvested animals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"salt water","offset":53},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":64},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":96},{"uri":"Flatfish","surface_form":"flatfish","offset":122},{"uri":"Continental_shelf","surface_form":"continental shelf","offset":163},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":192},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographical","offset":259},{"uri":"Labrador%2C_Canada","surface_form":"Labrador","offset":299},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":335},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":349},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":405},{"uri":"Sand_dollar","surface_form":"sand dollar","offset":443},{"uri":"Brittle_star","surface_form":"brittle star","offset":457},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":472},{"uri":"Polychaete","surface_form":"polychaete","offset":485},{"uri":"Capelin","surface_form":"capelin","offset":515},{"uri":"Launce","surface_form":"launce","offset":527},{"uri":"Flounder","surface_form":"flounder","offset":598},{"uri":"Dab","surface_form":"dab","offset":610},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":657},{"uri":"Marine_Conservation_Society","surface_form":"Marine Conservation Society","offset":681}]}
