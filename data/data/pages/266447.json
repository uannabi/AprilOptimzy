{"id":266447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloid","text":"e=\"preserve\">A metalloid or semimetal is a chemical element. Metalloids are elements that have the properties of both metal and non-metal elements. It might be shiny, but brittle. It might be dull, but conducts electricity.\nThe most common semimetal is silicon. Silicon has electrical conductivity between metals and nonmetals. It is a semiconductor.\nAn approximate way to classify metalloids is to look at the Periodic Table of elements. See the double diagonal line: top left Boron and Aluminium, bottom right Polonium and Astatine. Those diagonals are the metalloids. Some metalloids are not semimetals, and some semimetals are not metalloids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":43},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":118},{"uri":"Elements","surface_form":"elements","offset":138},{"uri":"Silicon","surface_form":"silicon","offset":253},{"uri":"Conductivity","surface_form":"conductivity","offset":285},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":336},{"uri":"Periodic_Table","surface_form":"Periodic Table","offset":411},{"uri":"Boron","surface_form":"Boron","offset":478},{"uri":"Polonium","surface_form":"Polonium","offset":512},{"uri":"Astatine","surface_form":"Astatine","offset":525}]}
