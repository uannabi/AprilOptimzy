{"id":266469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_selenide","text":"=\"preserve\">Sodium selenide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Na2Se. It contains sodium and selenide ions.\nProperties.\nSodium selenide is a solid. It reacts with water to make a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium hydroselenide. It is a reducing agent. It is oxidized to a mixture of selenide and selenium, making an offwhite color. It is eventually oxidized to selenium dioxide. it reacts with acids to make hydrogen selenide gas.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting selenium with a solution of sodium in liquid ammonia.\nUses.\nSodium selenide is used to react with some organic compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":33},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":95},{"uri":"Selenide","surface_form":"selenide","offset":106},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":115},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":203},{"uri":"Hydroselenide","surface_form":"hydroselenide","offset":231},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":254},{"uri":"Offwhite","surface_form":"offwhite","offset":334},{"uri":"Selenium_dioxide","surface_form":"selenium dioxide","offset":379},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":412},{"uri":"Hydrogen_selenide","surface_form":"hydrogen selenide","offset":426},{"uri":"Selenium","surface_form":"selenium","offset":485},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":530},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":588}]}
