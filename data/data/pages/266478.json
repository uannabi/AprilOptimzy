{"id":266478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenous_acid","text":"Selenous acid, also known as selenious acid, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is H2SeO3. It is an acid. It contains hydrogen and selenite ions.\nProperties.\nSelenous acid is a weak acid. It can be heated to make selenium dioxide. It is more stable than sulfurous acid. It can be crystallized as a white solid. It is a weak oxidizing agent. It reacts with bases to make selenites.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving selenium dioxide in water.\nUses.\nIt is used to dye steel a blue-grey color. It is used in the making of organic compounds.\nSafety.\nSelenous acid is very toxic. Just ingesting a small amount can kill you.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":50},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":110},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":128},{"uri":"Selenite","surface_form":"selenite","offset":141},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":150},{"uri":"Selenium_dioxide","surface_form":"selenium dioxide","offset":223},{"uri":"Sulfurous_acid","surface_form":"sulfurous acid","offset":264},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":334},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":366},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":449},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":533}]}
