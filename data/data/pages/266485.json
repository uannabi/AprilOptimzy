{"id":266485,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_selenite","text":"Sodium selenite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Na2SeO3. It contains sodium and selenite ions.\nProperties.\nSodium selenite is a white solid. It dissolves in water. It is a weak oxidizing agent. It reacts with acids to make selenous acid. It can be oxidized by powerful oxidizing agents to make sodium selenate.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting sodium hydroxide with selenium dioxide\nUses.\nSodium selenite is used to add a pink color to glass. It is also used in some vitamin supplements.\nSafety.\nEating of any more than a very tiny amount would give selenium poisoning.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":21},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":85},{"uri":"Selenite","surface_form":"selenite","offset":96},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":105},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":193},{"uri":"Selenous_acid","surface_form":"selenous acid","offset":239},{"uri":"Sodium_selenate","surface_form":"sodium selenate","offset":310},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":363},{"uri":"Selenium_dioxide","surface_form":"selenium dioxide","offset":385}]}
