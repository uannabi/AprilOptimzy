{"id":266494,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_tetrafluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Selenium tetrafluoride, also known as selenous fluoride and selenium(IV) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SeF4. It contains selenium in its +4 oxidation state. It also contains fluoride ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless liquid. It hydrolyses in water giving hydrofluoric acid and selenous acid. It is used to add fluoride to other chemical compounds.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting selenium with a little fluorine. A lot of fluorine makes selenium hexafluoride. It can also be made by reacting sulfur tetrafluoride with selenium dioxide.\nUses.\nIt is used to make adducts and some other chemical reactions like that.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":100},{"uri":"Selenium","surface_form":"selenium","offset":161},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":180},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":214},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":223},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":297},{"uri":"Selenous_acid","surface_form":"selenous acid","offset":319},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":449},{"uri":"Selenium_hexafluoride","surface_form":"selenium hexafluoride","offset":483},{"uri":"Sulfur_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur tetrafluoride","offset":538},{"uri":"Selenium_dioxide","surface_form":"selenium dioxide","offset":564},{"uri":"Adduct","surface_form":"adducts","offset":607}]}
