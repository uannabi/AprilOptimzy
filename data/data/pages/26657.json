{"id":26657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel","text":"Opel, full name Adam Opel AG, is an automobile maker from Germany, founded in 1862. Since 1929, Opel is the German brand of the American automaker General Motors. Opel has about 35,000 workers. The company headquarters are in R\u00FCsselsheim, Germany. Other German plants are in Eisenach and Kaiserslautern. In Great Britain, Opel cars are called Vauxhall. Opel would later engineer cars for GMDAT, and still engineers them for GM Korea. From 2007-2009 three Opel models (the Antara, the Astra and the Vectra) were sold in the United States under the Saturn marque. Upon the discontinuation of Saturn Buick became responsible for importing the Opel models. The only Buick cars to not be Opels are the Enclave CUV and the full sized LaCrosse sedan. In March 2017, Opel and its parent brand Vauxhall were brought by PSA, the company who owns Peugeot and Citroen.\nCar models.\nAdam | Antara | Ampera | Astra | Cascada | Corsa | Insignia | Karl | Meriva | Mokka | Zafira Tourer\nCombo | Vivaro | Movano\nAntara GTC | Astra OPC X-Treme | Eco Speedster | Flextreme | Flextreme GT/E | Frogster | GTC Concept | Insignia Concept | Monza Concept | RAK e | Snowtrekker | Trixx\nAgila | Admiral | Ascona | Blitz | Calibra | Commodore | Diplomat | Frontera | GT | Kadett | Kapit\u00E4n | Manta | Monterey | Monza | Olympia | Omega | Rekord | Senator | Signum | Sintra | Speedster | Tigra | Vectra","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"automobile","offset":36},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":58},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"General Motors","offset":147},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":239},{"uri":"Eisenach","surface_form":"Eisenach","offset":275},{"uri":"Kaiserslautern","surface_form":"Kaiserslautern","offset":288},{"uri":"Vauxhall_Motors","surface_form":"Vauxhall","offset":343},{"uri":"Daewoo_Motors","surface_form":"GMDAT","offset":388},{"uri":"Buick","surface_form":"Buick","offset":597},{"uri":"Buick_Enclave","surface_form":"Enclave","offset":697},{"uri":"Opel_Adam","surface_form":"Adam","offset":869},{"uri":"Opel_Antara","surface_form":"Antara","offset":876},{"uri":"Opel_Ampera","surface_form":"Ampera","offset":885},{"uri":"Opel_Astra","surface_form":"Astra","offset":894},{"uri":"Opel_Cascada","surface_form":"Cascada","offset":902},{"uri":"Opel_Corsa","surface_form":"Corsa","offset":912},{"uri":"Opel_Insignia","surface_form":"Insignia","offset":920},{"uri":"Opel_Karl","surface_form":"Karl","offset":931},{"uri":"Opel_Meriva","surface_form":"Meriva","offset":938},{"uri":"Opel_Mokka","surface_form":"Mokka","offset":947},{"uri":"Opel_Zafira","surface_form":"Zafira Tourer","offset":955},{"uri":"Opel_Combo","surface_form":"Combo","offset":969},{"uri":"Opel_Vivaro","surface_form":"Vivaro","offset":977},{"uri":"Opel_Movano","surface_form":"Movano","offset":986},{"uri":"Opel_Agila","surface_form":"Agila","offset":1159},{"uri":"Opel_Signum","surface_form":"Signum","offset":1326},{"uri":"Opel_Sintra","surface_form":"Sintra","offset":1335},{"uri":"Opel_Vectra","surface_form":"Vectra","offset":1364}]}
