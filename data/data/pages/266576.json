{"id":266576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_river","text":"A braided river is a network of small channels separated by islands that are often not fixed. In other words, the river channels wander across a flat area.\nBraided rivers are found in places where the river carries a lot of sediment, and when it slows down and spreads out. The river delta of the Amazon River is a good example on a huge scale, and the Waimakariri River is a good example on a smaller scale.\nLarge systems.\nAll these regions contain young mountains that have quick erosion.\nEurope has two notably braided rivers: the Narew, in Poland and Belarus, and the Tagliamento in northeastern Italy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":21},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":60},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":224},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"river delta","offset":278},{"uri":"Amazon_River","surface_form":"Amazon River","offset":297},{"uri":"Waimakariri_River","surface_form":"Waimakariri River","offset":353},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":456},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":482},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":491},{"uri":"Narew","surface_form":"Narew","offset":534},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":544},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":555},{"uri":"Tagliamento","surface_form":"Tagliamento","offset":572},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":600}]}
