{"id":266637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_permanganate","text":"=\"preserve\">Calcium permanganate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ca(MnO4)2. It contains calcium and permanganate ions.\nProperties.\nCalcium permanganate is a dark purple solid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It is similar to potassium permanganate. It can catch some organic chemicals like alcohol on fire. It can cause an explosion when mixed with sulfuric acid. This is because manganese(VII) oxide.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by calcium oxide with manganese(IV) oxide and calcium nitrate.\nUses.\nIt might whiten teeth. It can be used as an oxidizing agent, although potassium permanganate is more common.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":38},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":104},{"uri":"Permanganate","surface_form":"permanganate","offset":116},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":129},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":209},{"uri":"Potassium_permanganate","surface_form":"potassium permanganate","offset":243},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":367},{"uri":"Manganese(VII)_oxide","surface_form":"manganese(VII) oxide","offset":398},{"uri":"Calcium_oxide","surface_form":"calcium oxide","offset":451},{"uri":"Manganese(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"manganese(IV) oxide","offset":470},{"uri":"Calcium_nitrate","surface_form":"calcium nitrate","offset":494}]}
