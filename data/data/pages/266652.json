{"id":266652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_locomotion","text":"Terrestrial locomotion has evolved as animals adapted from aquatic to terrestrial places. Movement on land makes different problems than that on water, with less friction instead being the effects of gravity.\nLegged locomotion.\nMovement on legs is the most common form of land movement. It is the simple form of movement of two big groups with many members, the vertebrates and the arthropods.\nLimbless locomotion.\nThere are a number of land and amphibious limbless vertebrates and invertebrates. These animals, due to lack of legs, use their bodies to move. These movements are sometimes called to as \"slithering\" or \"crawling\".\nRolling.\nAlthough animals have never have wheels for locomotion, some animals will move by rolling their whole body.\nLimits and extremes.\nThe fastest terrestrial animal is the cheetah, which can get speeds of about 104\u00A0km/h (64\u00A0mph).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":27},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":38},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":162},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":200},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":362},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":382},{"uri":"Amphibious","surface_form":"amphibious","offset":446},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":672},{"uri":"Cheetah","surface_form":"cheetah","offset":806}]}
