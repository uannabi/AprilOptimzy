{"id":266674,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_acid","text":"In chemistry, a strong acid is an acid which ionizes (splits) completely in a solution of water. It always loses a proton (A H+) when put in water. A weak acid does not always lose a proton, though; It can lose its proton, but not all the time. They also have a very low pH, usually between 1 and 3. Many strong acids have a negative pKa value, which means they are very strong.\nThe six common strong acids are: (Acronym:CBSPIN)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":3},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":34},{"uri":"Ionizes","surface_form":"ionizes","offset":45},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":78},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":90},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":115},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":141},{"uri":"Weak_acid","surface_form":"weak acid","offset":150},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":271}]}
