Its nickname is Beishida.\nOriginally, it was called a \"normal school\" because it was only a school for teachers, and all teacher schools were named the same way. It was attached to the Imperial University of Peking. Later, it became a university on its own, teaching subjects other than education, but kept its name the same.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":52},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":70},{"uri":"Humanities","surface_form":"humanities","offset":162},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":177},{"uri":"Imperial_University_of_Peking","surface_form":"Imperial University of Peking","offset":457}]}
