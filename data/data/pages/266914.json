{"id":266914,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Copiap%C3%B3_mining_accident","text":"The 2010 Copiap\u00F3 mining accident was a mining accident that happened on August 5, 2010, when the copper-gold mine of San Jos\u00E9, near Copiap\u00F3, Chile, collapsed. It left 33 miners trapped around 700 meters under the ground.\nThe Mine of San Jos\u00E9 (Mina San Jos\u00E9) is about north of Copiap\u00F3, in the Region of Atacama. The miners were trapped at about deep and about from the entrance of the mine. The mine has had accidents in the past, including one death. A report from the Chilean Government from July 2010, said that the owners of the mine did not \"reinforce the roof.\" The lack of reinforcement \"led to an earlier collapse of the roof\". There has been controversy over why the mine was not closed down earlier.\nSome people, including lawyers representing the mining company, think that the owners of the mine will declare bankruptcy after the miners are rescued.\nOn October 13, 2010, Florencio \u00C1valos reached the surface. He was the first miner to be rescued.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":39},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":46},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":97},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":104},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mine","offset":109},{"uri":"Copiap%C3%B3","surface_form":"Copiap\u00F3","offset":132},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":141},{"uri":"Region_of_Atacama","surface_form":"Region of Atacama","offset":292}]}
