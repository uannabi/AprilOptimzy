{"id":266947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Hippo","text":"=\"preserve\">The Synod of Hippo was the synod of 393 that was held in Hippo Regius in northern Africa during the early Christian Church. Other synods were held in 394, 397, 401 and 426.\nSome were attended by St. Augustine. The synod of 393 is best known for two things. First, for the first time a council of bishops listed and agreed a canon of Sacred Scripture that is the same as the modern Orthodox and Roman Catholic canon. The canon was later agreed at the Council of Carthage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Synod","surface_form":"synod","offset":39},{"uri":"Hippo_Regius","surface_form":"Hippo Regius","offset":69},{"uri":"Northern_Africa","surface_form":"northern Africa","offset":85},{"uri":"Early_Christianity","surface_form":"early Christian Church","offset":112},{"uri":"Augustine_of_Hippo","surface_form":"St. Augustine","offset":207},{"uri":"Biblical_canon","surface_form":"canon","offset":336},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Sacred Scripture","offset":345},{"uri":"Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":393},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":406},{"uri":"Council_of_Carthage","surface_form":"Council of Carthage","offset":462}]}
