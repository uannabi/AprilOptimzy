He began his education at boarding-school in Jena, Germany.\nIn 1933, working in Z\u00FCrich, Switzerland, Reichstein made vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in what is now called the Reichstein process.\nReichstein, E.C. Kendall and P.S. Hench were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950 for their discovery of cortisone.\nHe died in Basel, Switzerland. The main industrial process for the artificial creation of Vitamin C still bears his name. Reichstein was the longest-lived Nobel laureate at the time of his death, but was beaten in 2008 by Rita Levi-Montalcini.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish-born","offset":54},{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":66},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":72},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":81},{"uri":"Nobel_laureate","surface_form":"Nobel laureate","offset":94},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":137},{"uri":"W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek","surface_form":"W\u0142oc\u0142awek","offset":154},{"uri":"Congress_Poland","surface_form":"Congress Poland","offset":165},{"uri":"Kiev","surface_form":"Kiev","offset":215},{"uri":"Jena","surface_form":"Jena","offset":300},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":306},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":335},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":343},{"uri":"Vitamin_C","surface_form":"vitamin C","offset":372},{"uri":"Ascorbic_acid","surface_form":"ascorbic acid","offset":383},{"uri":"Reichstein_process","surface_form":"Reichstein process","offset":424},{"uri":"Edward_Calvin_Kendall","surface_form":"E.C.
