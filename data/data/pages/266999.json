{"id":266999,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%C3%BA_National_Park","text":"Man\u00FA National Park is a biosphere reserve in Peru.\nBefore becoming an area protected by the Peruvian government, the Man\u00FA National Park was conserved because it was inaccessible; that is, people could not get to it. The park is fairly inaccessible by road to this day. In 1977, UNESCO recognised it as a Biosphere Reserve and in 1987, it was named a World Heritage Site.\nIt is the largest National Park in Peru, covering an area of 15,328\u00A0km\u00B2. The Biosphere Reserve includes an additional 2,570\u00A0km\u00B2, and a further 914\u00A0km\u00B2 are included in a \"Cultural Zone\" (which also given protection), bringing the total area up to 18,811\u00A0km\u00B2.\nThe park protects several ecological zones ranging from as low as 150 metres above sea level in parts of the Amazon Basin, to Puna grassland at altitudes of 4200 metres. Because of this topographical range, it has one of highest levels of biodiversity of any park in the world.\nOverall, more than 15,000 species of plants are found in Man\u00FA, and up to 250 varieties of trees have been found in a single hectare.\nThe reserve is visited by birdwatchers from all over the world, as it is home to over 1000 species of birds. This is over 10% of all living bird species, and more than the number of bird species found in the entirety of North America.\nThe Park has one of the most varied collections of land vertebrates ever found in Latin American tropical forests.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biosphere","surface_form":"biosphere","offset":24},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":45},{"uri":"Access","surface_form":"inaccessible","offset":235},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":278},{"uri":"Biosphere_Reserve","surface_form":"Biosphere Reserve","offset":304},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":350},{"uri":"Ecoregion","surface_form":"ecological zones","offset":655},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":712},{"uri":"Amazon_Basin","surface_form":"Amazon Basin","offset":738},{"uri":"Puna_grassland","surface_form":"Puna grassland","offset":755},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":868},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":944},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":997},{"uri":"Hectare","surface_form":"hectare","offset":1031},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1142},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":1331},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":1372},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1381}]}
