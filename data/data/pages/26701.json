{"id":26701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The dalton or unified atomic mass unit (abbreviated: amu, u, or Da) is a unit of measurement that is used to measure the mass of atoms. The atomic mass unit is equal to one twelfth of the mass of the carbon-12.\nThe unified atomic mass unit and the dalton are different names for the same thing. The word 'dalton' is being used more over time. The unit is named after John Dalton, an 18th-century naturalist and teacher.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":94},{"uri":"Atomic_mass","surface_form":"mass of atoms","offset":134},{"uri":"Carbon-12","surface_form":"carbon-12","offset":213},{"uri":"John_Dalton","surface_form":"John Dalton","offset":380}]}
