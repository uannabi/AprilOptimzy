{"id":267043,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology","text":"Geomorphology is the scientific study of landforms and the processes that shape them.\nMore broadly, it studies the evolution of the topography of a planet. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes. They use a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.\nGeomorphology is part of geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology and archaeology. This range of interests leads to a wide variety of research styles and interests in the field.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landform","surface_form":"landform","offset":41},{"uri":"Topography","surface_form":"topography","offset":132},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":196},{"uri":"Computer_model","surface_form":"numerical modeling","offset":375},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":420},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":431},{"uri":"Geodesy","surface_form":"geodesy","offset":440},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":449},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeology","offset":473}]}
