{"id":267185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrought_iron","text":"=\"preserve\">Wrought iron is a type of iron. It has very little carbon in it. Most steels have much more carbon. It also has some slag in it. This gives it a fibrous look similar to how wood looks. It is tough, malleable, ductile, and can be welded easily. It was most common in the old days when cast iron was the only other type of iron. Now mild steel is used instead. If it contains too much sulfur, it becomes very brittle when heated. Wrought iron has a rough surface that can hold paint and zinc for galvanization much more easily.\nWrought iron was one of the most common types of iron in the medieval times. Its popularity has declined. It is needed to make historical items look historical.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":38},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":63},{"uri":"Slag","surface_form":"slag","offset":129},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":185},{"uri":"Malleable","surface_form":"malleable","offset":210},{"uri":"Ductile","surface_form":"ductile","offset":221},{"uri":"Weld","surface_form":"weld","offset":241},{"uri":"Cast_iron","surface_form":"cast iron","offset":296},{"uri":"Mild_steel","surface_form":"mild steel","offset":343},{"uri":"Galvanization","surface_form":"galvanization","offset":506},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":599}]}
