{"id":267351,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander","text":"e=\"preserve\">Commander is a rank of naval officer. It may also be used as a general term for a leader.\nCommander as a naval rank.\nCommander is a rank used in many navies and some air forces. It is rarely used as a rank in armies, except in special forces for a team leader.\nThe title (originally \"Master and Commander\") originated in the 18th century Royal Navy for naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a Lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a Post-captain.\nIn practice, these were usually unrated sloops-of-war of no more than 20 guns. The Royal Navy shortened \"Master and Commander\" to \"Commander\" in 1794; however, the term \"Master and Commander\" remained in common use for many years. A corresponding rank in some navies is frigate captain. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF-4.\nRoyal Navy.\nA Commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of Lieutenant-Commander, below the rank of Captain. It is equivalent in rank to a Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army and Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force. A Commander may command a frigate, destroyer, submarine, aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"naval","offset":36},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":42},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":95},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"navies","offset":163},{"uri":"Air_force","surface_form":"air force","offset":179},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"armies","offset":222},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":351},{"uri":"Lieutenant","surface_form":"Lieutenant","offset":439},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":500},{"uri":"Sloop","surface_form":"sloop","offset":549},{"uri":"Frigate_Captain","surface_form":"frigate captain","offset":779},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":859},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":914},{"uri":"Lieutenant-Commander","surface_form":"Lieutenant-Commander","offset":946},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"Captain","offset":986},{"uri":"Lieutenant_Colonel","surface_form":"Lieutenant Colonel","offset":1025},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":1051},{"uri":"Wing_Commander","surface_form":"Wing Commander","offset":1068},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":1090},{"uri":"Frigate","surface_form":"frigate","offset":1133},{"uri":"Destroyer","surface_form":"destroyer","offset":1142},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":1153}]}
