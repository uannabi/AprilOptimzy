{"id":267440,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurite","text":"=\"preserve\">Tellurite is an ion. Its chemical formula is TeO32-. They are some of the more stable tellurium compounds. They are weak oxidizing agents. In slightly acidic conditions, it makes hydrogen tellurite, HTeO3-. When it is very acidic, it makes tellurous acid. They are normally made by reacting tellurium dioxide with a metal oxide.\nTellurite is also a rare mineral. This mineral consists of tellurium dioxide. It is a yellow to white mineral. It is in areas that tend to oxidize minerals (oxidation zone). Otherwise telluride or native tellurium would be there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":28},{"uri":"Tellurium","surface_form":"tellurium","offset":98},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":133},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":163},{"uri":"Tellurous_acid","surface_form":"tellurous acid","offset":252},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":303},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":366}]}
