{"id":267459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiba_Prefecture","text":"is a Japanese prefecture in the Kant\u014D region on the island of Honshu. The capital city is Chiba City.\nChiba is the sixth most populous prefecture, and 27th largest by land area.\nHistory.\nChiba Prefecture is made from the old province of Awa, Kazusa and Shim\u014Dsa.\nGeography.\nChiba borders Ibaraki Prefecture to the north at the Tone River, Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture to the west at the Edo River, the Pacific Ocean to the east and Tokyo Bay around its southern boundary. Most of Chiba lies on the hilly B\u014Ds\u014D Peninsula, a rice farming region: the east coast, known as the Ninety-Nine League Plain, is an especially productive area. The most populous zone, in the northwest of the prefecture, is part of the Kant\u014D region that extends into the urban agglomeration of Tokyo and Saitama. The Kuroshio Current flows near Chiba, which keeps it relatively warm in winter and cooler in summer than neighbouring Tokyo.\nCities.\n\u2021 Scheduled to be dissolved after mergers.\nNational Parks.\nNational Parks are established in about 6% of the total land area of the prefecture.\nEconomy.\nChiba is one of Japan's biggest industrial areas. This is because it has a long coastline on Tokyo Bay. Chiba was chosen as the place for a major Kawasaki Steel factory in 1950. The prefectural government started a very big land reclamation program. They filled in the water areas to make big, new waterfront properties for factories, warehouses, and docks. Chemical production, petrochemical refining, and machine production are the three main industries in Chiba. They are 45% of Chiba's exports. In recent years, the government has given more than eighty industrial parks money. This is to bring development further inland.\nChiba also has the second-highest farming output in Japan. Only Hokkaid\u014D makes more farm products.Chiba makes more vegetables than Hokkaid\u014D. Seaweed is harvested in big amounts from Tokyo Bay.\nSports.\nTwo major Japanese sport events happen in Chiba each year: the International Chiba Ekiden and the Chiba International Cross Country.\nThese sports teams are based in Chiba.\nTransportation.\nMost Tokyo-bound visitors going to Tokyo arriving on international flights land in Narita International Airport, which is situated in Narita in the north of the prefecture, and connected to Tokyo by the East Japan Railway's \"Narita Express\" and the Keisei Electric Railway's \"Skyliner\".\nTourism.\nThe Tokyo Disney Resort is in Urayasu near the western border of the prefecture.\nThe Kamogawa Sea World is a large scale comprehensive marine leisure center/museum equivalent facility located between the Tojo coast and the national highway No. 128 in Kamogawa city.\nThere are several tourist sites on the B\u014Ds\u014D Peninsula, such as Mount Nokogiri; Kuj\u016Bkuri Beach; and Onjuku Beach.\nChiba is linked to Tokyo by several railway lines; the main ones are the Keiyo Line and Sobu Line. The Musashino Line connects Chiba to Saitama and northern Tokyo. Southern Chiba is connected to Kanagawa Prefecture by the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line bridge-tunnel.\nPrefectural symbols.\nChiba is famous for peanuts. Most of Japan's peanuts are harvested in this prefecture and are also processed into peanut oil.\nShrines and Temples.\n\"Awa jinja\" and \"Tamasaki jinja\" are the chief Shinto shrines (\"ichinomiya\") in the prefecture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Prefecture Japan"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":5},{"uri":"Prefectures_of_Japan","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":14},{"uri":"Kant%C5%8D_region","surface_form":"Kant\u014D region","offset":32},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":62},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":74},{"uri":"Chiba%2C_Chiba","surface_form":"Chiba City","offset":90},{"uri":"List_of_Provinces_of_Japan","surface_form":"old province","offset":221},{"uri":"Awa_Province_(Chiba)","surface_form":"Awa","offset":237},{"uri":"Kazusa_Province","surface_form":"Kazusa","offset":242},{"uri":"Shim%C5%8Dsa_Province","surface_form":"Shim\u014Dsa","offset":253},{"uri":"Ibaraki_Prefecture","surface_form":"Ibaraki Prefecture","offset":287},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":338},{"uri":"Saitama_Prefecture","surface_form":"Saitama Prefecture","offset":348},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":401},{"uri":"Tokyo_Bay","surface_form":"Tokyo Bay","offset":431},{"uri":"B%C5%8Ds%C5%8D_Peninsula","surface_form":"B\u014Ds\u014D Peninsula","offset":503},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":521},{"uri":"Kant%C5%8D_region","surface_form":"Kant\u014D region","offset":706},{"uri":"Kuroshio_Current","surface_form":"Kuroshio Current","offset":787},{"uri":"Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries","surface_form":"Kawasaki Steel","offset":1216},{"uri":"Land_reclamation","surface_form":"land reclamation","offset":1294},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factories","offset":1394},{"uri":"Warehouse","surface_form":"warehouse","offset":1405},{"uri":"Dock","surface_form":"dock","offset":1421},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":1560},{"uri":"Hokkaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Hokkaid\u014D","offset":1761},{"uri":"Seaweed","surface_form":"Seaweed","offset":1838},{"uri":"International_Chiba_Ekiden","surface_form":"International Chiba Ekiden","offset":1961},{"uri":"Chiba_International_Cross_Country","surface_form":"Chiba International Cross Country","offset":1996},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":2091},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":2121},{"uri":"Narita_International_Airport","surface_form":"Narita International Airport","offset":2169},{"uri":"Narita%2C_Chiba","surface_form":"Narita","offset":2220},{"uri":"East_Japan_Railway_Company","surface_form":"East Japan Railway","offset":2289},{"uri":"Narita_Express","surface_form":"Narita Express","offset":2311},{"uri":"Keisei_Electric_Railway","surface_form":"Keisei Electric Railway","offset":2335},{"uri":"Skyliner","surface_form":"Skyliner","offset":2362},{"uri":"Tokyo_Disney_Resort","surface_form":"Tokyo Disney Resort","offset":2386},{"uri":"Urayasu","surface_form":"Urayasu","offset":2412},{"uri":"Kamogawa_Sea_World","surface_form":"Kamogawa Sea World","offset":2467},{"uri":"Kamogawa_city","surface_form":"Kamogawa city","offset":2633},{"uri":"Kuj%C5%ABkuri_Beach","surface_form":"Kuj\u016Bkuri Beach","offset":2727},{"uri":"Onjuku_Beach","surface_form":"Onjuku Beach","offset":2747},{"uri":"Keiyo_Line","surface_form":"Keiyo Line","offset":2834},{"uri":"Sobu_Line","surface_form":"Sobu Line","offset":2849},{"uri":"Musashino_Line","surface_form":"Musashino Line","offset":2864},{"uri":"Kanagawa_Prefecture","surface_form":"Kanagawa Prefecture","offset":2956},{"uri":"Tokyo_Bay_Aqua-Line","surface_form":"Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line","offset":2983},{"uri":"Peanut","surface_form":"peanut","offset":3059},{"uri":"Awa_jinja","surface_form":"Awa jinja","offset":3187},{"uri":"Tamasaki_jinja","surface_form":"Tamasaki jinja","offset":3203},{"uri":"Shinto_shrine","surface_form":"Shinto shrine","offset":3233},{"uri":"Ichinomiya","surface_form":"ichinomiya","offset":3250}]}
