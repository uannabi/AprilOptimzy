He grew up in Brooklyn and moved to Chicago where he led a crime syndicate in the Prohibition-era that was known as the \"Capones\". The Capones were known for smuggling, bootlegging liquor and prostitution in Chicago, Illinois from around the 1920s until 1931. Capone's organized crime reign ended in 1931, when he was put on trial for federal income tax evasion. Found guilty, Capone was sentenced to 11 years in prison.\nCapone was released from his sentence in 1939, suffering from an advanced case of syphilis. Capone died in 1947 after he suffered a stroke. He regained consciousness and caught pneumonia and later had a fatal cardiac arrest. On January 25, 1947 Al Capone died in his home, surrounded by his family. Michael Jackson made a song called \"Al Capone\" for his 1987 album \"Bad\". It was not put on the album. The song was released on the second disc of the 25th Anniversary re-release of \"Bad\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian_American","surface_form":"Italian-American","offset":74},{"uri":"Gangster","surface_form":"gangster","offset":91},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":115},{"uri":"Smuggling","surface_form":"smuggling","offset":259},{"uri":"Bootlegging","surface_form":"bootlegging","offset":270},{"uri":"Alcoholic_drink","surface_form":"liquor","offset":282},{"uri":"Prostitution","surface_form":"prostitution","offset":293},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":309},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":318},{"uri":"Tax_evasion","surface_form":"tax evasion","offset":451},{"uri":"Syphilis","surface_form":"syphilis","offset":604},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":654},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":674},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":699},{"uri":"Cardiac_arrest","surface_form":"cardiac arrest","offset":731},{"uri":"Michael_Jackson","surface_form":"Michael Jackson","offset":821},{"uri":"Bad_(album)","surface_form":"Bad","offset":888}]}
