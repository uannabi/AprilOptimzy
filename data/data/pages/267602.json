{"id":267602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_tellurite","text":"Sodium tellurite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Na2TeO3. It contains sodium and tellurite ions.\nProperties.\nSodium tellurite is a colorless solid. The tellurite ion can react with water to make sodium hydrogen tellurite, NaHTeO3. It dissolves in water easily. It is a weak oxidizing agent (can be reduced to tellurium) and a weak reducing agent (can be oxidized to tellurates). It is part of the process in making tellurium.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting tellurium dioxide with sodium hydroxide, or by heating a telluride in air with sodium carbonate.\nUses.\nSodium tellurite is used in making tellurium. It is also used to make electroplated nickel corrosion-resistant. It can also be used to add a bluish coating to steel. It can be used to isolate certain types of bacteria that it is not toxic to.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":22},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":86},{"uri":"Tellurite","surface_form":"tellurite","offset":97},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":107},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":290},{"uri":"Tellurium","surface_form":"tellurium","offset":325},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":347},{"uri":"Tellurate","surface_form":"tellurate","offset":382},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":478},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":501},{"uri":"Telluride","surface_form":"telluride","offset":535},{"uri":"Sodium_carbonate","surface_form":"sodium carbonate","offset":557},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplated","offset":651},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":665},{"uri":"Corrosion","surface_form":"corrosion","offset":672},{"uri":"Isolate","surface_form":"isolate","offset":765}]}
