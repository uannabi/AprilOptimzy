{"id":267605,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurate","text":"=\"preserve\">Tellurate is an ion. Its chemical formula is TeO42- or TeO66-. Chemical compounds having the tellurate ion in them are called tellurates. Tellurates are strong oxidizing agents. They are similar to selenates. Tellurates react with acids to make telluric acid.\nAn example is sodium tellurate (Na2TeO4). It is made by reacting telluric acid with sodium hydroxide. It can also be made by oxidizing sodium tellurite. It is similar to sodium selenate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":28},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"Chemical compound","offset":75},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":172},{"uri":"Selenate","surface_form":"selenate","offset":210},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":243},{"uri":"Telluric_acid","surface_form":"telluric acid","offset":257},{"uri":"Telluric_acid","surface_form":"telluric acid","offset":337},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":356},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidizing","offset":397},{"uri":"Sodium_tellurite","surface_form":"sodium tellurite","offset":407},{"uri":"Sodium_selenate","surface_form":"sodium selenate","offset":442}]}
