{"id":267608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_telluride","text":"Hydrogen telluride, also known as hydrotelluric acid, tellane, or tellurium hydride, is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is H2Te. It contains hydrogen and telluride ions.\nProperties.\nHydrogen telluride is a toxic reactive gas. It easily decomposes to hydrogen and tellurium. It also burns in air to make tellurium dioxide and water. It has a very bad smell of decayed garlic. It is almost as acidic as phosphoric acid. It reacts with some metals and metal oxides to make tellurides.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by adding a strong acid to a telluride, such as sodium telluride.\nUses.\nHydrogen telluride does not have many uses because it is very toxic and unstable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":90},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":123},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":171},{"uri":"Telluride","surface_form":"telluride","offset":184},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":194},{"uri":"Tellurium","surface_form":"tellurium","offset":293},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":333},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":431},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":468},{"uri":"Sodium_telluride","surface_form":"sodium telluride","offset":584}]}
