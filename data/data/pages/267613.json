{"id":267613,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_telluride","text":"Sodium telluride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Na2Te. It contains sodium and telluride ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a white solid when pure. It reacts with air to make a mixture of tellurium and tellurides, which would make gray or purple colors. It eventually turns into sodium carbonate and tellurium when in air. It is a powerful reducing agent. It reacts with strong acids to make hydrogen telluride. It reacts with water to make sodium hydrogen telluride, NaHTe.\nPreparation.\nSodium telluride is made by reacting tellurium and sodium in liquid ammonia.\nUses.\nSodium telluride is used to make organic tellurium compounds. It also can act as a reducing agent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":22},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":84},{"uri":"Telluride","surface_form":"telluride","offset":95},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":105},{"uri":"Tellurium","surface_form":"tellurium","offset":194},{"uri":"Sodium_carbonate","surface_form":"sodium carbonate","offset":285},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":346},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":384},{"uri":"Hydrogen_telluride","surface_form":"hydrogen telluride","offset":398},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":562},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":610}]}
