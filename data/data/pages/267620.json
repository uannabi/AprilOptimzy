It contains cadmium and telluride ions.\nProperties.\nCadmium telluride is a black solid. It reacts with acids to make toxic cadmium compounds and toxic hydrogen telluride gas. It does not dissolve in water.\nUses.\nCadmium telluride is used to make electricity in solar cells. It is one of the best things. It can be mixed with mercury to make mercury cadmium telluride, good in infrared detectors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":23},{"uri":"Cadmium","surface_form":"cadmium","offset":84},{"uri":"Telluride","surface_form":"telluride","offset":96},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":106},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":175},{"uri":"Hydrogen_telluride","surface_form":"hydrogen telluride","offset":223},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":318},{"uri":"Solar_cell","surface_form":"solar cell","offset":333},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":397}]}
