{"id":26766,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","text":"The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a protocol related to computers and networks of computers. It is referred to as DHCP for short. It was made so that computers could connect to other computers (on a network) automatically. To be able to access the Internet (or any computer network), an IP address is needed. DHCP allows for this IP address to be obtained automatically. Other data, like a DNS Nameserver, or a time server can also be obtained that way. Finally, computers that support it can even get a disk image they boot from over the network.\nThe address can be dynamic (it can change), or it can be static (it stays the same). After a certain time, the address lease has to be renewed.\nDHCP is one of the most complicated IP protocols in networks of computers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protocol","surface_form":"protocol","offset":46},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":66},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":80},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":258},{"uri":"DNS","surface_form":"DNS","offset":400},{"uri":"Time_server","surface_form":"time server","offset":421},{"uri":"Disk_image","surface_form":"disk image","offset":514}]}
