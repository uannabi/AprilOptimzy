{"id":267680,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimane_Prefecture","text":"is a Japanese prefecture in the Ch\u016Bgoku region of the island of Honshu. The capital is the city of Matsue. It has the second smallest population of any prefecture in Japan.\nShimane Prefecture is part of the San'in area. San'in means \"the shady side of the mountains\". There is a mountain range separating Shimane and neighboring Tottori from Hiroshima and Okayama. That means that the weather here is much wetter than further to the south.\nHistory.\nThe area of Shimane Prefecture includes the old provinces of Iwami Province, Izumo Province, and Oki Province.\nEarly history.\nThe history of Shimane starts with Japanese mythology. In these myths, the Shinto god \u014Ckuninushi lived in Izumo, an old province in Shimane. Izumo Shrine honors this god.\nLater on in the Kamakura period, the Kamakura Shogunate forced Emperor Gotoba and Emperor Godaigo into exile on Oki Island. Emperor Godaigo got away from Oki and successfully fought back against the shogunate.\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Muromachi period, many clans fought over this area because there was a lot of silver. The Kyogoku clan controlled Izumo and Oki. However, after the \u014Cnin War, the Amago clan in Gassan-Toda castle increased in power, and the Masuda clan controlled Iwami. Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine was in between Amago clan territory and Masuda clan territory, so there were many battles between these lords for the large amount of silver. However, in 1566 Mouri Motonari (\u6BDB\u5229\u5143\u5C31) conquered Izumo, Iwami, and Oki. After over 30 years of Mori control, in 1600 Horio Yoshiharu entered Izumo and Oki after the Battle of Sekigahara which Mouri lost. Horio Yoshiharu decided to move and build Matsue Castle instead of Gassan-Toda. The castle was completed soon after Yoshiharu's death. Later in 1638, the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Matsudaira Naomasa entered the castle because the Horio clan had no heir. Matsudaira's family ruled until the end of the han system.\nThe Iwami area was split into 3 clans. The mining district was under direct control of the Shogunate. The Hamada clan and the Tsuwano clan each controlled their own areas. Iwami Ginzan produced silver and was one of the nation's largest silver mine by the early 17th century. The Hamada clan was on the shogunate's side in the Meiji Restoration, and the castle was burned down. The Tsuwano clan, despite the Matsudaira (relative of the shogun) rule was on the emperor's side in the restoration.\nGeography.\nShimane faces the Sea of Japan on its north. Its southeastern border meets Tottori Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture and Yamaguchi Prefecture.\nNational Parks.\nNational Parks are established in about 6% of the total land area of the prefecture.\nShrines and Temples.\n\"Izumo taisha\", \"Mononobe jinja\", \"Mizuwakasu jinja\" and \"Yurahime jinja\" are the chief Shinto shrines (\"ichinomiya\") in the prefecture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":5},{"uri":"Prefectures_of_Japan","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":14},{"uri":"Ch%C5%ABgoku_region","surface_form":"Ch\u016Bgoku region","offset":32},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":64},{"uri":"Matsue%2C_Shimane","surface_form":"Matsue","offset":99},{"uri":"Tottori_Prefecture","surface_form":"Tottori","offset":329},{"uri":"Hiroshima_Prefecture","surface_form":"Hiroshima","offset":342},{"uri":"Okayama_Prefecture","surface_form":"Okayama","offset":356},{"uri":"List_of_Provinces_of_Japan","surface_form":"old provinces","offset":493},{"uri":"Iwami_Province","surface_form":"Iwami Province","offset":510},{"uri":"Izumo_Province","surface_form":"Izumo Province","offset":526},{"uri":"Oki_Province","surface_form":"Oki Province","offset":546},{"uri":"Izumo_Province","surface_form":"Izumo","offset":681},{"uri":"%C5%8Cnin_War","surface_form":"\u014Cnin War","offset":1128},{"uri":"Iwami_Province","surface_form":"Iwami","offset":1226},{"uri":"Iwami_Ginzan_Silver_Mine","surface_form":"Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine","offset":1233},{"uri":"Tokugawa_Ieyasu","surface_form":"Tokugawa Ieyasu","offset":1770},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":2114},{"uri":"Meiji_Restoration","surface_form":"Meiji Restoration","offset":2247},{"uri":"Sea_of_Japan","surface_form":"Sea of Japan","offset":2444},{"uri":"Tottori_Prefecture","surface_form":"Tottori Prefecture","offset":2501},{"uri":"Hiroshima_Prefecture","surface_form":"Hiroshima Prefecture","offset":2521},{"uri":"Yamaguchi_Prefecture","surface_form":"Yamaguchi Prefecture","offset":2546},{"uri":"Shinto_shrine","surface_form":"Shinto shrine","offset":2778},{"uri":"Ichinomiya","surface_form":"ichinomiya","offset":2795}]}
