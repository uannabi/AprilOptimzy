{"id":26769,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi","text":"Aldi is a supermarket in Germany and in most parts of the European Union. Aldi shops are also in Australia and the United States. Most German towns and villages have at least one Aldi shop. There are about 4,100 stores in Germany, and 7,600 worldwide. The name of the shop stands for \"ALbrecht-DI'\"scount\".\nThe company is a food retailer, but it also sells non-food at times. In the 1990s, Aldi often sold computers that were sought after. Aldi has a reputation for being cheap. It forces its suppliers to sell to them at low prices.\nHistory.\nThe company was started in 1913 as a family grocery business in Essen. In 1946, brothers Karl Albrecht (1920-2014) and Theo Albrecht (1922-2010) took over the business from their mother. Theo had been held by the US in a prisoner of war camp. They started the idea of discount shops in Germany. They decided to have a limited range of goods and sell them at a discount price. In 1960, the company was split into Aldi Nord (Aldi North) under the control of Theo, and Aldi S\u00FCd (Aldi South) under the control of Karl. The brothers became billionaires. In 2009 Karl's wealth was estimated to be \u20AC25 billion. Theo was kidnapped in 1971 and held prisoner for 17 days until a seven million mark ransom was paid. The family have avoided publicity and there are few known photographs of them.\nAustralia.\nAldi started in Australia in 2001. At the end of 2010 there were 210 Aldi stores in eastern Australia and the company were planning to open 20-30 stores each year. In 2009 the Australian stores made a profit of AU$91.94 million, up 27% on 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["company"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":25},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":58},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":97},{"uri":"Supply","surface_form":"suppliers","offset":493},{"uri":"Essen","surface_form":"Essen","offset":607},{"uri":"Karl_Albrecht","surface_form":"Karl Albrecht","offset":632},{"uri":"Theo_Albrecht","surface_form":"Theo Albrecht","offset":662},{"uri":"Prisoner_of_war","surface_form":"prisoner of war","offset":764}]}
