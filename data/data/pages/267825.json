{"id":267825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmosauridae","text":"Ophthalmosauridae were a family of Ichthyosaurs which lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Upper Cretaceous period.\nWithin Ophthalmosauridae there are two lineages, one including \"Aegirosaurus\" and \"Ophthalmosaurus\", and the other including \"Brachypterygius\", \"Caypullisaurus\" and \"Platypterygius\".\nOnly three genera survived the end-Jurassic extinction event: \"Caypullisaurus\", \"Maiaspondylus\", and \"Platypterygius\". They did, however, have a worldwide distribution. The last to survive was \"Platypterygius\". This genus became extinct about 30 million years before the end of the Upper Cretaceous period. It happened when there was a deep ocean anoxic event, which wiped out all the animals below pelagic waters. Ichthyosaurs, being reptiles, came to the surface to breath, but the extinction event removed their prey species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":25},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"Ichthyosaur","offset":35},{"uri":"Middle_Jurassic","surface_form":"Middle Jurassic","offset":69},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":92},{"uri":"Ophthalmosaurus","surface_form":"Ophthalmosaurus","offset":200},{"uri":"Caypullisaurus","surface_form":"Caypullisaurus","offset":262},{"uri":"Platypterygius","surface_form":"Platypterygius","offset":283},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":529},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":582},{"uri":"Deep_ocean_anoxic_event","surface_form":"deep ocean anoxic event","offset":636},{"uri":"Pelagic","surface_form":"pelagic","offset":699},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":735},{"uri":"Extinction_event","surface_form":"extinction event","offset":784},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":815}]}
