{"id":267839,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metriacanthosaurus","text":"\"Metriacanthosaurus\" is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. Its name means \"Moderate-spined lizard\", because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat-eating dinosaurs such as \"Allosaurus\", but shorter than those of other meat-eating dinosaurs, such as \"Acrocanthosaurus\". Like most theropods, \"Metriacanthosaurus\" was a meat-eater. It had three fingers on each hand. Each finger ended in a sharp, hook-like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws. It probably preyed on the large, long-necked sauropods, such as \"Pelorosaurus\", that lived in the same time and place as it. It was originally classified as a megalosaurid, but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family, the Metriacanthosauridae\nIn popular culture.\nIn \"Jurassic Park\", one of the vials of dinosaur DNA that Dennis Nedry steals is labeled \"Metriacanthosaurus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":259},{"uri":"Acrocanthosaurus","surface_form":"Acrocanthosaurus","offset":336},{"uri":"Theropods","surface_form":"theropods","offset":365},{"uri":"Pelorosaurus","surface_form":"Pelorosaurus","offset":633},{"uri":"Megalosaurid","surface_form":"megalosaurid","offset":727},{"uri":"Metriacanthosauridae","surface_form":"Metriacanthosauridae","offset":804},{"uri":"Jurassic_Park","surface_form":"Jurassic Park","offset":849}]}
