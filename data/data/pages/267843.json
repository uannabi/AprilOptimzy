{"id":267843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt","text":"A flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava.\nFlood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory, creating great plateaus and mountain ranges. Flood basalts have erupted at various times throughout Earth history. They are clear evidence that the Earth has periods of higher activity rather than being in a uniform steady state.\nOne explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting. Then a mantle plume produces vast quantities of a basaltic magma. These have a low viscosity, which is why they 'flood' rather than form taller volcanoes.\nFlood basalts start at between 100 and 400\u00A0km depth, in the asthenosphere. To get a partial melting as large as that of the traps, expelling huge quantities of lava, it is necessary to have a large heat input. Such melting can take place near a hotspot, resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume.\nExamples.\nThe Emeishan Traps in southwestern China, around Sichuan province, the Deccan Traps of central India, the Siberian Traps, and the Columbia River Plateau of western North America are four large regions covered by prehistoric flood basalts. The two largest flood basalt events in historic time have been at Eldgj\u00E1 and Lakagigar, both in Iceland. The largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain on Earth is part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in Canada. The maria on the Moon are additional, even more extensive, flood basalts. Flood basalts on the ocean floor produce oceanic plateaus.\nThe surface covered by one eruption can vary from around 200,000\u00A0km\u00B2 (Karoo) to 1,500,000\u00A0km\u00B2 (Siberian Traps). The thickness can vary from 2000 metres (Deccan Traps) to 12,000 m (Lake Superior). These are smaller than the original volumes due to erosion.\nAnother example of a lava plateau is the Giant's Causeway, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is was originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateau.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"volcanic eruption","offset":55},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":138},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":155},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":162},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":215},{"uri":"Prehistory","surface_form":"prehistory","offset":228},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":255},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":268},{"uri":"Earth_history","surface_form":"Earth history","offset":340},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":388},{"uri":"Rift_(geology)","surface_form":"continental rifting","offset":550},{"uri":"Melting","surface_form":"melting","offset":589},{"uri":"Mantle_plume","surface_form":"mantle plume","offset":605},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":648},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":657},{"uri":"Viscosity","surface_form":"viscosity","offset":681},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":742},{"uri":"Asthenosphere","surface_form":"asthenosphere","offset":813},{"uri":"Melting","surface_form":"melting","offset":845},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":951},{"uri":"Hotspot_(geology)","surface_form":"hotspot","offset":998},{"uri":"Emeishan_Traps","surface_form":"Emeishan Traps","offset":1135},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1166},{"uri":"Sichuan","surface_form":"Sichuan","offset":1180},{"uri":"Deccan_Traps","surface_form":"Deccan Traps","offset":1202},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1226},{"uri":"Siberian_Traps","surface_form":"Siberian Traps","offset":1237},{"uri":"Columbia_River","surface_form":"Columbia River","offset":1261},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1295},{"uri":"Eldgj%C3%A1","surface_form":"Eldgj\u00E1","offset":1436},{"uri":"Lakagigar","surface_form":"Lakagigar","offset":1447},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":1466},{"uri":"Mackenzie_Large_Igneous_Province","surface_form":"Mackenzie Large Igneous Province","offset":1563},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1599},{"uri":"Lunar_mare","surface_form":"maria","offset":1611},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":1624},{"uri":"Ocean_floor","surface_form":"ocean floor","offset":1702},{"uri":"Karoo-Ferrar","surface_form":"Karoo","offset":1810},{"uri":"Lake_Superior","surface_form":"Lake Superior","offset":1920},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":1972},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":1987},{"uri":"Giant%27s_Causeway","surface_form":"Giant's Causeway","offset":2037},{"uri":"County_Antrim","surface_form":"County Antrim","offset":2058},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":2073}]}
