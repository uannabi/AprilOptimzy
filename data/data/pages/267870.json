{"id":267870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurous_acid","text":"Tellurous acid is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is H2TeO3. It contains hydrogen and tellurite ions. It can be made by reacting tellurium dioxide with water. It is not made as easily as telluric acid.\nIt is a weak oxidizing agent and a weak reducing agent. It easily turns back into tellurium dioxide and water. It is a weak acid. It reacts with bases to make tellurites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":20},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":53},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":103},{"uri":"Tellurite","surface_form":"tellurite","offset":116},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":126},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":159},{"uri":"Telluric_acid","surface_form":"telluric acid","offset":217},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":245},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":272},{"uri":"Weak_acid","surface_form":"weak acid","offset":351},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":377}]}
