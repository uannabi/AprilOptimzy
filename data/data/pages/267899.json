{"id":267899,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral","text":"In Euclidean plane geometry, a quadrilateral is a polygon with four edges (or sides) and four vertices (or corners). Sometimes, the term quadrangle is used (similar to the term \"triangle\"), while other times, the term tetragon is used (similar to pentagon, 5-sided polygon, and hexagon, 6-sided polygon). A quadrilateral with vertices formula_1, formula_1, formula_1, formula_1 is sometimes written as formula_1.\nThe origin of the word quadrilateral is the two Latin words \"quadri\", a variant of four, and \"latus\", meaning \"side\".\nQuadrilaterals can be either complex, also called crossed (self-intersecting), or simple (not self-intersecting). Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave.\nAll the sides of a quadrilateral are straight, and the interior angles of a quadrilateral add up to 360\u00B0.\nThis is a special case of the \"n\"-gon interior angle sum formula: (\"n\" \u2212 2) \u00D7 180\u00B0.\nAll non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.\nThere are 6 special kinds of quadrilaterals; square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, kite, and trapezoid. Technically, squares, rectangles, and rhombuses are types of parallelograms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Euclidean_geometry","surface_form":"Euclidean plane geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":50},{"uri":"Edge_(geometry)","surface_form":"edges","offset":68},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"vertices","offset":94},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":178},{"uri":"Pentagon","surface_form":"pentagon","offset":247},{"uri":"Hexagon","surface_form":"hexagon","offset":278},{"uri":"Complex_polygon","surface_form":"complex","offset":560},{"uri":"Simple_polygon","surface_form":"simple","offset":613},{"uri":"Convex_polygon","surface_form":"convex","offset":678},{"uri":"Concave_polygon","surface_form":"concave","offset":688},{"uri":"Internal_and_external_angle","surface_form":"interior angles","offset":752},{"uri":"Tessellation","surface_form":"tile the plane","offset":924},{"uri":"Square","surface_form":"square","offset":1043},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangle","offset":1051},{"uri":"Rhombus","surface_form":"rhombus","offset":1062},{"uri":"Parallelogram","surface_form":"parallelogram","offset":1071},{"uri":"Kite_(geometry)","surface_form":"kite","offset":1086},{"uri":"Trapezoid","surface_form":"trapezoid","offset":1096}]}
