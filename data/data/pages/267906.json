{"id":267906,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelorosaurus","text":"\"Pelorosaurus conybeari\" is the name given to a few sauropod dinosaur bones from the Lower Cretaceous period, about 138\u2013112 million years ago.\nBones of \"Pelorosaurus\" have been found in England and Portugal. It was a Brachiosaur, with front legs that were longer than its hind legs.\nThe name has been challenged, and has been the subject of long-lasting dispute. Some palaeontologists prefer the name \"Cetiosaurus brevis\".\nThe taxonomic status of \"Pelorosaurus\" is as a result very problematic. Technically, \"Cetiosaurus brevis\" is its type species. The position of \"Pelorosaurus\" is further undermined by the fact that several researchers hold that the genus is a \"nomen dubium\" ('doubtful name').\n\"Pelorosaurus\" was one of the first dinosaurs described, and the naming procedures were not so well-developed at the time. Its life-style is assumed to be similar to other brachiosaurs, eating from the higher branches of tall conifer trees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":52},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":61},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":85},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":186},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":198},{"uri":"Brachiosaur","surface_form":"Brachiosaur","offset":217},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":925}]}
