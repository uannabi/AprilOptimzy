She banned Leto from giving birth on any mainland or island known.\nLeto found the island of Delos, which floated and so was not an island or mainland, and gave birth there. Hera then locked up the goddess of childbirth, Eilethyia, so she could not give birth to the twins. Then, all the other goddesses convinced her to let her free so she could finally give birth. Leto gave birth to Artemis without any problem. However she was in labor with Apollo for nine days. Artemis helped Leto to give birth to Apollo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":24},{"uri":"Twelve_Olympians","surface_form":"Twelve Olympians","offset":59},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":100},{"uri":"Leto","surface_form":"Leto","offset":109},{"uri":"Twin","surface_form":"twin","offset":126},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":141},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":175},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"wilderness","offset":205},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":278},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman","offset":335},{"uri":"Diana","surface_form":"Diana","offset":349}]}
