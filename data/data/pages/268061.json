{"id":268061,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurium(IV)_fluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Tellurium(IV) fluoride, also known as tellurium tetrafluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is TeF4. It contains tellurium in its +4 oxidation state. It also contains fluoride ions.\nProperties.\nTellurium(IV) fluoride is a white solid. It reacts with water to make tellurium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid. It reacts with many metals when heated.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting tellurium dioxide with sulfur tetrafluoride. It can also be made by reacting cold fluorine with tellurium. Another way is reacting selenium tetrafluoride with warm tellurium dioxide. Fluorine can also react with tellurium(II) chloride or tellurium(II) bromide to make tellurium(IV) fluoride.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":80},{"uri":"Tellurium","surface_form":"tellurium","offset":141},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":161},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":195},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":204},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":292},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":314},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":409},{"uri":"Sulfur_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur tetrafluoride","offset":432},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":491},{"uri":"Selenium_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"selenium tetrafluoride","offset":540},{"uri":"Tellurium(II)_chloride","surface_form":"tellurium(II) chloride","offset":621},{"uri":"Tellurium(II)_bromide","surface_form":"tellurium(II) bromide","offset":647}]}
