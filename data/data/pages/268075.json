{"id":268075,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluric_acid","text":"Telluric acid is a chemical compound. It is an acid. Its chemical formula is H6TeO6. It contains hydrogen and tellurate ions. It contains the TeO66- form of the tellurate ion.\nTelluric acid is a weak acid. It reacts with strong bases to make tellurates. It is a powerful oxidizing agents. It can be dehydrated to make tellurium trioxide. The metatelluric acid, H2TeO4, does not exist.\nTelluric acid can be made by reacting tellurium dioxide with chromium trioxide or hydrogen peroxide.\nIt is used to make other tellurates such as sodium tellurate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":19},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":47},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":97},{"uri":"Tellurate","surface_form":"tellurate","offset":110},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":120},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":228},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":271},{"uri":"Tellurium_trioxide","surface_form":"tellurium trioxide","offset":318},{"uri":"Tellurium_dioxide","surface_form":"tellurium dioxide","offset":423},{"uri":"Chromium_trioxide","surface_form":"chromium trioxide","offset":446},{"uri":"Hydrogen_peroxide","surface_form":"hydrogen peroxide","offset":467},{"uri":"Sodium_tellurate","surface_form":"sodium tellurate","offset":530}]}
