{"id":268181,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_nitrate","text":"Lithium nitrate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiNO3. It contains lithium and nitrate ions.\nProperties.\nLithium nitrate is a colorless solid. It makes a red flame when heated. It is an oxidizing agent. It breaks down when heated into lithium oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen.\nPreparation.\nThis metal can be made by reacting lithium, lithium hydroxide, lithium oxide, or lithium carbonate with nitric acid.\nUses.\nLithium nitrate is used in fireworks to make a red color. It is also used in flares.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":21},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":83},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":95},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":103},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":202},{"uri":"Lithium_oxide","surface_form":"lithium oxide","offset":251},{"uri":"Nitrogen_dioxide","surface_form":"nitrogen dioxide","offset":266},{"uri":"Lithium_hydroxide","surface_form":"lithium hydroxide","offset":353},{"uri":"Lithium_carbonate","surface_form":"lithium carbonate","offset":390},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":413},{"uri":"Fireworks","surface_form":"fireworks","offset":459},{"uri":"Flare","surface_form":"flare","offset":509}]}
