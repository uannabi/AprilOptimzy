{"id":268186,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_peroxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Lithium peroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li2O2. It contains lithium and peroxide ions.\nProperties.\nLithium peroxide is a white solid. It gives off oxygen when heated. It is an oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nLithium peroxide is made by reacting lithium hydroxide with hydrogen peroxide and removing the water.\nUses.\nIt is used to absorb carbon dioxide on spaceships. It also releases oxygen when it absorbs carbon dioxide.\nSafety.\nLithium peroxide reacts violently with water to make oxygen. It also is an oxidizing agent and can catch things on fire. It is corrosive because it is basic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":34},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":96},{"uri":"Peroxide","surface_form":"peroxide","offset":108},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":117},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":212},{"uri":"Lithium_hydroxide","surface_form":"lithium hydroxide","offset":279},{"uri":"Hydrogen_peroxide","surface_form":"hydrogen peroxide","offset":302},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":371},{"uri":"Spaceship","surface_form":"spaceship","offset":389},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":616}]}
