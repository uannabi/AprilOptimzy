It believes that the necessary advance of the world toward a more highly organized political and economic order renders free criticism of governments, administrations, and institutions imperative. And since freedom implies voluntary restraint, members pledge themselves to oppose such evils of a free press as mendacious publication, deliberate falsehood, and distortion of facts for political and personal ends.\nWriters in Prison Committee.\nInternational PEN's Writers in Prison Committee works to help persecuted writers worldwide. The Writers in Prison Committee monitors the cases of over 900 writers who have been imprisoned, tortured, threatened, attacked, made to disappear, and killed for the peaceful practice of their profession. It publishes a bi-annual [http://pen.org/media/CasepdfJune05.pdf Case List] documenting free expression violations against writers around the world. This committee was started in 1960 in response to increasing attempts to silence voices of dissent by imprisoning writers,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Writers","surface_form":"writers","offset":61},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":88},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":394},{"uri":"Freedom_of_expression","surface_form":"freedom of expression","offset":488},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":651},{"uri":"United_Nations_Educational%2C_Scientific_and_Cultural_Organization","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":776},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":859},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":909},{"uri":"Catherine_Amy_Dawson_Scott","surface_form":"Catherine Amy Dawson Scott","offset":927},{"uri":"John_Galsworthy","surface_form":"John Galsworthy","offset":955},{"uri":"Joseph_Conrad","surface_form":"Joseph Conrad","offset":1023},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Craig_(chef)","surface_form":"Elizabeth Craig","offset":1038},{"uri":"George_Bernard_Shaw","surface_form":"George Bernard Shaw","offset":1055},{"uri":"H.G._Wells","surface_form":"H.G.
