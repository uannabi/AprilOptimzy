Hu Jintao also served as the President of the People's Republic of China from 2003 to 2013 and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission from 2004 to 2012.\nHu was born in Taizhou, Jiangsu. Hu left office of General Secretary on 15 November 2012 and the office was taken by Xi Jinping.\nHu Jintao was educated as a hydraulic engineer from Tsinghua University in 1965. According to official biographies, he has a photographic memory. Politically, he is moderate and careful. He spent most of his previous career in Tibet and the poorer provinces, and was therefore unknown to Western analysts until he unexpectedly became the General Secretary (paramount leader). Even as a general secretary, he was quite private - and so has never given an interview.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Chinese"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paramount_leader","surface_form":"paramount leader","offset":70},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":90},{"uri":"General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"General Secretary of the Communist Party of China","offset":104},{"uri":"President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"President of the People's Republic of China","offset":202},{"uri":"Chairman_of_the_Central_Military_Commission","surface_form":"Chairman of the Central Military Commission","offset":272},{"uri":"Taizhou","surface_form":"Taizhou","offset":350},{"uri":"Jiangsu","surface_form":"Jiangsu","offset":359},{"uri":"Xi_Jinping","surface_form":"Xi Jinping","offset":452},{"uri":"Hydraulic_engineer","surface_form":"hydraulic engineer","offset":492},{"uri":"Tsinghua_University","surface_form":"Tsinghua University","offset":516},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":691}]}
