The prison was built in 1958 with aid from the Soviet Union and it is the only prison belonging to the Ministry of Public Security.\nThe majority of people in prison here are political prisoners. Some of them were participants in the Chinese democracy movement and Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Famous inmates include Jiang Qing, Bao Tong, Dai Qing, as well as Tibetans such as Choekyi Gyaltsen, the 10th Panchen Lama, and Phuntsok Wangyal. Other inmates included many communist cadres who were criticized during the Cultural Revolution, such as Bo Yibo, Peng Zhen, Israel Epstein, Sidney Rittenberg and David Crook. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo was also imprisoned here.\nThe prison is at the eastern foothill of Yanshan, facing the North China Plain in the east, north and south. The plain is where Qincheng Farm (\u79E6\u57CE\u519C\u573A) is, which is part of the prison.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":54},{"uri":"Changping_District","surface_form":"Changping District","offset":68},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":100},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":115},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":190},{"uri":"Ministry_of_Public_Security_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Ministry of Public Security","offset":246},{"uri":"Political_prisoner","surface_form":"political prisoner","offset":317},{"uri":"Chinese_democracy_movement","surface_form":"Chinese democracy movement","offset":376},{"uri":"Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989","surface_form":"Tiananmen Square protests of 1989","offset":407},{"uri":"Jiang_Qing","surface_form":"Jiang Qing","offset":465},{"uri":"Bao_Tong","surface_form":"Bao Tong","offset":477},{"uri":"Dai_Qing","surface_form":"Dai Qing","offset":487},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":508},{"uri":"Choekyi_Gyaltsen","surface_form":"Choekyi Gyaltsen","offset":525},{"uri":"Panchen_Lama","surface_form":"Panchen Lama","offset":552},{"uri":"Phuntsok_Wangyal","surface_form":"Phuntsok Wangyal","offset":570},{"uri":"Cadres","surface_form":"cadres","offset":626},{"uri":"Cultural_Revolution","surface_form":"Cultural Revolution","offset":664},{"uri":"Bo_Yibo","surface_form":"Bo Yibo","offset":693},{"uri":"Peng_Zhen","surface_form":"Peng Zhen","offset":702},{"uri":"Israel_Epstein","surface_form":"Israel Epstein","offset":713},{"uri":"Sidney_Rittenberg","surface_form":"Sidney Rittenberg","offset":729},{"uri":"David_Crook","surface_form":"David Crook","offset":751},{"uri":"Liu_Xiaobo","surface_form":"Liu Xiaobo","offset":794},{"uri":"Yanshan","surface_form":"Yanshan","offset":872},{"uri":"North_China_Plain","surface_form":"North China Plain","offset":892}]}
