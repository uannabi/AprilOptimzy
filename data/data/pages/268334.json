{"id":268334,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_pact","text":"=\"preserve\">A suicide pact is a plan of two or more people to kill themselves. People who agree on such a plan may kill themselves together, or they may just plan to do it on a certain schedule together. When studying suicide, suicide pacts are an important concept. Suicide pacts have occurred through history.\nNote that a suicide pact is different from mass suicide. In a mass suicide, many people commit suicide for the same reason. In a suicide pact, it might be that one person is suicidal because of romance, and the other is suicidal because of a disease, but they both wish to die.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"kill themselves","offset":62},{"uri":"Mass_suicide","surface_form":"mass suicide","offset":355}]}
