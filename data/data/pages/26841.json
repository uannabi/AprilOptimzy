Leto was the mother of the twins Artemis and Apollo, whose father was Zeus.\nAfter the twins were born, Leto played very little part in Greek mythology. She is the goddess of motherhood and one of Zeus' many wives.\nArtemis's and Apollo's birth.\nHera, who was Zeus's wife, discovered that Leto was pregnant and became very angry. She banned Leto from giving birth on any mainland or island known.\nLeto found the island of Delos, which floated and so was not an island nor mainland,and gave birth there. Leto gave birth to Artemis without any problem. However she was in labour with Apollo for nine days and nine nights. Artemis helped Leto to give birth to Apollo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":33},{"uri":"Koios","surface_form":"Coeus","offset":74},{"uri":"Phoebe_(titan)","surface_form":"Phoebe","offset":84},{"uri":"Titan_(mythology)","surface_form":"Titans","offset":101},{"uri":"Artemis","surface_form":"Artemis","offset":142},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":154},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":179},{"uri":"Hera","surface_form":"Hera","offset":353},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":405},{"uri":"Childbirth","surface_form":"labour","offset":677}]}
