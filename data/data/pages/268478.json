{"id":268478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio","text":"e=\"preserve\">Poisson's ratio (letter \"v\") is a measure of the contraction that happens when an object is stretched. This contraction is perpendicular to the stretching force. It can also expand as the object is compressed in a perpendicular direction.\nPoisson's ratio ranges from 0.0-0.5 for common materials, though for materials with certain structures, can be as low as -1. A material with a Poisson's ratio close to 0 (like cork) can be stretched a lot in the axial direction without changing much at all in the transverse, where as pulling on a material with a high Poisson's ratio (like rubber) will cause it to become much more narrow. A material with a negative Poisson's ratio will expand in all directions as it is stretched.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cork_(material)","surface_form":"cork","offset":428},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":593}]}
