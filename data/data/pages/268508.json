They normally oversee the actions of a corporation or other business. There are laws called bylaws that the board follows. They organize the business, appoint the CEO, organize budgets and take care of financial matters.\nWithin a board, directors commonly organize themselves into several committees, such as: audit committee, compensation committee, and human resource committee.\nUsually once a year, the board of directors invite shareholders to a meeting to talk about the company.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":47},{"uri":"Oversight","surface_form":"oversee","offset":69},{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":94},{"uri":"Bylaw","surface_form":"bylaws","offset":147},{"uri":"CEO","surface_form":"CEO","offset":218},{"uri":"Budget","surface_form":"budget","offset":232},{"uri":"Financial","surface_form":"financial","offset":257}]}
