Most made in the 20th century are mercury-in-glass thermometer<nowiki/>s. They are accurate and sensitive, having a narrow place where the mercury level rises very fast. A kink in the tube stops the mercury level from falling on it own.\nThese thermometers are used in clinics by doctors, it is a clinical thermometers they are also called a doctor's thermometers or medical thermometers. Most show both Celsius scale and Fahrenheit temperature scales, and run from 35 degree Celsius to 42 degree Celsius.\nMedical thermometers are cleaned before and after each use, with alcohol.\nFor centuries medical thermometers were large, and took many minutes to register a temperature. In the 1860s smaller, better ones were made, and thus thermometers were more often used. An ear thermometer was invented in the 1960s, which works quickly and easily. Digital thermometers became widespread in the late 20th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermometer","surface_form":"thermometer","offset":41},{"uri":"Body_temperature","surface_form":"body temperature","offset":75},{"uri":"Mercury-in-glass_thermometer","surface_form":"mercury-in-glass thermometer","offset":127},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":496},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Fahrenheit","offset":514},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":663}]}
