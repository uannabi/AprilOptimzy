{"id":268529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyptosaurus","text":"\"Aegyptosaurus\", meaning \"Egypt's Lizard\", is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in Africa around 95 million years ago during the Upper Cretaceous period. Like most sauropods, it had a long neck and a small skull. The animal's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass. Its tail also ended in a whip-like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs such as \"Carcharodontosaurus\" and \"Spinosaurus\".\n\"Aegyptosaurus\" was a close relative of \"Argentinosaurus\", a much larger dinosaur that lived in South America at about the same time. This suggests a possible land bridge between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period.\n\"Aegyptosaurus\" was discovered and named by a German paleontologist named Ernst Stromer in 1932. Its fossils were found in Egypt, Niger, and in several different locations in the Sahara Desert. All known specimens were discovered before 1939. The fossils were stored together in Munich, but were destroyed when an Allied bombing raid hit the museum in 1944, during World War II.\nThe type species is \"Aegyptosaurus baharijensis\", named after the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, where the first fossils were found.\n\"Aegyptosaurus\" was much smaller and more common than its contemporary, \"Paralititan\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":48},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":57},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":89},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":135},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":212},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":237},{"uri":"Carcharodontosaurus","surface_form":"Carcharodontosaurus","offset":406},{"uri":"Spinosaurus","surface_form":"Spinosaurus","offset":432},{"uri":"Argentinosaurus","surface_form":"Argentinosaurus","offset":487},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":542},{"uri":"Ernst_Stromer","surface_form":"Ernst Stromer","offset":754},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":803},{"uri":"Niger","surface_form":"Niger","offset":810},{"uri":"Sahara_Desert","surface_form":"Sahara Desert","offset":859},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":959},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1045},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":1063},{"uri":"Bahariya_Formation","surface_form":"Bahariya Formation","offset":1125},{"uri":"Paralititan","surface_form":"Paralititan","offset":1263}]}
