{"id":268592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Classical physics are the physics that were made before the 20th century. This part of physics studies things like movement, light, gravity, and electricity.\nMost of physics today uses ideas that are more complicated than the ideas of classical physics, because in the 20th century, physicists discovered two better ways to describe nature: the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.\nClassical physics turned out not to work when the things being studied were very, very small (around the size of atoms or smaller), or were moving very, very fast (around the speed of light). So, around the beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein worked out his Theory of Relativity and people like Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg. and Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger created quantum mechanics.\nHistory.\nSir Isaac Newton, and many scientists before him, helped create classical physics. They observed that some things in nature such as the falling of an apple occur the same way each time. Newton made equations that let him predict such events. He called these equations laws of physics.\nNewton's laws of physics have been tested by experiments and by using them in doing jobs. Sometimes things (like powerful winds) mess up the results of the experiment a bit, and the results come out a little wrong. But when people make efforts to get rid of these extra factors, the results of the experiments almost always get closer to what Newton's laws predict.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":39},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"movement","offset":128},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":138},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":145},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":158},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicists","offset":296},{"uri":"Theory_of_relativity","surface_form":"theory of relativity","offset":358},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":383},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atoms","offset":515},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":645},{"uri":"Special_relativity","surface_form":"Theory of Relativity","offset":676},{"uri":"Neils_Bohr","surface_form":"Neils Bohr","offset":713},{"uri":"Werner_Heisenberg","surface_form":"Werner Heisenberg","offset":725},{"uri":"Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger","surface_form":"Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger","offset":748},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":774},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":806},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":1000},{"uri":"Predict","surface_form":"predict","offset":1023},{"uri":"Laws_of_physics","surface_form":"laws of physics","offset":1070},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":1132}]}
