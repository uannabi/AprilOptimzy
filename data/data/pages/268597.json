{"id":268597,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_balloon","text":"A gas balloon is a kind of balloon that uses a gas of low density to fly using buoyancy. Gas balloons sometimes fly very high, very far, and for a very long time.\nA gas balloon is different from a hot air balloon. A hot air balloon uses a fire to lower\nthe density of air. A gas balloon does not use fire.\nThe most common use for gas balloons are to measure the atmosphere. These are called weather balloons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Balloon_(aircraft)","surface_form":"balloon","offset":27},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":58},{"uri":"Buoyancy","surface_form":"buoyancy","offset":79},{"uri":"Hot_air_balloon","surface_form":"hot air balloon","offset":197},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":268},{"uri":"Weather_balloon","surface_form":"weather balloon","offset":391}]}
