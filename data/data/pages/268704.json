{"id":268704,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism","text":"Les Fauves (French for \"The Wild Beasts\") was the name of a modern art movement in the early 20th century, led by the painters Henri Matisse and Andr\u00E9 Derain. The Fauves were a group of French painters who were influenced by the bright colours used by the Post-Impressionists Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin.\nThe bright colourful style of painting that they used began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, but the group was only together for three years, 1905\u20131907. In that time they had three exhibitions together. Their influence has continued until the present day, and was adopted or influenced many artists who are not usually thought of as fauvists. Aristarkh Lentulov is one good example.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":12},{"uri":"Modern_art","surface_form":"modern art","offset":60},{"uri":"Henri_Matisse","surface_form":"Henri Matisse","offset":127},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Derain","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Derain","offset":145},{"uri":"Post-Impressionists","surface_form":"Post-Impressionists","offset":256},{"uri":"Vincent_van_Gogh","surface_form":"Vincent van Gogh","offset":276},{"uri":"Paul_Gauguin","surface_form":"Paul Gauguin","offset":297},{"uri":"Aristarkh_Lentulov","surface_form":"Aristarkh Lentulov","offset":660}]}
