{"id":268722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodosaurus","text":"\"Nodosaurus\" (meaning \"knobbed lizard\") was a large, armored, quadrupedal (it walked on four legs), tank-like dinosaur. It lived in the first part of the Upper Cretaceous about 113\u201398 million years ago. Three very incomplete \"Nodosaurus\" fossils have been found in Wyoming and Kansas; no skulls have been found yet. It was named by paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh in 1889.\n\"Nodosaurus\" was about 13 to 20 ft (4-6 m) long. It was an ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaur with bony dermal plates covering the top of its body. It had four short legs, five-toed feet, a short neck, and a long, clubless tail. The nodosaurids had no tail club; it is not known how they defended themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":154},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":265},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":277},{"uri":"Othniel_Charles_Marsh","surface_form":"Othniel C.
