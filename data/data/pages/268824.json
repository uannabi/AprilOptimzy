{"id":268824,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangue","text":"=\"preserve\">Gangue is the worthless substance that is left behind when minerals are processed.\nWhen minerals are collected, the ore that is wanted is found only in small amounts. Flotation is used to concentrate the ore. The ore floats while the gangue sinks to the bottom. Sometimes minerals thought of as gangue are later recovered and used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":36},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":71},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":128},{"uri":"Flotation","surface_form":"Flotation","offset":179}]}
