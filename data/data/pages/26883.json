The elder sister of\u00A0Zeus, Demeter presided over\u00A0grains\u00A0and the\u00A0fertility\u00A0of the earth. She served as the patron goddess of farmers, and was believed to have taught men how to reap and cultivate the harvest. By Zeus, she is the mother of Persephone, the wife of Hades and queen of the underworld. Both she and Persephone were central figures of the\u00A0Eleusinian Mysteries, a series of festivals held in honor of the two goddesses in the region of\u00A0Attica. Her symbols were the scythe, cornucopia,\u00A0wheat,\u00A0bread and harvest grains, and the pig and snake were her sacred animals. Her Roman equivalent is Ceres.\nIn Greek Mythology, Demeter's daughter Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, and made her bride. Demeter grieved the loss of her daughter, bringing on a long famine. Eventually an accord was met by which Persephone would spend part of the year underground, and the rest above ground with her mother. This cycle is the Mythological explanation for the seasons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Attic Greek","offset":9},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Doric","offset":42},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":104},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"ancient Greek religion","offset":119},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":146},{"uri":"Twelve_Olympians","surface_form":"Twelve Olympians","offset":163},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":201},{"uri":"Persephone","surface_form":"Persephone","offset":418},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":442},{"uri":"Eleusinian_Mysteries","surface_form":"Eleusinian Mysteries","offset":529},{"uri":"Attica","surface_form":"Attica","offset":625},{"uri":"Scythe","surface_form":"scythe","offset":654},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":674},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":715},{"uri":"Ceres","surface_form":"Ceres","offset":778}]}
