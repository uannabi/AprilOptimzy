{"id":268912,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo","text":"The London Zoo is the world's oldest scientific zoo. It was opened in London on 27 April 1828, and was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. It was eventually opened to the public in 1847. Today it has a collection of 673 species of animals, with 19,289 individuals, making it one of the largest collections in the United Kingdom.\nIt is managed by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), established in 1826. It is at the northern edge of Regent's Park, on the boundary line between City of Westminster and Camden (the Regent's Canal runs through it). The Society also has a larger site at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire to which the larger animals such as elephants and rhinos have been moved.\nAs well as being the first scientific zoo, ZSL London Zoo also opened the first Reptile house (1849), first public Aquarium (1853), first insect house (1881) and the first children's zoo (1938).\nZSL receives no state funding and relies on 'Fellows', 'Friends', 'Members', entrance fees and sponsorship to get income.\nHowever, the ZSL's nearby \"Institute of Zoology\" may get public grants as a scientific institution. It has an international reputation in bioconservation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Zoo","surface_form":"zoo","offset":48},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific study","offset":154},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":253},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":264},{"uri":"Regent%27s_Park","surface_form":"Regent's Park","offset":470},{"uri":"City_of_Westminster","surface_form":"City of Westminster","offset":514},{"uri":"Camden_Town","surface_form":"Camden","offset":538},{"uri":"Regent%27s_Canal","surface_form":"Regent's Canal","offset":550},{"uri":"Whipsnade_Zoo","surface_form":"ZSL Whipsnade Zoo","offset":621},{"uri":"Bedfordshire","surface_form":"Bedfordshire","offset":642},{"uri":"Bioconservation","surface_form":"bioconservation","offset":1184}]}
