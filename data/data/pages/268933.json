It is a philosophical movement and political movement. The idea of progress is the belief that human society is improving over time. In the 18th century, many philosophers began holding this belief as part of the Age of Enlightenment.\nPolitical movement.\nProgressive politics generally wants to change government in a new way. Unlike conservatism which wants to keep government similar. It most often refers to a political movement in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, called the Progressive Era. In the United States, these people wanted to change politics, which was at that time run by big business and corrupt political machines. Most of the people who believed in the Progressive Movement were part of the middle class. Some of the leaders of the progressive movement were Theodore Roosevelt, Hiram Johnson, William Howard Taft, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., Franklin D. Roosevelt, Howard Dean, and Bernie Sanders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosophical_movement","surface_form":"philosophical movement","offset":102},{"uri":"Political_movement","surface_form":"political movement","offset":129},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"human society","offset":189},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":234},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":253},{"uri":"Age_of_Enlightenment","surface_form":"Age of Enlightenment","offset":307},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservatism","offset":428},{"uri":"Progressive_Era","surface_form":"Progressive Era","offset":601},{"uri":"Theodore_Roosevelt","surface_form":"Theodore Roosevelt","offset":899},{"uri":"Hiram_Johnson","surface_form":"Hiram Johnson","offset":919},{"uri":"William_Howard_Taft","surface_form":"William Howard Taft","offset":934},{"uri":"Robert_M._La_Follette%2C_Sr.","surface_form":"Robert M.
