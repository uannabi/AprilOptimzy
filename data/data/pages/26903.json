{"id":26903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island","text":"Staten Island is a borough of New York City. Fewer than half a million people live there, the smallest population of any of the five boroughs. Three bridges connect Staten Island to New Jersey, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge connects to Brooklyn. A passenger railroad runs along the south shore to the northeast end of the island, which is called Saint George. The borough has the same boundaries as the county Richmond County.\nThe free Staten Island Ferry carries 21 million passengers each year the five miles (eight km) across New York Harbor between Saint George and Manhattan. Nine ferry boats provide the service which began in the 1700s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":19},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":30},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":182},{"uri":"Verrazano-Narrows_Bridge","surface_form":"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge","offset":202},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":239},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":406},{"uri":"Staten_Island_Ferry","surface_form":"Staten Island Ferry","offset":439},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":478},{"uri":"New_York_Harbor","surface_form":"New York Harbor","offset":532},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":573}]}
