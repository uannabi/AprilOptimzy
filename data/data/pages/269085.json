{"id":269085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_wave","text":"A mechanical wave requires a medium. Sound waves, waves in a Slinky, and pressure waves are all examples of this phenomenon. Sound waves need a physical medium in order to exist; the Slinky waves need the Slinky, and the waves in the ocean need the water. Like all waves, they have a frequency, period, wavelength and amplitude.\nMechanical waves are a local oscillation of material. Only the energy propagates; the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position; the wave travels by jumping from one particle of the transmission medium to another. Therefore, mechanical waves transport energy and not material.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slinky","surface_form":"Slinky","offset":61},{"uri":"Transmission_medium","surface_form":"transmission medium","offset":546}]}
