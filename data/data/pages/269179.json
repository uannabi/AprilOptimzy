{"id":269179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_force","text":"Normal force is the force that the ground (or any surface) pushes back up with.\nIf there was no normal force, you'd be slowly seeping into the ground.\nThe normal force on a object is always perpendicular (at a right angle) to the surface the object is on.\nOn a flat surface, the normal force of an object is formula_1 (the object's weight, that is its mass multiplied by the force of gravity).\nOn an inclined plane, the normal force is reduced by the angle, and the normal force is formula_1.\nNote that on a flat surface, formula_1 would be 0, and so formula_1 would be 1. Thus, the two equations are equal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":20},{"uri":"Ground","surface_form":"ground","offset":35},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":50},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"perpendicular","offset":190}]}
