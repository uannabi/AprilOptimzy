{"id":269204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Grades are a teacher's evaluation of a student's performance. They are often letters (e.g. A, B, C, D, F,) or numbers (e.g. 1-10.), although in some countries they do not use either of these systems.\nLetter grades are most commonly used in the United States and some others. The grades D or C are usually enough to pass.\nGrades can also be on a number scale. Typically a midpoint score is a pass. Sometimes the numbers can go in descending order to indicate better performance.\nA \"Grade Point Average\", or GPA, takes the grade(s) of a student and assigns point values to them. These points are added up and divided to calculate the GPA.\nThe grade is the answer to that formula turned into a percent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":257},{"uri":"Percent","surface_form":"percent","offset":704}]}
