{"id":269241,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaur","text":"\"Balaur\" is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in southern Europe during the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago.\nThe specimen is unique: unlike most other dromaeosaurs, it had \"two\" sickle claws on each foot, not just one. It had a reduced and presumably nonfunctional third finger, consisting of only one rudimentary phalanx.\nThe specimen was discovered in 2010. \"Balaur\" lived on a large prehistoric island called Hateg Island. Seventy million years ago, sea levels were much higher than they are today. Europe was an archipelago of islands.\nPossibly because it was relatively isolated from other dinosaurs, \"Balaur\" developed unique features. It was a small. This is an example of island dwarfism.\nThere is one known species, \"Balaur bondoc\". \"Balaur\" was a velociraptorine. Studies have shown that it is most closely related to the famous Asian dromaeosaurid \"Velociraptor\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":14},{"uri":"Dromaeosaurid","surface_form":"dromaeosaurid","offset":23},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":37},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":46},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":78},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":96},{"uri":"Hateg_Island","surface_form":"Hateg Island","offset":445},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":549},{"uri":"Island_dwarfism","surface_form":"island dwarfism","offset":713},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":749},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":872},{"uri":"Velociraptor","surface_form":"Velociraptor","offset":893}]}
