The defenceman played four seasons with the University of Minnesota Duluth and in 1985-86 was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, awarded to the NCAA's top player.

In the spring of 1996, he scored the final goal in Winnipeg Jets' history prior to the team's relocation to Phoenix in the sixth game of a first round playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings. After retirement he became an assistant coach for the American Hockey League's Springfield Falcons from 2000 to 2003, and then the NHL's Boston Bruins from 2003 to 2006.\nMaciver is currently an amateur scout with the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thunder_Bay","surface_form":"Thunder Bay","offset":49},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":62},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":76},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":106},{"uri":"Defenceman_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"defenceman","offset":117},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":146},{"uri":"New_York_Rangers","surface_form":"New York Rangers","offset":188},{"uri":"Hartford_Whalers","surface_form":"Hartford Whalers","offset":206},{"uri":"Edmonton_Oilers","surface_form":"Edmonton Oilers","offset":224},{"uri":"Ottawa_Senators","surface_form":"Ottawa Senators","offset":241},{"uri":"Pittsburgh_Penguins","surface_form":"Pittsburgh Penguins","offset":258},{"uri":"Winnipeg_Jets_(1972%E2%80%9396)","surface_form":"Winnipeg Jets","offset":287},{"uri":"Phoenix_Coyotes","surface_form":"Phoenix Coyotes","offset":301},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"NHL","offset":368},{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"university","offset":403},{"uri":"University_of_Minnesota_Duluth","surface_form":"University of Minnesota Duluth","offset":491},{"uri":"Hobey_Baker_Award","surface_form":"Hobey Baker Award","offset":560},{"uri":"New_York_Rangers","surface_form":"New York Rangers","offset":740},{"uri":"Ottawa_Senators","surface_form":"Ottawa Senators","offset":940},{"uri":"1992-93_NHL_season","surface_form":"1992-93","offset":973},{"uri":"Phoenix%2C_AZ","surface_form":"Phoenix","offset":1183},{"uri":"Detroit_Red_Wings","surface_form":"Detroit Red Wings","offset":1253},{"uri":"American_Hockey_League","surface_form":"American Hockey League","offset":1326},{"uri":"Springfield_Falcons","surface_form":"Springfield Falcons","offset":1351},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":1495}]}
