{"id":269386,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey","text":"Jack Patrick Dorsey is an American software developer and business person, widely known as the creator of social networking service Twitter. He is also the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company. In 2008, he was named as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.\nEarly life.\nDorsey was born Jack Patrick Dorsey in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Tim and Marcia (n\u00E9e Smith) Dorsey. He is of English, Irish, and Italian descent. His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.\nHe was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati. He attended the Catholic Bishop DuBourg High School. In his younger days, Dorsey worked occasionally as a fashion model.\nBy age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open-source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by taxicab companies. Dorsey attended the University of Missouri\u2013Rolla for two-plus years (1995\u201397) before transferring to New York University, but he dropped out in 1999, one semester short of graduating. He came up with the idea that he developed as Twitter while studying at NYU.\nCareer.\nWhile working on dispatching as a programmer, Dorsey moved to California. In 2000, Dorsey started his company in Oakland to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web. His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a \"frictionless service market\". In July 2000, building on dispatching and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.\nWhen he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared easily among friends. He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging. Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status-message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks. The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams, a co-founder of that firm in 2005 who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":26},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":35},{"uri":"Social_networking","surface_form":"social networking","offset":106},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":132},{"uri":"Square_(payment_service)","surface_form":"Square","offset":175},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis, Missouri","offset":349},{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":445},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":574},{"uri":"Bishop_DuBourg_High_School","surface_form":"Bishop DuBourg High School","offset":659},{"uri":"Dispatch_(logistics)","surface_form":"dispatch routing","offset":804},{"uri":"Open-source_model","surface_form":"open-source","offset":834},{"uri":"Missouri_University_of_Science_and_Technology","surface_form":"University of Missouri\u2013Rolla","offset":956},{"uri":"New_York_University","surface_form":"New York University","offset":1037},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":1166},{"uri":"Oakland%2C_California","surface_form":"Oakland","offset":1318},{"uri":"LiveJournal","surface_form":"LiveJournal","offset":1570},{"uri":"AIM_(software)","surface_form":"AOL Instant Messenger","offset":1589},{"uri":"Instant_messaging","surface_form":"instant messaging","offset":1734},{"uri":"Odeo","surface_form":"Odeo","offset":1863},{"uri":"Text_messaging","surface_form":"text messaging","offset":1916},{"uri":"Biz_Stone","surface_form":"Biz Stone","offset":1943},{"uri":"Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)","surface_form":"Evan Williams","offset":2118},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":2180},{"uri":"Pyra_Labs","surface_form":"Pyra Labs","offset":2201},{"uri":"Blogger_(service)","surface_form":"Blogger","offset":2215}]}
