He is one of the most famous naturalists in the world. He presents many programs about nature, talking about the lives of animals and has stopped millions of people polluting our oceans. He has won many prestigious award and honorable mentions. In 1980 he won the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, a lifetime achievement award.

People have pushed aside the question of population sustainability and not considered it because it is too awkward, embarrassing and difficult. But we have to talk about it\u2033.\n\u201CWe are a plague on the Earth. It\u2019s coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It\u2019s not just climate change; it\u2019s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now\u201D.\n\"What are all these famines in Ethiopia?
