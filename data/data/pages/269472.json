{"id":269472,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_belts","text":"Karate belts are a measure of a student/teacher ability. For example, a Brown belt is higher than a Blue Belt.\nUsual rank.\nAll styles of karate range from white to black. There are some theories about how belts came to be.\nThe \"dying\" theory.\nSome believe when a student graduated a kyu, he/she would dye their current belt the new, desired color. This was often done in Japan during WWII when it was a very poor country.\nThe \"dirty belt\" theory.\nThis is a theory that demonstrates how a student would, as they trained, dirty their belt overtime. More of a myth than a theory, a student started with a white belt. As sweat, dirt, and other debris occupied not only the belt, but the karate gi, his/her color appeared to get darker and closer to black.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Karate","surface_form":"Karate","offset":0},{"uri":"Karate","surface_form":"karate","offset":137},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":371},{"uri":"WWII","surface_form":"WWII","offset":384},{"uri":"Belt","surface_form":"belt","offset":669},{"uri":"Karate_gi","surface_form":"karate gi","offset":683}]}
