{"id":269516,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression","text":"e=\"preserve\">A regular expression (abbreviated regexp or regex) is a way to describe sets of characters using syntactic rules. Many programming languages use or support regular expressions. A regular expression is then used by a special program or part of a programming language. This program will either generate a parser that can be used to match expressions or it will match such expressions itself.\nA\u00A0regular expression processor\u00A0is used for processing a regular expression statement in terms of a grammar in a given\u00A0formal language, and with that examines a text string.\nRegular expressions can be much more complex than these examples. Many regular expression languages also support \"wildcard\" characters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":85},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntactic rules","offset":110},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":132},{"uri":"Parser","surface_form":"parser","offset":316},{"uri":"Formal_language","surface_form":"formal language","offset":521}]}
