{"id":269550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclinic","text":"=\"preserve\">A triclinic crystal is shaped almost like a rectangle. It is slightly bent, though. Copper sulfate makes triclinic crystals. It is the least symmetric (meaning that both sides are not very similar).\n. In the triclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":24},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangle","offset":56},{"uri":"Copper_sulfate","surface_form":"Copper sulfate","offset":96},{"uri":"Symmetric","surface_form":"symmetric","offset":153}]}
