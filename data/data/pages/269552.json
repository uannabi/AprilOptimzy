{"id":269552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure","text":"In crystallography, the crystal structure is how the atoms (or ions or molecules) are arranged in a crystalline material. Crystals occur naturally from the way the chemical bonds of the atoms connect. Symmetric repeating patterns occur in 3-D space in the crystal.\nThe crystal structure and symmetry cause many physical properties, such as cleavage (how the crystal splits) how it conducts electricity, and its optical properties..\nThe crystal structure of a chemical is the shape of the crystal at the molecular level. There are several shapes of crystals. Sodium chloride is a cube. Copper sulfate is triclinic. Most things, even metals, have crystal structures. Some crystals fit more atoms in them than others, and these crystals usually weigh more.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallography","offset":3},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":53},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":63},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":71},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystalline material","offset":100},{"uri":"Chemical_bonds","surface_form":"chemical bonds","offset":164},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"Symmetric","offset":201},{"uri":"3-D","surface_form":"3-D","offset":239},{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"optical","offset":411},{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"Sodium chloride","offset":558},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":579},{"uri":"Copper_sulfate","surface_form":"Copper sulfate","offset":585},{"uri":"Triclinic","surface_form":"triclinic","offset":603}]}
