There are ways to get rid of hazardous things. There are different types of hazards; some can catch things on fire; some can burn skin; some can irritate the eyes, etc.\nThe term 'hazard' is used in driving instruction, and in some traffic-related laws. It simply means 'something a motorist should notice and drive accordingly'. For example, children playing on the pavement (U.S. = sidewalk; Austr. = footpath) are a potential hazard. If any go into the actual road, then they are a real hazard, and motorist should do whatever is safe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dangerous","surface_form":"dangerous","offset":34},{"uri":"Driving_instruction","surface_form":"driving instruction","offset":330},{"uri":"Traffic","surface_form":"traffic","offset":363},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":379},{"uri":"Pavement","surface_form":"pavement","offset":498}]}
