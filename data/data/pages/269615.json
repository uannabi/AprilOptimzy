{"id":269615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiled_egg","text":"A boiled egg is an egg boiled in its shell. This is a common way of cooking eggs. If the shells are broken, it is called a poached egg. There are two different types of boiled eggs: hard boiled eggs and soft-boiled eggs.\nHard-boiled eggs.\nHard-boiled eggs are completely cooked. The egg yolk is solid. They can be eaten warm or cold. Some dishes use them like egg salad. They can be stored for a long time in the refrigerator. Some machines called egg slicers can slice these easily.\nSoft-boiled eggs.\nSoft-boiled eggs have firmly cooked eggwhites, while at the same time, the yolks are liquid. They can have salmonella in them if you don't prepare them correctly. In Europe, soft-boiled eggs are a traditional breakfast cousin, and you normally scoop them out of the shell and eat. In Asia, the soft-boiled egg is cracked into a cup with soy sauce and black pepper.\nTo make the perfect soft boiled egg, bring the water up to a boil, then lower it to a rapid simmer. Add the eggs to the pot, and then begin timing. If you're just cooking one or two eggs, five minutes is perfect for a runny yolk, or cook as long as seven minutes for a more firmly set, but still spoonable, yolk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":19},{"uri":"Boiling","surface_form":"boiled","offset":23},{"uri":"Poached_egg","surface_form":"poached egg","offset":123},{"uri":"Egg_yolk","surface_form":"egg yolk","offset":283},{"uri":"Egg_salad","surface_form":"egg salad","offset":360},{"uri":"Refrigerator","surface_form":"refrigerator","offset":413},{"uri":"Salmonella","surface_form":"salmonella","offset":609},{"uri":"Soy_sauce","surface_form":"soy sauce","offset":839},{"uri":"Black_pepper","surface_form":"black pepper","offset":853}]}
