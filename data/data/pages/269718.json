{"id":269718,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_phosphide","text":"=\"preserve\">Sodium phosphide is a chemical compound. It contains sodium and phosphide ions. Its chemical formula is Na3P.\nProperties.\nSodium phosphide is a black solid. It is ionic. There are several other sodium phosphides that do not have the formula Na3P. It reacts with acids to make phosphine gas. It is a reducing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting liquid sodium with phosphorus(V) chloride. It can also be made by reacting sodium with phosphorus.\nUses.\nIt is used to make semiconductors. It can also be used as a catalyst.\nSafety.\nSodium phosphide is flammable, making toxic gases when burned. It also makes toxic flammable gases when reacted with acids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":34},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":65},{"uri":"Phosphide","surface_form":"phosphide","offset":76},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":86},{"uri":"Ionic_bond","surface_form":"ionic","offset":175},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":274},{"uri":"Phosphine","surface_form":"phosphine","offset":288},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":311},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":374},{"uri":"Phosphorus(V)_chloride","surface_form":"phosphorus(V) chloride","offset":386},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":454},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":491},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":532}]}
