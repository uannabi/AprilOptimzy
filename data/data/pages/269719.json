It contains phosphorus and chloride ions. The phosphorus is in the +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nPhosphorus(V) chloride is a colorless solid. It is one of the most important phosphorus chlorides. Sometimes it is yellowish. It reacts with hot water to make phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting a lot of chlorine with phosphorus. It can also be made by reacting chlorine with phosphorus(III) chloride.\nUses.\nPhosphorus(V) chloride is used to add chloride to other chemical compounds.\nSafety.\nPhosphorus(V) chloride is acidic and toxic. It puts off toxic gases when reacted with water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":69},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":130},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":145},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":154},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":188},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":376},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":396},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":460},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":474},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":518},{"uri":"Phosphorus(III)_chloride","surface_form":"phosphorus(III) chloride","offset":532}]}
