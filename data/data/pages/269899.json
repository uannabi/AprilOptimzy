{"id":269899,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Revere","text":"Paul Revere (January 1, 1735 - May 10, 1818) was an early United States Patriot and a leader of the American Revolution. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and worked there as a silversmith. He was married twice and became the father of 16 children.\nRevere was a member of a group called The Sons of Liberty. This group wanted better treatment for the American colonies from the British government. Revere made a silver engraving of the Boston Massacre. This engraving made Americans even more angry with the British.\nRevere was a courier and soldier in the American Revolution. After the Revolutionary War, he operated a metal foundry in Boston. He died in Boston, and was buried in the Granary Burying Ground. He is most famous for alerting the colonial militia that British soldiers were coming before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1860, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem about this called \"Paul Revere's Ride.\"\nMidnight Ride.\nRevere is most famous for his \"Midnight Ride\". It happened on the night of April 1819, 1775. British officials had learned that American Patriots (the leaders of the American Revolution) were storing guns in Concord, Massachusetts. They wanted to destroy the guns. The Patriots thought the British also wanted to capture Patriot leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams. The two leaders were staying in Lexington, Massachusetts. Revere and a man named William Dawes rode on horseback from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts to warn Adams and Hancock that the British were coming. Revere warned other Patriots along the way.\nWhen Paul Revere arrived in Lexington, he shouted loudly to wake up and warn the people. Revere was soon joined by Dawes, who also told the people that the British soldiers were coming. In Concord, Samuel Prescott joined Revere and Dawes. All three were stopped by British soldiers in a field in the city of Lincoln, Massachusetts. Prescott and Dawes escaped quickly. However, the British soldiers held Revere for about an hour before letting him go. Because his horse was gone, Revere ran back to Lexington, where the fighting had already begun. Almost a hundred years later, Paul Revere's Ride (poem) revived his fame.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"United States","offset":58},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"American Revolution","offset":100},{"uri":"Boston%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Boston, Massachusetts","offset":136},{"uri":"Sons_of_Liberty","surface_form":"Sons of Liberty","offset":294},{"uri":"13_Colonies","surface_form":"American colonies","offset":354},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British","offset":381},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"engraving","offset":422},{"uri":"Boston_Massacre","surface_form":"Boston Massacre","offset":439},{"uri":"Courier","surface_form":"courier","offset":533},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":545},{"uri":"Foundry","surface_form":"foundry","offset":630},{"uri":"Granary_Burying_Ground","surface_form":"Granary Burying Ground","offset":690},{"uri":"Militia","surface_form":"militia","offset":758},{"uri":"Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord","surface_form":"Battles of Lexington and Concord","offset":811},{"uri":"Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow","surface_form":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow","offset":854},{"uri":"Paul_Revere%27s_Ride","surface_form":"Paul Revere's Ride","offset":913},{"uri":"1775","surface_form":"1775","offset":1036},{"uri":"Concord%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Concord, Massachusetts","offset":1157},{"uri":"John_Hancock","surface_form":"John Hancock","offset":1286},{"uri":"Samuel_Adams","surface_form":"Samuel Adams","offset":1303},{"uri":"Lexington%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Lexington, Massachusetts","offset":1349},{"uri":"William_Dawes","surface_form":"William Dawes","offset":1398},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":1420},{"uri":"Lexington%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Lexington, Massachusetts","offset":1445},{"uri":"Samuel_Prescott","surface_form":"Samuel Prescott","offset":1768},{"uri":"Lincoln%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Lincoln, Massachusetts","offset":1878},{"uri":"Paul_Revere%27s_Ride_(poem)","surface_form":"Paul Revere's Ride (poem)","offset":2147}]}
