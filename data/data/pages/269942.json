The Scottish National Party won 47 seats in the election, which was the largest number of seats for any party in the election, but was not enough to form a majority government. The Scottish National Party then formed a minority government with Alex Salmond as First Minister.\nThis was the first time since the 1964 UK General Election in which the Labour Party did not get the highest number of votes in Scotland and it also gave the Scottish National Party it's largest ever number of votes. The final results were: Scottish National Party (47 Seats), Scottish Labour Party (46 Seats), Scottish Conservative Party (17 Seats), Scottish Liberal Democrats (16 Seats) and the Scottish Green Party (2 Seats). Parties which had won seats in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election including the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Senior Citizens Party, lost all of their seats.\nVoting system.\nScotland is divided into 73 constituencies with roughly the same number of people in each one. Each of these constituencies elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) using the First Past the Post voting system. These 73 constituencies are grouped into eight regions. Each of these regions elects seven MSPs using proportional representation which means that the total number of MSPs is 129.\nParty leaders.\nScottish National Party - Alex Salmond\nScottish Labour Party - Jack McConnell\nScottish Conservative Party - Annabel Goldie\nScottish Liberal Democrats - Nicol Stephen\nScottish Green Party - Robin Harper / Shiona Baird\nNext election.\nThe next election to the Scottish parliament was held on 5 May 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":58},{"uri":"Scottish_Parliament","surface_form":"Scottish Parliament","offset":110},{"uri":"Scottish_Labour_Party","surface_form":"Scottish Labour Party","offset":160},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":224},{"uri":"Scottish_Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Scottish Liberal Democrats","offset":253},{"uri":"First_Minister_of_Scotland","surface_form":"First Minister","offset":303},{"uri":"Scottish_National_Party","surface_form":"Scottish National Party","offset":323},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":475},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":538},{"uri":"Alex_Salmond","surface_form":"Alex Salmond","offset":563},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":667},{"uri":"Scottish_Conservative_Party","surface_form":"Scottish Conservative Party","offset":906},{"uri":"Scottish_Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Scottish Liberal Democrats","offset":946},{"uri":"Scottish_Green_Party","surface_form":"Scottish Green Party","offset":992},{"uri":"Scottish_Socialist_Party","surface_form":"Scottish Socialist Party","offset":1107},{"uri":"Constituency","surface_form":"constituencies","offset":1240},{"uri":"Proportional_representation","surface_form":"proportional representation","offset":1534},{"uri":"Alex_Salmond","surface_form":"Alex Salmond","offset":1653},{"uri":"Jack_McConnell","surface_form":"Jack McConnell","offset":1690}]}
