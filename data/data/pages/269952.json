The three party leaders are shown below.\nOutcome.\nThe election resulted in a hung parliament, where no political party has an overall majority of seats. This is the first time this has happened since 1974.\nThe Conservative Party won 307 out of the 650 seats available making them the largest party in the House of Commons. A coalition was then formed between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats who together had enough seats for a majority. This is the first coalition government in the United Kingdom since World War II.\nThe Leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron became Prime Minister of the United Kigdom on 11 May 2010 and the leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg became the Deputy Prime Minister. Before the election, the Leader of the Labour Party Gordon Brown was the Prime Minister.\nThis was the first British general election where the leaders of the three main parties took part together in a series of debates for television. The first debate was shown on ITV and was moderated by Alastair Stewart. It was on the subject of domestic affairs and polls taken after the debate showed that most people thought Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had done the best and the Liberal Democrats then saw a large rise in support in opinion polls, even beating Labour for second place behind the Conservatives.\nThe second debate, on the subject of Foreign Affairs was shown on Sky News and was moderated by Adam Boulton. Polls after this debate showed that Nick Clegg and David Cameron had done best with Gordon Brown slightly behind. The third and final debate was shown on BBC One and was moderated by David Dimbleby. It was on the subject of the economy and taxes and most opinion polls indicated that David Cameron had performed the best out of the three leaders.\nThe Conservative Party gained support from the following newspapers: the \"Daily Express\", the \"Daily Mail\", the \"Sun\", the \"Daily Telegraph\", the \"Times\", the \"Daily Star\", the \"Evening Standard\", the \"Financial Times\", \"Sunday Express\", the \"Mail on Sunday\", the \"News of the World\", the \"Sunday Telegraph\" and the \"Sunday Times\". The Liberal Democrats were supported by: the \"Guardian\", the \"Observer\" and the \"Independent\". Only the \"Daily Mirror\" and the \"Sunday Mirror\" supported the Labour Party and the \"People\" newspaper favoured a coalition.\nThis election saw the Conservative Party return to government for the first time since 1997 and also saw the Liberal Democrats get their first ever representation in government. Peter Robinson, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party unexpectedly lost his seat to the Alliance Party. The Green Party of England and Wales gained its first ever seat in the House of Commons and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland gained its first seat in the House of Commons since 1974. Former Labour Party Home Secretaries Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke both lost their seats. The Ulster Unionist Party and the Respect Party won seats in the 2005 General Election but lost their seats in the 2010 Election.\nResults by party.\nThe seat of North Down was won by an Independent candidate and the seat of Buckingham was won by the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, who is not considered to be of any political party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["election"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":48},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons of the United Kingdom","offset":104},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative Party","offset":354},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":469},{"uri":"Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Liberal Democrats","offset":534},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":665},{"uri":"David_Cameron","surface_form":"David Cameron","offset":716},{"uri":"Nick_Clegg","surface_form":"Nick Clegg","offset":828},{"uri":"Gordon_Brown","surface_form":"Gordon Brown","offset":925},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":1096},{"uri":"ITV","surface_form":"ITV","offset":1138},{"uri":"Nick_Clegg","surface_form":"Nick Clegg","offset":1312},{"uri":"Sky_News","surface_form":"Sky News","offset":1547},{"uri":"Adam_Boulton","surface_form":"Adam Boulton","offset":1577},{"uri":"BBC_One","surface_form":"BBC One","offset":1745},{"uri":"David_Dimbleby","surface_form":"David Dimbleby","offset":1774},{"uri":"Peter_Robinson","surface_form":"Peter Robinson","offset":2667},{"uri":"Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales","surface_form":"Green Party of England and Wales","offset":2820},{"uri":"Jacqui_Smith","surface_form":"Jacqui Smith","offset":3042},{"uri":"Ulster_Unionist_Party","surface_form":"Ulster Unionist Party","offset":3101},{"uri":"Respect_Party","surface_form":"Respect Party","offset":3131},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_2005_general_election","surface_form":"2005 General Election","offset":3162},{"uri":"John_Bercow","surface_form":"John Bercow","offset":3378},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":3426}]}
