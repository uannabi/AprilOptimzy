{"id":270017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torvosaurus","text":"\"Torvosaurus\" was a large carnivorous dinosaur,\nfrom the Upper Jurassic. It lived about 153 to 148 million years ago in what is now Colorado and Portugal.\n\"Torvosaurus\", possibly the largest carnivore of its time, was a large, heavily-built, bipedal carnivore. It grew to 9 to 11 meters (30 to 36\u00A0ft) in length and an estimated weight of about 2 metric tons (2.2 tons). Its hands and arms were about average for its size. In proportion, \"Allosaurus\" had more powerful arms, and T. rex had tiny arms.\nStudies suggest that the paleoenvironment of this part of the Morrison Formation had rivers flowing from the west into a basin with a giant, saline alkaline lake. There were extensive wetlands nearby. Fossils from the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western Colorado show one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world. The Dry Mesa Quarry has produced the remains of the sauropods \"Apatosaurus\", \"Diplodocus\", \"Barosaurus\", \"Supersaurus\", \"Dystylosaurus\", \"Camarasaurus\", the iguanodontid \"Camptosaurus\", and the theropods \"Allosaurus\", \"Ceratosaurus\" and \"Ornitholestes\", as well as \"Dryosaurus\", and \"Stegosaurus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":26},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":38},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"Upper Jurassic","offset":57},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":132},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":145},{"uri":"Bipedal","surface_form":"bipedal","offset":242},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":438},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"T. rex","offset":478},{"uri":"Natural_environment","surface_form":"paleoenvironment","offset":525},{"uri":"Morrison_Formation","surface_form":"Morrison Formation","offset":562},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"saline","offset":641},{"uri":"Alkaline","surface_form":"alkaline","offset":648},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":657},{"uri":"Wetlands","surface_form":"wetlands","offset":684},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":754},{"uri":"Sauropods","surface_form":"sauropods","offset":896},{"uri":"Apatosaurus","surface_form":"Apatosaurus","offset":907},{"uri":"Diplodocus","surface_form":"Diplodocus","offset":922},{"uri":"Barosaurus","surface_form":"Barosaurus","offset":936},{"uri":"Supersaurus","surface_form":"Supersaurus","offset":950},{"uri":"Dystylosaurus","surface_form":"Dystylosaurus","offset":965},{"uri":"Camarasaurus","surface_form":"Camarasaurus","offset":982},{"uri":"Iguanodontid","surface_form":"iguanodontid","offset":1001},{"uri":"Camptosaurus","surface_form":"Camptosaurus","offset":1015},{"uri":"Theropods","surface_form":"theropods","offset":1038},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":1049},{"uri":"Ceratosaurus","surface_form":"Ceratosaurus","offset":1063},{"uri":"Ornitholestes","surface_form":"Ornitholestes","offset":1082},{"uri":"Dryosaurus","surface_form":"Dryosaurus","offset":1110},{"uri":"Stegosaurus","surface_form":"Stegosaurus","offset":1128}]}
