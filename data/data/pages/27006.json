{"id":27006,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh","text":"Winnie the Pooh, also called Pooh Bear, is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear. He was created by A. A. Milne. He is based on a stuffed toy that belonged to Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne. The toy was named after \"Winnipeg\" (\"Winnie\" for short), who was a black bear at the London Zoo, and \"Pooh\", which was a nickname Milne and his son had given to a swan. The first book was published in 1926. Other books were published later. Walt Disney made a series of cartoons based on the books. The Walt Disney Company still owns the character.\nPooh is a small yellow bear. He is nearly tall. He wears an old red t-shirt. His favorite food is honey. The first thing he says when he gets up in the morning is \"What's for breakfast?\". He invented the game \"Poohsticks\".\nPooh has several friends. Their names are Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger, Rabbit, Kanga and Roo, Owl, Gopher, and Christopher Robin. Piglet is a small timid pig. Eeyore is an old grey donkey. Tigger is an energetic tiger. Rabbit is a kind-hearted rabbit. Kanga is a female kangaroo. Roo is Kanga's son.\nThe first book, \"Winnie-the-Pooh\", was published on October 15, 1926 by Methuen & Company. The second book was \"The House at Pooh Corner\", which was published on October 11, 1928. The poetry book \"When We Were Very Young\" was published in 1924 and \"Now We Are Six\" was published in 1927. \"Return to Hundred Acre Wood\" was written by David Benedictus and published on October 5, 2009. \"The Best Bear in All the World\" was published in 2016 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first Winnie-the-Pooh book.\nThere have been quite a few series created by Walt Disney based on these books. The stories are translated into many languages.\nA Disney movie about Pooh, \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\", was made in March 1977. \"Winnie the Pooh\" was made in July 2011. A live-action movie directed by Marc Forster and based on A. A. Milne's books, entitled \"Christopher Robin\", was released in 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional","offset":45},{"uri":"Anthropomorphic","surface_form":"anthropomorphic","offset":55},{"uri":"Teddy_bear","surface_form":"teddy bear","offset":71},{"uri":"A._A._Milne","surface_form":"A.
