{"id":270116,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelisaurus","text":"\"Abelisaurus\" is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Upper Cretaceous period. There is one known species, \"Abelisaurus comahuensis\".\n\"Abelisaurus\" was the first abelisaurid to be discovered, and gives its name to the family, the Abelisauridae. \"Abelisaurus\" is the type genus. Despite this, little is known about it.\nThe first, and only, fossils discovered were several skull bones found in Argentina. Scientists put them back together in the lab to create a skull. The skull is similar to that of other members of its family. Like most abelisaurs, it is blunt and short in length, but tall in vertical height from a front view. \"Abelisaurus\" probably preyed on the large sauropod dinosaurs of the time, such as \"Amargasaurus\", in packs. It may also have hunted smaller plant-eating dinosaurs, such as the small ornithopod \"Gasparinisaura\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":28},{"uri":"List_of_South_American_dinosaurs","surface_form":"South America","offset":60},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":85},{"uri":"Abelisauridae","surface_form":"Abelisauridae","offset":261},{"uri":"Type_genus","surface_form":"type genus","offset":297},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":423},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":704},{"uri":"Amargasaurus","surface_form":"Amargasaurus","offset":745},{"uri":"Gasparinisaura","surface_form":"Gasparinisaura","offset":856}]}
