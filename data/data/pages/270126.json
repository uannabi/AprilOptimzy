{"id":270126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosaurus","text":"\"Nanosaurus\" (\"small or dwarf lizard\") was an ornithopod dinosaur that measured about 4 ft (1.1 m) long, weighing about 50 pounds (22.5 kg). Othnielia had a horny beak and a small skull with self-sharpening cheek teeth. Othnielia may have had cheek pouches.\nThis plant eater was bipedal (walked on two legs). It had thin legs and a stiffened tail that gave it speed and agility. It had five-fingered hands and four-toed feet, all clawed. It had large eyes and short arms. \"Othnielia\" resembled Hypsilophodon. Its fossils (two partial skeletons and teeth) were found in Colorado and Utah in rocks of the Late Jurassic age.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ornithopod","surface_form":"ornithopod","offset":46},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":57},{"uri":"Hypsilophodon","surface_form":"Hypsilophodon","offset":494},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":569},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":582},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Late Jurassic","offset":603}]}
