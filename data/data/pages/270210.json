{"id":270210,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihydrogen","text":"=\"preserve\">Antihydrogen is an atom made of antimatter. Like normal matter, antihydrogen can bond and form molecules with other antimatter. (It would annihilate any normal matter that it touches). Antihydrogen has one positron\u2013which is positively charged\u2013orbiting an antiproton, which is negatively charged. This is opposite normal hydrogen, which has one negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged proton.\n\"Antihydrogen\" can also refer to the molecule called Antihydrogen, which is made of two bonded antiprotons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":31},{"uri":"Antimatter","surface_form":"antimatter","offset":44},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":107},{"uri":"Positron","surface_form":"positron","offset":218},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"positively charged","offset":236},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":255},{"uri":"Antiproton","surface_form":"antiproton","offset":267},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":332},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":375},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":414},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":459},{"uri":"Antiproton","surface_form":"antiproton","offset":517}]}
