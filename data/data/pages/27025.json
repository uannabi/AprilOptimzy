{"id":27025,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilli-danda","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gilli \"\u093F\u0917\u0932\u094D\u0932\u0940\" -danda \"\u0921\u0928\u094D\u0921\u093E\" is a game played by children in India and Pakistan. It is usually played by using a small round stick, about as long as a baseball or cricket bat. This is the \"danda\". There is another smaller stick, round in the middle and tapering towards the ends. This is the \"gilli\". The game gilli-danda is similar to cricket. It is also believed to be origin of cricket.\nTo play the game, one team uses the \"danda\" to hit one of the tapered ends of the \"gilli\" with force. This causes the \"gilli\" to flip through the air. While the \"gilli\" is airborne, the opposing team's hitter attempts to smack it like one would as if playing cricket. The one who hits the \"gilli\" the farthest will wins. It is played with two teams. One side pitches the \"gilli\" using the big \"danda\" (not the bare hands), to the other team's hitter. The hitter, using his \"danda\" then hits the \"gilli\". In the course of the play, if the \"gilli\" is caught, then those players who pitched with the big \"danda\" to the hitter, are out of the game. It was most popularly played around 1970 to 1980 throughout India and Pakistan and is played to this day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":75},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":85},{"uri":"Baseball_bat","surface_form":"baseball","offset":165},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket bat","offset":177}]}
