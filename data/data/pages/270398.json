It was found in the Yixian Formation in what is now China.\nThis new fossil supports the idea that these dinosaurs did not have scaly, reptile-like skin, but had a softer, downy coat. No fossil skin impressions of these dinosaurs had been found previously.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Feathered_dinosaur","surface_form":"feathered dinosaur","offset":87},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":115},{"uri":"Dromaeosaur","surface_form":"dromaeosaur","offset":135},{"uri":"Yixian_Formation","surface_form":"Yixian Formation","offset":168},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":200}]}
