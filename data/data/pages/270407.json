{"id":270407,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion","text":"Subversion is a systematic attempt to overthrow or undermine a government or political system by persons working from within. Subversion works against structures of power, authority, exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy. A subversive is something or someone that works against an organization or system.\nSubversive activity is the lending of aid, comfort, and support to individuals, groups, or organizations that work for the \"overthrow of governments by force and violence\". Actions against the best interests of the government, and which are not treason, sedition, sabotage, or espionage are put in the category of subversive activity.\nChina.\nSubversion is a crime in China. The government of the People's Republic of China prosecutes subversives under Articles 102 through 112 of the state criminal law. These laws describe behavior that can be a threat to national security. China has prosecuted many dissidents using these laws. Articles 105 and 111 are used the most often to silence political dissent. Article 105 makes it a crime to organize, make a secret plan, work against the national order, or tell rumors to make people fight the national order or overthrow the socialist system. Article 111 prohibits stealing, secretly collecting, purchasing, or illegally providing state secrets or intelligence to an organization, institution, or personnel outside the country.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThere is no crime defined as \"subversion\" in British Constitutional law. There is a crime of treason. Legal experts have tried define subversion, but political and legal thinkers could not reach a general agreement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":551},{"uri":"Sedition","surface_form":"sedition","offset":560},{"uri":"Sabotage","surface_form":"sabotage","offset":570},{"uri":"Espionage","surface_form":"espionage","offset":583},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":702},{"uri":"List_of_Chinese_dissidents","surface_form":"dissidents","offset":908},{"uri":"Classified_information","surface_form":"state secrets","offset":1285},{"uri":"Constitutional_law","surface_form":"Constitutional law","offset":1451},{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":1491}]}
