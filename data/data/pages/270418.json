He is known as a \"sci-fi fan\" on the SC.\nEarly life and Education.\nKaku was born on January 24, 1947 in San Jose, California to Japanese parents. As a child, he took judo lessons. When he grew older, he graduated from college with a summa cum laude degree.\nWorks.\nKaku is famous for his major field, theoretical physics. Sci-fi is another field Michio studied. Some episodes of Sci-Fi Science, for instance, ponder alien invasion of the planet, or a new solar system. The string theory is another topic that Kaku studied.\nHe has also studied the future. Futurists like Kaku often use PPPW to evaluate the future. The \"three Ps and one W\" represent, to futurists, \"plausible\", \"possible\", and \"preferable\". The \"W\" stands for \"wildcard\"(random) events.\nA science populariser, or a populariser of science, is one who captures the scientific method and accuracy to preserve the language in the name of science. Michio Kaku wrote several books including Physics of the Impossible and Hyperspace, Beyond Einstein, and Parallel Worlds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theoretical_physicist","surface_form":"theoretical physicist","offset":62},{"uri":"Science_Channel","surface_form":"Science Channel","offset":107},{"uri":"Sci-Fi_Science","surface_form":"Sci-Fi Science","offset":141},{"uri":"Sci-fi","surface_form":"sci-fi","offset":175},{"uri":"San_Jose%2C_California","surface_form":"San Jose, California","offset":261},{"uri":"Judo","surface_form":"judo","offset":323},{"uri":"Summa_cum_laude","surface_form":"summa cum laude","offset":390},{"uri":"Theoretical_physics","surface_form":"theoretical physics","offset":457},{"uri":"Sci-fi","surface_form":"Sci-fi","offset":478},{"uri":"Sci-Fi_Science","surface_form":"Sci-Fi Science","offset":535},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"alien","offset":572},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":578},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"planet","offset":594},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"solar system","offset":611},{"uri":"String_theory","surface_form":"string theory","offset":629},{"uri":"Scientific_method","surface_form":"method","offset":996},{"uri":"Accuracy","surface_form":"accuracy","offset":1007},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":1056},{"uri":"Physics_of_the_Impossible","surface_form":"Physics of the Impossible","offset":1107},{"uri":"Hyperspace","surface_form":"Hyperspace","offset":1137},{"uri":"Beyond_Einstein","surface_form":"Beyond Einstein","offset":1149},{"uri":"Parallel_Worlds","surface_form":"Parallel Worlds","offset":1170}]}
