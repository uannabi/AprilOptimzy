{"id":270675,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Analytical chemistry is a branch of chemistry. It tries to analyze chemicals in things. A simple job would be to see how much zinc is in a piece of brass. There are several methods, like chromatography and mass spectrometry to do this. Flame tests can be used for a basic analysis.\nMore formally: it is the study of the chemical components of natural and artificial materials.\nQualitative analysis finds what chemical species are in the sample. Quantitative analysis finds out how much of a substance there are in a sample. Substances in a sample are often separated from each other using chromatography before the analysis. This is because a sample can contain many different substances.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":49},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analyze","offset":72},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":139},{"uri":"Brass","surface_form":"brass","offset":161},{"uri":"Chromatography","surface_form":"chromatography","offset":200},{"uri":"Mass_spectrometry","surface_form":"mass spectrometry","offset":219},{"uri":"Flame_test","surface_form":"Flame test","offset":249},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":333},{"uri":"Qualitative_analysis","surface_form":"Qualitative analysis","offset":390},{"uri":"Chemical_species","surface_form":"chemical species","offset":422},{"uri":"Quantitative_analysis","surface_form":"Quantitative analysis","offset":458},{"uri":"Chromatography","surface_form":"chromatography","offset":602}]}
