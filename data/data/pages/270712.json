{"id":270712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delisle_scale","text":"=\"preserve\">The Delisle scale is a scale to measure temperature. It was introduced by French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle in 1732. Delisle used a thermometer that worked with Mercury. The unit is abbreviated \"De\" or \"D\". 0\u00B0De is equal to the boiling point of water under normal pressure. Delisle then measured the volume change of the mercury. At the start, the Delisle scale had 2400 degrees. Josias Weitbrecht recalibrated the theromometer in 1738, so that the melting point of ice was taken into account. Ice melts at 150\u00B0De.\nThe Deslile scale counts downwards, from the boiling point to the melting point. It was widely used in Russia in the 19th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":52},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":86},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":93},{"uri":"Joseph-Nicolas_Delisle","surface_form":"Joseph-Nicolas Delisle","offset":104},{"uri":"Thermometer","surface_form":"thermometer","offset":151},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":180},{"uri":"Boiling_point","surface_form":"boiling point","offset":247},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":264},{"uri":"Normal_pressure","surface_form":"normal pressure","offset":276},{"uri":"Josias_Weitbrecht","surface_form":"Josias Weitbrecht","offset":399},{"uri":"Calibration","surface_form":"recalibrated","offset":417},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":468},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":485},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":637},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":651}]}
