{"id":270736,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromous_acid","text":"Bromous acid is a chemical compound. It is an acid. Its chemical formula is HBrO2. It contains hydrogen and bromite ions. It contains bromine in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt can be made by oxidizing hypobromous acid with hypochlorous acid. It can also be made by careful disproportionation of hypobromous acid. It can also be made by reacting hypobromous acid and bromic acid. They can be used to reduce permanganates to manganates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":18},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":46},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":95},{"uri":"Bromite","surface_form":"bromite","offset":108},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":116},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":134},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":152},{"uri":"Hypobromous_acid","surface_form":"hypobromous acid","offset":209},{"uri":"Hypochlorous_acid","surface_form":"hypochlorous acid","offset":231},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionation","offset":281},{"uri":"Bromic_acid","surface_form":"bromic acid","offset":374},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduce","offset":407},{"uri":"Permanganate","surface_form":"permanganate","offset":414},{"uri":"Manganate","surface_form":"manganate","offset":431}]}
