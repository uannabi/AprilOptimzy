{"id":270738,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perbromic_acid","text":"=\"preserve\">Perbromic acid is a chemical compound. It is an acid. Its chemical formula is HBrO4. It contains hydrogen and perbromate ions.\nPerbromic acid is a very unstable acid. It easily breaks down. It can be made by reacting perbromates with an acid. It releases oxygen and turns into bromic acid. It can also totally break down, releasing bromine gas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":32},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":60},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":109},{"uri":"Perbromate","surface_form":"perbromate","offset":122},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":133},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":267},{"uri":"Bromic_acid","surface_form":"bromic acid","offset":289},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":344}]}
