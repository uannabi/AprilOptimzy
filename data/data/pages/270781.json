{"id":270781,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_trifluoride","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chlorine trifluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ClF3. It contains chlorine and fluoride ions. The chlorine is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nChlorine trifluoride is a colorless gas, but it can be compressed to a light yellow liquid. Chlorine trifluoride is normally sold compressed. It is an interhalogen, and is very reactive. It can burn plastics, sand, skin, hydrogen sulfide, metals, phosphorus, and sulfur. Since it is a much stronger oxidizing agent than oxygen, it can burn things that normally can't burn, like concrete or sand. It reacts with water very violently to make hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid. It can ignite glass after being in it for a while.\nPreparation.\nChlorine trifluoride is made by reacting chlorine with fluorine. This makes other chlorine fluorides which have to be taken out.\nUses.\nChlorine trifluoride is used to make uranium hexafluoride by reacting it with uranium metal. It was looked at as a rocket propellant. It was also looked at as a poison gas. It is too difficult to make and store, though. Chlorine trifluoride can be used to clean areas where semiconductors are made.\nSafety.\nChlorine trifluoride is extremely toxic and dangerous. It is one of the most dangerous chemicals there is. It can catch many things on fire, including things that are usually non-flammable, such as asbestos, concrete, and glass. The fires are almost impossible to put out. It reacts with most things.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":39},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":100},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":113},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":122},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":154},{"uri":"Compression","surface_form":"compressed","offset":238},{"uri":"Interhalogen","surface_form":"interhalogen","offset":334},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":382},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":392},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":404},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":422},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":430},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":446},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":482},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":561},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":623},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":645},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":783},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":978},{"uri":"Propellant","surface_form":"propellant","offset":985},{"uri":"Poison_gas","surface_form":"poison gas","offset":1024},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":1137},{"uri":"Asbestos","surface_form":"asbestos","offset":1368},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":1378},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":1392}]}
