{"id":270851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_10%2C000_problem","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Year 10,000 problem (also known as the Y10K problem, Y10K Bug, and Y10K) is an error machines and computers will encounter when the need to express five digits for a year.\nCultural practicing.\nSome people practice the art of cutting the last two digits of a decade. For example, the \"1970's\" becomes just the \"70's\".\nHowever, this becomes a problem, because to keep order, one will now need to take the last three digits, rather than two.\nCultural confusion.\nThis is also a problem because the \"000's\" might be confused with the legit \"00's\", representing a new century. Also, the year can overflow with certain computer programs. On Microsoft Excel, for instance, in a cell the date 12/31/9999 is a legit date, but 1/1/10000 causes a problem. The date \"ten thousand\" is unable to be supported, producing a large negative instead.\nEfforts.\nSo far, the Long Now Foundation is able to preempt the Y10K by adding a \"0\" in front of the date. So the current year of, will be look like 0. However, it would still be subsceptible to a \"Y100K\" problem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft_Excel","surface_form":"Microsoft Excel","offset":651},{"uri":"Long_Now_Foundation","surface_form":"Long Now Foundation","offset":869}]}
