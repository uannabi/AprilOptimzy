{"id":270881,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Ashdown","text":"Jeremy John Durham \"Paddy\" Ashdown, Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon (27 February 1941 \u2013 22 December 2018) was a British politician and international diplomat. He served as leader of the Liberal Democrats from July 1988 to August 1999.\nBiography.\nPaddy Ashdown was born in New Delhi, British India, but was brought up in Northern Ireland and his Irish accent brought him the nickname \"Paddy\". He served in the Royal Marines from 1959 to 1972 and saw fighting in Borneo, Hong Kong and Northern Ireland. At the 1983 general election, Ashdown became the Liberal Party's Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Yeovil.\nIn 1988, when the Liberal Party merged with the Social Democratic Party to form the Liberal Democrats, Ashdown was elected the leader of the new party and led the party through the 1992 and 1997 general elections. He resigned in 1999, and was given both a knighthood and a seat in the House of Lords. In the House of Lords, he was given the title Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon. From 2002 to 2006 he served as High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHis reputation was damaged slightly in 1992, when it was revealed that he had a five-month extra-marital affair with his secretary, and many British newspapers exposed this in great detail. \"The Sun\" newspaper ran a famous headline which played on Ashdown's name, calling him \"Paddy Pants-Down\".\nAshdown was diagnosed with \"serious\" bladder cancer in October 2018. He died two months later on 22 December 2018 from the disease in Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, at the age of 77.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":115},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":138},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":175},{"uri":"Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Liberal Democrats","offset":189},{"uri":"New_Delhi","surface_form":"New Delhi","offset":275},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":286},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":323},{"uri":"Accent","surface_form":"accent","offset":354},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":377},{"uri":"Royal_Marines","surface_form":"Royal Marines","offset":412},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":464},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":472},{"uri":"The_Troubles","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":486},{"uri":"1983_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"1983 general election","offset":511},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Liberal Party","offset":553},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":569},{"uri":"Constituency","surface_form":"constituency","offset":603},{"uri":"Yeovil","surface_form":"Yeovil","offset":619},{"uri":"Merge","surface_form":"merged","offset":659},{"uri":"Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Social Democratic Party","offset":675},{"uri":"Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Liberal Democrats","offset":711},{"uri":"General_election","surface_form":"general election","offset":822},{"uri":"Knighthood","surface_form":"knighthood","offset":883},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":912},{"uri":"Representative","surface_form":"Representative","offset":1046},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":1065},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":1093},{"uri":"Infidelity","surface_form":"extra-marital affair","offset":1180},{"uri":"Secretary","surface_form":"secretary","offset":1210},{"uri":"Expos%C3%A9","surface_form":"exposed","offset":1249},{"uri":"The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)","surface_form":"The Sun","offset":1280},{"uri":"Headline","surface_form":"headline","offset":1312},{"uri":"Pun","surface_form":"played on","offset":1327},{"uri":"Medical_diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosed","offset":1397},{"uri":"Bladder_cancer","surface_form":"bladder cancer","offset":1422},{"uri":"Norton-sub-Hamdon","surface_form":"Norton-sub-Hamdon","offset":1519},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":1538}]}
