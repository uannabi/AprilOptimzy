{"id":270936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon","text":"Armageddon (Harmaged\u014Dn, Har Megiddo,) is the place where the great war of the end of day will start.\nChristians that believe that Jesus Christ will someday come back to earth, translated the sentences of the Messiah and the Lamb of God, are the symbolism of Jesus, that will return to the earth to fight the Antichrist (or the Beast) in the battle of \"Armageddon\". After that war Satan (or the \"Antichrist\") will be thrown to the bottomless pit, or \"Abyss\" for a 1,000 years, known as the \"Millennium Age\". After Satan will be out of the pit, he will gather one man called \"Gog and Magog\" (In the texts he is named \"God and Magog\" but also named \"Gog kind of Magog\", in Jewish texts, the war of Gog and Magog means the attack of Gog kind of Magog to kill all the Jewish people, and God will kill him and his army. In Christianity, Gog and Magog are two separate people that are Evil.) from the Four corners of the Earth. They will trap the \"Holy Ones\" (means Christians) in the \"Beloved City\", (means Jerusalem). Then Fire will come from God and from the Heavens, and it will destroy Gog and Magog and will trap the Devil in \"Gehenna\" (Gehinom, Valley of Hinom, a place near Jerusalem, lake of fire and brimstone, also known as Hell).\nThe word \"Armageddon\" appears only once in the \"Greek New Testament\". This word comes from the Hebrew \"Har Megiddo\" (), which means - \"Mountain of Megiddo\". In Israel there is a small city, that is in the Azrieli Vally, called Megiddo. The Mountain of Megiddo is a small mountain which had a big Roman fort.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":130},{"uri":"Antichrist","surface_form":"Antichrist","offset":308},{"uri":"Satan","surface_form":"Satan","offset":380},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":782},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":817},{"uri":"Flat_Earth","surface_form":"Four corners of the Earth","offset":894},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":1001},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1038},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"Heaven","offset":1055},{"uri":"Devil","surface_form":"Devil","offset":1116},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":1228},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":1330},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"Mountain","offset":1370},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":1395},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":1531}]}
