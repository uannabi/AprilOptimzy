{"id":270945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine_dioxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Bromine dioxide, also known as bromine(IV) oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BrO2. It contains bromine in its +4 oxidation state. It also contains oxide ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow or yellow-orange solid. It is very unstable. It turns into bromine and oxygen easily. It is similar to chlorine dioxide. It reacts with a base to make bromide and bromate.\nPreparation.\nIt is made when an electric current is passed through a mixture of cold bromine and oxygen gases. It also can be made by reacting bromine in an organic solvent with ozone.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":67},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":128},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":146},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":180},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":186},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":290},{"uri":"Chlorine_dioxide","surface_form":"chlorine dioxide","offset":322},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":357},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":370},{"uri":"Bromate","surface_form":"bromate","offset":382},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":548}]}
