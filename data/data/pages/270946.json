{"id":270946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_bromate","text":"=\"preserve\">Calcium bromate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ca(BrO3)2. It contains calcium and bromate ions.\nProperties.\nCalcium bromate is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water easily. It is an oxidizing agent. It is similar to calcium chloride.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by oxidation (by electrolysis) of calcium bromide solution. It can also be made by dissolving bromine in hot calcium hydroxide solution. This also makes calcium bromide.\nUses.\nIt is added to flour to make it better in some areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":33},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":99},{"uri":"Bromate","surface_form":"bromate","offset":111},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":119},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":214},{"uri":"Calcium_chloride","surface_form":"calcium chloride","offset":248},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":293},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":307},{"uri":"Calcium_bromide","surface_form":"calcium bromide","offset":324},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":384},{"uri":"Calcium_hydroxide","surface_form":"calcium hydroxide","offset":399}]}
