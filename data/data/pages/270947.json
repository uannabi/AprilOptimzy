{"id":270947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bromate","text":"Sodium bromate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaBrO3, which means that one molecule of it contains one atom of sodium and one ion of bromate.\nProperties.\nSodium bromate is a colorless solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nSodium bromate is made by reacting sodium hydroxide with bromic acid. It can also be made by electrolysis of a sodium bromide solution. It may be made by dissolving bromine in hot sodium hydroxide solution. This also makes sodium bromide.\nUses.\nIt is used to dye hair. It is also used to dye other things. It can be used to dissolve gold.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":20},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":43},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":92},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":120},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":128},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":143},{"uri":"Bromate","surface_form":"bromate","offset":150},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":223},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":288},{"uri":"Bromic_acid","surface_form":"bromic acid","offset":310},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":346},{"uri":"Sodium_bromide","surface_form":"sodium bromide","offset":364},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":379},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":418},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":433}]}
