{"id":270948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_bromate","text":"Potassium bromate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KBrO3. It contains potassium and bromate ions.\nProperties.\nPotassium bromate is a white solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It might be a carcinogen.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by dissolving bromine in hot potassium hydroxide. It can also be made by electrolysis of potassium bromide solution.\nUses.\nPotassium bromate is used to make wheat flour better. Some places have banned it from being added to flour because it might be a carcinogen. Normally when the bread is baked the potassium bromate is broken down. If there is too much, then some might be left over in the bread, which is bad.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":23},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":85},{"uri":"Bromate","surface_form":"bromate","offset":99},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":107},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":176},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":207},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":261},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":276},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":320},{"uri":"Potassium_bromide","surface_form":"potassium bromide","offset":336},{"uri":"Wheat_flour","surface_form":"wheat flour","offset":404},{"uri":"Ban","surface_form":"ban","offset":441}]}
