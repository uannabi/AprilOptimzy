{"id":27096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hangeul () (formerly Hangul \uD55C\uAD74) is the alphabet (or alphabetic syllabary) used for the Korean language.\nIt was made by Sejong the Great, the 4th King of the Joseon Dynasty in 1443. It is still being used now. When Hangeul was spreading, King Sejong published \"Hunminjeong'eum Haeryebon\" (\uD6C8\uBBFC\uC815\uC74C \uD574\uB840\uBCF8). It was picked as the 'Memory of the World' by UNESCO in 1997.\nIn this book, the design ideas of Hangeul and information about its use were written down in detail. The book \"Hunminjeong'eum Haeryebon\" states the two design ideas of Hangeul. The first one is that the consonants of Hangeul look like vocal organs. The second one is that the vowels of Hangeul are based on Cheonji'in (\uCC9C\uC9C0\uC778). Cheonji'in refers to the three elements of philosophy which are sky (\uCC9C), earth (\uC9C0) and human (\uC778). Because of these ideas, Hangeul is well known for being easy to learn.\nAlthough it was only used by the lower classes at first, Hangeul became the official writing script of Korea in the late 19th century. Today it is the most used writing system of both North Korea and South Korea. North Korea abolished the use of Hanja, and today North Koreans write only in Hangeul. In South Korea, people write mostly in Hangeul, but sometimes Hanja is still used.\nVowels.\nVowels are letters like A, E, O and so on\nThere are 21 letters for vowels in Hangul.\nThose with two small lines are pronounced with an extra \"y\" first.\nBlocks.\nThe consonants and vowels are combined into blocks of syllables. A syllable means one vowel and a few consonants, like \"han\" and \"geul\".\nThe blocks look like these examples: \uC11C\uC6B8 \uD55C\uAE00 \uD3C9\uC591","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":52},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllabary","offset":76},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean language","offset":100},{"uri":"Sejong_the_Great","surface_form":"Sejong the Great","offset":132},{"uri":"Joseon","surface_form":"Joseon Dynasty","offset":170},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":358},{"uri":"The_Elements_of_Style","surface_form":"elements","offset":731},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":743},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":1082},{"uri":"Hanja","surface_form":"Hanja","offset":1115},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":1172}]}
