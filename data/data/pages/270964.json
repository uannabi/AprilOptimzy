This is a biography of two great music composers - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Salieri knows Mozart is a great composer but tries to stop him out of envy.\nThe movie was shot on location in Prague, Krom\u011B\u0159\u00ED\u017E and Vienna. Notably, Forman was able to shoot scenes in the Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague, where \"Don Giovanni\" and \"La Clemenza di Tito\" were first shown two centuries before. Several other scenes were shot at the Barrandov Studios.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":20},{"uri":"Biographical_movie","surface_form":"biographical","offset":29},{"uri":"Period_drama","surface_form":"period drama","offset":42},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":55},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":61},{"uri":"Milos_Forman","surface_form":"Milos Forman","offset":73},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Oscars","offset":100},{"uri":"Biography","surface_form":"biography","offset":118},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":147},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart","surface_form":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","offset":159},{"uri":"Antonio_Salieri","surface_form":"Antonio Salieri","offset":187},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":314},{"uri":"Krom%C4%9B%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BE","surface_form":"Krom\u011B\u0159\u00ED\u017E","offset":322},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":335},{"uri":"Estates_Theatre","surface_form":"Count Nostitz Theatre","offset":391},{"uri":"Don_Giovanni","surface_form":"Don Giovanni","offset":431},{"uri":"La_Clemenza_di_Tito","surface_form":"La Clemenza di Tito","offset":450},{"uri":"Barrandov_Studios","surface_form":"Barrandov Studios","offset":548}]}
