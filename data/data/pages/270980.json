{"id":270980,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromic_acid","text":"=\"preserve\">Bromic acid is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is HBrO3. It contains hydrogen and bromate ions.\nProperties.\nBromic acid cannot be found pure. It can be found in a solution though. It is very corrosive and a strong oxidizing agent. It is similar to chloric acid.\nPreparation.\nBromic acid is made by adding a strong acid to a bromate such as sodium bromate.\nUses.\nBromic acid can be used to make bromates, although it is not normally used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":29},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":62},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":111},{"uri":"Bromate","surface_form":"bromate","offset":124},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":132},{"uri":"Corrosive","surface_form":"corrosive","offset":233},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":256},{"uri":"Chloric_acid","surface_form":"chloric acid","offset":290},{"uri":"Strong_acid","surface_form":"strong acid","offset":349},{"uri":"Bromate","surface_form":"bromate","offset":366},{"uri":"Sodium_bromate","surface_form":"sodium bromate","offset":382}]}
