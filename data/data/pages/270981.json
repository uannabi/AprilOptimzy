{"id":270981,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine_pentafluoride","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bromine pentafluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BrF5. It contains bromine and fluoride ions. The bromine is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nBromine pentafluoride is a pale yellow liquid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with water to make bromic acid and hydrofluoric acid.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting hot bromine with fluorine. This makes some bromine trifluoride. Potassium bromide can be reacted with fluorine. This makes bromine pentafluoride and potassium fluoride.\nUses.\nIt is used to look at the isotopes of oxygen. It can add fluoride ions to other chemical compounds. It can be used as an oxidizing agent in rockets. It can be used as poison as well.\nSafety.\nBromine pentafluoride is very corrosive. Just a little kills most animals. It can ignite powdered metals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":40},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":101},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":113},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":122},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":153},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":246},{"uri":"Bromic_acid","surface_form":"bromic acid","offset":292},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":308},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":384},{"uri":"Bromine_trifluoride","surface_form":"bromine trifluoride","offset":410},{"uri":"Potassium_bromide","surface_form":"Potassium bromide","offset":431},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":469},{"uri":"Potassium_fluoride","surface_form":"potassium fluoride","offset":516},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":568},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":580},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":682},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":831}]}
