{"id":270982,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine_trifluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Bromine trifluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BrF3. It contains bromine and fluoride ions. The bromine is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow liquid. It absorbs water. It reacts when it is placed in water. It can be dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid. It conducts electricity. It can dissolve other fluorides.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting cold fluorine with bromine. Hot fluorine makes bromine pentafluoride.\nUses.\nIt is used to make uranium hexafluoride for uranium making. This makes the uranium able to explode in an atomic bomb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":37},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":98},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":110},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":150},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":294},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":408},{"uri":"Bromine_pentafluoride","surface_form":"bromine pentafluoride","offset":450},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"uranium","offset":523},{"uri":"Atomic_bomb","surface_form":"atomic bomb","offset":584}]}
