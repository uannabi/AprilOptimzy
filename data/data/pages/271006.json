The term \"Caucasian\" is often used as a synonym for \"white people\", but sometimes it means people of the Caucasus Mountains.\nBefore the modern age, no Europeans thought of themselves as \"white\". Instead, they defined their race, ancestry, or ethnicity in terms of their nationality (Greek, Roman, etc.). The concept of a unified white race came into use in the 17th century, or later.
