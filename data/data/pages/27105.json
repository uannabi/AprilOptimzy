{"id":27105,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans","text":"Americans are citizens of the United States. They are of many different ethnic groups and religions, due to immigration from all over the world. With this in mind, Americans usually embrace both their ethnic and/or cultural background along with their U.S. nationality at the same time.\nAlso, there are other groups that did not immigrate to the United States but became American because of American expansion in the late 19th century. These groups are people from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. The Philippines is now an independent country.\nIn addition to the United States, Americans and people of American descent can be found around the world. Three to seven million Americans are estimated to be living outside the United States.\nMost Americans are of European descent. The number of Latin Americans and Asians is more than ever. About 13% of Americans are of African descent. People from many cultures, religions and ethnic groups live in the U.S. This is why the United States is called the \"Melting Pot\".\nThe United States is a diverse country. Six races are officially recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes: White, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander.\nThe current population of Americans in the U.S. is over 320 million people as of 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":14},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":30},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":72},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":90},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":108},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":465},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":473},{"uri":"Guam","surface_form":"Guam","offset":486},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":499},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":940},{"uri":"Ethnic_groups_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"diverse","offset":1053},{"uri":"U.S._Census_Bureau","surface_form":"U.S. Census Bureau","offset":1113}]}
