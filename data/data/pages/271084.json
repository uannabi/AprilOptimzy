{"id":271084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_I_of_Spain","text":"Louis I of Spain (25 August 1707 \u2013 31 August 1724) was the King of Spain and eldest son of Philip V of Spain and Maria Luisa of Savoy. His reign was one of the shortest in Spanish history. It is often considered unremarkable. However, his marriage to his father's cousin Louis \u00C9lisabeth d'Orl\u00E9ans helped the country's relations with France. His wife was a minor French princess.\nLouis was born in Madrid. He was the heir to the throne from birth. He held the title Prince of Asturias. He was given the names Louis, after his grandfather the King Louis XIV, and Felipe, in honour of his father. He was a first cousin of Louis XV of France as well as the future Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia.\nLouis was King of Spain from 14 January to 31 August 1724, less than eight months. During his short reign he was nicknamed \"The beloved\" and \"The liberal\" (\"El Bien Amado\" and \"El Liberal\" in Spanish). His reign ended when he died of smallpox. He had no children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_of_Spain","surface_form":"King of Spain","offset":59},{"uri":"Philip_V_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip V of Spain","offset":91},{"uri":"Maria_Luisa_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Maria Luisa of Savoy","offset":113},{"uri":"Louis_%C3%89lisabeth_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis \u00C9lisabeth d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":271},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":333},{"uri":"Prince_of_the_blood","surface_form":"minor French princess","offset":356},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":397},{"uri":"Prince_of_Asturias","surface_form":"Prince of Asturias","offset":465},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":546},{"uri":"Louis_XV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XV of France","offset":619},{"uri":"Charles_Emmanuel_III_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia","offset":660},{"uri":"Smallpox","surface_form":"smallpox","offset":928}]}
