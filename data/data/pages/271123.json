He reigned from 1670 to 1723, and was the elder son of Grand Duke Ferdinando II of Tuscany. Cosimo's fifty long reign, the longest in Tuscan history, was marked by a series of regulatory laws. His reign also saw Tuscany's bad finances become even worse. He was succeeded by his elder surviving son, Gian Gastone de' Medici, when he died, in 1723.\nHe married Marguerite Louise d'Orl\u00E9ans, a cousin of Louis XIV. It was a bad marriage and Marguerite Louise eventually left Tuscany to remain at the Convent of Montmartre in Paris. Together, they had 3 children. In later life, he tried to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as heiress of Tuscany, but Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it. Tuscany passed it to the House of Lorraine in 1737.\nIssue.\nCosimo III's official style was \"Cosimo the Third, By the Grace of God, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany","surface_form":"Grand Duke of Tuscany","offset":77},{"uri":"Grand_Duke_Ferdinando_II_of_Tuscany","surface_form":"Grand Duke Ferdinando II of Tuscany","offset":155},{"uri":"Gian_Gastone_de%27_Medici","surface_form":"Gian Gastone de' Medici","offset":399},{"uri":"Marguerite_Louise_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Marguerite Louise d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":458},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":499},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":620},{"uri":"Charles_VI%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor","offset":745},{"uri":"House_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"House of Lorraine","offset":822}]}
