{"id":271124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Gastone_de%27_Medici%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany","text":"Gian Gastone de' Medici (24 May 1671 \u2013 9 July 1737) was the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany. He was the second son of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Marguerite Louise d'Orl\u00E9ans. His sister, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, the Electress Palatine, married him to Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg in 1697. The two remained childless and it was common knowledge that Gian Gastone was homosexual. Gian Gastone succeeded his father as Grand Duke in 1723.\nIn his reign he reversed all his father's laws and stopped taxes for poorer people, repealed (got rid of) the anti-Jewish laws and stopped public executions. His father, Cosimo III, wanted the his sister to succeed him but Spain, Great Britain, Austria and the Dutch Republic disregarded and made Charles III of Spain his heir. Charles changed his claim to Francis III of Lorraine. Francis then became the Grand Duke on 9 July 1737 ending almost 300 years of Medici rule over Florence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1671","surface_form":"1671","offset":32},{"uri":"1737","surface_form":"1737","offset":46},{"uri":"House_of_Medici","surface_form":"Medici","offset":65},{"uri":"Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany","surface_form":"Grand Duke of Tuscany","offset":72},{"uri":"Cosimo_III_de%27_Medici%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany","surface_form":"Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany","offset":120},{"uri":"Marguerite_Louise_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Marguerite Louise d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":170},{"uri":"Anna_Maria_Luisa_de%27_Medici","surface_form":"Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici","offset":211},{"uri":"Anna_Maria_Franziska_of_Saxe-Lauenburg","surface_form":"Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg","offset":279},{"uri":"1697","surface_form":"1697","offset":321},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":404},{"uri":"Cosimo_III","surface_form":"Cosimo III","offset":643},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":696},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":703},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":718},{"uri":"Dutch_Republic","surface_form":"Dutch Republic","offset":734},{"uri":"Charles_III_of_Spain","surface_form":"Charles III of Spain","offset":770},{"uri":"Francis_III_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Francis III of Lorraine","offset":830},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":949}]}
