{"id":271215,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocalcium_phosphate","text":"=\"preserve\">Monocalcium phosphate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ca(H2PO4)2. It contains phosphate, calcium, and hydrogen ions.\nProperties.\nMonocalcium phosphate is a colorless solid. It dissolves a little in water to make an acidic solution. It is made by replacing one of the hydrogen ions in phosphoric acid with a calcium ion.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting calcium phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. This makes monocalcium phosphate.\nUses.\nIt is used in baking powder. When it is dissolved in water, it makes an acidic solution which reacts with the sodium bicarbonate to make carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes it rise. It is also used in fertilizers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":39},{"uri":"Phosphate","surface_form":"phosphate","offset":106},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":117},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":130},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":139},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":243},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":312},{"uri":"Calcium_phosphate","surface_form":"calcium phosphate","offset":384},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":412},{"uri":"Baking_powder","surface_form":"baking powder","offset":481},{"uri":"Sodium_bicarbonate","surface_form":"sodium bicarbonate","offset":577},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":604},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":673}]}
