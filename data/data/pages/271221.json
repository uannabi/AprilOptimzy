{"id":271221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonzai","text":"Toonzai was a group of cartoons broadcast on Saturday morning on The CW. It was first broadcast on August 14, 2010. It used to be named The CW4Kids. The programs were broadcast on weekday afternoons.\nThe block is programmed by 4Kids Entertainment. They also programmed the 4Kids TV on Fox until December 2008. 4Kids also indicated that it will retain \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" and \"Sonic X\" in its lineup, along with adding \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\", a redone version of \"Dragon Ball Z\" from Funimation Entertainment that is shared with Nicktoons.\nProgramming.\nIn most markets, most affiliates use the network's current Saturday morning schedule. Some, such as Atlanta's WUPA-TV broadcast the block on Sundays. This is usually done because the stations were at one time UPN affiliates and UPN did not have children's television programming on Saturday mornings. Former WB affiliate WCCT-TV in Hartford airs the first three hours of the block on Saturday mornings and the last two hours on Sunday mornings to make room for their own programing.\nKMYS in San Antonio, currently the newest CW affiliate has decided to air the block during early Sunday morning and early Monday morning (split into a two-hour and three-hour block) airing before 5am due to its previous commitment of airing Fox's \"Weekend Marketplace\" infomercial block on Saturday mornings (a holdover from its MyNetworkTV affiliation), along with already existing religious and paid programming on Sunday mornings; this by default will force most younger viewers of the block in that market to record it overnight for later viewing.\nSchedule.\nAll times Pacific. Actual times may vary, depending on affiliate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["programming block"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":23},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":32},{"uri":"The_CW_Television_Network","surface_form":"The CW","offset":65},{"uri":"The_CW4Kids","surface_form":"The CW4Kids","offset":136},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"programs","offset":153},{"uri":"4Kids_Entertainment","surface_form":"4Kids Entertainment","offset":227},{"uri":"4Kids_TV","surface_form":"4Kids TV","offset":273},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox","offset":285},{"uri":"Yu-Gi-Oh%21_(2000_TV_series)","surface_form":"Yu-Gi-Oh!","offset":352},{"uri":"Sonic_X","surface_form":"Sonic X","offset":368},{"uri":"List_of_Dragon_Ball_Z_Kai_episodes","surface_form":"Dragon Ball Z Kai","offset":411},{"uri":"Dragon_Ball_Z","surface_form":"Dragon Ball Z","offset":452},{"uri":"Funimation_Entertainment","surface_form":"Funimation Entertainment","offset":472},{"uri":"Nicktoons_(TV_channel)","surface_form":"Nicktoons","offset":517},{"uri":"Affiliate","surface_form":"affiliate","offset":563},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"network's","offset":582},{"uri":"Atlanta","surface_form":"Atlanta","offset":641},{"uri":"WUPA-TV","surface_form":"WUPA-TV","offset":651},{"uri":"Television_station","surface_form":"stations","offset":724},{"uri":"UPN","surface_form":"UPN","offset":750},{"uri":"The_WB_Television_Network","surface_form":"WB","offset":849},{"uri":"WCCT-TV","surface_form":"WCCT-TV","offset":862},{"uri":"Hartford%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Hartford","offset":873},{"uri":"KMYS","surface_form":"KMYS","offset":1024},{"uri":"San_Antonio%2C_Texas","surface_form":"San Antonio","offset":1032},{"uri":"Weekend_Marketplace","surface_form":"Weekend Marketplace","offset":1272},{"uri":"Infomercial","surface_form":"infomercial","offset":1293},{"uri":"MyNetworkTV","surface_form":"MyNetworkTV","offset":1353},{"uri":"Pacific_Time_Zone_(North_America)","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":1596}]}
