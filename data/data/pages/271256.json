{"id":271256,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business","text":"A small business, sometimes called a mom and pop store by some in the United States, is a business that is privately owned and operated. They have a small number of employees and do not sell many things. Whether or not the law says that a business is \"small\" is different in different countries and industries.\nSmall businesses are common in many countries. Some examples include: convenience stores, other small shops (such as a bakery), hairdresser<nowiki/>s, tradesmen, lawyers, accountants, restaurants, guest houses, photographers, small-scale manufacturing, and online business, such as web design and programming.\nGood things about small business.\nA small business can be started at a very low cost. It also does not need to be open all the time.\nIndependence is another good thing about owning a small business. Being able to operate by themselves is a good thing for small business owners. Small business owners can make their own decisions about what they want to do with their company. However, entrepreneurs often must work very long hours and understand that their customers are their bosses.\nMany organizations in the United States also give help to small businesses, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.\nProblems for small businesses.\nSmall businesses often face a lot of problems because of their size.\nIn the United States, some of the largest concerns of small business owners are insurance costs, high energy costs and taxes.\nAnother problem for several small businesses is the fact that much larger businesses can influence their chances for success.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":70},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":90},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":165},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":223},{"uri":"Convenience_store","surface_form":"convenience store","offset":381},{"uri":"Bakery","surface_form":"bakery","offset":430},{"uri":"Hairdresser","surface_form":"hairdresser","offset":439},{"uri":"Tradesman","surface_form":"tradesmen","offset":462},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":473},{"uri":"Accountant","surface_form":"accountant","offset":482},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":495},{"uri":"Motel","surface_form":"guest houses","offset":508},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":522},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":549},{"uri":"Web_design","surface_form":"web design","offset":593},{"uri":"Entrepreneur","surface_form":"entrepreneur","offset":1006},{"uri":"Customer","surface_form":"customer","offset":1078},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1380},{"uri":"Insurance","surface_form":"insurance","offset":1453},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"energy","offset":1475},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":1492},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1588}]}
