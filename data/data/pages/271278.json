{"id":271278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement","text":"e=\"preserve\">An art movement, or \"ism\", is a style in art. It may have a common philosophy, followed by a group of artists. It may be a label given by a critic to describe a type of artwork. It is typical of the post-photography era that art explores new directions.\nSome art movements can be pinned down to a time and place, or to particular artists. Verbal explanation of movements may come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto (published statement). Quite often, a movement is labelled afterwards by some art historian or critic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":54},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":80},{"uri":"Label","surface_form":"label","offset":136},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":217},{"uri":"Manifesto","surface_form":"manifesto","offset":454}]}
