{"id":271285,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art","text":"Conceptual art even questions the nature of art. Joseph Kosuth elevated this into a definition of art itself in his early manifesto of conceptual art.\nThe notion that art should examine its own nature was already part of art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists began a far more radical analysis of art than was previously done. One of the first things they questioned was the assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.\nConceptual art has come to mean all contemporary art which does not use the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radical","surface_form":"radical","offset":406},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":414},{"uri":"Contemporary_art","surface_form":"contemporary art","offset":628},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":690},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":703}]}
