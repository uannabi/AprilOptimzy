{"id":27137,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime","text":"In Australian Aboriginal culture, life is based on a foundation of beliefs which are called the Dreamtime, or The Dreaming. This is a complex set of ideas with deep levels of meanings. The Dreamtime has four parts: The beginning of everything; the life and power of the ancestors; the way of life and death; and power in life. Dreamtime was all four of these things at the same time because it is more powerful than time and space. In it all things exist at once. The Aboriginal peoples call Dreamtime the all-at-once time because they think it is the past, present, and future at the same time.

Some parts of the Dreamtime are only known to those who have inherited the right to the knowledge.\nDreamtime is often used to describe the time before time, or the time of the creation. Most Aboriginals believe that all life is connected to the great spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime. Every hill, water hole, river, the sky, every feature was created in the Dreamtime. The journeys of the ancestors across the country created the landscape, and populated it with plants and animals. These journeys are often told in cycles of stories, songs and dances, known as \"iwara\", or songlines. These great spirit ancestors have not gone, they are still present, even if they can not be seen. The ceremonies of songs and dance keep the people in contact with the spirits. \"Without ceremony the land soon dies...\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_Australian","surface_form":"Australian Aboriginal","offset":3},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":25},{"uri":"Central_Australia","surface_form":"Central Australia","offset":1005},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":1028},{"uri":"Inherit","surface_form":"inherited","offset":1514}]}
