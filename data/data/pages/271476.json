It was dissolved in 1874.\nThe Company had armed forces and armed ships. It fought against various Indian rulers and struggled against the Dutch East India Company and other European nations. It was ruled by one governor and 24 directors. It became a monopoly in most parts of India.\nThe company was dissolved in 1874. Its role was taken over by the Government of India (the British Raj). At its height, the Raj covered a huge area from Baluchistan in the west to Burma in the east, plus Ceylon and a number of other islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":45},{"uri":"Joint-stock_company","surface_form":"joint-stock company","offset":53},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":78},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":99},{"uri":"East_Indies","surface_form":"East Indies","offset":143},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":179},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":189},{"uri":"Charter","surface_form":"charter","offset":211},{"uri":"Presidency_armies","surface_form":"presidency armies","offset":317},{"uri":"Battle_of_Plassey","surface_form":"Battle of Plassey","offset":347},{"uri":"Dutch_East_India_Company","surface_form":"Dutch East India Company","offset":561},{"uri":"Nations","surface_form":"nations","offset":605},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":634},{"uri":"Board_of_Directors","surface_form":"directors","offset":650},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":797},{"uri":"Balochistan_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Baluchistan","offset":859},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":886},{"uri":"Ceylon","surface_form":"Ceylon","offset":910}]}
