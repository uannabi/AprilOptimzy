{"id":271531,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cheating in video games is when a player creates an advantage for themself beyond what normal gameplay would allow. In general, cheating is breaking the rules to get an unfair advantage. In video games, a player usually cheats to make the game easier.\nThese kind of advantages can often be activated by entering codes. A set of cheat codes may have been written into the game's programming by the game's developers. When entered, a code activates a corresponding advantage. Cheat codes can also be created by added software, called a game trainer. Players can also cheat by taking advantage of software bugs in the game.\nCheat codes makes the system do things that are not normal. For example, pressing a certain sequence of buttons may increase a character's hit points in an role-playing game, or make a car drive faster in a racing game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":25},{"uri":"Advantage","surface_form":"advantage","offset":65},{"uri":"Gameplay","surface_form":"gameplay","offset":107},{"uri":"Cheating","surface_form":"cheating","offset":141},{"uri":"Fairness","surface_form":"unfair","offset":182},{"uri":"Code","surface_form":"code","offset":325},{"uri":"Programming","surface_form":"programming","offset":391},{"uri":"Video_game_developer","surface_form":"developers","offset":417},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":528},{"uri":"Trainer_(games)","surface_form":"game trainer","offset":547},{"uri":"Software_bug","surface_form":"software bug","offset":607},{"uri":"Hit_points","surface_form":"hit points","offset":773},{"uri":"Role-playing_game","surface_form":"role-playing game","offset":790},{"uri":"Racing_game","surface_form":"racing game","offset":841}]}
