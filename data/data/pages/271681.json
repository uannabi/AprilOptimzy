{"id":271681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malays","text":"The Malays (Malay: \"Melayu\", Jawi:) are an Austronesian ethnic group in Southeast Asia. They mainly live in the Malay Peninsula and many parts of the Malay Archipelago, including Brunei, Singapore, Borneo and eastern Sumatra.\nOverview.\nThe Malay language is one of the major languages of the world. Their religion was animist and a mix of other Chinese religions at first but now they are mostly Muslims. They use wood for most of their traditional villages which are called \"kampongs\".\nMalays make up a majority of Malaysia and Brunei's populations. They make a significant populations in Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nLanguage.\nMost ethnic Malays speak one or more of the many dialects (versions) of the Malay language, a language of the Austronesian family of languages. In Indonesia, the standardized form of Malay is Indonesian (). In Malaysia, the standard form is called Malaysian (. About 80% of their words mean the same thing in either dialect. These naming policies were created to form national unities in the two countries instead of making the Malays a ruling influence or the ruling class, something that it is in Brunei. In Brunei, Thailand and Singapore it is known as \"Bahasa Melayu\".\nToday, the language is usually written a version of the Roman alphabet, called Rumi. Malay written using the Arabic alphabet is called Jawi, which is mostly used in official and religious contexts. Jawi is more common than Rumi in very conservative Muslim areas like Kelantan in Malaysia and Pattani in Thailand.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay","offset":12},{"uri":"Jawi","surface_form":"Jawi","offset":29},{"uri":"Austronesian_peoples","surface_form":"Austronesian","offset":43},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":56},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":72},{"uri":"Malay_Peninsula","surface_form":"Malay Peninsula","offset":112},{"uri":"Malay_Archipelago","surface_form":"Malay Archipelago","offset":150},{"uri":"Brunei","surface_form":"Brunei","offset":179},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":187},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":198},{"uri":"Sumatra","surface_form":"Sumatra","offset":217},{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay language","offset":240},{"uri":"Animist","surface_form":"animist","offset":318},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":396},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":414},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":516},{"uri":"Brunei","surface_form":"Brunei's","offset":529},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":590},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":601},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":615},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":685},{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay language","offset":712},{"uri":"Austronesian_languages","surface_form":"Austronesian","offset":746},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":783},{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay","offset":819},{"uri":"Indonesian_language","surface_form":"Indonesian","offset":828},{"uri":"Malaysian_language","surface_form":"Malaysian","offset":884},{"uri":"Cognate","surface_form":"mean the same thing","offset":922},{"uri":"Brunei","surface_form":"Brunei","offset":1146},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":1154},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":1167},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Roman alphabet","offset":1265},{"uri":"Malay_alphabet","surface_form":"Rumi","offset":1288},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic alphabet","offset":1318},{"uri":"Jawi","surface_form":"Jawi","offset":1344},{"uri":"Kelantan","surface_form":"Kelantan","offset":1476},{"uri":"Pattani","surface_form":"Pattani","offset":1501}]}
