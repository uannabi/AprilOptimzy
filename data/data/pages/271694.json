{"id":271694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyxena_of_Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg","text":"Polyxena of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg (Polyxena Christina Johanna; 21 September 1706 \u2013 13 January 1735) was the second wife of Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, future King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia.\nBiography.\nPolyxena was born at Langenschwalbach in Hesse and was baptised with the names \"Polyxena Christina Johanna \". King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia approached her family and proposed a union between Polyxena and Victor Amadeus II's son and heir Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont. A previous match organised by \"Agostino Steffani\" with a daughter of Duke Rinaldo d'Este of Modena had come to nothing. His first wife, Anne Christine of Sulzbach died March 1723 having given birth to a son.\nThe engagement was announced on 2 July 1724. The marriage was celebrated in person at Thonon in Chablais on 20 August 1724. The happy marriage produced six children.\nPraised as an attractive, cultured and kind woman, Polyxena founded a home for penniless mothers in Turin in 1732, redecorated the \"Villa della Regina\", the hunting lodge of Stupingi, and the Church of Saint Giuseppe in Turin. She popularised \"chinoiserie\". She was also a patron of Giovanni Battista Crosato, a baroque painter.\nHaving been ill since June 1734, she died at the Royal Palace of Turin. Originally buried at the \"Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista\", she was moved to the Royal Basilica of Superga in 1786 by her son Victor Amadeus III. Two years after her death, her husband married Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine, sister of the future Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Charles_Emmanuel_III_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont","offset":127},{"uri":"Bad_Schwalbach","surface_form":"Langenschwalbach","offset":243},{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse","offset":263},{"uri":"Victor_Amadeus_II","surface_form":"King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia","offset":332},{"uri":"Charles_Emmanuel_III_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont","offset":464},{"uri":"House_of_Este","surface_form":"Duke Rinaldo d'Este of Modena","offset":571},{"uri":"Anne_Christine_of_Sulzbach","surface_form":"Anne Christine of Sulzbach","offset":638},{"uri":"Thonon-les-Bains","surface_form":"Thonon","offset":796},{"uri":"Chablais","surface_form":"Chablais","offset":806},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":976},{"uri":"Palazzina_di_caccia_of_Stupinigi","surface_form":"Stupingi","offset":1050},{"uri":"Chinoiserie","surface_form":"chinoiserie","offset":1120},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"baroque","offset":1188},{"uri":"Royal_Palace_of_Turin","surface_form":"Royal Palace of Turin","offset":1254},{"uri":"Royal_Basilica_of_Superga","surface_form":"Royal Basilica of Superga","offset":1363},{"uri":"Victor_Amadeus_III","surface_form":"Victor Amadeus III","offset":1408},{"uri":"Elisabeth_Therese_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine","offset":1475},{"uri":"Francis_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor","offset":1527}]}
