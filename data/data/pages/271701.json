Her mother was a niece of Louis XIV.\nHer mother wanted her to marry her cousin Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans but the Duke of Orl\u00E9ans refused.

The already twice widowed Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia asked for her hand in late 1736 and the marriage went ahead.\nThe couple married in person on 1 April 1737. Charles Emmanuel III was her first cousin, his mother being Anne Marie d'Orl\u00E9ans \u2013 a half sister of her mother \u00C9lisabeth Charlotte. The marriage produced three children, only one of whom survived infancy.\n\u00C9lisabeth Th\u00E9r\u00E8se died at the Palace of Venaria aged 29, having fallen ill with a fever after childbirth. She was buried in the Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista in Turin.
