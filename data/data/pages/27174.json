{"id":27174,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue","text":"Niue is an island country in the south Pacific. Situated between Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands, it is commonly known as \"Rock of Polynesia\". It has its own government, but it is an associated state of New Zealand. This means that Niue's head of state is New Zealand's sovereign (queen) in right, and most diplomatic relations are conducted by the latter on Niue's behalf.\nThe territory is 2,400 kilometres northeast of New Zealand in a triangle between Tonga, Samoa, and the Cook Islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":11},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":18},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":39},{"uri":"Polynesia","surface_form":"Polynesia","offset":133},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":160},{"uri":"Associated_state","surface_form":"associated state","offset":185},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":205},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"sovereign","offset":272},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomatic","offset":309},{"uri":"Behalf","surface_form":"behalf","offset":368},{"uri":"Tonga","surface_form":"Tonga","offset":457},{"uri":"Samoa","surface_form":"Samoa","offset":464},{"uri":"Cook_Islands","surface_form":"Cook Islands","offset":479}]}
