When he drinks too much wine, he starts speaking in Latin. He has pimples on his face but is rather intelligent. Chaucer used to write about the medieval age. Anachronism can be found in his writings easily. Everything that he has described about the Summoner is set in that time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canterbury_Tales","surface_form":"Canterbury Tales","offset":57}]}
