{"id":271800,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_chloride","text":"Lead(II) chloride, also known as plumbous chloride and lead dichloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbCl2. It contains lead and chloride ions. The lead is in the +2 oxidation state. Its use may lead to lead poisoning.\nProperties.\nLead(II) chloride is a colorless crystalline solid. It does not dissolve well in water. It can dissolve in solutions that have chloride ions in them. It reacts with molten sodium nitrite to make lead(II) oxide.\nPreparation.\nLead(II) chloride is made by reacting sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid with lead nitrate. It can also be made by reacting lead(IV) oxide with hydrochloric acid. It can also be made by reacting chlorine with lead.\nUses.\nIt is used to make ceramics. A basic chloride is used in pigments.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":77},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":139},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":148},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":157},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":185},{"uri":"Lead_poisoning","surface_form":"lead poisoning","offset":222},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":283},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":357},{"uri":"Sodium_nitrite","surface_form":"sodium nitrite","offset":422},{"uri":"Lead(II)_oxide","surface_form":"lead(II) oxide","offset":445},{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"sodium chloride","offset":512},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":531},{"uri":"Lead_nitrate","surface_form":"lead nitrate","offset":554},{"uri":"Lead(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"lead(IV) oxide","offset":600},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":671},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":716}]}
