{"id":271805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic","text":"A relic is an object, especially a piece of the body or a personal item of someone of religious importance, that was carefully preserved with an air of veneration as a memorial that you can touch. Relics are an important aspect of Buddhism, some denominations of Christianity, Hinduism, shamanism, and many other personal belief systems.\nThe word relic comes from the Latin \"reliquiae\" ('remains'). A reliquary is a shrine that houses one or more relics.\nSome well-known religious relics include the Tooth of Buddha, the Holy Grail, the Crown of Thorns, the True Cross of Jesus, the Staff of Moses, and the Sword of Mohammed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":48},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":86},{"uri":"Preservation","surface_form":"preserved","offset":127},{"uri":"Veneration","surface_form":"veneration","offset":152},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":231},{"uri":"Religious_denomination","surface_form":"denominations","offset":246},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":263},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":277},{"uri":"Shamanism","surface_form":"shamanism","offset":287},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":368},{"uri":"Reliquary","surface_form":"reliquary","offset":401},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":416},{"uri":"Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":509},{"uri":"Holy_Grail","surface_form":"Holy Grail","offset":521},{"uri":"True_Cross","surface_form":"True Cross","offset":558},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":592},{"uri":"Mohammed","surface_form":"Mohammed","offset":616}]}
