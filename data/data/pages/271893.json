{"id":271893,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_sulfide","text":"Lead(II) sulfide, also known as plumbuus sulfide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbS. It contains lead and sulfide ions. The lead is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nLead(II) sulfide is a black solid. It does not react with acids. It reacts with air at a high temperature to make lead(II) oxide. It is one of the least toxic forms of lead. This does not mean that it is not toxic, though. It is the result of a test for hydrogen sulfide. Paper soaked in lead(II) acetate is passed through hydrogen sulfide. The colorless lead(II) acetate turns black.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting hydrogen sulfide with lead(II) acetate or lead(II) nitrate. This makes a black solid.\nOccurrence.\nIt is found as the mineral galena. Galena is a little shinier.\nUses.\nIt was once used as a black pigment. Now it is mainly used in infrared detectors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":55},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":115},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":124},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":132},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":160},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":247},{"uri":"Lead(II)_oxide","surface_form":"lead(II) oxide","offset":303},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":614},{"uri":"Lead(II)_acetate","surface_form":"lead(II) acetate","offset":636},{"uri":"Lead(II)_nitrate","surface_form":"lead(II) nitrate","offset":656},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":731},{"uri":"Galena","surface_form":"galena","offset":739},{"uri":"Infrared_detector","surface_form":"infrared detector","offset":843}]}
