{"id":271900,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_bromide","text":"=\"preserve\">Lead(II) bromide, also known as plumbous bromide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbBr2. It contains lead and bromide ions. The lead is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nLead(II) bromide is a white solid. It only dissolves a little in water. It melts to make a liquid that conducts a little electricity. It is toxic because it has lead in it.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting lead(II) nitrate or lead(II) acetate with hydrobromic acid or any other bromide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":67},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":129},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":138},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":146},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":174},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":324},{"uri":"Lead(II)_nitrate","surface_form":"lead(II) nitrate","offset":416},{"uri":"Lead(II)_acetate","surface_form":"lead(II) acetate","offset":436},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":458},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":488}]}
