{"id":271901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_sulfate","text":"=\"preserve\">Lead(II) sulfate, also known as plumbous sulfate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbSO4. It contains lead and sulfate ions. The lead is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nLead(II) sulfate is a white solid. It does not dissolve in water. It is toxic because it has lead in it. It does not dissolve in sulfuric acid.\nPreparation.\nLead(II) sulfate is made in a lead acid battery by normal usage. It can be made by reacting lead(II) acetate or lead(II) nitrate with any sulfate. It is found as a mineral named anglesite. This mineral is made when galena is oxidized.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":67},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":129},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":138},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":146},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":174},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":332},{"uri":"Lead_acid_battery","surface_form":"lead acid battery","offset":390},{"uri":"Lead(II)_acetate","surface_form":"lead(II) acetate","offset":452},{"uri":"Lead(II)_nitrate","surface_form":"lead(II) nitrate","offset":472},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":498},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":524},{"uri":"Anglesite","surface_form":"anglesite","offset":538},{"uri":"Galena","surface_form":"galena","offset":575}]}
