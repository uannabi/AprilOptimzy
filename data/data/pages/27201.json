It shows how they reacted when Jesus said that one of them would betray him. Each disciple has their own expression showing their own reaction to what Jesus has just told them.\nThe painting is a mural on the wall of the Santa Maria delle Grazie rectory in the dining room in Milan, Italy. It measures 460 X 880\u00A0cm. Da Vinci began painting it in 1495 and finished it in 1498, but did not work on it all the time between these years.
