He is the patron saint of Armenia, bookbinders, butchers, Florentine cheese and salt merchants, Gambatesa, Italy, leather workers; nervous diseases, plasterers; shoemakers; tanners, and trappers. Along with Saint Jude Thaddeus, he helped bring Christianity to Armenia. He is the patron saint of people who work with leather and animal skins because he was martyred (killed for his beliefs) by being skinned alive. He is usually represented by holding a large knife and his skin.\nBartholomew is also found in Islamic literature. In one such story mentioned by Suyuti, Ibn Arabi, Bayhaqi, and Abu Nuyam Bartholomew is described as one whom God has given extended life to and he meet the companions of the Prophet Muhammad in Iraq. This event took place during the regin of Umar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Twelve_Apostles","surface_form":"apostles","offset":45},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":57},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":90},{"uri":"Vellum","surface_form":"bookbinders","offset":99},{"uri":"Butcher","surface_form":"butcher","offset":112},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":133},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":144},{"uri":"Gambatesa%2C_Italy","surface_form":"Gambatesa, Italy","offset":160},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":178},{"uri":"Tanning","surface_form":"tanners","offset":237},{"uri":"Trappers","surface_form":"trappers","offset":250},{"uri":"Jude_Thaddeus","surface_form":"Jude Thaddeus","offset":277},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":308},{"uri":"Martyred","surface_form":"martyred","offset":420},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":523},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":537},{"uri":"Suyuti","surface_form":"Suyuti","offset":623},{"uri":"Ibn_Arabi","surface_form":"Ibn Arabi","offset":631},{"uri":"Bayhaqi","surface_form":"Bayhaqi","offset":642},{"uri":"Abu_Nuyam","surface_form":"Abu Nuyam","offset":655},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":775},{"uri":"Umar","surface_form":"Umar","offset":835}]}
