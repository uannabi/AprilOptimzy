{"id":272092,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelot","text":"The ocelot (\"Leopardus pardalis\") is a small mammal, one of nine species in the genus \"Leopardus\".\nIt lives in South and Central America, as far up as Mexico. It has been reported as far north as Texas and in Trinidad, in the Caribbean. These fast cats eat small mammals, birds, fish, and snakes. They are very good swimmers.\nOnce hunted for its beautiful fur, the cat is now protected and listed as 'least concern' by the IUCN Red List. The cat is nocturnal and likes forests and dense vegetation. It is very territorial, and will fight to keep its territory. Like many cats, male ocelots mark their territory by spraying urine.\nTheir kittens grow slowly, staying with their mother for up to two years. They have to learn how to catch prey before they can be independent.\nAlthough a \"small cat\", it is a good deal bigger than the others. The ocelot ranges from in length, plus in tail length, and typically weighs. Larger ones have been reported. It is the largest of the generally dainty \"Leopardus\" wild cat genus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":45},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":65},{"uri":"Leopardus","surface_form":"Leopardus","offset":87},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South","offset":111},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":121},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":151},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":196},{"uri":"Trinidad_and_Tobago","surface_form":"Trinidad","offset":209},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":226},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":263},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":272},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":279},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":289},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":356},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":449},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":469},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":623},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":736},{"uri":"Leopardus","surface_form":"Leopardus","offset":991}]}
