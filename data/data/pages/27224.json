{"id":27224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re","text":"Alexandre Dumas (born 24 July, 1802 at Villers-Cotter\u00EAts, died 5 December 1870 at Dieppe) was a French writer of Haitian descent. He is famous for writing \"The Three Musketeers\" (1844), \"Queen Margot\", \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1844-1845) and about the Man with the iron mask.\nDumas was the son of a general, who fought in the French Revolution. His father died and his mother raised him. They didn't have much money when he was growing up.\nDumas wrote his first plays in 1825 and 1826 after reading Shakespeare, Sir Walter Scott, Friedrich von Scholler and Lord Byron.\nDumas was also a gourmand (lover of food), and wrote Le Grand Dictionnaire de cuisine, an encyclop\u00E6dia of food and cooking with 1152 pages. He finished it weeks before his death. It is not thought very reliable, because it relies on Dumas' opinions rather than fact.\nDumas was a member of the Club des Hashischins, or Hashish Club. This group of French writers experimented with hashish to get ideas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Villers-Cotter%C3%AAts","surface_form":"Villers-Cotter\u00EAts","offset":39},{"uri":"Dieppe","surface_form":"Dieppe","offset":82},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":103},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":113},{"uri":"The_Three_Musketeers","surface_form":"The Three Musketeers","offset":156},{"uri":"Queen_Margot","surface_form":"Queen Margot","offset":187},{"uri":"The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo","surface_form":"The Count of Monte Cristo","offset":203},{"uri":"Man_with_the_iron_mask","surface_form":"Man with the iron mask","offset":256},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":330},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare","offset":503},{"uri":"Walter_Scott","surface_form":"Walter Scott","offset":520},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"Lord Byron","offset":561},{"uri":"Encyclopedia","surface_form":"encyclop\u00E6dia","offset":663},{"uri":"Club_des_Hashischins","surface_form":"Club des Hashischins","offset":866},{"uri":"Hashish","surface_form":"hashish","offset":952}]}
