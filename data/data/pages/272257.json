It contains tin and iodide ions. The tin is in its +4 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nTin(IV) iodide is a red-orange solid. It reacts with water to make hydriodic acid and tin(IV) oxide. It dissolves in organic solvents. It reacts with hydriodic acid to make the SnI62- ion.\nPreparation.\nIt is normally made by reacting iodine with tin. It can also be made by reacting tin(IV) oxide with hydriodic acid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":71},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":132},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":140},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":147},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":174},{"uri":"Hydriodic_acid","surface_form":"hydriodic acid","offset":270},{"uri":"Tin(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"tin(IV) oxide","offset":289},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":320},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":328},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":437}]}
