{"id":272275,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_sulfide","text":"=\"preserve\">Tin(II) sulfide, also known as stannous sulfide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SnS. It contains tin and sulfide ions. The tin is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nTin(II) sulfide is a dark brown solid. It is rarely found as a mineral. It does not dissolve in water but dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid.\nPreparation.\nTin(II) sulfide is made by reacting tin with sulfur. It can also be made by reacting tin(II) chloride with hydrogen sulfide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":66},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":89},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":126},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":134},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":142},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":169},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":261},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolve","offset":282},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":330},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":407},{"uri":"Tin(II)_chloride","surface_form":"tin(II) chloride","offset":447},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":469}]}
