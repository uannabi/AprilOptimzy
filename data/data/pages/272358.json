He uses the pen name Ha Jin (\u54C8\u91D1). \"Ha\" comes from his favorite city, Harbin. In 1984, he went to America and began to write about China only in English.

Jin joined the People's Liberation Army during the Cultural Revolution when he was 13 years old. He began to teach himself about Chinese literature and to learn the high school curriculum at sixteen.

Next, he earned a M.A. degree in Anglo-American literature at Shandong University.\nJin grew up in the chaos of early communist China. He was at Brandeis University when the 1989 Tiananmen incident happened. The way the Chinese government stopped the protest by force was important to Jin. It helped him decide to emigrate to the United States.

He has won the National Book Award and the Faulkner Award for his novel, \"Waiting\" (1999). He has received three Pushcart Prizes for fiction and a Kenyon Review Prize.
