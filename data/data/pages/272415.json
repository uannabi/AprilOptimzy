The struggle lasted 50 years, from 499\u2013449. Herodotus wrote a history of the war. Fifty years before the war started, Cyrus the Great had conquered the Greek colonies on the western coast of Asia Minor, an area the Greeks called Ionia. The Persians put a tyrant in charge of each city or polis. About 530 BC Cyrus died in battle.\nAristagoras, the Tyrant of Miletus was on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos with Persian support, but that was a failure. Before he could be dismissed, Arisagoras encouraged Ionia to rebel against the Persians. This led to the Ionian Revolt. Aristagoras got support from Athens and Eretria, and together they burnt the Persian regional capital city, Sardis. The Persian king, now Darius the Great, vowed revenge.\nFirst invasion of Greece.\nThe first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC, led by the Persian general Mardonius. They successfully beat Thrace and Macedon, but several mishaps forced an early end to the rest of the campaign.p135-138.\nThe Battle of Marathon.\nIn 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece, this time across the Aegean Sea. This expedition captured the Cyclades, then destroyed Eretria. On the way to Athens, the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon, ending Persian efforts at that time.\nDarius then began to plan to completely conquer Greece, but died in 486 BC. Command passed to his son Xerxes. In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled.\nVictory over the allied Greek states at the famous Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to burn Athens (which had been evacuated) and overrun most of Greece. However, against the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, decisively defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea, and ending the invasion of Greece by the Achaemenid Empire.\nList of main events.\nMuch of what is known of these wars comes from Herodotus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classical_Greece","surface_form":"Classical Greece","offset":60},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":81},{"uri":"Achaemenid_Empire","surface_form":"Achaemenid Empire","offset":90},{"uri":"Herodotus","surface_form":"Herodotus","offset":175},{"uri":"Cyrus_the_Great","surface_form":"Cyrus the Great","offset":249},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":322},{"uri":"Ionia","surface_form":"Ionia","offset":360},{"uri":"Tyrant","surface_form":"tyrant","offset":386},{"uri":"Polis","surface_form":"polis","offset":419},{"uri":"Aristagoras","surface_form":"Aristagoras","offset":461},{"uri":"Tyrant","surface_form":"Tyrant","offset":478},{"uri":"Miletus","surface_form":"Miletus","offset":488},{"uri":"Naxos","surface_form":"Naxos","offset":542},{"uri":"Ionian_Revolt","surface_form":"Ionian Revolt","offset":699},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":743},{"uri":"Sardis","surface_form":"Sardis","offset":822},{"uri":"Darius_the_Great","surface_form":"Darius the Great","offset":852},{"uri":"Revenge","surface_form":"revenge","offset":876},{"uri":"Mardonius_(general)","surface_form":"Mardonius","offset":992},{"uri":"Thrace","surface_form":"Thrace","offset":1026},{"uri":"Macedon","surface_form":"Macedon","offset":1037},{"uri":"Aegean_Sea","surface_form":"Aegean Sea","offset":1214},{"uri":"Cyclades","surface_form":"Cyclades","offset":1255},{"uri":"Eretria","surface_form":"Eretria","offset":1280},{"uri":"Battle_of_Marathon","surface_form":"Battle of Marathon","offset":1377},{"uri":"Darius","surface_form":"Darius","offset":1434},{"uri":"Xerxes_I","surface_form":"Xerxes","offset":1536},{"uri":"Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece","surface_form":"second Persian invasion of Greece","offset":1581},{"uri":"Battle_of_Thermopylae","surface_form":"Battle of Thermopylae","offset":1721},{"uri":"Battle_of_Salamis","surface_form":"Battle of Salamis","offset":1922},{"uri":"Battle_of_Plataea","surface_form":"Battle of Plataea","offset":2053},{"uri":"Herodotus","surface_form":"Herodotus","offset":2200}]}
