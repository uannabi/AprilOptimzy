{"id":272536,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1707_H%C5%8Dei_earthquake","text":"The 1707 H\u014Dei earthquake happened at 14:00 local time on 28 October 1707. It was the largest earthquake in Japanese history.\nBackground.\nThe southern coast of Honshu runs in the same direction as the Nankai Trough. This marks the place where the Philippine Sea Plate moves under the Eurasian Plate. Movement on this boundary causes many earthquakes; some of them are megathrust earthquakes. The Nankai megathrust has five parts (A-E) that can break one by one. The different parts have broken either one at a time or all together many times over the last 1,300 years. This kind of quake often happens in pairs with a relatively short time between them. In addition to the two earthquakes in 1854, there were similar earthquakes in 1944 and 1946. Each time, the northeastern part broke before the southwestern part. In 1707, the earthquakes were either at the same time, or close enough together so that writing from that time do not describe them separately.\nDamage.\n29,000 houses were destroyed and more than 5,000 people were killed. The earthquake caused at least one major landslide in Shizuoka. This landslide was one of the three largest in Japan and is called the Ohya Landslide. It covered an area of 1.8\u00A0km2 with an estimated volume of 120 million m3. In the Nara Basin, the earthquake made the soil behave like a liquid.\nEarthquake.\nThere were two other very large earthquakes: the 1854 Ansei-T\u014Dkai and Ansei-Nankai earthquakes. The 1707 was stronger than both. Several observations show that the H\u014Dei earthquake was bigger. At Cape Muroto, K\u014Dchi, a cliff was raised up about 2.3 m in 1707, but just 1.5 m in 1854. In the Kawachi Plain area, the earthquake was around 6 - 7 on the JMA scale. Also, the amount of damage and height of the water from tsunami showed the strength of the earthquake. There are also records of tsunami at distant locations, such as Nagasaki and Jeju-do, South Korea.\nTsunami.\nThe tsunami that followed the earthquake raised water along the coast. Along the southwestern coast of K\u014Dchi, the average increase in sea level was 7.7 m. In some places it rose up to 10.2 m\nConnection to Mount Fuji eruption.\nChanges in stress caused by large earthquakes may be enough to cause volcanic eruptions, when the magma system of the volcano is close to a critical state. The great earthquake in 1707 may have changed pressure in the magma under Mount Fuji.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":93},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":107},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":159},{"uri":"Nankai_Trough","surface_form":"Nankai Trough","offset":200},{"uri":"Philippine_Sea_Plate","surface_form":"Philippine Sea Plate","offset":246},{"uri":"Eurasian_Plate","surface_form":"Eurasian Plate","offset":283},{"uri":"Megathrust_earthquake","surface_form":"megathrust earthquake","offset":367},{"uri":"Nankai_megathrust_earthquakes","surface_form":"This kind of quake","offset":568},{"uri":"Landslide","surface_form":"landslide","offset":1077},{"uri":"Shizuoka_Prefecture","surface_form":"Shizuoka","offset":1090},{"uri":"Nara_Prefecture","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1268},{"uri":"Soil_liquefaction","surface_form":"soil behave like a liquid","offset":1304},{"uri":"1854_Ansei-T%C5%8Dkai_earthquake","surface_form":"1854 Ansei-T\u014Dkai","offset":1392},{"uri":"1854_Ansei-Nankai_earthquake","surface_form":"Ansei-Nankai earthquakes","offset":1413},{"uri":"K%C5%8Dchi_Prefecture","surface_form":"K\u014Dchi","offset":1551},{"uri":"Kawachi_Province","surface_form":"Kawachi","offset":1632},{"uri":"Japan_Meteorological_Agency_seismic_intensity_scale","surface_form":"JMA scale","offset":1691},{"uri":"Nagasaki","surface_form":"Nagasaki","offset":1869},{"uri":"Jeju-do","surface_form":"Jeju-do","offset":1882},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":1891},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":1917},{"uri":"K%C5%8Dchi%2C_K%C5%8Dchi","surface_form":"K\u014Dchi","offset":2016},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":2208},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":2237},{"uri":"Mount_Fuji","surface_form":"Mount Fuji","offset":2369}]}
