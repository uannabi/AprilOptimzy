He has to take care of his nephew and apprentice Cloudpaw, and make sure he is trained and abides by the Warrior Code. So far Cloudpaw has not done that and gets into trouble, even going so far as to beg for food from a Twoleg, which results in him being stolen. Ravenpaw comes to meet Fireheart to tell him where Cloudpaw is, and so he, Fireheart, and Sandstorm go and rescue Cloudpaw. On the way back the patrol, without Ravenpaw, runs into a WindClan patrol, and get into a fight. They win, so they advance back to their territory and are greeted by the Clan. Later on, Fireheart detects fire and warns the Clan. The Clan rushes to the RiverClan camp for shelter, but Yellowfang dies saving elders. Fireheart then races back to the RiverClan territory and the Clan goes home. Finally, Fireheart takes ThunderClan to the Gathering and discovers that Tigerclaw is now the leader of ShadowClan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Warriors_(book_series)","surface_form":"original \"Warriors\" series","offset":41}]}
