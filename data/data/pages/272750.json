{"id":272750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness","text":"Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth which has not been much disturbed by humans.\nWilderness areas can be found in reserves, estates, farms, conservation areas, ranches, National Forests, National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or any undeveloped areas. These areas are important for the survival of species, biodiversity, ecology, conservation, solitude, and recreation.\nWilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, moral, and aesthetic reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.\nThey may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, gardens or laboratories.\nFrom this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being \"wilderness\". Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered \"wild.\" This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference.\nThe WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (Wilderness areas).\nProbably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by indigenous people, or through global processes such as climate change. Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration, also affect the wilderness.\nEspecially in richer, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated wilderness, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.\nMany new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that \"in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_environment","surface_form":"natural environment","offset":28},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":51},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":94},{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":161},{"uri":"Ranch","surface_form":"ranch","offset":181},{"uri":"National_Forest","surface_form":"National Forest","offset":190},{"uri":"National_Park","surface_form":"National Park","offset":208},{"uri":"Urban","surface_form":"urban","offset":235},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":253},{"uri":"Gulch","surface_form":"gulch","offset":261},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":341},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":350},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":364},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":401},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"moral","offset":466},{"uri":"Aesthetics","surface_form":"aesthetic","offset":477},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":620},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":674},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":684},{"uri":"Zoo","surface_form":"zoo","offset":727},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":733},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratories","offset":744},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"natural processes","offset":1116},{"uri":"WILD_Foundation","surface_form":"WILD Foundation","offset":1174},{"uri":"International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature","surface_form":"World Conservation Union","offset":1300},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":1522},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":1577},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":1657},{"uri":"Animal_migration","surface_form":"animal migration","offset":1698},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1874},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1930},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1941},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":1949},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1962},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1983},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":2071},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"Legislature","offset":2087}]}
