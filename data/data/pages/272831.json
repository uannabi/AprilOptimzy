{"id":272831,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_monochloride","text":"=\"preserve\">Iodine monochloride, also known as iodine(I) chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ICl. It has iodine and chloride ions. The iodine is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIodine monochloride is a red or brown solid. It easily melts. It has two forms; one melts at 27.2\u00B0C and the other melts at 13.9\u00B0C. It is an oxidizing agent. It can vaporize easily, too to make a brown vapor. It reacts with water. It is the main source of I+. It is an interhalogen.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by mixing equal moles of iodine and chlorine. More chlorine would make iodine trichloride.\nUses.\nIt is used to add iodine atoms to some organic compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":72},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":127},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":138},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":147},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":177},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":346},{"uri":"Interhalogen","surface_form":"interhalogen","offset":474},{"uri":"Mole_(unit)","surface_form":"moles","offset":528},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":548},{"uri":"Iodine_trichloride","surface_form":"iodine trichloride","offset":583},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":648}]}
