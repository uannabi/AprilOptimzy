{"id":27295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes","text":"Aristophanes (born around 450/445 BC \u2013 died around 385 BC) was a Greek writer who wrote 40 plays. However, only 11 of his plays survive in their entirety. He is famous for writing comedies. They were biting satires aimed at famous men of his day, and the all-too-human weaknesses of ordinary people.\nHis most famous play, \"Lysistrata\", is about a group of women who protest against a war by not having sexual intercourse with their husbands until the war is ended.\nAncient Greek theatre was first presented in competitions at the festival of Dionysia, dedicated to the god Dionysus. The interesting thing is that Aristophanes did not always win first prize. The plays which won ahead of his have been lost, so we cannot make any comparisons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":65},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedies","offset":180},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":207},{"uri":"Lysistrata","surface_form":"Lysistrata","offset":323},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_theatre","surface_form":"Ancient Greek theatre","offset":465},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":530},{"uri":"Dionysia","surface_form":"Dionysia","offset":542},{"uri":"Dionysus","surface_form":"Dionysus","offset":573}]}
