{"id":273055,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hilton","text":"James Hilton (9 September 1900 \u2013 20 December 1954) was an English writer. He wrote several best-selling novels including \"Lost Horizon\" and \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\". \"Lost Horizon\" introduced an imaginary place called Shangri-La and made it popular.\nBiography.\nJames Hilton was born in Leigh. His father, John Hilton, was the headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow. James Hilton partially based the character Mr. Chipping in \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" on his father.\nHilton wrote his two most famous books while living in an ordinary semi-detached house on Oak Hill Gardens, Woodford Green. The house is still there, and a small, blue sign says it was Hilton's home.\nHe was married twice, first to Alice Brown and later to Galina Kopineck. Both marriages ended in divorce. He died in Long Beach, California from liver cancer.\nNovels.\nHilton became a success writer when he was still young. He published his first novel, \"Catherine Herself,\" when he was 20 years old. Several of his books were international bestsellers. Some successful films were made based on his novels. Three of the best known movies are: \"Lost Horizon\" (1933), \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (1934), and \"Random Harvest\" (1941). Many copies of \"Lost Horizon\" were sold in the 1930s as one of the first Pocket Books. The serial number was \"1\". Some people call it the novel that began the popularity of paperback books.\nLost Horizon.\n\"Lost Horizon\" is supposedly set in Tibet, and especially in a secret, imaginary valley called Shangri-La. Shangri-La now means any perfect, pleasurable place or utopia.\nIt is unsure exactly where and how Hilton got his ideas about Tibet. He may have been inspired to write \"Lost Horizon\" and to invent Shangri-La\" by reading the \"National Geographic Magazine\" by Joseph Rock. Rock was an Austrian-American botanist and ethnologist who explored southwestern China and areas near Tibet. Hilton have also read articles by early travelers in Tibet that he found in the British Library for more ideas Christian Zeeman may also have been the model for the hero of the story. He disappeared while living in Japan and there were rumors that he was living secretly in a Zen Buddhist monastery. Some say that the isolated valley town of Weaverville, California, in far northern Trinity County, was Shangri-La. However, this is a misunderstanding of a comment by Hilton in a 1941 interview. In that interview, Hilton said that Weaverville reminded him of Shangri-La. Coincidentally, Junction City (about 8 miles from Weaverville) now has a Tibetan Buddhist centre with the occasional Tibetan monks in saffron robes.\nAfter the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt told the press that the airplanes had taken off from Shangri-La. This was a kind of joke to hide the secret that they had taken off from aircraft carriers. Later, the US Navy gave that name to an aircraft carrier, and Roosevelt named his Maryland presidential retreat \"Shangri-La\". (That retreat is now called Camp David since President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it after his grandson.) Zhongdian is a mountain region of Southwest China that has now been renamed Shangri-La (Xianggelila) because it may have inspired Hilton's book\nWork in Hollywood.\nHilton lived and worked in Hollywood beginning in the mid-1930s. He won an Academy Award in 1942 for his work on the screenplay of \"Mrs. Miniver\". That film was based on the novel by Jan Struther. Hilton was the host of \"The Hallmark Playhouse\" (1948\u20131953) for CBS Radio. One of his later novels, \"Morning Journey\", was about the movie business.\nOther versions of his works.\nHilton co-wrote the book and lyrics for \"Shangri-La\", an unsuccessful 1956 Broadway musical adaptation of \"Lost Horizon\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":58},{"uri":"Lost_Horizon_(novel)","surface_form":"Lost Horizon","offset":122},{"uri":"Goodbye_Mr._Chips","surface_form":"Goodbye Mr. Chips","offset":141},{"uri":"Shangri-La","surface_form":"Shangri-La","offset":213},{"uri":"Leigh%2C_Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Leigh","offset":281},{"uri":"Headmaster","surface_form":"headmaster","offset":321},{"uri":"Chapel_End_School","surface_form":"Chapel End School","offset":335},{"uri":"Walthamstow","surface_form":"Walthamstow","offset":356},{"uri":"Goodbye%2C_Mr._Chips","surface_form":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","offset":429},{"uri":"Woodford_Green","surface_form":"Woodford Green","offset":572},{"uri":"Long_Beach%2C_California","surface_form":"Long Beach, California","offset":781},{"uri":"Liver_cancer","surface_form":"liver cancer","offset":809},{"uri":"Lost_Horizon","surface_form":"Lost Horizon","offset":1107},{"uri":"Goodbye%2C_Mr._Chips","surface_form":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","offset":1130},{"uri":"Random_Harvest","surface_form":"Random Harvest","offset":1163},{"uri":"Pocket_Books","surface_form":"Pocket Books","offset":1260},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":1427},{"uri":"Utopia","surface_form":"utopia","offset":1553},{"uri":"National_Geographic_Magazine","surface_form":"National Geographic Magazine","offset":1722},{"uri":"Joseph_Rock","surface_form":"Joseph Rock","offset":1755},{"uri":"Austrian","surface_form":"Austrian","offset":1780},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1789},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":1798},{"uri":"Ethnologist","surface_form":"ethnologist","offset":1811},{"uri":"Christian_Zeeman","surface_form":"Christian Zeeman","offset":1988},{"uri":"Zen_Buddhist","surface_form":"Zen Buddhist","offset":2153},{"uri":"Weaverville%2C_California","surface_form":"Weaverville, California","offset":2219},{"uri":"Trinity_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Trinity County","offset":2260},{"uri":"Junction_City%2C_California","surface_form":"Junction City","offset":2464},{"uri":"Tibetan_Buddhist","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhist","offset":2521},{"uri":"Saffron","surface_form":"saffron","offset":2582},{"uri":"Doolittle_Raid","surface_form":"Doolittle Raid","offset":2607},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
