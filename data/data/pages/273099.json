It is located south from the center of St.\u00A0Petersburg, but is no longer a place for the imperial family. Instead, it is part of the town of Pushkin and of the World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nIn the 17th century, the place belonged to a Swedish noble.\nIn 1708, Peter the Great gave the estate to his wife as a present. She helped in the making of the Blagoveschenskaya church there in 1724, and changed the name of the place to Blagoveschenskoye. However, this soon went out of use.\nIt was Catherine I who started to develop the place as a place for royal people. She built the Catherine Palace, now known as the Cameron Gallery.\nBy the end of the 18th century, Tsarskoye Selo became a popular place for noble people to visit in the summer. On September 17, 1941 the Germans destroyed the town of Pushkin, destroying many historical buildings and other artifacts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tsar","surface_form":"Tsar","offset":19},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian","offset":46},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"St.\u00A0Petersburg","offset":127},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":247},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":322},{"uri":"Peter_I_of_Russia","surface_form":"Peter the Great","offset":346},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Germans","offset":852},{"uri":"Artifact_(archaeology)","surface_form":"artifacts","offset":938}]}
