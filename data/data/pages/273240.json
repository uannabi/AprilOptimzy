{"id":273240,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud","text":"In telecommunications, Baud is the unit to measure the symbol rate. If one symbol can be transmitted per second, this is equal to one Baud. The unit is named after Jean-Maurice-\u00C9mile Baudot a French telecommunications engineer who invented the Baudot code. The Baud rate is different from the gross bit rate, measured in \"bits/second\".\nVarious electric signal schemes invented in the 20th century such as Phase-shift keying can make bit rates much higher than signal rates. In another example, gigabit ethernet has a symbol rate of 125MBd. Gigabit ethernet uses pulse-amplitude modulation and can transmit two bits of payload data per symbol. Gigabit ethernet uses four balanced pairs for transmission.\nIt can transmit formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telecommunications","surface_form":"telecommunications","offset":3},{"uri":"Symbol_rate","surface_form":"symbol rate","offset":55},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":75},{"uri":"Jean-Maurice-%C3%89mile_Baudot","surface_form":"Jean-Maurice-\u00C9mile Baudot","offset":164},{"uri":"Baudot_code","surface_form":"Baudot code","offset":244},{"uri":"Gross_bit_rate","surface_form":"gross bit rate","offset":293},{"uri":"Signal_(electrical_engineering)","surface_form":"electric signal","offset":344},{"uri":"Phase-shift_keying","surface_form":"Phase-shift keying","offset":405},{"uri":"Gigabit_ethernet","surface_form":"gigabit ethernet","offset":494},{"uri":"Pulse-amplitude_modulation","surface_form":"pulse-amplitude modulation","offset":562}]}
