{"id":273265,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_acid","text":"=\"preserve\">Periodic acid (pronounced as per\u00B7io'\u00B7dic acid) is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is HIO4 or H5IO6. It has hydrogen and periodate ions in it.\nProperties.\nPeriodic acid is found as a colorless solution. It is a strong oxidizing agent, like perchloric acid. It breaks down when heated to iodine pentoxide and oxygen, as well as water. It does not form I2O7. It is found as HIO4 in dilute solution and H5IO6 in concentrated solution. When H5IO6 is heated, it turns into HIO4.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting a periodate with a strong acid.\nUses.\nIt is used to look at the structure of certain organic compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":64},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":97},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":149},{"uri":"Periodate","surface_form":"periodate","offset":162},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":172},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":259},{"uri":"Perchloric_acid","surface_form":"perchloric acid","offset":281},{"uri":"Iodine_pentoxide","surface_form":"iodine pentoxide","offset":328},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":349},{"uri":"Strong_acid","surface_form":"strong acid","offset":570},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":636}]}
