{"id":273267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_periodate","text":"=\"preserve\">Potassium periodate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KIO4. It has potassium and periodate ions in it.\nProperties.\nPotassium periodate is a white solid. It is an oxidizing agent. It is similar to potassium perchlorate. It does not dissolve good in water. It makes potassium iodate and oxygen when heated.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting potassium iodide with a strong oxidizing agent.\nUses.\nIt is used to find out how much potassium is in something because it is one of the few potassium compounds that do not dissolve easily in water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":37},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":93},{"uri":"Periodate","surface_form":"periodate","offset":107},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":117},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":188},{"uri":"Potassium_perchlorate","surface_form":"potassium perchlorate","offset":222},{"uri":"Potassium_iodate","surface_form":"potassium iodate","offset":290}]}
