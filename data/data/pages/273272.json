{"id":273272,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_heptafluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Iodine heptafluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is IF7. It contains iodine and fluoride ions. The iodine is in its +7 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless gas with a moldy, stinky odor. Its melting point is at, and its boiling point is at. This means that it has a very narrow liquid range. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It is very irritating to the skin. It is an interhalogen.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting iodine pentafluoride with fluorine gas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":38},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":98},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":109},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":118},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":148},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":348},{"uri":"Interhalogen","surface_form":"interhalogen","offset":409},{"uri":"Iodine_pentafluoride","surface_form":"iodine pentafluoride","offset":459},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":485}]}
