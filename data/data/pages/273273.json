{"id":273273,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoiodous_acid","text":"=\"preserve\">Hypoiodous acid is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is HIO. It has hydrogen and hypoiodite ions in it.\nProperties.\nHypoiodous acid is very unstable. It easily disproportionates to iodine and iodic acid. It is a disinfectant and oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting mercury(II) oxide with iodine.\nUses.\nIt is too unstable to be used, although people think that this is what makes iodine a disinfectant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":33},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":66},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":108},{"uri":"Hypoiodite","surface_form":"hypoiodite","offset":121},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":132},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionates","offset":200},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":221},{"uri":"Iodic_acid","surface_form":"iodic acid","offset":232},{"uri":"Disinfectant","surface_form":"disinfectant","offset":252},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":269},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_oxide","surface_form":"mercury(II) oxide","offset":322}]}
