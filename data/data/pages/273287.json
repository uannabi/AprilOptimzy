{"id":273287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_pentafluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Iodine pentafluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is IF5. It has iodine and fluoride ions. The iodine is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIodine pentafluoride is a pale yellow liquid. It is an interhalogen. It is also a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with water to make hydrofluoric acid.\nPreparation.\nIodine pentafluoride is made by burning iodine in fluorine gas.\nUses.\nIt is used in organic chemistry (amine to nitrile conversion after hydrolysis).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":38},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":93},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":104},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":113},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":143},{"uri":"Interhalogen","surface_form":"interhalogen","offset":227},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":263},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":309},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":391},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":425},{"uri":"Amine","surface_form":"amine","offset":444},{"uri":"Nitrile","surface_form":"nitrile","offset":453},{"uri":"Hydrolysis","surface_form":"hydrolysis","offset":478}]}
