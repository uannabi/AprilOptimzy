Its chemical formula is I2O5. It has iodine and oxide ions. The iodine is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIodine pentoxide is a white solid. It breaks down to iodine and oxygen when heated. It reacts with carbon monoxide to make carbon dioxide and iodine. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It reacts with water to make iodic acid.\nPreparation.\nIodine pentoxide is made by heating iodic acid to in dry air.\nUses.\nIt is used to see how much carbon monoxide is in a sample of gas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":88},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":144},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":155},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":161},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":191},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":284},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"carbon monoxide","offset":319},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":343},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":385},{"uri":"Iodic_acid","surface_form":"iodic acid","offset":431}]}
