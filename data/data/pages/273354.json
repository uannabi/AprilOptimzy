{"id":273354,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(I)_iodide","text":"Copper(I) iodide, also known as cuprous iodide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuI. It has copper and iodide ions in it. The copper is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nCopper(I) iodide is a white solid. It does not dissolve in water. It easily turns tan or brown. It is a reducing agent. The iodide easily oxidizes to iodine. Copper does not form a stable copper(II) iodide; copper(II) iodide breaks down right away to make copper(I) iodide and iodine. It dissolves in concentrated iodides like potassium iodide. When it is diluted, it makes copper(I) iodide again.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by reacting iodine and copper in concentrated hydroiodic acid. Another way would be to react copper(II) sulfate and potassium iodide. This makes copper(II) iodide which as said before breaks down right away to make iodine and copper(I) iodide.\nUses.\nIt is used to make organic compounds. It is also used to make clouds rain. It is used to make nylon resistant to heat. It can be used to put iodine to foods.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":53},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":108},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":119},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":126},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":162},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":295},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":341},{"uri":"Potassium_iodide","surface_form":"potassium iodide","offset":518},{"uri":"Hydroiodic_acid","surface_form":"hydroiodic acid","offset":663},{"uri":"Copper(II)_sulfate","surface_form":"copper(II) sulfate","offset":710},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":886},{"uri":"Cloud","surface_form":"cloud","offset":929},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":936},{"uri":"Nylon","surface_form":"nylon","offset":961}]}
