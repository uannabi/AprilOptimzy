{"id":273358,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_bromide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Copper(II) bromide, also known as cupric bromide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuBr2. It has copper and bromide ions in it. The copper is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nCopper(II) bromide is a grayish-black solid. Most copper(II) compounds, except for the oxide, are bright blue or green. It can be reduced to copper(I) bromide.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by dissolving copper(II) oxide in hydrobromic acid. It can also be made by reacting copper and bromine.82\nUses.\nCopper(II) bromide is used in lasers. It is also used to add bromide ions to other chemical compounds in organic chemistry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":68},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":125},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":136},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":144},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":180},{"uri":"Copper(II)_oxide","surface_form":"the oxide","offset":292},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduced","offset":339},{"uri":"Copper(I)_bromide","surface_form":"copper(I) bromide","offset":350},{"uri":"Copper(II)_oxide","surface_form":"copper(II) oxide","offset":411},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":431},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":492},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":539},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":614}]}
