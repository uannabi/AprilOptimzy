{"id":273415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_University_of_Innsbruck","text":"The Medical University of Innsbruck (German: Medizinische Universit\u00E4t Innsbruck) is a university in Innsbruck, Austria. It used to be one of the four historical faculties of the Leopold-Franzens-Universit\u00E4t Innsbruck, but it became an independent (by itself) university in 2004.\nHistory.\nThe medical tradition dates back long before the university began. The first hospital began in the silver-mining city of Schwaz nearby in 1307. Because people grew as years went by, a medical faculty was added to the university, begun in 1669 by Emperor Leopold I, making it the first of its kind in the Alpine region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":37},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":86},{"uri":"Innsbruck","surface_form":"Innsbruck","offset":100},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":111},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":150},{"uri":"Faculty_(university)","surface_form":"faculties","offset":161},{"uri":"Leopold-Franzens-Universit%C3%A4t_Innsbruck","surface_form":"Leopold-Franzens-Universit\u00E4t Innsbruck","offset":178},{"uri":"Schwaz","surface_form":"Schwaz","offset":409},{"uri":"Leopold_I_(Holy_Roman_Empire)","surface_form":"Emperor Leopold I","offset":534}]}
