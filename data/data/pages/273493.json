{"id":273493,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metriacanthosauridae","text":"Metriacanthosaurids were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs. They tended to be large predators, and some were 30 ft (10 m) long.\nMetriacanthosaurids are carnosaurs. At first they were classified in the Megalosauridae or Allosauridae, now they are put in their own family. A gigantic tooth, which may come from a giant metriacanthosaurid, was described recently (2008).\nClassification.\nThe Metriacanthosauridae is a monophyletic group. Cladistically it includes \"Metriacanthosaurus parkeri\" and species closer related to \"Metriacanthosaurus\" than to \"Allosaurus fragilis\", \"Carcharodontosaurus saharicus\", or to birds. These theropods are close to the ancestors of the allosaurs.\nMetriacanthosauridae is often referred to as \"Sinraptoridae\", but Metriacanthosauridae is the correct name under ICZN rules, since \"Metriacanthosaurus\" was the first member of the family to be described and named.\nThe cladogram here follows a study by Benson and colleagues.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":27},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":37},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":49},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":58},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":93},{"uri":"Foot_(length)","surface_form":"ft","offset":121},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":128},{"uri":"Carnosauria","surface_form":"carnosaurs","offset":161},{"uri":"Megalosauridae","surface_form":"Megalosauridae","offset":210},{"uri":"Allosauridae","surface_form":"Allosauridae","offset":228},{"uri":"Monophyly","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":423},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"Cladistically","offset":443},{"uri":"Metriacanthosaurus","surface_form":"Metriacanthosaurus parkeri","offset":470},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus fragilis","offset":558},{"uri":"Carcharodontosaurus","surface_form":"Carcharodontosaurus saharicus","offset":581},{"uri":"Theropoda","surface_form":"theropods","offset":632},{"uri":"Allosauridae","surface_form":"allosaurs","offset":676},{"uri":"ICZN","surface_form":"ICZN","offset":800},{"uri":"Cladogram","surface_form":"cladogram","offset":905}]}
