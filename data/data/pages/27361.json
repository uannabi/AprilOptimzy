Pop-punk music has a lighter, happier sound than most punk rock and hardcore punk music. Most punk rock and hardcore punk music sounds angry and harsh, and has lyrics (words) about protest and anger.\nLate 1970s and 1980s pop-punk.\nThere are several types of pop-punk. An early type of pop-punk was developed right after Punk rock became popular in the late 1970s. Most of this kind of music is very much like Punk rock, but it features things from other kinds of music like pop music and older rock music, and country music, so different people can enjoy it. Some people call the Ramones a pop-punk band. The Ramones were a band from the United States.\n1990s pop-punk.\nIn the 1990s, pop-punk became very popular in North America. Bands such as Green Day, Blink-182 and Zebrahead sold millions of recordings and did many tours.\nPresent day.\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, which is the decade we are in now, many bands have joined, or contributed to the pop punk genre. They include Fall Out Boy, Relient K, FM Static, Hawk Nelson, and Amber Pacific.\nControversy.\nSome people who like 1970s punk rock or 1980s hardcore punk do not like pop-punk. The 1970s punk rock or 1980s hardcore punk was usually angry, rebellious protest music. In contrast, 2000s pop-punk songs are nicer and lighter. Some people think 2000s pop-punk is too commercialized and nothing like the older punk music from the 1970s and 1980s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":74},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":89},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock music","offset":103},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":169},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":183},{"uri":"Angry","surface_form":"angry","offset":250},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":296},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"Punk rock","offset":435},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":472},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"Punk rock","offset":524},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":589},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock music","offset":609},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":625},{"uri":"Green_Day","surface_form":"Green Day","offset":859},{"uri":"Blink-182","surface_form":"Blink-182","offset":870},{"uri":"Zebrahead","surface_form":"Zebrahead","offset":884},{"uri":"Fall_Out_Boy","surface_form":"Fall Out Boy","offset":1089},{"uri":"Relient_K","surface_form":"Relient K","offset":1103},{"uri":"FM_Static","surface_form":"FM Static","offset":1114},{"uri":"Hawk_Nelson","surface_form":"Hawk Nelson","offset":1125},{"uri":"Amber_Pacific","surface_form":"Amber Pacific","offset":1142},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":1197},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":1216},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":1262},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":1281},{"uri":"Punk","surface_form":"punk","offset":1479},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":1499},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":1509}]}
