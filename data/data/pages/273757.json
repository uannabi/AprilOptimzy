{"id":273757,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuthine","text":"=\"preserve\">Bismuthine, also known as bismuthane, bismuth hydride, and hydrogen bismuthide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BiH3. It has bismuth and hydride ions in it. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nBismuthine is very unstable. It is only found below -60\u00B0C. Above that temperature it breaks down into bismuth and hydrogen.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by a complex process that involves organic chemistry.\nUses.\nIt is part of a test for bismuth. This is similar to the Marsh test for arsenic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":97},{"uri":"Bismuth","surface_form":"bismuth","offset":153},{"uri":"Hydride","surface_form":"hydride","offset":165},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":173},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":210},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":353},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":422},{"uri":"Marsh_test","surface_form":"Marsh test","offset":504}]}
