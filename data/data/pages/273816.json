{"id":273816,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_monofluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Chlorine monofluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is ClF. It has chlorine and fluoride ions in it. The chlorine is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nChlorine monofluoride is a colorless gas. It can be cooled to a pale yellow liquid at low temperatures. Many of its properties are between the properties of chlorine and fluorine. It reacts with tungsten to make tungsten hexafluoride and with selenium to make selenium tetrafluoride. It reacts with carbon monoxide to add chloride and fluoride to it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":39},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":94},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":107},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":116},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":154},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":353},{"uri":"Tungsten","surface_form":"tungsten","offset":378},{"uri":"Tungsten_hexafluoride","surface_form":"tungsten hexafluoride","offset":395},{"uri":"Selenium","surface_form":"selenium","offset":426},{"uri":"Selenium_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"selenium tetrafluoride","offset":443}]}
