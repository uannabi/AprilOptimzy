{"id":273838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_pie","text":"Cottage pie or shepherd's pie is a type of savory pie. It is made with minced meat, with mashed potato on top. It comes from the United Kingdom and Ireland. The dish is now popular worldwide.\nThe name \"cottage pie\" was first used at the end of the 18th century. It was around that time that the poorer people of Britain, people who lived in cottages in the country, started using potatoes as an everyday food. Originally, a pie made with any kind of meat and mashed potato was called a \"cottage pie\".\nIn modern British English, the dish is usually called \"cottage pie\" if it is made with beef. If it is made with lamb it is usually called \"shepherd's pie\" (because a shepherd looks after sheep).\nAccording to the \"Oxford Companion to Food\", once upon a time, Scotland made its shepherd\u2019s pies with pastry instead of mashed potatoes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pie","surface_form":"pie","offset":50},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":78},{"uri":"Mashed_potato","surface_form":"mashed potato","offset":89},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":129},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":148},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":312},{"uri":"Cottage","surface_form":"cottage","offset":341},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":380},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":511},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":588},{"uri":"Lamb_(food)","surface_form":"lamb","offset":613},{"uri":"Shepherd","surface_form":"shepherd","offset":667},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":688},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":759},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastry","offset":798}]}
