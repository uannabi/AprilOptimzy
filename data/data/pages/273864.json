It has bismuth and bromide ions. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nBismuth(III) bromide is a white to pale yellow solid. It reacts with water to make bismuth oxybromide, BiOBr, which is a solid. It can only dissolve in acidic solutions.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting bismuth(III) oxide with hydrobromic acid. It can also be made by reacting powdered bismuth with bromine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":61},{"uri":"Bismuth","surface_form":"bismuth","offset":118},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":130},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":138},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":169},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":350},{"uri":"Bismuth(III)_oxide","surface_form":"bismuth(III) oxide","offset":404},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":428},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":500}]}
