{"id":273883,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_biology","text":"=\"preserve\">Freshwater biology is the study of plants and animals that live in fresh water. This includes rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes and other bodies of water. It is part of the branch of science called Limnology.\nMuch freshwater biology takes place in man-made places such as sewage treatment works and water treatment works. In these places water is purified using plants and animals. Keeping them working as hard as possible helps to make the water as cleaner.\nIn recent times freshwater biologists have been looking at how plants and animals change in the autumn and spring. This is helping us to understand more about the effects of climate change.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":47},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":58},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":79},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":106},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":114},{"uri":"Pond","surface_form":"pond","offset":121},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marsh","offset":128},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":191},{"uri":"Limnology","surface_form":"Limnology","offset":206},{"uri":"Sewage_treatment","surface_form":"sewage treatment","offset":280},{"uri":"Water_treatment","surface_form":"water treatment","offset":307},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":346},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":641}]}
