They are a distinct evolutionary branch of the Archaea, and are extremophiles.\nThe term \"halobacteria\" is a misnomer (mistaken name), because we now know the archaea are a different group from bacteria.\nIn taxonomy, the Haloarchaea are a class of the Euryarchaeota, found in water with salt. They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt, moisture, and organic material are available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Halophile","surface_form":"halophile","offset":16},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":45},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":94},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"Archaea","offset":121},{"uri":"Extremophile","surface_form":"extremophile","offset":138},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":280},{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":312},{"uri":"Euryarchaeota","surface_form":"Euryarchaeota","offset":325},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":349},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":360}]}
