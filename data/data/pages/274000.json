{"id":274000,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmicutes","text":"The Firmicutes are a phylum of bacteria, most of which have the Gram-positive type of cell walls.\nClasses.\nThe group is typically divided into the Clostridia, which are anaerobic, the Bacilli, which are aerobic, and the Mollicutes, a class of bacteria which do not have cell walls.\nOn phylogenetic trees, the first two groups show up as paraphyletic or polyphyletic, as do their main genera, \"Clostridium\" and \"Bacillus\".\nHealth.\nFirmicutes make up the largest portion of the mouse and human gut microbiome. The division \"Firmicutes\" as part of the gut flora has been shown to be involved in energy resorption and obesity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":21},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":31},{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"Gram-positive","offset":64},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":86},{"uri":"Clostridia","surface_form":"Clostridia","offset":147},{"uri":"Anaerobic_organism","surface_form":"anaerobic","offset":169},{"uri":"Bacilli","surface_form":"Bacilli","offset":184},{"uri":"Aerobic","surface_form":"aerobic","offset":203},{"uri":"Mollicute","surface_form":"Mollicute","offset":220},{"uri":"Phylogenetic_tree","surface_form":"phylogenetic tree","offset":285},{"uri":"Paraphyletic","surface_form":"paraphyletic","offset":337},{"uri":"Polyphyletic","surface_form":"polyphyletic","offset":353},{"uri":"Clostridium","surface_form":"Clostridium","offset":393},{"uri":"Bacillus","surface_form":"Bacillus","offset":411},{"uri":"Gut_flora","surface_form":"gut flora","offset":549},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":614}]}
