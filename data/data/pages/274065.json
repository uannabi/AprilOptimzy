It has bismuth and sulfide ions in it. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties and preparation.\nBismuth(III) sulfide is a brown solid. It does not dissolve in water. It is made by reacting hydrogen sulfide with a bismuth compound like bismuth(III) chloride.\nOccurrence.\nIt is found as the mineral bismuthinite. Bismuthinite is lead-gray to tin-white, with an iridescent tarnish. It is an important ore of bismuth. It has a metallic color. It was first found in Bolivia. Its specific gravity is around 6.8.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":58},{"uri":"Bismuth","surface_form":"bismuth","offset":115},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":127},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":135},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":172},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":310},{"uri":"Bismuth(III)_chloride","surface_form":"bismuth(III) chloride","offset":356},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":519},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":544},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":582},{"uri":"Specific_gravity","surface_form":"specific gravity","offset":595}]}
