{"id":274079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bismuthate","text":"Sodium bismuthate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaBiO3. It has sodium and bismuthate ions in it.\nProperties.\nSodium bismuthate is a light brown solid. It does not dissolve in water. It is one of the only sodium compounds that do not dissolve in water. It reacts with hot water to make sodium hydroxide, bismuth(III) oxide, and oxygen gas. It reacts with acids to make bismuth(III) salts, sodium salts, and oxygen gas. It is a strong oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting a basic solution of bismuth(III) oxide and sodium hydroxide with a strong oxidizing agent.\nUses.\nSodium bismuthate is used in a test for manganese.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":23},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":81},{"uri":"Bismuthate","surface_form":"bismuthate","offset":92},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":103},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":303},{"uri":"Bismuth(III)_oxide","surface_form":"bismuth(III) oxide","offset":321},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":399},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":451},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":506},{"uri":"Manganese","surface_form":"manganese","offset":641}]}
