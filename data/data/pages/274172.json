{"id":274172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufa","text":"Tufa is a porous variety of limestone. It is formed by the precipitation of carbonate minerals from water at normal temperatures.\nGeothermally heated hot springs sometimes produce similar (but less porous) carbonate deposits known as travertine.\nDo not confuse with the rock made of volcanic ash, which is called tuff.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Porous","surface_form":"porous","offset":10},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":28},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":59},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":76},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":86},{"uri":"Geothermal_energy","surface_form":"Geothermally","offset":130},{"uri":"Hot_spring","surface_form":"hot spring","offset":150},{"uri":"Travertine","surface_form":"travertine","offset":234},{"uri":"Volcanic","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":283},{"uri":"Ash","surface_form":"ash","offset":292},{"uri":"Tuff","surface_form":"tuff","offset":313}]}
