It usually contains compliant things such as feathers, cotton and foam rubber. Many have springs inside.\nThe word \"mattress\" came from Arabic words meaning \"to throw\" and \"place where something is thrown\" or \"mat, cushion.\" During the Crusades, Europeans slept on cushions thrown on the floor, and the word \"materas\" eventually became Middle English through the Romance languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bed","surface_form":"bed","offset":55},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":75},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":139},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":149},{"uri":"Foam","surface_form":"foam","offset":160},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":165},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":229},{"uri":"Crusades","surface_form":"Crusades","offset":329},{"uri":"Middle_English","surface_form":"Middle English","offset":429},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":456}]}
