{"id":27444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome","text":"e=\"preserve\">A dome is a feature of architecture that usually looks like the upper half of a sphere on top of a building.\nIt is a feature that makes many religious and government buildings stand out, because if someone is speaking to others inside or under a dome, the voice sounds louder. Also a dome makes it easier to identify an important building, for example a temple or a palace.\nA large stadium with a roof over the playing field is often called a \"dome\". One example of that usage is the Metrodome.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":36},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":93},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":154},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":168},{"uri":"Identify","surface_form":"identify","offset":321},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":367},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":379},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":395},{"uri":"Metrodome","surface_form":"Metrodome","offset":497}]}
