Address can also mean public speaking. It can also be used when someone is working on something, or talking about something.\"\nAn address (pronounced AD-dress or ad-DRESS) is a way to find or communicate with someone. It can be a postal address or an e-mail address. On forms, it is common to ask for someone's name, address and phone number, so that the person can be found easily.\nPostal address.\nA postal address is usually the location of someone's house, but sometimes it is the person's Post Office Box. It is the information that is put on a letter to have the letter delivered to a person.\nEmail Address.\nThe \"name\" part can be made up of any letters or numbers, and a few special characters, but it cannot contain spaces. The \"provider\" part can be made up of any letters or numbers, but no special characters and no spaces. Some providers may restrict the \"name\" part in other ways. For example, Gmail does not allow underscores.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Public_speaking","surface_form":"public speaking","offset":130},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communicate","offset":299},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"e-mail address","offset":358},{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":418},{"uri":"Phone_number","surface_form":"phone number","offset":436},{"uri":"Post_Office_Box","surface_form":"Post Office Box","offset":600},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":627},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":656},{"uri":"Gmail","surface_form":"Gmail","offset":1013}]}
