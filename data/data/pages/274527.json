{"id":274527,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQR_codes","text":"Secure Quick Response codes or SQR codes are secure two dimensional barcodes with high data density, based on QR codes.\nSecure Quick Response codes are a secure method for encrypting data into a barcode. It makes it extremely difficult to decode into the original plain text in the absence of the encryption cipher or key. A typical implementation of SQR codes would be to create a one-time use SQR code on a mobile phone's screen to effectively create a highly secure one-time pad type of encryption of, for example, an online account number.\nA typical implementation is to encrypt and use a precursor physical machine readable token such as the card identity number (CID) written in read-only memory (ROM) of a Secure Digital microSD card contained in a mobile telephone. The international mobile identity number may be used where no microSD card is present, for example, on an Apple iPhone.\nSQR codes may be securely read in a retail environment at the point of sale using 2D barcode scanners or even a low cost web camera. Secure Quick Response codes were first developed by Yodo, a company operating in Japan, and are patent pending.\nSQR Codes have also been developed by Sonny Fisher of the FORUS Foundation for the purposes of secure transactions, and published in a white paper and under a creative commons licence. The SQR solution guarantees the integrity of the source data as well as the validity of the originating party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2D","surface_form":"two dimensional","offset":52},{"uri":"Barcode","surface_form":"barcode","offset":68},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":87},{"uri":"QR_codes","surface_form":"QR codes","offset":110},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encrypting","offset":172},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plain text","offset":264},{"uri":"Cipher","surface_form":"encryption cipher","offset":297},{"uri":"Encryption_key","surface_form":"key","offset":318},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":409},{"uri":"Computer_monitor","surface_form":"screen","offset":424},{"uri":"One-time_pad","surface_form":"one-time pad","offset":469},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":490},{"uri":"Online_and_offline","surface_form":"online","offset":521},{"uri":"Card_identity_number","surface_form":"card identity number","offset":647},{"uri":"Read-only_memory","surface_form":"read-only memory","offset":685},{"uri":"Secure_Digital_card","surface_form":"Secure Digital","offset":713},{"uri":"MicroSD","surface_form":"microSD","offset":728},{"uri":"Mobile_telephone","surface_form":"mobile telephone","offset":756},{"uri":"IMEI","surface_form":"international mobile identity number","offset":778},{"uri":"IPhone","surface_form":"Apple iPhone","offset":880},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retail","offset":930},{"uri":"Point_of_sale","surface_form":"point of sale","offset":956},{"uri":"Webcam","surface_form":"web camera","offset":1015},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1108}]}
