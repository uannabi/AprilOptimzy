{"id":274554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball-jointed_doll","text":"A ball-jointed doll is a doll that is can have its arms and legs moved because of a ball joint. During the 1930, artist Hans Bellmer, made dolls that had ball-joints and used them in photography. In 1980, Japanese traditional doll artists used ball joints with dolls. In 1999, Japanese doll company, Volks, popularized the ball-jointed doll made of urethane.\nThe main feature of the ball-jointed doll is its joints. These joints are round and can be taken apart. So you can assemble the joints and body parts to make a doll. There are double-joints and triple joints that can make doll more delicate.\nThe eyes, wigs, clothes and make-up on the dolls can be changed and people can design their 'own' doll.\nVolks is the most popular company. There is also U-noa (Japan), D.O.D (Dream of Doll)(Korea), Luts (Korea), Blue Fairy (Korea), Iple House (Korea) and DZdoll (China).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Doll","surface_form":"doll","offset":25},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":183},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":205},{"uri":"Urethane","surface_form":"urethane","offset":349}]}
