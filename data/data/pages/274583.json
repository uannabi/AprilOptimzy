{"id":274583,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t","text":"An \"entrep\u00F4t\" is a trading post where merchandise can be imported and exported without paying a tariff. This is often at a profit. Sometimes it is more convenient to sell to an entrep\u00F4t than to travel long distances along a trade route. The entrep\u00F4t sells the goods at a higher price to others travelling the rest of the route. In modern times customs areas have largely made such entrep\u00F4ts obsolete.\nThis type of port should not be confused with the modern French use of the word \"entrep\u00F4t\" meaning warehouse.\nHistory.\nEntrep\u00F4ts date back to the middle ages. The Vikings established trade routes with entrep\u00F4ts at Dublin, Wexford and Waterford. An example of a Colonial American entrep\u00F4t was in Rhode Island between 1690 and 1765.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trading_post","surface_form":"trading post","offset":19},{"uri":"Product_(business)","surface_form":"merchandise","offset":38},{"uri":"Import_(international_trade)","surface_form":"imported","offset":57},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":70},{"uri":"Tariff","surface_form":"tariff","offset":96},{"uri":"Profit_(accounting)","surface_form":"profit","offset":123},{"uri":"Trade_route","surface_form":"trade route","offset":224},{"uri":"Customs_area","surface_form":"customs area","offset":344},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":414},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":458},{"uri":"Entrep%C3%B4t","surface_form":"entrep\u00F4t","offset":482},{"uri":"Warehouse","surface_form":"warehouse","offset":500},{"uri":"Middle_age","surface_form":"middle age","offset":547},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":564},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":615},{"uri":"Wexford","surface_form":"Wexford","offset":623},{"uri":"Waterford","surface_form":"Waterford","offset":635},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"Colonial American","offset":662},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":696}]}
