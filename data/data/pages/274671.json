{"id":274671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography","text":"X-ray crystallography is a way to see the three-dimensional structure of a molecule. The electron cloud of an atom bends the X-rays slightly. This makes a \"picture\" of the molecule that can be seen on a screen. It can be used for both organic and inorganic molecules. The sample is not destroyed in the process.\nThe technique was jointly invented by Sir William Bragg (1862\u20131942) and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg (1890\u20131971). They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915. Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate. He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin in February 1953.\nThe oldest method of X-ray crystallography is X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-rays are fired at a single crystal and the way they are scattered produces a pattern. These patterns are used to work out the arrangement of atoms inside the crystal.\nX-ray analysis of crystals.\nHere \"d\" is the spacing between diffracting planes, formula_1 is the incident angle, \"n\" is any integer, and \u03BB is the wavelength of the beam. These specific directions appear as spots on the diffraction pattern called \"reflections\". Thus, X-ray diffraction results from an electromagnetic wave (the X-ray) hitting a regular array of scatterers (the repeating arrangement of atoms within the crystal).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"three-dimensional","offset":42},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":60},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":75},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":89},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":125},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":235},{"uri":"Inorganic_chemistry","surface_form":"inorganic","offset":247},{"uri":"William_Bragg","surface_form":"William Bragg","offset":354},{"uri":"Lawrence_Bragg","surface_form":"Lawrence Bragg","offset":396},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":437},{"uri":"Cavendish_Laboratory","surface_form":"Cavendish Laboratory","offset":557},{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge University","offset":579},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":640},{"uri":"James_D._Watson","surface_form":"James D.
