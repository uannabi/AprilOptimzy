It has mercury and sulfate ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nMercury(I) sulfate is a whitish-yellow solid. It is not soluble in water. It does dissolve in dilute nitric acid.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving a large amount of mercury in concentrated sulfuric acid. It can also be made by reacting mercury(I) nitrate with any sulfate or sulfuric acid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":70},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":128},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":140},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":148},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":185},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":315},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":408},{"uri":"Mercury(I)_nitrate","surface_form":"mercury(I) nitrate","offset":455},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":483}]}
