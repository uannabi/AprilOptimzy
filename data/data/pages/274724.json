{"id":274724,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury(II)_sulfate","text":"=\"preserve\">Mercury(II) sulfate, also known as mercuric sulfate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is HgSO4. It has mercury and sulfate ions in it. The mercury is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nMercury(II) sulfate is a colorless solid. It reacts with hot water to make sulfuric acid and a mercury oxysulfate that does not dissolve. It is an oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nMercury(II) sulfate is made by dissolving a small amount of mercury metal in concentrated sulfuric acid. It can also be made by reacting mercury(II) oxide with sulfuric acid.\nUses.\nMercury(II) sulfate is used as a catalyst in making acetaldehyde. Some byproducts of this reaction that have mercury in them are thought to have poisoned many people in Japan (Minamata disease).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":70},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":127},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":139},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":147},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":184},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":288},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":360},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_oxide","surface_form":"mercury(II) oxide","offset":527},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":604},{"uri":"Acetaldehyde","surface_form":"acetaldehyde","offset":623}]}
