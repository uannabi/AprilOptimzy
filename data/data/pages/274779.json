{"id":274779,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury(I)_bromide","text":"=\"preserve\">Mercury(I) bromide, also known as mercurous bromide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Hg2Br2. It has mercury and bromide ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nMercury(I) bromide is a white crystalline solid. It is highly toxic. It easily disproportionates to mercury(II) bromide and mercury metal.\nOccurrence.\nIt is found very rarely as kuzminite, a mercury(I) bromide and chloride.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting a bromide like potassium bromide or sodium bromide with mercury(I) nitrate. It can also be made by reacting mercury and bromine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":70},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":128},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":140},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":148},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":185},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":244},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":276},{"uri":"Disproportionation","surface_form":"disproportionates","offset":293},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_bromide","surface_form":"mercury(II) bromide","offset":314},{"uri":"Mercury(I)_chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":428},{"uri":"Potassium_bromide","surface_form":"potassium bromide","offset":489},{"uri":"Sodium_bromide","surface_form":"sodium bromide","offset":510},{"uri":"Mercury(I)_nitrate","surface_form":"mercury(I) nitrate","offset":530},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":594}]}
