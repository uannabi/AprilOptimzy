{"id":274793,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_I%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","text":"Philippe of France, Son of France, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans (21 September 1640\u00A0\u2013 9 June 1701) was the youngest son of Louis XIII of France and his queen consort Anne of Austria. His older brother was the famous Louis XIV, \"le roi soleil\". He was known as \"Monsieur\" at his brother's court.\nBiography.\n\"Philippe de France\" was born at the Ch\u00E2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Styled Duke of Anjou from birth, Philippe became Duke of Orl\u00E9ans upon the death of his uncle Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans. During the reign of his brother he was known simply as \"Monsieur\". Openly homosexual, he married twice: firstly to Henrietta of England, \"Minette\", sister of Charles II of England. During their marriage, Philippe met and began a relationship with the Chevalier de Lorraine who was the great love of Philippe's life, their long relationship beginning in 1668. After the alleged poisoning of Minette, Philippe married again in 1671 to Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, \"Liselotte\".\nHe was the founder of the House of Orl\u00E9ans, a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon, and thus the direct ancestor of Louis Philippe I, who ruled France from 1830 till 1848 in the July Monarchy. Through the children of both of his marriages Philippe became an ancestor of most modern-day Roman Catholic royals, giving him the nickname of \"the grandfather of Europe\". Philippe's other legacies include his decisive victory at the Battle of Cassel in 1677. Through careful personal administration, Philippe greatly augmented his fortune and thus the fortune of the House of Orl\u00E9ans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Child_of_France","surface_form":"Son of France","offset":20},{"uri":"Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":35},{"uri":"Louis_XIII_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIII of France","offset":109},{"uri":"Queen_consort","surface_form":"queen consort","offset":138},{"uri":"Anne_of_Austria","surface_form":"Anne of Austria","offset":152},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV, \"le roi soleil\"","offset":202},{"uri":"Child_of_France","surface_form":"Monsieur","offset":247},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Saint-Germain-en-Laye","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye","offset":329},{"uri":"Duke_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Duke of Anjou","offset":370},{"uri":"Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":412},{"uri":"Gaston%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":456},{"uri":"Monsieur","surface_form":"Monsieur","offset":537},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":555},{"uri":"Princess_Henrietta_of_England","surface_form":"Henrietta of England, \"Minette\"","offset":596},{"uri":"Charles_II_of_England","surface_form":"Charles II of England","offset":639},{"uri":"Chevalier_de_Lorraine","surface_form":"Chevalier de Lorraine","offset":732},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Charlotte_of_the_Palatinate","surface_form":"Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, \"Liselotte\"","offset":914},{"uri":"House_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"House of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":992},{"uri":"House_of_Bourbon","surface_form":"House of Bourbon","offset":1039},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe_I","surface_form":"Louis Philippe I","offset":1089},{"uri":"July_Monarchy","surface_form":"July Monarchy","offset":1151},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1259},{"uri":"Descendants_of_Philippe_I%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"the grandfather of Europe","offset":1310},{"uri":"Battle_of_Cassel_(1677)","surface_form":"Battle of Cassel","offset":1400}]}
