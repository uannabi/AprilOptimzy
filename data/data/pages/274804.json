{"id":274804,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Marie_de_Bourbon","text":"Fran\u00E7oise Marie de Bourbon, \"L\u00E9gitim\u00E9e de France\", Granddaughter of France by marriage (4 May 1677 \u2013 1 February 1749) was the youngest legitimised daughter (\"fille l\u00E9gitim\u00E9e de France\") of Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. She was famed for her arrogance and belief that she was above most other people.\nBiography.\nOriginally known as the second \"Mademoiselle de Blois\", that style eventually gave way to the name \"Fran\u00E7oise Marie de Blois\". She married her first cousin Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans in 18 February 1692 at the age of fourteen and later bore eight children, four of which would have further children.\nProud, lazy and attractive, she successfully intrigued to have her daughters marry well to the Prince of Conti, Duke of Berry, Duke of Modena and King of Spain, mostly to spite her sister Louise Fran\u00E7oise de Bourbon, the Duchess of Bourbon. However, she welded little political influence considering her proximity to the political circle of the era. She was involved in the Cellamare Conspiracy in 1718 which was supposed to overthrow her own husband Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans as Regent of the Kingdom and replace him with her favourite brother the Duke of Maine. The \"marquis d'Argenson\" said she was very like her mother, Madame de Montespan, but also had Louis XIV's orderly mind with his failings of injustice and harshness.\nAmong her male line descendents are Philippe Egalit\u00E9, Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, and Prince Henri, Count of Paris, the present Orl\u00E9anist pretender to the French throne. She is also an ancestor of Juan Carlos I of Spain, Philippe, King of the Belgians, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the pretender to the Italian throne.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fils_de_France","surface_form":"Granddaughter of France by marriage","offset":51},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":189},{"uri":"Madame_de_Montespan","surface_form":"Madame de Montespan","offset":227},{"uri":"Philippe_II%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":496},{"uri":"Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_Prince_of_Conti","surface_form":"Prince of Conti","offset":727},{"uri":"Charles%2C_Duke_of_Berry_(1686%E2%80%931714)","surface_form":"Duke of Berry","offset":744},{"uri":"Louis_I_of_Spain","surface_form":"King of Spain","offset":778},{"uri":"Louise_Fran%C3%A7oise_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise Fran\u00E7oise de Bourbon","offset":820},{"uri":"Duchess_of_Bourbon","surface_form":"Duchess of Bourbon","offset":853},{"uri":"Cellamare_Conspiracy","surface_form":"Cellamare Conspiracy","offset":1006},{"uri":"Philippe_II%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":1083},{"uri":"R%C3%A9gence","surface_form":"Regent of the Kingdom","offset":1105},{"uri":"Louis-Auguste_de_Bourbon%2C_duc_du_Maine","surface_form":"Duke of Maine","offset":1174},{"uri":"Marc-Ren%C3%A9_de_Voyer_de_Paulmy_d%27Argenson_(1652%E2%80%931721)","surface_form":"marquis d'Argenson","offset":1194},{"uri":"Patrilineality","surface_form":"male line","offset":1364},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe_II%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe Egalit\u00E9","offset":1390},{"uri":"Louis-Philippe_I%2C_King_of_the_French","surface_form":"Louis-Philippe I, King of the French","offset":1408},{"uri":"Prince_Henri%2C_Count_of_Paris%2C_Duke_of_France","surface_form":"Prince Henri, Count of Paris","offset":1450},{"uri":"Orl%C3%A9anist","surface_form":"Orl\u00E9anist","offset":1492},{"uri":"Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain","surface_form":"Juan Carlos I of Spain","offset":1561},{"uri":"Philippe_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Philippe, King of the Belgians","offset":1585},{"uri":"Henri%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg","surface_form":"Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg","offset":1617},{"uri":"Vittorio_Emanuele%2C_Prince_of_Naples","surface_form":"Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples","offset":1653}]}
