He greatly augmented the already huge wealth of the House of Orl\u00E9ans.\nBiography.\n\"Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans\" was born at the Palace of Versailles on 12 May 1725. As the only son of Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans and his wife Johanna of Baden-Baden.\nFirst marriage.\nIn 1743, his paternal grandmother, Fran\u00E7oise-Marie de Bourbon the formidable Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00E9ans, and Louise \u00C9lisabeth, Dowager Princess of Conti arranged his marriage to his seventeen-year old cousin, Louise Henriette de Bourbon. The couple was married on 17 December 1743 at Versailles.\nAfter a few months of a passion that surprised everyone at court, the couple started to drift apart as the young Duchess of Chartres began to lead a scandalous life.\nSecond marriage.\nIn spite of his liaison with \u00C9tiennette, Louis Philippe had several other mistresses until he met, in July 1766, Madame de Montesson, a witty but married twenty-eight year old. After the death of the Marquis of Montesson in 1769, Louis Philippe tried to obtain Louis XV's authorisation to marry the young widow. Finally, in December 1772, the King gave his consent on the condition that the Marquise of Montesson would never become Duchess of Orl\u00E9ans or succeed to any other Orl\u00E9ans titles. In addition, the couple was to live a quiet life away from the court. The morganatic wedding took place on 23 April 1773.\nLater life.\nSurrounded by all the members of his immediate family, even his three children by Etiennette Le Marquis, Louis-Philippe died on 18 November 1785, at Sainte-Assise at the age of sixty. He was buried at the Val-de-Gr\u00E2ce convent in Paris, built by his ancestor Anne of Austria to celebrate the birth of Louis XIV of France, Louis Philippe's great grandfather.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":62},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe_II%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9","offset":97},{"uri":"House_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"House of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":168},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Palace of Versailles","offset":240},{"uri":"Louis_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":296},{"uri":"Margravine_Johanna_of_Baden-Baden","surface_form":"Johanna of Baden-Baden","offset":342},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7oise-Marie_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7oise-Marie de Bourbon","offset":417},{"uri":"Louise_%C3%89lisabeth_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise \u00C9lisabeth, Dowager Princess of Conti","offset":491},{"uri":"Louise_Henriette_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise Henriette de Bourbon","offset":591},{"uri":"Madame_de_Montesson","surface_form":"Madame de Montesson","offset":974},{"uri":"Louis_XV","surface_form":"Louis XV","offset":1122},{"uri":"Val-de-Gr%C3%A2ce","surface_form":"Val-de-Gr\u00E2ce","offset":1691},{"uri":"Anne_of_Austria","surface_form":"Anne of Austria","offset":1744}]}
