{"id":274885,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathilde_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","text":"Bathilde d'Orl\u00E9ans (Louise Marie Th\u00E9r\u00E8se Bathilde;9 July 1750 \u2013 10 January 1822), was a French princess. She was sister of Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9, the mother of the executed \"duc d'Enghien\" and aunt of Louis-Philippe King of the French. She was known as \"Citoyenne V\u00E9rit\u00E9\" during the French Revolution. By birth and marriage she held the rank of a princess of the blood.\nYouth.\nDescended from both Louis XIV of France and his younger brother, Philippe of France, \"Duke of Orl\u00E9ans\", Bathilde was born a \"princesse du sang\" and baptised with the names \"Louise Marie Th\u00E9r\u00E8se Bathilde\". She was the youngest child of Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. Bathilde was born at the Ch\u00E2teau de Saint-Cloud on 9 July 1750.\nHer mother died in 1759 when Bathilde was just eight years old. Her father, pressured by his mistress, Madame de Montesson, sent her to a convent. During her time at the convent, she became a very spiritual person.\nMarriage.\nInitially, Bathilde was considered as a possible bride for a distant cousin, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, the favourite grandson of King Louis XV of France, however, that marriage never materialised.\nFinally, in 1770, when she was twenty years old, she was allowed to leave the convent and marry her younger cousin, the \"Louis Henri de Bourbon\", son and heir of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00E9 and his wife Charlotte \u00C9lisabeth Godefride de Rohan.\nThe scandal of her husband's adultery came out in 1778, and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders. The couple separated in 1780. As a separated spouse, she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life at the Ch\u00E2teau de Chantilly.\nIn her isolation, she discreetly had an illegitimate daughter with a marine officer. Later, she passed the child off as the daughter of her secretary, in order to keep the little girl close to her. In 1787, she purchased the \u00C9lys\u00E9e Palace from Louis XVI and had a hamlet constructed there.\nRevolution.\nDuring the French Revolution, just like her brother Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9, Bathilde discovered democracy. She fell out with her royalist husband and son, who both chose to leave France after the storming of the Bastille. As the \"Ancien R\u00E9gime\" crumbled, she took the name, \"Citoyenne V\u00E9rit\u00E9\", \"Citizeness Truth\". Threatened by the new revolutionary government, she offered her wealth to the First French Republic before it could be confiscated.\nIn April 1793, her nephew, the young Duke of Chartres (future Louis Philippe of the French), fled France and sought asylum with the Austrians. In retribution, the National Convention decreed the imprisonment of all Bourbons remaining in France. While other members of the Orl\u00E9ans family still in France were kept under house arrest, Bathilde, Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9 and his sons were imprisoned in the Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille. Badly rewarded for her fidelity to the democratic ideals of the Revolution, she survived a year and a half in a prison cell. In November of the same year, her brother was guillotined. Miraculously spared during the Reign of Terror, Bathilde was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and returned to her \u00C9lys\u00E9e residence in Paris. Poverty-stricken, she was forced to rent out most of the palace.\nExile.\nIn 1797, the Directoire decided to exile the last of the Bourbons still living in France. With her sister-in-law, Louise Marie Ad\u00E9la\u00EFde de Bourbon, she went to Spain with her illegitimate daughter. Despite being forty-seven years old at the time, during the months which this journey took, she had an amorous intrigue with a handsome twenty-seven year old police officer (\"gendarme\") under whose responsibility she had been put. The two maintained a correspondence during her exile.\nRelegated to a place near Barcelona, Bathilde founded, despite her small means, a pharmacy and dispensary for the poor, and her house became a gathering place for those who needed aid. She became completely republican during this time period, despite her exile.\nIn 1804, she learned that Napol\u00E9on I, whom she admired, had had her only son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, kidnapped, and executed by firing squad in the moat of the Ch\u00E2teau de Vincennes. For ten years, the emperor kept the mother of his most famous victim from setting foot in France. Bathilde got her revenge in 1814, when the people, seeing in her the mother of the \"Martyr of Vincennes,\" cheered her as she travelled the route back to Paris.\nReturn to France.\nIn 1815, at the start of the Bourbon Restoration, she returned to France. Louis XVIII traded with her the H\u00F4tel Matignon for the \u00C9lys\u00E9e Palace. Bathilde promptly installed a community of nuns on the premises and charged them with praying for the souls of the victims of the Revolution. Her family, in the new moral order of the day, wanted to see her rejoin her husband after a separation of thirty-five years, but she refused. Instead, she resumed her affair with the police officer who had escorted her to Spain in 1797.\nIn 1822, while she was taking part in a march towards the Panth\u00E9on, she lost consciousness, and drew her last breath in the home of a law professor who taught at the Sorbonne. After her death, her nephew, Louis-Philippe, wanting to give an air of respectability to her bohemian lifestyle, burned the manuscript of her memoirs and a file on her young police officer located in the war archives.\nShe was buried in the Orl\u00E9ans family chapel the Coll\u00E9giale de Dreux.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippe_%C3%89galit%C3%A9","surface_form":"Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9","offset":123},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"executed","offset":159},{"uri":"Louis-Antoine-Henri_de_Bourbon-Cond%C3%A9","surface_form":"duc d'Enghien","offset":169},{"uri":"Louis-Philippe_of_France","surface_form":"Louis-Philippe King of the French","offset":196},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":278},{"uri":"Princess_of_the_blood","surface_form":"princess of the blood","offset":342},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":392},{"uri":"Philippe_I%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe of France, \"Duke of Orl\u00E9ans\"","offset":437},{"uri":"Prince_du_Sang","surface_form":"princesse du sang","offset":497},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":607},{"uri":"Louise_Henriette_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise Henriette de Bourbon","offset":636},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Saint-Cloud","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Saint-Cloud","offset":690},{"uri":"Charlotte-Jeanne_B%C3%A9raud_de_la_Haye_de_Riou%2C_marquise_de_Montesson","surface_form":"Madame de Montesson","offset":832},{"uri":"Ferdinand%2C_Duke_of_Parma","surface_form":"Ferdinand, Duke of Parma","offset":1031},{"uri":"Louis_XV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XV of France","offset":1088},{"uri":"Louis_Henri%2C_Prince_of_Cond%C3%A9","surface_form":"Louis Henri de Bourbon","offset":1272},{"uri":"Louis_Joseph_de_Bourbon%2C_prince_de_Cond%C3%A9","surface_form":"Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00E9","offset":1313},{"uri":"Charlotte_%C3%89lisabeth_Godefride_de_Rohan","surface_form":"Charlotte \u00C9lisabeth Godefride de Rohan","offset":1367},{"uri":"Adultery","surface_form":"adultery","offset":1436},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chantilly","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Chantilly","offset":1646},{"uri":"%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_Palace","surface_form":"\u00C9lys\u00E9e Palace","offset":1893},{"uri":"Louis_XVI","surface_form":"Louis XVI","offset":1912},{"uri":"Hamlet","surface_form":"hamlet","offset":1932},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":1981},{"uri":"Philippe_%C3%89galit%C3%A9","surface_form":"Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9","offset":2022},{"uri":"Storming_of_the_Bastille","surface_form":"storming of the Bastille","offset":2160},{"uri":"Ancien_R%C3%A9gime","surface_form":"Ancien R\u00E9gime","offset":2194},{"uri":"First_French_Republic","surface_form":"First French Republic","offset":2356},{"uri":"Confiscation","surface_form":"confiscated","offset":2397},{"uri":"Louis-Philippe_of_France","surface_form":"Duke of Chartres","offset":2447},{"uri":"Right_of_asylum","surface_form":"asylum","offset":2526},{"uri":"National_Convention","surface_form":"National Convention","offset":2573},{"uri":"Marseille","surface_form":"Marseille","offset":2825},{"uri":"Guillotine","surface_form":"guillotine","offset":3007},{"uri":"Reign_of_Terror","surface_form":"Reign of Terror","offset":3051},{"uri":"Thermidorian_Reaction","surface_form":"Thermidorian Reaction","offset":3098},{"uri":"Directoire","surface_form":"Directoire","offset":3252},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":3274},{"uri":"Louise_Marie_Ad%C3%A9la%C3%AFde_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise Marie Ad\u00E9la\u00EFde de Bourbon","offset":3353},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":3399},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":3748},{"uri":"Napoleon_I_of_France","surface_form":"Napol\u00E9on I","offset":4010},{"uri":"Louis-Antoine-Henri_de_Bourbon-Cond%C3%A9","surface_form":"Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien","offset":4062},{"uri":"Kidnap","surface_form":"kidnap","offset":4094},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Vincennes","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Vincennes","offset":4153},{"uri":"Bourbon_Restoration","surface_form":"Bourbon Restoration","offset":4480},{"uri":"Louis_XVIII","surface_form":"Louis XVIII","offset":4525},{"uri":"H%C3%B4tel_Matignon","surface_form":"H\u00F4tel Matignon","offset":4557},{"uri":"%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_Palace","surface_form":"\u00C9lys\u00E9e Palace","offset":4580},{"uri":"Nun","surface_form":"nun","offset":4638},{"uri":"Panth%C3%A9on","surface_form":"Panth\u00E9on","offset":5032},{"uri":"Sorbonne","surface_form":"Sorbonne","offset":5140},{"uri":"Louis-Philippe_of_France","surface_form":"Louis-Philippe","offset":5179},{"uri":"Bohemian","surface_form":"bohemian","offset":5243},{"uri":"Memoirs","surface_form":"memoirs","offset":5292},{"uri":"Chapelle_royale_de_Dreux","surface_form":"Coll\u00E9giale de Dreux","offset":5416}]}
