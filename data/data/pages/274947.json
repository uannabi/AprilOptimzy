{"id":274947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basin_(geology)","text":"A geological basin is a large low-lying area. It is often below sea level.\nGeological basins are one of the two most common places inland which collect sediment (the other is lakes). The type of rocks which form there tell about the palaeoclimate of the continent. The geology is of interest to oil prospectors, hydrologists and palaeontologists.\nDeath Valley example.\nStarting around 16 million years ago in the Miocene, and continuing into the present, a large part of the North American Plate has been stretched by being pulled apart.p611 The result has been the creation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust; the region grew an average of per year initially and then slowed to per year in the last 5 million years. Geologists call this region the Basin and Range Province.\nPulling forces causes rock at depth to stretch like silly putty and rock closer to the surface to break along normal faults into downfallen basins called grabens.\nSediment.\nBecause the basin is low-lying, it collects sediment. Rivers may run down into the basin from surrounding mountains. Floods or lakes may form with no outlet to the sea. Evaporation occurs; more sediment arrives, and so on. The strata which forms gives clues as to the palaeoclimate.\nOther terms that are used to describe a basin are: \"drainage basin\", \"catchment\", \"catchment area\", \"catchment basin\", \"drainage area\", \"river basin\", \"water basin\", \"endorheic basin\" and \"watershed\".\nDrainage.\nSome basins, such as the Great Basin, do not drain to the sea. The water may drain into underground aquifers, or evaporate to form salt lakes.\nMost basins, however, are drainage basins with rivers bringing their water into the sea. Many such rivers meander through a web of islands at the river delta, and bring along a huge amount of sediment in the form of mud, clay and sand. The Amazon and the Mississippi river systems are like this. The strata which form are quite different from inland basin lakes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":2},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":64},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":152},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":175},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":239},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":254},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":295},{"uri":"Hydrology","surface_form":"hydrologists","offset":312},{"uri":"Palaeontologist","surface_form":"palaeontologist","offset":329},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":413},{"uri":"North_American_Plate","surface_form":"North American Plate","offset":475},{"uri":"Crust_(geology)","surface_form":"crust","offset":630},{"uri":"Basin_and_Range_Province","surface_form":"Basin and Range Province","offset":775},{"uri":"Putty","surface_form":"putty","offset":859},{"uri":"Fault_(geology)","surface_form":"fault","offset":918},{"uri":"Graben","surface_form":"graben","offset":955},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":1018},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"River","offset":1028},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1080},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"Evaporation","offset":1143},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":1201},{"uri":"Endorheic_basin","surface_form":"endorheic basin","offset":1424},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":1446},{"uri":"Great_Basin","surface_form":"Great Basin","offset":1493},{"uri":"Aquifer","surface_form":"aquifer","offset":1568},{"uri":"Salt_lake","surface_form":"salt lake","offset":1599},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":1637},{"uri":"Meander","surface_form":"meander","offset":1717},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"river delta","offset":1757},{"uri":"Mud","surface_form":"mud","offset":1827},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":1832},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":1841},{"uri":"Amazon_Basin","surface_form":"Amazon","offset":1851},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":1866},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":1911},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":1967}]}
