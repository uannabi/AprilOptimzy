{"id":275188,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion","text":"e=\"preserve\">A pion or \u03C0 meson is a meson, which is a subatomic particle made of one quark and one antiquark.\nThere are six types of quark (called \"flavours\") but only two \"flavours\" go together to make a pion. These flavours are called up and down. Quarks have charge, so two quarks of the same flavour (both up or both down) make a neutral pion. But when the two quarks have different flavours (up and down), the pion will have a charge. This charge is positive when an up quark pairs with a down antiquark. The charge is negative when a down quark pairs with an up antiquark.\nPions do not exist for a long time. (On average, charged pions exist for around 26 nanoseconds; neutral pions last a tiny fraction of this). Pions are significant to our lives because they are one of the ways for strong force interactions to take place between nucleons like the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter. These interactions hold the nucleus together.\nPions are the lightest hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and pions with a positive or negative charge are the mesons with the longest \"mean lifetime\" (the average time that passes before they \"decay\" into leptons).\nThree Types of Pions.\nThe (superscript) +, \u2013, or 0 simply refers to the (electromagnetic) charge of the pion.\nUp quarks have a charge of + and down antiquarks have a charge of +, so \u03C0+ has charge of +1 (like a proton).\nAntiparticles have charge opposite to their particles, so up antiquarks have a charge of \u2212 and down quarks have a charge of \u2212. This means that \u03C0\u2212 has charge of \u22121 (like an electron).\nBecause \u03C00 pairs quarks of the same flavour with their antiquarks, both up quark (+) paired with up antiquark (\u2212) and down quark (+) paired with down antiquark (\u2212) leave it with zero charge (like a neutron).\nQuarks and antiquarks also have a different kind of charge called \"color\", unrelated to electromagnetic charge. This comes from the strong interaction that holds the quarks together. As in all mesons, the color charges in a pion must be equal and opposite: \"blue\" with \"anti-blue\", \"green\" with \"anti-green\", or \"red\" with \"anti-red\". The effect of these color\u2013anticolor pairings is that the pion's color charge is \"colorless\" (like a neutron is neutral). At the smallest distances, typically within an atomic nucleus, a small effect of the color charge remains and acts as the nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. Within the nucleus, then, \"virtual\" pions (and other \"virtual\" mesons) are exchanged between nucleons (protons and neutrons), pulling them together.\nAntiquarks are antimatter, so they will annihilate a quark of the same \"flavour\" that is near enough. This means that the quark and the antiquark will turn one another into energy.\nForce Carriers.\nForce-carriers are particles that are responsible for the action of forces, such as electromagnetism. Just as photons are responsible for electromagnetic force, so mesons are responsible for some of the lower energy (\"residual\") strong force interactions that occur between nucleons. (Strong force is also known as nuclear force or \"residual strong force\" when its action is between nucleons.) At an even smaller level, gluons are responsible for the strong force interactions between quarks.\nPion Decay.\nDecay of charged pions always produces leptons, like electrons.\nA neutral pion, \u03C00, will usually decay into two highly-energized photons.\nOther Forms of Pion Decay.\nHowever, there is some probability (from <0.1% to 1.2%) involved with the decay of some pions, as they can also decay into different forms. For \u03C0+, the second most likely decay product is one positron (an anti-electron) and one electron neutrino. \u03C0\u2013 will sometimes decay into one electron and one electron antineutrino. \u03C00 will sometimes decay into one highly-energized photon, one electron, and one positron. (Keep in mind that positrons and electrons can annihilate each other, and this annihilation produces highly-energized photons).\nDecay Due to Weak Force.\nSince the decay of pions is due to weak force, yet another force carrier is introduced. During the decay, a W+ boson is created, which lasts for 3x10\u221225 seconds. After this incredibly short amount of time, the W+ boson will decay into the leptons that the pion would naturally decay to. However, it is important to draw this distinction, as it includes weak force.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pi_(letter)","surface_form":"\u03C0","offset":23},{"uri":"Meson","surface_form":"meson","offset":36},{"uri":"Subatomic_particle","surface_form":"subatomic particle","offset":54},{"uri":"Quark","surface_form":"quark","offset":85},{"uri":"Antimatter","surface_form":"antiquark","offset":99},{"uri":"Up_quark","surface_form":"up","offset":237},{"uri":"Down_quark","surface_form":"down","offset":244},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"charge","offset":262},{"uri":"Neutral","surface_form":"neutral","offset":334},{"uri":"Positive_charge","surface_form":"positive","offset":455},{"uri":"Negative_charge","surface_form":"negative","offset":524},{"uri":"Mean_lifetime","surface_form":"On average","offset":616},{"uri":"Nanosecond","surface_form":"nanosecond","offset":662},{"uri":"Strong_force","surface_form":"strong force","offset":792},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"interaction","offset":805},{"uri":"Nucleon","surface_form":"nucleon","offset":840},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":858},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":870},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":891},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":927},{"uri":"Hadron","surface_form":"hadron","offset":968},{"uri":"Lepton","surface_form":"lepton","offset":1154},{"uri":"Superscript","surface_form":"superscript","offset":1191},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"(electromagnetic) charge","offset":1236},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":1555},{"uri":"Strong_interaction","surface_form":"strong interaction","offset":1906},{"uri":"Nuclear_force","surface_form":"nuclear force","offset":2352},{"uri":"Boson","surface_form":"\"virtual\" pion","offset":2425},{"uri":"Nucleon","surface_form":"nucleon","offset":2492},{"uri":"Annihilation","surface_form":"annihilate","offset":2588},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":2721},{"uri":"Force-carrier","surface_form":"Force-carrier","offset":2745},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":2764},{"uri":"Fundamental_force","surface_form":"force","offset":2813},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"electromagnetism","offset":2829},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":2899},{"uri":"Strong_force","surface_form":"strong force","offset":2974},{"uri":"Nuclear_force","surface_form":"nuclear force","offset":3060},{"uri":"Gluon","surface_form":"gluon","offset":3165},{"uri":"Lepton","surface_form":"lepton","offset":3289},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":3303},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"photon","offset":3379},{"uri":"Positron","surface_form":"positron","offset":3607},{"uri":"Electron_neutrino","surface_form":"neutrino","offset":3652},{"uri":"Weak_force","surface_form":"weak force","offset":4013},{"uri":"W_boson","surface_form":"W+ boson","offset":4086}]}
