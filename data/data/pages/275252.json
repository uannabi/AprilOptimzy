{"id":275252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium(I)_bromide","text":"Thallium(I) bromide, also known as thallous bromide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is TlBr. It has thallium and bromide ions in it. The thallium is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nThallium(I) bromide is a yellow-white solid. It is similar to silver bromide. It gets darker when light shines on it. It is very toxic, like all thallium compounds. It does not dissolve in water.\nPreparation.\nThallium(I) bromide is made by reacting thallium and bromine or by reacting sodium or potassium bromide with any thallium compound.\nUses.\nIt is used in semiconductors and gamma ray and X-ray detectors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":58},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"thallium","offset":114},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":127},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":135},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":173},{"uri":"Silver_bromide","surface_form":"silver bromide","offset":264},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":464},{"uri":"Sodium_bromide","surface_form":"sodium","offset":487},{"uri":"Potassium_bromide","surface_form":"potassium bromide","offset":497},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":563},{"uri":"Gamma_ray","surface_form":"gamma ray","offset":582},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":596}]}
