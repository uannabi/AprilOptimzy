{"id":275255,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium(III)_hydroxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Thallium(III) hydroxide, also known as thallic hydroxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Tl(OH)3. It has thallium and hydroxide ions in it. The thallium is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nThallium(III) hydroxide is a weak base. It is a white solid. It is highly toxic. It is also an oxidizing agent. It breaks down to thallium(III) oxide when heated. If it is heated more, it breaks down to oxygen and thallium(I) oxide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":75},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"thallium","offset":134},{"uri":"Hydroxide","surface_form":"hydroxide","offset":147},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":157},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":195},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":258},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":319},{"uri":"Thallium(III)_oxide","surface_form":"thallium(III) oxide","offset":354},{"uri":"Thallium(I)_oxide","surface_form":"thallium(I) oxide","offset":438}]}
