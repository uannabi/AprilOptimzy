{"id":27526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League","text":"Rugby League is a ball sport. Two teams of thirteen players play against each other. The ball used is oval in shape. The field is a rectangle shape. It is 100 metres long and 70 metres wide. It is played for 80 minutes (40 minutes each half).\nA \"try\" is scored when a player scores or touches the ball down in the in-goal area (the try line included). A try is worth 4 points and if its converted (the goal kicker kicks the ball in between the top of the goal post), the team gets an extra 2 points. Another method of scoring points is through drop goals which are worth 1 point, or penalty goals which are worth 2 points.\nRugby League is played in over 30 countries in the world.
