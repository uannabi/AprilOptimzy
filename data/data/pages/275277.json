{"id":275277,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium(I)_chloride","text":"e=\"preserve\">Thallium(I) chloride, also known as thallous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is TlCl. It has thallium and chloride ions in it. The thallium is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nThallium(I) chloride is a colorless odorless solid. It is very toxic. It is insoluble (does not dissolve) in cold water but dissolves a little in hot water. Otherwise, it is somewhat similar to potassium chloride in being colorless and silver chloride in being insoluble in water.\nPreparation.\nThallium(I) chloride is made by reacting any soluble chloride such as hydrochloric acid with thallium(I) sulfate. This makes a thallium(I) chloride solid. It can also be made by reacting thallium metal with hydrochloric acid.\nUses.\nIt is the result of a certain way to make hexafluorophosphates from chlorides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":73},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"thallium","offset":129},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":142},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":151},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":189},{"uri":"Potassium_chloride","surface_form":"potassium chloride","offset":412},{"uri":"Silver_chloride","surface_form":"silver chloride","offset":454},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":582},{"uri":"Thallium(I)_sulfate","surface_form":"thallium(I) sulfate","offset":605},{"uri":"Hexafluorophosphate","surface_form":"hexafluorophosphate","offset":786}]}
