{"id":275343,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Person of the Year is an issue of the United States magazine \"Time\" that has come out each year since 1927. Until 1999, it was called \"Man of the Year.\"\nThe \"Person of the Year\" is not always a person. It can be a person, group, idea, or thing that \"for better or for worse...has done the most to influence the events of the year\". This means that being chosen is not an award, like being chosen as the \"best person of the year.\" The Person of the Year may be an enemy of the United States, like Adolf Hitler (1938) or Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942). Every year, \"Time\" chooses the person who they think has had the most effect on the things that have happened in that year (whether those things were good or bad).\nThe first Person of the Year was aviator Charles Lindbergh, in 1927. Since then, Persons of the Year have included groups, whole generations, important objects, and even the Earth. Since the list began, every serving President of the United States has been a Person of the Year at least once, except for Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and Gerald Ford. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have been named Person of the Year three times.\nThe December 31, 1999 issue of \"Time\" named Albert Einstein the \"Person of the Century\". Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Time_(magazine)","surface_form":"Time","offset":76},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":311},{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"award","offset":385},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":477},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":510},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":533},{"uri":"Charles_Lindbergh","surface_form":"Charles Lindbergh","offset":769},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":857},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":880},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":902},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":945},{"uri":"Calvin_Coolidge","surface_form":"Calvin Coolidge","offset":1032},{"uri":"Herbert_Hoover","surface_form":"Herbert Hoover","offset":1049},{"uri":"Gerald_Ford","surface_form":"Gerald Ford","offset":1069},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
