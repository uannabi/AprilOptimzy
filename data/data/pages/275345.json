She also had much input in the construction of the \"Ch\u00E2teau de Lun\u00E9ville\". She also introduced the future architect \"Germain Boffrand\" to the royal courts in 1711.\nFamily.\n\u00C9lisabeth Charlotte was born at the Ch\u00E2teau de Saint-Cloud the daughter of Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans and of his second wife, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate.

The marriage was the result of the Treaty of Ryswick, one of its conditions being that the Duchy of Lorraine, which had been for many years in the possession of France, be restored to Leopold, a son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Thus, \u00C9lisabeth Charlotte was but an instrument to cement the peace treaty. The House of Lorraine received a dowry of 900,000 Livres.\nTo everyone surprise, what had been expected to be an unhappy union turned out to be a marriage of love and happiness.

After being educated in Vienna, Francis Stephen returned to Lorraine in 1737, ending his mother's tenure as regent.\n\u00C9lisabeth Charlotte tried to engage her youngest child Anne Charlotte to King Louis XV; this project failed due to the intrigues of Duke of Bourbon; \u00C9lisabeth Charlotte then tried to arrange the marriage of Anne Charlotte to her first cousin Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, who had been recently widowed; Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans refused.\nLater years.\nUnable to prevent her son from giving up the duchy of Lorraine to Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski when he married the Habsburg heiress, Maria Theresa of Austria, \u00C9lisabeth Charlotte moved into the \"Ch\u00E2teau d\u2019Harou\u00E9\" in nearby Commercy, which was turned into a sovereign principality for her to enjoy during her dowager years.\n\u00C9lisabeth Charlotte died of a stroke, on 23 December 1744, one week after her daughter-in-law and grandchild, at the age of sixty-eight. She was the last of her siblings to die and had outlived ten of her thirteen children. Nine months after her death, her son Francis Stephen became Holy Roman Emperor.\nShe was buried in the funerary chapel of the Dukes of Lorraine in the \"Saint-Fran\u00E7ois-des-Cordeliers\" church in Nancy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Leopold%2C_Duke_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Leopold, Duke of Lorraine","offset":106},{"uri":"Lorraine_(duchy)","surface_form":"Lorraine","offset":157},{"uri":"Commercy","surface_form":"Commercy","offset":206},{"uri":"Francis_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor","offset":239},{"uri":"Marie_Antoinette","surface_form":"Marie Antoinette","offset":280},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Lun%C3%A9ville","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Lun\u00E9ville","offset":350},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Saint-Cloud","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Saint-Cloud","offset":506},{"uri":"Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":545},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Charlotte_of_the_Palatinate","surface_form":"Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate","offset":595},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":674},{"uri":"Royal_Highness","surface_form":"Her Royal Highness","offset":734},{"uri":"Marie_Louise_of_Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Queen_of_Spain","surface_form":"Marie Louise","offset":876},{"uri":"Anne_Marie_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Anne Marie","offset":893},{"uri":"Henrietta_of_England","surface_form":"Henrietta of England","offset":950},{"uri":"Joseph_Clemens_of_Bavaria","surface_form":"Joseph Clemens of Bavaria","offset":1127},{"uri":"William_III_of_England","surface_form":"William III of England","offset":1192},{"uri":"Joseph_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I","offset":1216},{"uri":"Pope_Innocent_XII","surface_form":"Pope Innocent XII","offset":1269},{"uri":"Louis%2C_Grand_Dauphin","surface_form":"Louis, Grand Dauphin","offset":1332},{"uri":"Louis-Auguste_de_Bourbon%2C_duc_du_Maine","surface_form":"Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine","offset":1366},{"uri":"Madame_de_Montespan","surface_form":"Madame de Montespan","offset":1435},{"uri":"Palace_of_Fontainebleau","surface_form":"Palace of Fontainebleau","offset":1522},{"uri":"Leopold%2C_Duke_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Leopold, Duke of Lorraine","offset":1549},{"uri":"Charles_V%2C_Duke_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Charles V, Duke of Lorraine","offset":1583},{"uri":"Eleonora_of_Austria","surface_form":"Eleonora of Austria","offset":1635},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Ryswick","surface_form":"Treaty of Ryswick","offset":1691},{"uri":"Charles_V%2C_Duke_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Charles V, Duke of Lorraine","offset":1858},{"uri":"Dowry","surface_form":"dowry","offset":1996},{"uri":"French_livres","surface_form":"Livres","offset":2013},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Lun%C3%A9ville","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Lun\u00E9ville","offset":2416},{"uri":"Francis_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Francis Stephen of Lorraine","offset":2579},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":2632},{"uri":"Louis_XV","surface_form":"Louis XV","offset":2802},{"uri":"Louis_Henri%2C_Duke_of_Bourbon","surface_form":"Duke of Bourbon","offset":2856},{"uri":"Louis_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":2966},{"uri":"Stanis%C5%82aw_Leszczy%C5%84ski","surface_form":"Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski","offset":3135},{"uri":"House_of_Habsburg","surface_form":"Habsburg","offset":3177},{"uri":"Maria_Theresa_of_Austria","surface_form":"Maria Theresa of Austria","offset":3195},{"uri":"Commercy","surface_form":"Commercy","offset":3285},{"uri":"Dowager","surface_form":"dowager","offset":3370},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":3415},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Holy Roman Emperor","offset":3669},{"uri":"Nancy","surface_form":"Nancy","offset":3801}]}
