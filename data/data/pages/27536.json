{"id":27536,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English","text":"e=\"preserve\">African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is a name for the way some African-American people talk. Linguists (people who study language) gave AAVE its name. Some non-black people use this dialect, too. Some of its pronunciations and grammar resemble the way people talk in West Africa.\nIt first came about in the 16th and 17th centuries. African American Vernacular English became famous in 1996, when some educators in Oakland, California said they wanted to use AAVE to help teach black kids. They called it Ebonics. However, Ebonics often has a negative connotation.\nThere are many rules that govern how the sounds of AAVE are different from Standard English. Some have to do with pronunciation and vocabulary (or lexicon). Most have to do with grammar. This includes verb tenses and sentence structure.\nHip hop music has made AAVE more famous since the 1980s. Some people think it is cool and they try to speak it or learn it even if they are not really familiar with it. Some non-black people can speak it well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"Linguist","offset":113},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":202},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":287},{"uri":"Oakland%2C_California","surface_form":"Oakland, California","offset":434},{"uri":"Standard_English","surface_form":"Standard English","offset":659},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":698},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":716},{"uri":"Lexicon","surface_form":"lexicon","offset":731},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":762},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":785},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":801},{"uri":"Hip_hop","surface_form":"Hip hop music","offset":821},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":871}]}
