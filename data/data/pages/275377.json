{"id":275377,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium(I)_carbonate","text":"=\"preserve\">Thallium(I) carbonate, also known as thallous carbonate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Tl2CO3. It has thallium and carbonate ions in it. The thallium is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nThallium(I) carbonate is a white solid. It dissolves in water. It is the only heavy metal carbonate that can dissolve in water. It is similar to potassium carbonate. It is highly toxic, though. It reacts with acids like all carbonates do to make a thallium salt and carbon dioxide.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting thallium(I) oxide with carbon dioxide.\nUses.\nIt is used to make fake diamonds, to test for carbon disulfide, and to kill fungi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":74},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"thallium","offset":132},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":145},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":155},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":193},{"uri":"Potassium_carbonate","surface_form":"potassium carbonate","offset":367},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":431},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":488},{"uri":"Thallium(I)_oxide","surface_form":"thallium(I) oxide","offset":540},{"uri":"Carbon_disulfide","surface_form":"carbon disulfide","offset":631},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":661}]}
