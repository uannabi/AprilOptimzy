{"id":275396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium(I)_oxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Thallium(I) oxide, also known as thallous oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Tl2O. It has thallium and oxide ions in it. The thallium is in its +1 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nThallium(I) oxide is a black solid. It reacts with water to make a yellow solution of thallium(I) hydroxide. It reacts with carbon dioxide to make thallium(I) carbonate. It is a strong base. It reacts with acids to make other thallium salts. It is very toxic.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by heating thallium(I) hydroxide or thallium(I) carbonate in air.\nUses.\nIt is used in some superconductors. It is also used to make certain special types of glass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":66},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"thallium","offset":122},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":135},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":141},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":179},{"uri":"Thallium(I)_hydroxide","surface_form":"thallium(I) hydroxide","offset":294},{"uri":"Thallium(I)_carbonate","surface_form":"thallium(I) carbonate","offset":355},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":393},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":414},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":443},{"uri":"Superconductor","surface_form":"superconductor","offset":583},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":649}]}
