{"id":275427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium_halide","text":"e=\"preserve\">The thallium halides come in two oxidation states: monohalides, where thallium has the oxidation state +1, and trihalides, where thallium generally has oxidation state +3.\nMonohalides.\nThe monohalides all contain thallium with oxidation state +1.\nTrihalides.\nThallium(III) halides are very rare. Some of them are unstable. The thallium(III) iodide does not form. They are quite different to aluminium, gallium and indium trihalides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":46},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"thallium","offset":83},{"uri":"Unstable","surface_form":"unstable","offset":326}]}
