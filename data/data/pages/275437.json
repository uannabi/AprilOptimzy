They became extinct in the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event.\nThey were the major predators of their day. They had large, powerful, square-shaped jaws with huge, sabre-like canine and interlaced, socket-like teeth. Many fossils have been found in South Africa.\nThe largest known, \"Inostrancevia\", was the size of a large bear with a 45\u00A0cm long skull, and 12-cm long sabre-like teeth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Therapsid","surface_form":"Therapsid","offset":22},{"uri":"Tetrapods","surface_form":"tetrapods","offset":45},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":89},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian period","offset":158},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":215},{"uri":"Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event","surface_form":"Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event","offset":230},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":450},{"uri":"Inostrancevia","surface_form":"Inostrancevia","offset":484},{"uri":"Sabre","surface_form":"sabre","offset":569}]}
