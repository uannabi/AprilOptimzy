{"id":275447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark","text":"=\"preserve\">Down quarks (sometimes written as a \"d\") are very small particles that help make up many larger particles, like protons and neutrons. Down quarks have a charge of -1/3. Since Down quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can exist in the same space at the same time), they have a spin of 1/2. Down quarks are the second lightest quark, the first being up quarks.\nThe antiparticle of a Down quark is a Down antiquark, or simply an antidown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":68},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":124},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":136},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"charge","offset":165},{"uri":"Fermion","surface_form":"fermion","offset":203},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":304},{"uri":"Up_quark","surface_form":"up quark","offset":376},{"uri":"Antimatter","surface_form":"antiparticle","offset":391}]}
