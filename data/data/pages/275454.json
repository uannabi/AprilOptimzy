{"id":275454,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charm_quark","text":"=\"preserve\">Charm quarks or c quarks are the third most massive of the six quarks. Like all quarks, they are thought to be so small that they can not be divided. (They are called elementary particles for this reason). Similar to up quarks, charm quarks have a charge of +2/3. Although charm quarks are not extremely common, they can be found in particles created by particle accelerators (which smash atoms together at extremely high speeds), such as \u03C8 mesons, D mesons, and other charmed particles. Since they are fermions (particles that can not have more than one of that particle at the same place at the same time), charm quarks have a spin of 1/2.\nThe discovery of charm quarks \u2013 and J/\u03C8 mesons \u2013 led to a rapid series of scientific breakthroughs. These events are known as the November revolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quarks","surface_form":"quarks","offset":75},{"uri":"Elementary_particle","surface_form":"elementary particle","offset":179},{"uri":"Up_quark","surface_form":"up quark","offset":229},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"charge","offset":260},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":345},{"uri":"Particle_accelerator","surface_form":"particle accelerator","offset":366},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":401},{"uri":"%CF%88_meson","surface_form":"\u03C8 meson","offset":451},{"uri":"D_meson","surface_form":"D meson","offset":461},{"uri":"Fermion","surface_form":"fermion","offset":515},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":641},{"uri":"November_revolution","surface_form":"November revolution","offset":784}]}
