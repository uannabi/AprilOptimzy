{"id":275475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othniel_Charles_Marsh","text":"Othniel Charles Marsh M.A PhD LL.D (October 29, 1831 \u2013 March 18, 1899) was one of the leading paleontologists of the 19th century. He discovered and named many fossils found in western North America.\nEarly life.\nMarsh was born in Lockport, New York, into a family of modest means. However, he was the nephew of the very rich banker and philanthropist, George Peabody.\nHe graduated from Yale College in 1860. He later studied geology and mineralogy in New Haven, and afterwards paleontology and anatomy in Berlin, Heidelberg and Breslau. He returned to the United States in 1866 and was appointed professor of vertebrate paleontology at Yale University. He persuaded his uncle George Peabody to establish the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale.\nCareer.\nMarsh and his many fossil hunters were able to uncover about 500 new species of fossil animals, which were named by Marsh himself.\nIn May 1871, Marsh uncovered the first pterosaur fossils found in America. He also found early horses, the Cretaceous and Jurassic dinosaurs \"Apatosaurus\" and \"Allosaurus\", and described the toothed birds of the Cretaceous; \"Ichthyornis\" and \"Hesperornis\".\nMarsh is also known for the so-called \"Bone Wars\" waged against Edward Drinker Cope. The two men were fiercely competitive, discovering and documenting more than 120 new species of dinosaur between them. Marsh eventually won the Bone Wars by finding 80 new species of dinosaur, while Cope only found 56.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","surface_form":"M.A","offset":22},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":26},{"uri":"LL.D","surface_form":"LL.D","offset":30},{"uri":"Paleontologist","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":94},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":160},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":185},{"uri":"Lockport%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Lockport, New York","offset":230},{"uri":"George_Peabody","surface_form":"George Peabody","offset":352},{"uri":"Yale_College","surface_form":"Yale College","offset":386},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":425},{"uri":"Mineralogy","surface_form":"mineralogy","offset":437},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":494},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":505},{"uri":"Heidelberg","surface_form":"Heidelberg","offset":513},{"uri":"Breslau","surface_form":"Breslau","offset":528},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":636},{"uri":"Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History","surface_form":"Peabody Museum of Natural History","offset":708},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":778},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":828},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":929},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":985},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":997},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":1012},{"uri":"Apatosaurus","surface_form":"Apatosaurus","offset":1032},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":1050},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":1102},{"uri":"Ichthyornis","surface_form":"Ichthyornis","offset":1115},{"uri":"Hesperornis","surface_form":"Hesperornis","offset":1133},{"uri":"Bone_Wars","surface_form":"Bone Wars","offset":1186},{"uri":"Edward_Drinker_Cope","surface_form":"Edward Drinker Cope","offset":1211},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1328}]}
