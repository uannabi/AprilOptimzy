{"id":275517,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson","text":"The only remaining fundamental force that has no known gauge boson is gravity. The theoretical gauge boson for gravity is called a graviton.\nAll gauge bosons are bosons, which simply means that two or more of them can exist in the same place at the same time, unlike fermions. It also means that gauge bosons have a spin of 0, 1, or 2.\nGauge bosons are thought to interact with the Higgs field. This theoretical field is believed by many scientists to be responsible for why some gauge bosons \u2013 like W and Z bosons \u2013 have mass, while others \u2013 such as photons \u2013 do not have mass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":70},{"uri":"Theoretical_Particle","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":83},{"uri":"Graviton","surface_form":"graviton","offset":131},{"uri":"Boson","surface_form":"boson","offset":162},{"uri":"Fermion","surface_form":"fermion","offset":267},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":316},{"uri":"Higgs_field","surface_form":"Higgs field","offset":382},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":522}]}
