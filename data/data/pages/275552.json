{"id":275552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus","text":"\"Pediococcus\" is a genus of gram-positive lactic acid bacteria. They usually occur in pairs or tetrads, and divide along two planes of symmetry, as do the other lactic acid cocci genera. They are purely homofermentative.\n\"Pediococcus\" strains are found in foods, on plants, and as beer-spoilage agents. They produce inactive lactic acid and are used mainly for making fermented vegetables, mashes, beer, and wort.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"gram-positive","offset":28},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":54},{"uri":"Lactic_acid","surface_form":"lactic acid","offset":161},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":256},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":266}]}
