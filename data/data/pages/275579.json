{"id":275579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Gasser","text":"Herbert Gasser (Herbert Spencer Gasser, July 5, 1888 May 11, 1963) was an American doctor. He won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, with Joseph Erlanger.\nGasser discovered the different conductivity rates of different groups of nerve fibres. The work led to advances in our knowledge of the mechanism of pain and of reflex action and has inspired a large school of neurophysiologists. The Nobel Foundation described their work as \"for their discoveries relating to the highly differentiated functions of single nerve fibres\" which probably means 'different fibres do different things'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"American","offset":74},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":83},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":107},{"uri":"Joseph_Erlanger","surface_form":"Joseph Erlanger","offset":151},{"uri":"Nerve_fibre","surface_form":"nerve fibre","offset":242},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":318},{"uri":"Reflex","surface_form":"reflex","offset":330}]}
