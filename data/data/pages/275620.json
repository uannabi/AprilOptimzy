{"id":275620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-Triassic_extinction_event","text":"e=\"preserve\">The End-Triassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, 208 million years ago. However, many of the extinctions occurred before then in the Upper Triassic.\nOverall, this was one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon. It profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans. At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct.\nA whole class (conodonts: extinct chordates); 20% of all marine families; all large crurotarsans (non-dinosaurian archosaurs); some remaining therapsids; and many of the large amphibians such as the temnospondyls were wiped out.\nThe event emptied many ecological niches, and allowed the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years, and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart.\nRecent evidence.\nA recent paper in PNAS shows fairly clearly that mass volcanism was involved. It was probably the primary cause of the extinction. Mercury is present in volcanic rocks found at the end-Triassic boundary.\nMercury is emitted in gaseous form during volcanism, and deposited in sediments. The paper says \"Such episodic volcanism likely perturbed the global environment over a long time and strongly delayed ecological recovery\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":78},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":91},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinctions","offset":153},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":193},{"uri":"Extinction_event","surface_form":"extinction event","offset":244},{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic","offset":269},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":281},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"oceans","offset":333},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":362},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":427},{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":444},{"uri":"Conodont","surface_form":"conodont","offset":451},{"uri":"Chordate","surface_form":"chordate","offset":470},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":493},{"uri":"Crurotarsi","surface_form":"crurotarsans","offset":520},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaurian","offset":538},{"uri":"Archosaur","surface_form":"archosaur","offset":550},{"uri":"Therapsid","surface_form":"therapsid","offset":578},{"uri":"Amphibia","surface_form":"amphibia","offset":612},{"uri":"Temnospondyl","surface_form":"temnospondyl","offset":635},{"uri":"Ecological_niche","surface_form":"ecological niche","offset":688},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":723},{"uri":"Pangaea","surface_form":"Pangaea","offset":858},{"uri":"Volcanism","surface_form":"volcanism","offset":961},{"uri":"Mercury","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":1038},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":1181}]}
