The album was released on Virgin Records.\nThe entire album was provided on their website for legal download many months before the CD release was announced. It was one of the first major uses of the MP3 format by a commercial organization.\nIt does not use the jazzy sounds and the rapping of Tricky in \"Blue Lines\" and \"Protection\", leaving in favour a dark sound, heavy bass lines and distorted guitars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":41},{"uri":"Trip_hop","surface_form":"trip hop","offset":49},{"uri":"Massive_Attack","surface_form":"Massive Attack","offset":64},{"uri":"Virgin_Records","surface_form":"Virgin Records","offset":187},{"uri":"Tricky","surface_form":"Tricky","offset":453},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":557}]}
