{"id":275868,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_antimonide","text":"Aluminium antimonide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AlSb. It has aluminium and antimonide ions in it. Compounds like it, such as gallium antimonide and indium antimonide can be made into LED<nowiki/>s and detectors for Infrared radiation but aluminium antimonide doesn't work as well. It is used instead to make the other compounds work better by stopping defects forming as they are made.\nProperties.\nAluminium antimonide is a black solid. It is a semiconductor. It reacts with acids to make stibine. It is a reducing agent. It has properties between a salt and an alloy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":26},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":82},{"uri":"Antimonide","surface_form":"antimonide","offset":96},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":107},{"uri":"LED","surface_form":"LED","offset":204},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"Infrared","offset":236},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":466},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":496},{"uri":"Stibine","surface_form":"stibine","offset":510},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":527},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":571},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":583}]}
