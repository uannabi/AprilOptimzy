{"id":275870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stibine","text":"e=\"preserve\">Stibine, also known as antimony hydride or hydrogen antimonide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbH3. It is a covalent compound. It could be seen as having antimonide and hydrogen ions, or antimony and hydride ions.\nProperties.\nStibine is a colorless gas. It is very toxic. It has a bad smell like hydrogen sulfide. Its structure is similar to ammonia. It can be found in the Marsh test, a test for arsenic. Antimony is reacted with a mixture of zinc and hydrochloric acid in a tube, making stibine. The stibine is heated and a shiny area of antimony is made in the heated part of the tube.\nStibine easily decomposes into antimony and hydrogen at room temperature. This decomposition can be explosive. It burns very easily in air to make antimony trioxide and water. It can be deprotonated by very strong bases. Stibine melts at -88\u00B0C and boils at -17\u00B0C.\nHistory.\nStibine was first found in 1837. It was difficult to find its properties because people did not know of a good way to make it. In 1901, Alfred Stock found a good way to make this gas and found most of its properties.\nPreparation.\nStibine is made by reacting any antimonide with a strong acid. Some antimonides react with water to make this gas. Stibine can also be made by reacting any antimony(III) compound such as antimony trioxide with any hydride.\nUses.\nStibine is used to dope semiconductors with antimony. Some claim that it is used as a fumigant, but phosphine works much better.\nSafety.\nStibine is a highly toxic gas, similar in toxicity to phosphine. It is too unstable to be of any hazard outside the laboratory, though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":82},{"uri":"Covalent","surface_form":"covalent","offset":139},{"uri":"Antimonide","surface_form":"antimonide","offset":185},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":200},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":209},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":218},{"uri":"Hydride","surface_form":"hydride","offset":231},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":327},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":373},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":475},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":484},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":720},{"uri":"Antimony_trioxide","surface_form":"antimony trioxide","offset":767},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonated","offset":806},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":834},{"uri":"Antimonide","surface_form":"antimonide","offset":1155},{"uri":"Strong_acid","surface_form":"strong acid","offset":1173},{"uri":"Doping_(semiconductor)","surface_form":"dope","offset":1371},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":1376},{"uri":"Fumigation","surface_form":"fumigant","offset":1438},{"uri":"Phosphine","surface_form":"phosphine","offset":1452}]}
