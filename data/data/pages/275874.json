{"id":275874,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_tribromide","text":"=\"preserve\">Antimony tribromide, also known as antimony(III) bromide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbBr3. It has antimony and bromide ions in it. The antimony is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony tribromide is a colorless solid. It absorbs water from the air. It reacts with water to make antimony trioxide and hydrobromic acid. It has covalent bonds in it and melts easily.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting antimony and bromine or by reacting concentrated hydrobromic acid with antimony trioxide.\nUses.\nIt is used as a fire retardant. It is also used in dyeing, and analytical chemistry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":75},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":132},{"uri":"Bromide","surface_form":"bromide","offset":145},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":153},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":191},{"uri":"Antimony_trioxide","surface_form":"antimony trioxide","offset":322},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":344},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent bond","offset":369},{"uri":"Melt","surface_form":"melt","offset":394},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":457},{"uri":"Fire_retardant","surface_form":"fire retardant","offset":556},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":591},{"uri":"Analytical_chemistry","surface_form":"analytical chemistry","offset":603}]}
