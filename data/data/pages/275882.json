{"id":275882,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_trifluoride","text":"Antimony trifluoride, also known as antimony(III) fluoride or Swart's reagent, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbF3. It has antimony and fluoride ions in it. The antimony is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony trifluoride is a light gray solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is very corrosive. It has a strong odor.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting antimony trioxide with concentrated hydrofluoric acid or by reacting antimony with a little fluorine.\nUses.\nIt is used to add fluoride ions to other chemical compounds in organic chemistry. A Belgian chemist reacted a chloride with antimony trifluoride and chlorine to make a fluoride from the chloride. It was used to make Freon. It is also used in pottery and dyeing.\nSafety.\nAntimony trifluoride is highly corrosive. It is acidic and can burn the digestive system. It also makes ulcers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":84},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":140},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":153},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":162},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":200},{"uri":"Corrosive","surface_form":"corrosive","offset":314},{"uri":"Antimony_trioxide","surface_form":"antimony trioxide","offset":383},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":419},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":475},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":509},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":554},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":601},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":640},{"uri":"Freon","surface_form":"Freon","offset":707},{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"pottery","offset":733},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":745},{"uri":"Digestive_system","surface_form":"digestive system","offset":833},{"uri":"Ulcer","surface_form":"ulcer","offset":865}]}
