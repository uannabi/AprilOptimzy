{"id":275891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_trisulfide","text":"Antimony trisulfide, also known as antimony(III) sulfide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Sb2S3. It has antimony and sulfide ions in it. The antimony is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony trisulfide is a gray solid. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide and an antimony(III) compound. It dissolves in potassium hydroxide. It burns in air to make antimony(III) oxide and sulfur dioxide. It is a reducing agent.\nOccurrence.\nStibnite is the mineral form of antimony trisulfide.\nPreparation.\nAntimony trisulfide is made in the laboratory by reacting any antimony(III) compound with hydrogen sulfide.\nUses.\nAntimony trisulfide is used in cosmetics; in this area it is called kohl. It is used in pyrotechnics to make a glitter effect. It is also used in the heads of safety matches. It used to be used in flash powder before electronic flashes were used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":63},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":120},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":133},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":141},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":179},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":260},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":286},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":350},{"uri":"Antimony(III)_oxide","surface_form":"antimony(III) oxide","offset":395},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":419},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":443},{"uri":"Stibnite","surface_form":"Stibnite","offset":471},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":487},{"uri":"Cosmetics","surface_form":"cosmetics","offset":682},{"uri":"Kohl","surface_form":"kohl","offset":719},{"uri":"Pyrotechnics","surface_form":"pyrotechnics","offset":739},{"uri":"Safety_match","surface_form":"safety match","offset":810}]}
