{"id":275896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_tetroxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Antimony tetroxide, also known as antimony tetraoxide or antimony(III,V) oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Sb2O4. It has antimony and oxide ions in it. The antimony is both in the +3 and the +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony tetroxide is a white solid. It is an oxidizing agent. It turns yellow when heated and turns white again when cooled.\nOccurrence and preparation.\nAntimony tetroxide is found as the mineral cervantite. It is made by heating antimony trioxide with air, burning antimony in air, or heated antimony pentoxide strongly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":97},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":154},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":167},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":173},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":227},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":302},{"uri":"Antimony_trioxide","surface_form":"antimony trioxide","offset":487},{"uri":"Antimony_pentoxide","surface_form":"antimony pentoxide","offset":550}]}
