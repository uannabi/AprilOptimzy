{"id":275899,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_pentachloride","text":"=\"preserve\">Antimony pentachloride, also known as antimony(V) chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbCl5. It has antimony and chloride ions in it. The antimony is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony pentachloride is a colorless or yellow liquid. It releases toxic and odorous (bad odor) fumes in air. It melts at 2.8\u00B0C and boils at 140\u00B0C. It reacts with water to make antimony pentoxide and hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in chloroform. It absorbs water to form a solid hydrate. It is a strong oxidizing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting liquid antimony trichloride with chlorine.\nUses.\nIt is used in a test for caesium. It is also used in the making of chemicals and dyes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":77},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":134},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":147},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":156},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":194},{"uri":"Antimony_pentoxide","surface_form":"antimony pentoxide","offset":401},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":424},{"uri":"Chloroform","surface_form":"chloroform","offset":494},{"uri":"Hydrate","surface_form":"hydrate","offset":539},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":563},{"uri":"Antimony_trichloride","surface_form":"antimony trichloride","offset":623},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":649},{"uri":"Caesium","surface_form":"caesium","offset":690},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":746}]}
