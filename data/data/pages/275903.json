{"id":275903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_pentafluoride","text":"Antimony pentafluoride, also known as antimony(V) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbF5. It has five antimony-fluorine bonds. The antimony is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony pentafluoride is a colorless thick liquid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and very reactive. It can help fluorine to oxidize oxygen. This is not normal as oxygen normally oxidizes other things; it does not get oxidized. It can make very strong acids when mixed with hydrofluoric acid. It was used in the first reaction that used fluorides to make fluorine.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting antimony pentoxide or antimony pentachloride with hydrofluoric acid. It can also be made by reacting antimony trifluoride with fluorine.\nUses.\nIt is used to make very strong acids.\nSafety.\nAntimony pentafluoride reacts with most chemical compounds. It is extremely corrosive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":65},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":126},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":135},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":144},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":177},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":275},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidize","offset":334},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":342},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":461},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":483},{"uri":"Antimony_pentoxide","surface_form":"antimony pentoxide","offset":610},{"uri":"Antimony_pentachloride","surface_form":"antimony pentachloride","offset":632},{"uri":"Antimony_trifluoride","surface_form":"antimony trifluoride","offset":711}]}
