{"id":275905,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_pentoxide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Antimony pentoxide, also known as antimony pentaoxide and antimony(V) oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Sb2O5. It has antimony and oxide ions in it. The antimony is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nIt is a yellow solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It reacts with hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid to make antimony pentachloride and antimony pentafluoride. It breaks down to antimony tetroxide when heated to a high temperature.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting antimony trioxide with nitric acid. It can also be made by reacting antimony pentafluoride or antimony pentachloride with water.\nUses.\nAntimony pentoxide is used in fire retardants and the making of titanium dioxide. It is also used as a catalyst.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":95},{"uri":"Antimony","surface_form":"antimony","offset":152},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":165},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":171},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":209},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":275},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":307},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":329},{"uri":"Antimony_pentachloride","surface_form":"antimony pentachloride","offset":355},{"uri":"Antimony_pentafluoride","surface_form":"antimony pentafluoride","offset":382},{"uri":"Antimony_tetroxide","surface_form":"antimony tetroxide","offset":424},{"uri":"Antimony_trioxide","surface_form":"antimony trioxide","offset":514},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":537},{"uri":"Fire_retardant","surface_form":"fire retardant","offset":679},{"uri":"Titanium_dioxide","surface_form":"titanium dioxide","offset":713},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":752}]}
