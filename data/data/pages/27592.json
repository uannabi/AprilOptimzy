{"id":27592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code","text":"A code is a way of changing information into something else. Sometimes this is done as a way of keeping a message secret. This is called encryption or cryptography.\nOne source gives this explanation: a code is \"a word, number or some other symbol used to represent a word, phrase or syllable in plaintext\". It is one of the earliest forms of cryptography. Contrast code with cypher, in which the individual letters are encrypted (changed).\nComputers use codes, by changing letters into 1's and 0's. This method was invented for punched tape. Now the usual alphanumeric code is ASCII.\nSome people write codes as a kind of game. They think it is fun to make ciphers, and fun to break them. Breaking a code means taking it apart to understand how it works, and then you can understand messages that are written in that code. Cryptanalysis is also serious business. Nations and other organizations have been breaking each other's ciphers for many centuries.\nThe algorithm (code) for making a message secret is called the encryption algorithm. To change a secret message back a decryption algorithm is needed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Secret","surface_form":"secret","offset":114},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":137},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":151},{"uri":"Plaintext","surface_form":"plaintext","offset":295},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":342},{"uri":"Cypher","surface_form":"cypher","offset":375},{"uri":"Punched_tape","surface_form":"punched tape","offset":528},{"uri":"ASCII","surface_form":"ASCII","offset":577},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":621},{"uri":"Cryptanalysis","surface_form":"Cryptanalysis","offset":822},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":958},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":1017},{"uri":"Decryption","surface_form":"decryption","offset":1073}]}
