{"id":275924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_(album)","text":"\"Protection\" (1994) is Bristol-based trip-hop band Massive Attack's second album.\nSound.\n\"Protection\" was featured in the top ten of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 'Coolest Albums of All Time List,' calling it \"great music for when you're driving around a city at 4 am,\" due to the 'chill out' nature of the album. Like most of Massive Attack's albums, the music often forgets about categorisation, ranging from R&B (title track, Sly) to hip hop/rap (Karmacoma, Eurochild) to reggae-tinged synthpop (Spying Glass) to classical-influenced electronica instrumentals (Weather Storm, Heat Miser).\nPaul Evans of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the album three and a half of five stars calling it \"Cool, sexy stuff, it smoothly fuses dub, club and soul, grounding its grace in sampled hip-hop beats.\"\nIt is the second and last Massive Attack album listed in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\nThe track \"Karmacoma\" featured vocals from Tricky, and the video was directed by Jonathan Glazer. The song also features a sample from the track \"Dream Time in Lake Jackson\" by The KLF, which can be found 2:00 minutes in.\nDJ Mad Professor remixed the album in 1995 under the name \"No Protection\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album| &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":23},{"uri":"Trip-hop","surface_form":"trip-hop","offset":37},{"uri":"Massive_Attack","surface_form":"Massive Attack","offset":51},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":75},{"uri":"Rolling_Stone","surface_form":"Rolling Stone","offset":134},{"uri":"Chill_out_music","surface_form":"chill out","offset":279},{"uri":"Rhythm_and_blues","surface_form":"R&B","offset":408},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":434},{"uri":"Reggae","surface_form":"reggae","offset":472},{"uri":"Synthpop","surface_form":"synthpop","offset":486},{"uri":"Electronica","surface_form":"electronica","offset":534},{"uri":"Paul_Evans_(critic)","surface_form":"Paul Evans","offset":589},{"uri":"Rolling_Stone","surface_form":"Rolling Stone","offset":604},{"uri":"1001_Albums_You_Must_Hear_Before_You_Die","surface_form":"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die","offset":847},{"uri":"Tricky","surface_form":"Tricky","offset":933},{"uri":"Jonathan_Glazer","surface_form":"Jonathan Glazer","offset":971},{"uri":"Chill_Out","surface_form":"\"Dream Time in Lake Jackson\"","offset":1035},{"uri":"The_KLF","surface_form":"The KLF","offset":1067},{"uri":"Disc_Jockey","surface_form":"DJ","offset":1112},{"uri":"Mad_Professor","surface_form":"Mad Professor","offset":1115},{"uri":"Remix","surface_form":"remix","offset":1129},{"uri":"No_Protection_(Massive_Attack_album)","surface_form":"No Protection","offset":1171}]}
