The same time to Massive Attack, Vowles, along with Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall, Nellee Hooper, and others were The Wild Bunch crew, named after a western by Sam Peckinpah. Several members of The Wild Bunch formed Massive Attack.\nCareer.\nVowles stayed a member of Massive Attack until shortly after the release of their third full-length album, \"Mezzanine\", in 1998. Interviews with band members have pointed to differences of opinion in the direction the band should go; Vowles liking a hip-hop direction while Robert Del Naja and Daddy G leaned more towards darker electronica themes. He also had expressed a dislike for touring, an activity which he characterised as \"pimping\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Southmead_Hospital","surface_form":"Southmead Hospital","offset":48},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":68},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":77},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":135},{"uri":"Trip-hop","surface_form":"trip-hop","offset":143},{"uri":"Massive_Attack","surface_form":"Massive Attack","offset":157},{"uri":"Bath%2C_Somerset","surface_form":"Bath","offset":204},{"uri":"Robert_Del_Naja","surface_form":"Robert Del Naja","offset":262},{"uri":"Daddy_G","surface_form":"Grant Marshall","offset":279},{"uri":"Nellee_Hooper","surface_form":"Nellee Hooper","offset":295},{"uri":"The_Wild_Bunch","surface_form":"The Wild Bunch","offset":326},{"uri":"Western_(genre)","surface_form":"western","offset":361},{"uri":"Sam_Peckinpah","surface_form":"Sam Peckinpah","offset":372},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":552},{"uri":"Mezzanine","surface_form":"Mezzanine","offset":560},{"uri":"Hip-hop","surface_form":"hip-hop","offset":702},{"uri":"Robert_Del_Naja","surface_form":"Robert Del Naja","offset":726},{"uri":"Daddy_G","surface_form":"Daddy G","offset":746}]}
