{"id":276033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100th_Window","text":"\"100th Window\" is the fourth studio album from the Bristol-based trip-hop group Massive Attack. Of the band's original core people, the album only features Robert Del Naja. Andrew Vowles left shortly after the release of \"Mezzanine\", and Grant Marshall did not want to be in the making of the record.\nReleased in February 2003, \"100th Window\" was written and produced by Del Naja and Neil Davidge, and features vocals from Horace Andy and Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor, as well as one appearance by Damon Albarn. It is the first album by the band that made no use of samples, and contains none of the jazz or jazz fusion stylings of the \"Blue Lines\" or \"Protection\" recordings, but is less dark than \"Mezzanine\". The album could have been released earlier, but Del Naja was arrested a few months earlier before it was released under suspicion of child pornography offences. However, he was cleared.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":29},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":51},{"uri":"Trip_hop","surface_form":"trip-hop","offset":65},{"uri":"Massive_Attack","surface_form":"Massive Attack","offset":80},{"uri":"Robert_Del_Naja","surface_form":"Robert Del Naja","offset":156},{"uri":"Andrew_Vowles","surface_form":"Andrew Vowles","offset":173},{"uri":"Mezzanine","surface_form":"Mezzanine","offset":222},{"uri":"Daddy_G","surface_form":"Grant Marshall","offset":238},{"uri":"Horace_Andy","surface_form":"Horace Andy","offset":423},{"uri":"Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor","surface_form":"Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor","offset":439},{"uri":"Damon_Albarn","surface_form":"Damon Albarn","offset":485},{"uri":"Sampling_(music)","surface_form":"samples","offset":553},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":587},{"uri":"Jazz_fusion","surface_form":"jazz fusion","offset":595},{"uri":"Blue_Lines","surface_form":"Blue Lines","offset":624},{"uri":"Protection_(album)","surface_form":"Protection","offset":640},{"uri":"Mezzanine","surface_form":"Mezzanine","offset":687}]}
