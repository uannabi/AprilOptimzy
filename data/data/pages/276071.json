He was traded to the New York Americans in December 1931, but never played for the team. He later worked in the International Hockey League and the Can-Am Leagues. Creighton became a professional hockey referee after retiring as a player, and later worked as a general insurance salesman.\nHe served as an alderman in Brandon in 1946, 1948 and 1949, and was mayor of the city from 1952 to 1955 and from 1958 to 1961.\nCreighton won the Liberal-Progressive nomination for Brandon City in the 1953 provincial election, defeating W.A.
