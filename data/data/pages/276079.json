{"id":276079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide","text":"Gallium arsenide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is GaAs. It has gallium and arsenide ions in it. The gallium is in the +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nGallium arsenide is a gray solid. It makes crystals in a cube shape. It reacts slowly with water and quickly with acids to make arsine. It oxidizes in air.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting arsenic trichloride or arsenic with gallium.\nUses.\nGallium arsenide is mainly used as a semiconductor. It has several things better about it than silicon. The semiconductors made are faster and higher power. LED's using gallium arsenide are efficient. Silicon, though is cheaper. Silicon dioxide is a good insulator; gallium arsenide does not make a good insulator like silicon does. Silicon semiconductors also take less power than gallium arsenide ones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":22},{"uri":"Gallium","surface_form":"gallium","offset":78},{"uri":"Arsenide","surface_form":"arsenide","offset":90},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":99},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":136},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":208},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":222},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":279},{"uri":"Arsine","surface_form":"arsine","offset":293},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidizes","offset":304},{"uri":"Arsenic_trichloride","surface_form":"arsenic trichloride","offset":357},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":380},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":445},{"uri":"Silicon","surface_form":"silicon","offset":503}]}
