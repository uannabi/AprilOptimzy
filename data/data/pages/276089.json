{"id":276089,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_trichloride","text":"e=\"preserve\">Arsenic trichloride, also known as arsenic(III) chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AsCl3. It has three arsenic-chlorine bonds in it. The arsenic is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nArsenic trichloride is a colorless or yellowish liquid. It melts at -16\u00B0C and boils at 130.2\u00B0C. It reacts with water, similar to phosphorus trichloride, to make arsenous acid and hydrochloric acid. It makes fumes in moist air. It is highly toxic.\nPreparation.\nArsenic trichloride is made by reacting arsenic with chlorine or by reacting arsenic trioxide with hydrochloric acid or sulfur monochloride.\nUses.\nIt is used to make other arsenic compounds. It is also used to make organo-arsenic compounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":76},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":139},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":147},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":156},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":194},{"uri":"Melt","surface_form":"melt","offset":282},{"uri":"Boiling","surface_form":"boils","offset":301},{"uri":"Phosphorus_trichloride","surface_form":"phosphorus trichloride","offset":352},{"uri":"Arsenous_acid","surface_form":"arsenous acid","offset":384},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":402},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":536},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":560},{"uri":"Sulfur_monochloride","surface_form":"sulfur monochloride","offset":603},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organo","offset":698}]}
