{"id":276090,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_trifluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Arsenic trifluoride, also known as arsenic(III) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AsF3. It has arsenic and fluoride ions in it. The arsenic is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nArsenic trifluoride is a colorless liquid. It melts at -8.5\u00B0C and boils at 60.4\u00B0C. It is highly toxic. It reacts with water to make arsenous acid and hydrofluoric acid, both very dangerous acids.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting arsenic trioxide with hydrofluoric acid or by reacting excess arsenic with fluorine.\nUses.\nIt is used to change nonmetal chlorides to fluorides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":75},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":131},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":143},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":152},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":189},{"uri":"Arsenous_acid","surface_form":"arsenous acid","offset":350},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":368},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":450},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":525},{"uri":"Nonmetal","surface_form":"nonmetal","offset":562},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":571}]}
