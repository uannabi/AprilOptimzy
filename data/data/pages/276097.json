{"id":276097,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_triiodide","text":"=\"preserve\">Arsenic triiodide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AsI3. It has arsenic and iodide ions in it. The arsenic is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nArsenic triiodide is an orange-red solid. It easily sublimes. It dissolves in water and reacts very slowly to make arsenious acid and hydroiodic acid. The solution is very acidic. It breaks down when heated to make arsenic trioxide, arsenic metal, and iodine. It is a weak reducing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting sodium or potassium iodide with arsenic trichloride.\nUses.\nAs \"Donovan's solution\" it was said to treat many diseases which it did not treat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":35},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":91},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":103},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":110},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":147},{"uri":"Sublime","surface_form":"sublime","offset":228},{"uri":"Arsenious_acid","surface_form":"arsenious acid","offset":291},{"uri":"Hydroiodic_acid","surface_form":"hydroiodic acid","offset":310},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":331},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":348},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":391},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":428},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":449},{"uri":"Sodium_iodide","surface_form":"sodium","offset":501},{"uri":"Potassium_iodide","surface_form":"potassium iodide","offset":511},{"uri":"Arsenic_trichloride","surface_form":"arsenic trichloride","offset":533}]}
