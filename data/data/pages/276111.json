{"id":276111,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenous_acid","text":"=\"preserve\">Arsenous acid, also known as arsenious acid, is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is As(OH)3. It has arsenic and hydroxide ions in it. The arsenic is in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nArsenous acid is a colorless solution. It is a weak acid. It reacts with bases to make arsenite salts. It is highly toxic. It cannot be made in a crystalline form because it turns into arsenic trioxide and water again. It is similar to phosphorous acid, although it is not a strong reducing agent.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by dissolving arsenic trioxide or arsenic trichloride in water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":62},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":95},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":141},{"uri":"Hydroxide","surface_form":"hydroxide","offset":153},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":163},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":200},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":258},{"uri":"Weak_acid","surface_form":"weak acid","offset":276},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":302},{"uri":"Arsenite","surface_form":"arsenite","offset":316},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":325},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":345},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":375},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":414},{"uri":"Phosphorous_acid","surface_form":"phosphorous acid","offset":465},{"uri":"Reducing_agent","surface_form":"reducing agent","offset":511},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":565},{"uri":"Arsenic_trichloride","surface_form":"arsenic trichloride","offset":585}]}
