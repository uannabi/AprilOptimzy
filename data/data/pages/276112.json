{"id":276112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenite","text":"=\"preserve\">Arsenite is an ion. Its chemical formula can be either AsO33- or AsO2-. It has arsenic in its +3 oxidation state. All arsenites are highly toxic. Sodium arsenite is an example. Arsenites are salts of arsenous acid.\nSometimes arsenite means arsenic trioxide, especially in groundwater chemistry (chemistry dealing with the properties of water in the ground)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":27},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":91},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":109},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":151},{"uri":"Sodium_arsenite","surface_form":"Sodium arsenite","offset":158},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":203},{"uri":"Arsenous_acid","surface_form":"arsenous acid","offset":212},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":252}]}
