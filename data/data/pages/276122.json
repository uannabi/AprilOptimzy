{"id":276122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_pentafluoride","text":"=\"preserve\">Arsenic pentafluoride, also known as arsenic(V) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AsF5. It has five arsenic-fluorine bonds in it. The arsenic is in its +5 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nArsenic pentafluoride is a colorless gas. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It is highly toxic. It makes an ionic bond with sulfur tetrafluoride. Its melting point is -79.8\u00B0C and its boiling point is -52.8\u00B0C.\nPreparation.\nArsenic pentafluoride is made by reacting arsenic trifluoride with fluorine or by reacting arsenic with a large amount of fluorine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":75},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":136},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":144},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":153},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":191},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":277},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":307},{"uri":"Ionic_bond","surface_form":"ionic bond","offset":326},{"uri":"Sulfur_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"sulfur tetrafluoride","offset":342},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":368},{"uri":"Boiling_point","surface_form":"boiling point","offset":401},{"uri":"Arsenic_trifluoride","surface_form":"arsenic trifluoride","offset":482},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":507}]}
