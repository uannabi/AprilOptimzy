{"id":276133,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_arsenate","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lead arsenate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbHAsO4. It has lead, hydrogen, and arsenate (HAsO42-) ions in it. The lead is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nLead arsenate is a white solid. It is highly toxic because of the lead and the arsenic in it. It does not dissolve in water.\nPreparation.\nIt was made by reacting lead nitrate with arsenic acid.\nUses.\nIt was the most used insecticide that had arsenic in it. It was used against the potato beetle and the gypsy moth. It replaced the even more toxic Paris Green. It was later used to kill certain moths, mosquitoes, and pests of cranberries. It was found that it stayed inside fruits even after washing off, so it was replaced with DDT. It was completely banned in 1988.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":32},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":91},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":97},{"uri":"Arsenate","surface_form":"arsenate","offset":111},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":130},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":146},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":164},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":238},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":272},{"uri":"Lead_nitrate","surface_form":"lead nitrate","offset":355},{"uri":"Arsenic_acid","surface_form":"arsenic acid","offset":373},{"uri":"Insecticide","surface_form":"insecticide","offset":414},{"uri":"Potato_beetle","surface_form":"potato beetle","offset":474},{"uri":"Gypsy_moth","surface_form":"gypsy moth","offset":496},{"uri":"Paris_Green","surface_form":"Paris Green","offset":540},{"uri":"Moth","surface_form":"moth","offset":587},{"uri":"Mosquito","surface_form":"mosquito","offset":594},{"uri":"Cranberry","surface_form":"cranberries","offset":619},{"uri":"DDT","surface_form":"DDT","offset":722}]}
