{"id":276137,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_arsenate","text":"=\"preserve\">Potassium arsenate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula can be K3AsO4, K2HAsO4, or KH2AsO4. It has potassium and arsenate ions in it.\nProperties.\nPotassium arsenate is a white solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It is carcinogenic and highly toxic.\nPreparation and uses.\nPotassium arsenate is made by reacting amounts of potassium hydroxide with arsenic acid. The amount of potassium hydroxide can be changed to make the different chemical formulas. Potassium arsenate was once used for medicine but is too toxic to be used now.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":36},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":119},{"uri":"Arsenate","surface_form":"arsenate","offset":133},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":142},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":242},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":265},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":289},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":368},{"uri":"Arsenic_acid","surface_form":"arsenic acid","offset":393},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":534}]}
