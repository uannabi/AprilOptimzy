It had been officially released everywhere except North America by 8 February 2010 (US and Canada on 9\u00A0February 2010) \u2013 seven years after the release of their last non-soundtrack, standalone studio album, \"100th Window\". It has been certified Gold in the United Kingdom.\nPersonnel.\nThe record has the singing of Horace Andy plus invited vocalists: Tunde Adebimpe of TV On The Radio, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, Hope Sandoval of Hope Sandoval And The Warm Inventions and Mazzy Star, Guy Garvey of Elbow and Martina Topley-Bird, as well as guitar playing by Adrian Utley of Portishead (on \"Saturday Come Slow\"), keys from Portishead collaborator John Baggott (most notably on \"Atlas Air\"), keys and synth bass from Damon Albarn (\"Splitting the Atom\" and \"Flat of the Blade\" respectively), guitar (various tracks) and bass (\"Girl I Love You\") by Neil Davidge and bass by Billy Fuller of Beak on various tracks.\nThe record features drumming from the late Jerry Fuchs and regular session and touring drummer Damon Reece. Dan Brown and Stew Jackson (Robot Club) co-wrote \"Paradise Circus\", played guitar on and co-wrote \"Saturday Come Slow\", and part-programmed and engineered those tracks. Tim Goldsworthy added an additional production (specific tracks unstated). Most tracks were mixed with Mark \"Spike\" Stent and then all were mastered with Tim Young at Metropolis Studios, as with previous records. Unlike previous records, there are no personal acknowledgements on the inlay. Neil Davidge co-produced all tracks with Robert Del Naja only (except tracks 3, 7 and 9 where Grant Marshall was also involved), though Marshall has a co-write credit on every track. The album is dedicated to the \"Blue Lines\" co-producer, Jonny Dollar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_production","surface_form":"music production","offset":77},{"uri":"Massive_Attack","surface_form":"Massive Attack","offset":104},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":141},{"uri":"Heligoland","surface_form":"same name","offset":160},{"uri":"100th_Window","surface_form":"100th Window","offset":377},{"uri":"Horace_Andy","surface_form":"Horace Andy","offset":483},{"uri":"Tunde_Adebimpe","surface_form":"Tunde Adebimpe","offset":519},{"uri":"TV_On_The_Radio","surface_form":"TV On The Radio","offset":537},{"uri":"Damon_Albarn","surface_form":"Damon Albarn","offset":554},{"uri":"Blur_(band)","surface_form":"Blur","offset":570},{"uri":"Gorillaz","surface_form":"Gorillaz","offset":579},{"uri":"Hope_Sandoval","surface_form":"Hope Sandoval","offset":589},{"uri":"Hope_Sandoval_And_The_Warm_Inventions","surface_form":"Hope Sandoval And The Warm Inventions","offset":606},{"uri":"Mazzy_Star","surface_form":"Mazzy Star","offset":648},{"uri":"Guy_Garvey","surface_form":"Guy Garvey","offset":660},{"uri":"Elbow_(band)","surface_form":"Elbow","offset":674},{"uri":"Martina_Topley-Bird","surface_form":"Martina Topley-Bird","offset":684},{"uri":"Adrian_Utley","surface_form":"Adrian Utley","offset":734},{"uri":"Portishead_(Band)","surface_form":"Portishead","offset":750},{"uri":"Neil_Davidge","surface_form":"Neil Davidge","offset":1021},{"uri":"Jerry_Fuchs","surface_form":"Jerry Fuchs","offset":1129},{"uri":"Damon_Reece","surface_form":"Damon Reece","offset":1181},{"uri":"Tim_Goldsworthy","surface_form":"Tim Goldsworthy","offset":1363},{"uri":"Mark_Stent","surface_form":"Mark \"Spike\" Stent","offset":1466},{"uri":"Metropolis_Studios","surface_form":"Metropolis Studios","offset":1530},{"uri":"Neil_Davidge","surface_form":"Neil Davidge","offset":1654},{"uri":"Robert_Del_Naja","surface_form":"Robert Del Naja","offset":1695},{"uri":"Daddy_G","surface_form":"Grant Marshall","offset":1748},{"uri":"Blue_Lines","surface_form":"Blue Lines","offset":1868},{"uri":"Jonny_Dollar","surface_form":"Jonny Dollar","offset":1893}]}
