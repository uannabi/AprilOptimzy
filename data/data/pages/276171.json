He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau attended Coll\u00E8ge Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the \u00C9cole Navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. After an automobile accident cut short his career in naval aviation, Cousteau changed to studying the sea.\nIn Toulon, where he was serving on the \"Condorcet\", Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles. Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935\u20131938) and in the USSR (1939).\nOn 12 July 1937 he married Simone Melchior (1919-1990), with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940\u20131979). His sons took part in the adventures of the \"Calypso\". In 1991, after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife.\nDeath or is he still alive?\nOn the morning of 25 June 1997, Jacques-Yves Cousteau died at his home in Paris, aged 87 from a heart attack. Despite rumors, encouraged by some Islamic publications and websites, Cousteau did not convert to Islam, and when he died he was buried in a Roman Catholic Christian funeral. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-Andr\u00E9-de-Cubzac in France. A street was named \"rue du Commandant Cousteau\" in a street which runs near his native house, where a commemorative plaque was affixed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":84},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"naval","offset":91},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":106},{"uri":"Ecologist","surface_form":"ecologist","offset":116},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"filmmaker","offset":127},{"uri":"Innovator","surface_form":"innovator","offset":138},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":149},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":160},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":174},{"uri":"Researcher","surface_form":"researcher","offset":185},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":212},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":233},{"uri":"Aqua-lung","surface_form":"aqua-lung","offset":269},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":287},{"uri":"Marine_conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":294},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise","offset":331},{"uri":"Saint-Andr%C3%A9-de-Cubzac","surface_form":"Saint-Andr\u00E9-de-Cubzac","offset":470},{"uri":"Gironde","surface_form":"Gironde","offset":493},{"uri":"Pierre-Antoine_Cousteau","surface_form":"Pierre-Antoine","offset":556},{"uri":"Coll%C3%A8ge_Stanislas_de_Paris","surface_form":"Coll\u00E8ge Stanislas","offset":590},{"uri":"%C3%89cole_Navale","surface_form":"\u00C9cole Navale","offset":642},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":700},{"uri":"Toulon","surface_form":"Toulon","offset":801},{"uri":"Philippe_Tailliez","surface_form":"Philippe Tailliez","offset":926},{"uri":"Goggle","surface_form":"goggle","offset":988},{"uri":"French_Navy","surface_form":"French Navy","offset":1054},{"uri":"Shanghai","surface_form":"Shanghai","offset":1095},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1108},{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"USSR","offset":1137},{"uri":"Simone_Melchior","surface_form":"Simone Melchior","offset":1177},{"uri":"Jean-Michel_Cousteau","surface_form":"Jean-Michel","offset":1233},{"uri":"Philippe_Cousteau","surface_form":"Philippe","offset":1261},{"uri":"Calypso_(ship)","surface_form":"Calypso","offset":1328},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1382},{"uri":"Francine_Cousteau","surface_form":"Francine Triplet","offset":1401},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1693},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1805},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1848},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":1863},{"uri":"Saint-Andr%C3%A9-de-Cubzac","surface_form":"Saint-Andr\u00E9-de-Cubzac","offset":1919}]}
