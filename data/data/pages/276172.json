{"id":276172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpiment","text":"Orpiment is a mineral. Its chemical formula is As2S3. It is an orange to yellow mineral. It has a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and a specific gravity of 3.46. It melts at 300\u00B0C and oxidizes to arsenic trioxide at higher temperatures. It is toxic because it gets a layer of arsenic trioxide on it by oxidation in the air.\nOrpiment was used as a pigment because it was one of the only yellow pigments that they could find. It is used to remove hair from hides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":14},{"uri":"Arsenic_trisulfide","surface_form":"As2S3","offset":47},{"uri":"Mohs_hardness","surface_form":"Mohs hardness","offset":98},{"uri":"Specific_gravity","surface_form":"specific gravity","offset":130},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidizes","offset":178},{"uri":"Arsenic_trioxide","surface_form":"arsenic trioxide","offset":190},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":341},{"uri":"Hide","surface_form":"hide","offset":449}]}
