Examples are smoke, oceanic haze, air pollution, smog and CS gas. When they say \"aerosol\" most people mean an aerosol spray can or the spray it makes.\nTo differentiate suspensions from true solutions, the term sol evolved\u2014originally meant to cover dispersions of tiny (sub-microscopic) particles in a liquid. With studies of dispersions in air, the term aerosol evolved and now embraces both liquid droplets, solid particles, and combinations of these.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suspension","surface_form":"suspension","offset":16},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":35},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":54},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":75},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoke","offset":93},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":114},{"uri":"Smog","surface_form":"smog","offset":129},{"uri":"Aerosol_spray","surface_form":"aerosol spray","offset":190},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":270},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":420},{"uri":"Drop","surface_form":"drop","offset":479}]}
