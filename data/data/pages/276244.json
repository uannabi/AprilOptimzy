{"id":276244,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Islamic_Jihad","text":"e=\"preserve\">Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), originally called al-Jihad, is an Egyptian terrorist group based on an extreme interpretation of Islam. It has been active since the late 1970s. It is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations as a group linked to al-Qaeda. It is also banned by several governments around the world, including that of the Russian Federation.\nSince 1991 it has been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is now the leader of al-Qaeda. According to Zawahiri, the EIJ was \"different from the Takfir wal Hijra group as we do not consider people infidels because of their sins. And we are different from the Muslim Brotherhood because sometimes they do not oppose the government\".\nThe organization's original main goal was to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state based on the way it thought Islam should be. Later it broadened its aims to include attacking the United States and Israel, and other interests in Egypt and abroad.\nIslamic Jihad was responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. Sadat's Sinai treaty with Israel, which recognized the Jewish state, made them very angry.\nLink with Al Qaeda.\nIn June 2001, Al Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which had been associated with each other for many years, merged into 'Qaeda al-Jihad'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":77},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":86},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":140},{"uri":"Embargo","surface_form":"embargo","offset":210},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":225},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"al-Qaeda","offset":261},{"uri":"Russian_Federation","surface_form":"Russian Federation","offset":352},{"uri":"Ayman_al-Zawahiri","surface_form":"Ayman al-Zawahiri","offset":402},{"uri":"Takfir_wal-Hijra","surface_form":"Takfir wal Hijra","offset":511},{"uri":"Muslim_Brotherhood","surface_form":"Muslim Brotherhood","offset":625},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":912},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":930},{"uri":"Anwar_Sadat","surface_form":"Anwar Sadat","offset":1034},{"uri":"Sinai","surface_form":"Sinai","offset":1063},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":1069},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":1081},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"Al Qaeda","offset":1180}]}
