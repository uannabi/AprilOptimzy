{"id":276303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_chloride","text":"Cadmium chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CdCl2. It has cadmium and chloride ions in it. The cadmium is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nCadmium chloride is a colorless solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is toxic and carcinogenic (causes cancer). It is mostly ionic but a little covalent. It reacts with bases to make cadmium oxide.\nPreparation.\nCadmium chloride is made by reacting cadmium oxide, cadmium, or cadmium carbonate with hydrochloric acid. It can also be made by mixing cadmium and chlorine.\nUses.\nIt is used to make yellow cadmium sulfide, which is used as a pigment. It is also used to make organocadmium compounds. It is also used for electroplating.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":22},{"uri":"Cadmium","surface_form":"cadmium","offset":79},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chloride","offset":91},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":100},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":137},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":241},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":251},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":272},{"uri":"Ionic_bond","surface_form":"ionic","offset":294},{"uri":"Covalent","surface_form":"covalent","offset":313},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":338},{"uri":"Cadmium_oxide","surface_form":"cadmium oxide","offset":352},{"uri":"Hydrochloric_acid","surface_form":"hydrochloric acid","offset":467},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":528},{"uri":"Cadmium_sulfide","surface_form":"cadmium sulfide","offset":570},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":606},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organo","offset":639},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":684}]}
