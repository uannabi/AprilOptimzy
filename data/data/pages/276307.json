{"id":276307,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_sulfate","text":"Cadmium sulfate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CdSO4. It is made of cadmium and sulfate ions. The cadmium is in its +2 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nCadmium sulfate is a white solid. It easily dissolves in water. It is toxic and carcinogenic.\nPreparation.\nCadmium sulfate is made by dissolving cadmium carbonate, cadmium oxide, or cadmium metal in sulfuric acid.\nUses.\nCadmium sulfate is used to electroplate cadmium on electronic circuits. It is also used to make cadmium sulfide, a pigment. It is used as an electrolyte in a certain battery used to make voltmeters accurate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":21},{"uri":"Cadmium","surface_form":"cadmium","offset":85},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":97},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":105},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":136},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":235},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":245},{"uri":"Cadmium_oxide","surface_form":"cadmium oxide","offset":329},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":364},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplate","offset":412},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":436},{"uri":"Cadmium_sulfide","surface_form":"cadmium sulfide","offset":481},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":500},{"uri":"Electrolyte","surface_form":"electrolyte","offset":526},{"uri":"Battery","surface_form":"battery","offset":551},{"uri":"Voltmeter","surface_form":"voltmeter","offset":572}]}
