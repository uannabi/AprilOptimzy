{"id":276356,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_oxide","text":"Cadmium oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CdO. It has cadmium and oxide ions in it.\nProperties.\nCadmium oxide can be a colorless powder, brown powder, or red-brown crystals. All forms dissolve in acid. It is carcinogenic. Breathing the dust is harmful. It is similar in some ways to zinc oxide.\nPreparation.\nCadmium oxide is made by burning cadmium in air or reacting an alkali with any soluble cadmium salt.\nUses.\nCadmium oxide is used in electronics as a transparent conductor. It is also used to make pigments (cadmium sulfide), kill nematodes, make nickel cadmium batteries, and electroplating cadmium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":19},{"uri":"Cadmium","surface_form":"cadmium","offset":74},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":86},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":92},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":184},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":216},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":228},{"uri":"Zinc_oxide","surface_form":"zinc oxide","offset":303},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"alkali","offset":391},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":423},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronics","offset":460},{"uri":"Transparent","surface_form":"transparent","offset":477},{"uri":"Electrical_conductivity","surface_form":"conductor","offset":489},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":524},{"uri":"Cadmium_sulfide","surface_form":"cadmium sulfide","offset":534},{"uri":"Nematode","surface_form":"nematode","offset":557},{"uri":"Nickel_cadmium_battery","surface_form":"nickel cadmium batteries","offset":573},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":603}]}
