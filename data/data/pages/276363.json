{"id":276363,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_iodide","text":"=\"preserve\">Cadmium iodide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CdI2. It has cadmium and iodide ions in it.\nProperties.\nCadmium iodide is a white or pale yellow solid. It is known for its crystal structure. Many other chemical compounds have a cadmium iodide crystal structure. It easily dissolves in water. It is toxic.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting cadmium with iodine. It can also be made by reacting cadmium, or cadmium oxide with hydriodic acid.\nUses.\nCadmium iodide is used to make phosphors (things that light when struck by UV light), photography, and electroplating.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":32},{"uri":"Cadmium","surface_form":"cadmium","offset":88},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":100},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":107},{"uri":"Crystal_structure","surface_form":"crystal structure","offset":199},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":325},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodine","offset":381},{"uri":"Cadmium_oxide","surface_form":"cadmium oxide","offset":433},{"uri":"Hydriodic_acid","surface_form":"hydriodic acid","offset":452},{"uri":"Phosphor","surface_form":"phosphor","offset":505},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":560},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":577}]}
