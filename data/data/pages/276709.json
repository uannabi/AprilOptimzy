{"id":276709,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Andr%C3%A9s_P%C3%A9rez","text":"Carlos Andr\u00E9s P\u00E9rez Rodr\u00EDguez (October 27, 1922 \u2013 December 25, 2010) was a president of Venezuela. He was born in 1922, served twice as president in the early 1990s, and died in 2010.\nBiography.\nP\u00E9rez was born on 27 October 1922 in Rubio, Venezuela. He went to school in Caracas, where he studied law. In 1948, he married Blanca Rodr\u00EDguez, one of his cousins. During the same year, because he opposed a coup d'\u00E9tat, he was put in prison, but got out and left Venezuela. In 1958, Venezuala became a democracy, and P\u00E9rez became a part of the government led by R\u00F3mulo Betancourt.\nIn 1973, P\u00E9rez became president of Venezuala. He left office in 1979, and soon after, Venezuala's economy went through a low period. In 1989, P\u00E9rez became president again. Soon after, he made government spending much smaller and made prices of goods like gasoline higher. There were many riots because of this.\nIn 1992, there were two coups that tried but failed to remove P\u00E9rez from being president. In 1993, though, he was impeached because he was thought to have paid for bodyguards for Violeta Chamorro, who was a former president of Nicaragua. He went to prison after this for ten weeks. After prison he was put in house arrest for two years.\nAfter Hugo Ch\u00E1vez became president of Venezuala in 1998, P\u00E9rez went to the Dominican Republic. In 2003, he moved again, this time to the United States. While he was in the US, people in Venezuala tried to force him to return because he was wanted in connection with the riots his laws caused in 1989. He also married Cecilia Matos during this time.\nHe died on 25 December 2010 in Miami at the age of 88. Mar\u00EDa Francia P\u00E9rez, his daughter, said that he had died of a heart attack.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":88},{"uri":"Caracas","surface_form":"Caracas","offset":271},{"uri":"Blanca_Rodr%C3%ADguez","surface_form":"Blanca Rodr\u00EDguez","offset":322},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":403},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":430},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":498},{"uri":"R%C3%B3mulo_Betancourt","surface_form":"R\u00F3mulo Betancourt","offset":558},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":675},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"gasoline","offset":832},{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"riot","offset":865},{"uri":"Impeachment","surface_form":"impeached","offset":1002},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":1115},{"uri":"House_arrest","surface_form":"house arrest","offset":1197},{"uri":"Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez","surface_form":"Hugo Ch\u00E1vez","offset":1231},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":1300},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1362},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami","offset":1605},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1691}]}
