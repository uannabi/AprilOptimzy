The Duke of Berry was for seven years heir presumptive to the throne of Spain (1700\u20131707) when his brother Philip V of Spain was childless.\nBorn at the Palace of Versailles, Charles was the youngest son of Louis, Dauphin of France, \"le Grand Dauphin\", and of Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria.\nThe Duchess of Orl\u00E9ans proposed he marry her daughter Marie Louise \u00C9lisabeth d'Orl\u00E9ans. All agreed, the marriage with Marie Louise \u00C9lisabeth took place on 6 July 1710. It was an unhappy marriage, and after a miscarriage which ended her first pregnancy, Marie Louise \u00C9lisabeth never gave birth to a child that lived for more than a few days. Once a widow, Madame de Berry became ill-famous for her debauched lifeways. She hid several pregnancies and died at 23 a few weeks after suffering a harrowing clandestine childbirth. Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchess Dowager of Orl\u00E9ans and the grandmother of Berry's wife, nicknamed him \"Berry-Bon C\u0153ur\" (\"Berry Good Heart\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":80},{"uri":"Philip_V_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip V of Spain","offset":208},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Palace of Versailles","offset":253},{"uri":"Louis%2C_Dauphin_of_France_(1661%E2%80%931711)","surface_form":"Louis, Dauphin of France","offset":307},{"uri":"Maria_Anna_Victoria_of_Bavaria","surface_form":"Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria","offset":360},{"uri":"Marie_Louise_%C3%89lisabeth_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Marie Louise \u00C9lisabeth d'Orl\u00E9ans","offset":446},{"uri":"Miscarriage","surface_form":"miscarriage","offset":600},{"uri":"Elisabeth_Charlotte_of_the_Palatinate","surface_form":"Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchess Dowager of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":916}]}
