The current holder of the post is General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, appointed in June 2018.\nFor many years, until after World War II, the title used was Chief of the Imperial General Staff. This was supposed to show that all of the armies of the British Empire were united under one command. As countries gained independence, this was not the case.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":62},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":77},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":210},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":336},{"uri":"Command_(military)","surface_form":"command","offset":373},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":402}]}
