{"id":277017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbering_plan","text":"=\"preserve\">A telephone numbering plan is a system used in telecommunications to give telephone numbers to customers and to route telephone calls in a telephone network. A closed numbering plan imposes a fixed length to numbers, such as in North America (10-digit). An open numbering plan may have telephone numbers that vary in length.\nA dial plan establishes the type of telephone number in a given area. This includes country codes, access codes, area codes and all combinations of digits dialed. For instance, the North American public switched telephone network (PSTN) uses a phone numbers with a 3-digit area code and a 7-digit telephone number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telecommunications","surface_form":"telecommunications","offset":59},{"uri":"Telephone_number","surface_form":"telephone number","offset":86},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":161},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":240},{"uri":"Country_code","surface_form":"country code","offset":421},{"uri":"Area_code","surface_form":"area code","offset":450}]}
