{"id":277073,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christogram_IHS","text":"The Christogram IHS is a monogram symbolizing Jesus Christ.\nFrom Greek it is an abbreviation of the name IH\u03A3\u039F\u03A5\u03A3 (Jesus).\nIn Eastern Orthodox Church the Christogram is composed with letters \"X,\" \"P\", \"I\" and \"X\" arranged into the cross. They are the first letters of one from two words in Greek language: \"Christ\" and \"Jesus Christ\".\nIn the Western culture there exist the compositions: \"IHS\" and also \"IHC\" being the first letters (iota-eta-sigma) of the name Jesus in Greek alphabet: \u0399\u0397\u03A3\u039F\u03A5\u03A3 (\u038A\u03B7\u03C3\u03BF\u1FE6\u03C2 or \u0399\u0397\u03F9\u039F\u03A5\u03F9 with lunated sigma). The abbreviation in form \"IHS'\" appeared in first time on the coins of Justinian II on the turn of the 7th and 8th centuries.\nThese developed inscriptions were most likely formed because in the Middle Ages people mistakenly read the letter E as H.\nAccording to a legend, this inscription with the cross was seen by emperor Constantine the Great in his sleep before the battle against Maxentius in 312 on the Ponte Milvio.\nCommentators unfriendly to the Catholic Church sometimes interpret the abbreviation IHS as derived from the solar idols of the Egyptian mythology: Isis, Horus and Seth. Nevertheless, present scientific knowledge does not confirm such interpretations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monogram","surface_form":"monogram","offset":25},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":46},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":65},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":113},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Church","offset":124},{"uri":"Cross","surface_form":"cross","offset":229},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":469},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"coin","offset":593},{"uri":"Justinian_II","surface_form":"Justinian II","offset":602},{"uri":"7th_century","surface_form":"7th","offset":634},{"uri":"8th_century","surface_form":"8th","offset":642},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":725},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":794},{"uri":"Constantine_the_Great","surface_form":"Constantine the Great","offset":854},{"uri":"Maxentius","surface_form":"Maxentius","offset":915},{"uri":"312","surface_form":"312","offset":928},{"uri":"Ponte_Milvio","surface_form":"Ponte Milvio","offset":939},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":984},{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":1080},{"uri":"Isis","surface_form":"Isis","offset":1100},{"uri":"Horus","surface_form":"Horus","offset":1106},{"uri":"Seth","surface_form":"Seth","offset":1116}]}
