An inflorescence is the reproductive portion of a plant; each plant bears its flowers in a specific pattern.\nSometimes it is just a close bunch of flowers (e.g. \"Antirrhinum\") on a \"spike\". Sometimes the inflorescence is so tight it looks like one single flower. What you see as a single daisy is actually made of several hundred tiny flowers packed together. This kind of inflorescence is called a pseudanthium (\"false flower\").\nAdvantages.\nThe advantages of the inflorescence mode is all about reproduction compared to a single primitive flower of the \"Magnolia\" type.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":86},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":108},{"uri":"Lamiales","surface_form":"Antirrhinum","offset":276},{"uri":"Daisy","surface_form":"daisy","offset":402},{"uri":"Pseudanthium","surface_form":"pseudanthium","offset":513},{"uri":"Magnolia","surface_form":"Magnolia","offset":669}]}
