{"id":27711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations","text":"The League of Nations (French: La Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 des Nations) was the predecessor to the United Nations. The League was founded in 1920, after World War I, but failed to maintain peace during World War II. The League had a Council of the great powers and an Assembly of all the member countries.\nThe League of Nations was thought up by Woodrow Wilson, the American President during the First World War. It was to be a group of nations that worked together to keep peace. One of the reasons for its downfall was that, after a vote, the American public refused to join. The League did not have the power it needed to enforce any of the rules that made it up. This later proved to be a fatal flaw in the League's structure.\nAnother flaw in the League was that it was not representative enough: at any point there were no more than 65 members part of the league and the interests of the superior nations often exceeded those of more limited members.\nThe League also had no troops of its own, and decisions it made were often slow. For example, when the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria (North-East China) in 1931, the League took a whole year to make a decision. When it came, Japan ignored it. When Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935, the League condemned it more quickly but Italy merely quit the League and continued its conquest. After these disasters the League was thought to be weak and powerless and stopped operations in 1939.\nThe League did not fail completely: it had prevented a few conflicts in Europe in the 1920s and worked hard to relieve various public health and social problems around the world.\nIn 1946, the already inactive League of Nations formally ended. The United Nations was established, and still today does many of the same things the League of Nations did.\nUnited States.\nFirst, the United States had many German immigrants who hated the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles blamed Germany and its allies for the war and said they must pay heavy war reparations. To join The League of Nations, a country had to agree and accept the Treaty of Versailles. German American<nowiki/>s did not accept this.\nSecond, Americans did not want to risk more Americans dying in a European war, as they had in World War I. They also felt that it would result in pointless actions such as sending soldiers all around the globe to sort out small disputes. This attitude was called isolationism. Most Americans felt it would be best to avoid European and British affairs completely.\nThird, the granting of women's voting rights in the United States brought a huge new voting block that overwhelmingly desired to turn inward towards 'isolation'.\n1920.\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Former International Organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":23},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":82},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":136},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":185},{"uri":"Great_power","surface_form":"great power","offset":231},{"uri":"Woodrow_Wilson","surface_form":"Woodrow Wilson","offset":329},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Empire of Japan","offset":1042},{"uri":"Manchuria","surface_form":"Manchuria","offset":1066},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1190},{"uri":"Abyssinia","surface_form":"Abyssinia","offset":1204},{"uri":"Public_health","surface_form":"public health","offset":1550},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1670},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Treaty of Versailles","offset":1855},{"uri":"German_American","surface_form":"German American","offset":2081},{"uri":"Women%27s_voting_rights_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"women's voting rights in the United States","offset":2515}]}
