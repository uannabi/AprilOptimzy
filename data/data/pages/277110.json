People overeat to feel better, but they actually feel worse, and go back to overeating for relief, forming a vicious cycle.\nIf binge eating becomes a pattern, this is an eating disorder. People who suffer from this have a high risk of weight gain. They may feel ashamed of their eating habits and become depressed. People who binge and then purge, (usually by vomiting), have a different eating disorder called bulimia. People with anorexia may also binge and purge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eating_disorder","surface_form":"eating disorder","offset":416},{"uri":"Overweight","surface_form":"weight gain","offset":481},{"uri":"Depression_(mood)","surface_form":"depressed","offset":550},{"uri":"Purge","surface_form":"purge","offset":587},{"uri":"Vomit","surface_form":"vomit","offset":606},{"uri":"Bulimia","surface_form":"bulimia","offset":657},{"uri":"Anorexia","surface_form":"anorexia","offset":678}]}
