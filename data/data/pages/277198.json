{"id":277198,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_New_York_(1776)","text":"The Great Fire of New York was a large fire in New York City. It burned through the night of September 21, 1776 on the west side of the former boundaries of New York City at the southern end of the island of Manhattan. It started when the British Army took control of the city during the American Revolutionary War.\nThe fire destroyed 10 to 25% of the city. Some of the unburned parts of the city were ransacked. Many people thought that someone started the fire on purpose, for different reasons. British leaders accused American rebels, who had recently lost the Battle of Long Island, of starting the fire. Most people thought that one side or the other had started it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":39},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":47},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":208},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":239},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":288},{"uri":"Looting","surface_form":"ransacked","offset":402},{"uri":"Arson","surface_form":"started the fire","offset":446},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"American","offset":522},{"uri":"Rebel","surface_form":"rebel","offset":531},{"uri":"Battle_of_Long_Island","surface_form":"Battle of Long Island","offset":565}]}
