{"id":27722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse","text":"As seen from Earth, a solar eclipse /\"ee-klips\"/ happens when the Moon is directly between the Earth and the Sun. This makes the Moon fully or partially (partly) cover the sun. Solar eclipses can only happen during a new moon. Every year there are about two solar eclipses. Sometimes there are even five solar eclipses in a year. However, only two of these can be total solar eclipses, and often a year will pass without a total eclipse.\nThe area in which an eclipse is total is only a narrow track along the Earth. Totality lasts only a few minutes. Outside this path, all eclipses are partial, and places far from the track get no eclipse at all. The track can be predicted many years before it happens. The last total eclipse was the solar eclipse of June 21, 2020. The next will be on 14 Dec 2020.\nA total solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon (event). Long ago, solar eclipses were thought to happen because of something supernatural or as a sign that something bad was going to happen. This is still believed in some cultures today. A total solar eclipse can frighten people who do not know what it means, because the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky turns dark in just a few minutes. Other people like to go to the eclipse path for a good view.\nSolar eclipses happen somewhere on Earth almost every year, and very similar solar eclipses happen every 18 years, 11.3 days. This period is called the Saros cycle.\nTypes.\nThe Sun's distance from the Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as big as the Moon's. This is why the Sun and Moon seem to be about the same size from Earth.\nLooking at a solar eclipse.\nLooking directly at the bright surface of the Sun itself can hurt the retina of the eye greatly because of the radiation that comes from the Sun. It can even blind people. The retina does not feel pain, so damage may not be felt for hours.\nThe Sun is usually so bright that it is hard to look at it directly. However, when the Sun is covered in an eclipse, it is easier to look at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is equally dangerous, except in the very short time when the Sun's surface is completely covered. Looking at the Sun's surface through binoculars, a telescope, or even a camera is extremely dangerous and can damage the eye in less than a second.\nLooking at the Sun without an eclipse does not usually hurt the eye very greatly, because the pupil of the eye closes down and makes everything darker. If the Sun is almost completely covered, the pupil opens because there is not as much light. However, the parts of the Sun that can be seen are still equally bright, and can hurt the eye very much.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":13},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":66},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":109},{"uri":"Phases_of_the_Moon","surface_form":"new moon","offset":217},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":837},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"supernatural","offset":926},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1023},{"uri":"Fear","surface_form":"frighten","offset":1065},{"uri":"Saros_cycle","surface_form":"Saros cycle","offset":1421},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":1529},{"uri":"Retina","surface_form":"retina","offset":1749},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":1790},{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blind","offset":1837},{"uri":"Binocular","surface_form":"binocular","offset":2236},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":2250},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":2271},{"uri":"Pupil_(eye)","surface_form":"pupil","offset":2441}]}
