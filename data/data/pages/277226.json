{"id":277226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talc","text":"Talc (from the Arabic \"talk\") is a silicate mineral, a type of clay. It is the standard for grade 1 in the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. A fingernail can easily scratch it. Talc is composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. Talc and pyrophyllite are very similar, but pyrophyllite may be slightly harder.\nTalc has a greasy feel and a translucent, soapy look. In loose form, it is the widely-used substance known as talcum powder. Steatite, also called soapstone, is a rock with a lot of talc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":15},{"uri":"Silicate_mineral","surface_form":"silicate mineral","offset":35},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":63},{"uri":"Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","surface_form":"Mohs scale of mineral hardness","offset":107},{"uri":"Magnesium","surface_form":"magnesium","offset":204},{"uri":"Silicate","surface_form":"silicate","offset":214},{"uri":"Pyrophyllite","surface_form":"pyrophyllite","offset":274},{"uri":"Steatite","surface_form":"Steatite","offset":471},{"uri":"Soapstone","surface_form":"soapstone","offset":493}]}
