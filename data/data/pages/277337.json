{"id":277337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charophyceae","text":"The Charophyceae are the green algae closest to plants.\nTheir exact rank is the matter of some debate. Some botanists recommend expanding the existing plant kingdom to include charophyceans and chlorophytes.\nOthers classify Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta, with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division. There are also other possibilities.\nThe consensus among botanists is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants (embryophytes).\nMany of the complex plant traits related to sexual reproduction evolved first in charophyceans. Analysis of cpDNA (chloroplast DNA) shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts also evolved first in the charophyceans, before the Zygnematales diverged from the lineage that lead to Coleochaetales, Charales, and the land plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Green_algae","surface_form":"green algae","offset":25},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botanists","offset":108},{"uri":"Plantae","surface_form":"plant kingdom","offset":151},{"uri":"Chlorophyta","surface_form":"chlorophytes","offset":194},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":379},{"uri":"Plants","surface_form":"plants","offset":458},{"uri":"Embryophyta","surface_form":"embryophytes","offset":466},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"traits","offset":507},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"sexual reproduction","offset":525},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplast","offset":596},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":608},{"uri":"Zygnematales","surface_form":"Zygnematales","offset":714},{"uri":"Coleochaetales","surface_form":"Coleochaetales","offset":766},{"uri":"Charales","surface_form":"Charales","offset":782}]}
