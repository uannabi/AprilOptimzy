{"id":277382,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viridiplantae","text":"Viridiplantae ('green plants') are the clade which includes the green algae and land plants.\nIn some classification systems they have been called Plantae, by expanding the traditional plant kingdom (Embryophytes) to include the green algae.\nAdl and colleagues, who produced a classification for eukaryotes in 2005, used the name Chloroplastida for this group, reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll. They rejected the name Viridiplantae on the grounds that most of the species are not plants, as understood traditionally.\nThere are more than 350,000 species of Viridiplantae.\nGroup structure.\n'Green algae' is not used here because they are definitely not monophyletic. It is just a convenience term for Chlorophyta and Charophyta together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":39},{"uri":"Green_alga","surface_form":"green alga","offset":64},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":85},{"uri":"Embryophyte","surface_form":"Embryophyte","offset":199},{"uri":"Green_algae","surface_form":"green algae","offset":228},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":295},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplast","offset":396},{"uri":"Chlorophyll","surface_form":"chlorophyll","offset":420},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":689}]}
