{"id":277441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rnstjerne_Bj%C3%B8rnson","text":"Bj\u00F8rnstjerne Martinius Bj\u00F8rnson (born 8 December 1832 in Kvikne, Norway - died 26 April 1910 in Paris, France) was a Norwegian playwright, author and poet who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1903.\nHis father was a Lutheran minister, but Bj\u00F8rnson rejected organized religion. He married Karoline Reimers, a famous stage actress, and their son Bj\u00F8rn also had great success as a stage actor, and appeared in a few early silent films. Their daughter, Bergljot, married Henrik Ibsen's son Sigurd.\nHe attended grammar school, Heltbergs Studentfabrikk in Oslo, with Henrik Ibsen, but dropped out of a course at the University of Oslo. By his early twenties he was writing literature reviews for the Norwegian newspaper, Morgenbladet. At 25 he wrote his first produced play, \"Mellem Slagene\" (Between the Battles). His \"Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg\" was a statement for political tolerance, and \"P\u00E5 Guds veie\" (\"In God's Way\") for religious tolerance. He is best known internationally for his tales of peasant life in Norway. His novel, \"Synn\u00F6ve Solbakken\", has been filmed three times. Bj\u00F8rnson also worked as a stage director, and later served as editor of another paper, Aftenbladet, where he wrote fiery liberal editorials and passionately defended Alfred Dreyfus. His poem, \"Yes, We Love This Land\", is the Norwegian national anthem.\nThe cause of his death is unknown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["writer &lt;!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kvikne%2C_Norway","surface_form":"Kvikne, Norway","offset":57},{"uri":"Paris%2C_France","surface_form":"Paris, France","offset":96},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":117},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":127},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":139},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":167},{"uri":"Lutheran","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":219},{"uri":"Henrik_Ibsen","surface_form":"Henrik Ibsen","offset":470},{"uri":"Oslo","surface_form":"Oslo","offset":553},{"uri":"Alfred_Dreyfus","surface_form":"Alfred Dreyfus","offset":1249},{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":1318}]}
