{"id":277473,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudstone","text":"A mudstone is a siliciclastic sedimentary rock which has a mixture of silt- and clay-sized particles (at least 1/3 of each). So, a mudstone is a type of mudrock with a more varied grain size than either siltstones or claystones.\nAlternatively, some sources say it is a synonym for mudrock.\nClaystone.\nA claystone is a mudrock which does not split easily.\nIn order for a rock to be a claystone, it must be up to half (50%) clay, whose particles measure less than 1/256th of a millimeter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"siliciclastic","offset":16},{"uri":"Sedimentary_rock","surface_form":"sedimentary rock","offset":30},{"uri":"Silt","surface_form":"silt","offset":70},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":80},{"uri":"Mudrock","surface_form":"mudrock","offset":153},{"uri":"Siltstone","surface_form":"siltstone","offset":203},{"uri":"Claystone","surface_form":"claystone","offset":217},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":269},{"uri":"Mudrock","surface_form":"mudrock","offset":281},{"uri":"Mudrock","surface_form":"mudrock","offset":318},{"uri":"Millimeter","surface_form":"millimeter","offset":475}]}
