{"id":277689,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reassignment_surgery","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sexual reassignment surgery (SRS) is also called gender reassignment surgery, sex reassignment surgery or a sex change. SRS is one or more surgeries that are done to change the body's genitals or other sexual characteristrics. Transgender people may get SRS to make their body match their gender identity.\nThere are many different kinds of surgeries that fall under the category of \"sexual reassignment surgery.\"\nTransgender people may get one of these surgeries, a combination, or no surgeries at all. Every person is different.\nSome international laws on human rights cover SRS. For example, the Declaration of Montreal and the Yogyakarta Principles say that transgender people must be allowed SRS. These laws say that if health insurance companies did not cover SRS, they would be discriminating against transgender people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgeries","offset":152},{"uri":"Genitals","surface_form":"genitals","offset":197},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"Transgender","offset":240},{"uri":"Gender_identity","surface_form":"gender identity","offset":302},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":548},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":570},{"uri":"Declaration_of_Montreal","surface_form":"Declaration of Montreal","offset":611},{"uri":"Yogyakarta_Principles","surface_form":"Yogyakarta Principles","offset":643},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discriminating","offset":797}]}
