He had held this position since 1981. In the 1960's he won the first Johor Grand Prix. In 1977 he shot and killed a man he thought was a smuggler. Iskandar was going to go to prison for six months, but his father gave him a royal pardon. He also caused trouble in 1993, when he assaulted a hockey coach who had not followed his son's instructions. This led to a change in Malayasian law that means in future, sultans would have to obey the laws.\nTengku Mahkota of Johor Tunku Ibrahim Ismail, his eldest son, was appointed to be the new sultan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sultan","surface_form":"sultan","offset":87}]}
