{"id":277950,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Barnum","text":"Phineas Taylor Barnum (July 5, 1810 \u2013 April 7, 1891) was an American showman, businessman, and entertainer. He started his career in New York City by showing off a slave he owned named Joice Heth. He told people that Joice was 161 years old and removed her teeth to make her look older. It was a lie, but it made him famous at a young age, and he even showed off her dead body in a public autopsy.\nIn New York City, he founded two American Museums where he offered legitimate acts such as General Tom Thumb and hoaxes such as the Fiji mermaid. He introduced Jenny Lind to the American public. After fire destroyed his second museum, Barnum founded a circus. It was here that he displayed Jumbo the elephant. He suggested the circus setting for Horatio Alger, Jr.'s boys book \"The Young Acrobat\". Barnum is also widely known for saying \"There's a sucker born every minute.\"\nHe may have been the first \"show business\" millionaire. Barnum said \"I am a showman by profession,\" but he was also an author, publisher, and for a while a politician.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Businessman","surface_form":"businessman","offset":78},{"uri":"Entertainer","surface_form":"entertainer","offset":95},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":133},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":164},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":257},{"uri":"Autopsy","surface_form":"autopsy","offset":389},{"uri":"American_Museum","surface_form":"American Museum","offset":431},{"uri":"General_Tom_Thumb","surface_form":"General Tom Thumb","offset":489},{"uri":"Hoax","surface_form":"hoax","offset":511},{"uri":"Fiji_mermaid","surface_form":"Fiji mermaid","offset":530},{"uri":"Jenny_Lind","surface_form":"Jenny Lind","offset":558},{"uri":"Circus","surface_form":"circus","offset":650},{"uri":"Jumbo","surface_form":"Jumbo","offset":688},{"uri":"Horatio_Alger%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Horatio Alger, Jr.","offset":744},{"uri":"The_Young_Acrobat","surface_form":"The Young Acrobat","offset":776},{"uri":"Millionaire","surface_form":"millionaire","offset":916},{"uri":"Profession","surface_form":"profession","offset":960},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":992},{"uri":"Publisher","surface_form":"publisher","offset":1000},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":1029}]}
