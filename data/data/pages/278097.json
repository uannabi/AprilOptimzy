{"id":278097,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 2001 Anthrax attacks were a series of incidents in the United States. The attacks began on September 18, 2001 and lasted for several weeks. Anthrax was spread through the mail. The anthrax spores were put in envelopes and sent to several news media offices and two U.S. senate offices.\n22 people were infected. Five people died. It was believed that the person who was responsible for this was Dr. Bruce Edward Ivins. He was a senior biodefense researcher who was employed by the U.S. government. Ivins killed himself in 2008. He was not prosecuted the crime but the evidence suggests that he acted alone in mailing the envelopes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":72},{"uri":"Anthrax_(disease)","surface_form":"Anthrax","offset":157},{"uri":"United_States_Postal_Service","surface_form":"mail","offset":188},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":206},{"uri":"Envelope","surface_form":"envelope","offset":225},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news","offset":255},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"U.S. senate","offset":282},{"uri":"Bruce_Edward__Ivins","surface_form":"Bruce Edward Ivins","offset":415},{"uri":"Biodefense","surface_form":"biodefense","offset":451},{"uri":"United_States_government","surface_form":"U.S. government","offset":497},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"killed himself","offset":520},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":570}]}
