{"id":278487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton","text":"Diane Keaton (born Diane Hall, January 5, 1946) is an American movie actress, director, producer, and screenwriter.\nEarly life.\nKeaton was born on January 5, 1946 in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Dorothy Deanne (n\u00E9e Keaton; 1921\u20132008), was a homemaker and amateur photographer; her father, John Newton Ignatius \"Jack\" Hall (1921\u20131990), was a real estate broker and civil engineer. Her father, from Nebraska, came from an Irish-American Catholic background, and her mother, originally from Kansas, came from a Methodist family, and had English, German, and more distant Austrian, ancestry. Keaton was raised a Free Methodist by her mother. Her mother won the \"Mrs. Los Angeles\" pageant for homemakers; Keaton has said that the theatricality of the event inspired her first impulse to be an actress, and led to her wanting to work on stage. She has also credited Katharine Hepburn, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.\nPersonal life.\nKeaton had bulimia nervosa in the early 1970s. She has never married. She has two adopted children: a daughter Dexter Keaton (born 1995) and a son Duke Keaton (born 2000).\nShe starred in \"Annie Hall\", \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\", \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\", \"Marvin's Room\", \"The First Wives Club\" and \"Something's Gotta Give\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":54},{"uri":"Homemaker","surface_form":"homemaker","offset":249},{"uri":"Civil_engineer","surface_form":"civil engineer","offset":372},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":405},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":496},{"uri":"Methodism","surface_form":"Methodist","offset":516},{"uri":"Katharine_Hepburn","surface_form":"Katharine Hepburn","offset":868},{"uri":"Bulimia_nervosa","surface_form":"bulimia nervosa","offset":1000},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adopted","offset":1071},{"uri":"Annie_Hall","surface_form":"Annie Hall","offset":1177},{"uri":"Looking_for_Mr._Goodbar_(movie)","surface_form":"Looking for Mr. Goodbar","offset":1191},{"uri":"Manhattan_Murder_Mystery","surface_form":"Manhattan Murder Mystery","offset":1218},{"uri":"Marvin%27s_Room","surface_form":"Marvin's Room","offset":1246},{"uri":"The_First_Wives_Club","surface_form":"The First Wives Club","offset":1263},{"uri":"Something%27s_Gotta_Give_(movie)","surface_form":"Something's Gotta Give","offset":1290}]}
