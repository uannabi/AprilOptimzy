{"id":278529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati","text":"e=\"preserve\">Maserati is an Italian luxury car making company. It began working with the company known as Ferrari, but recently changed to a group that includes Alfa Romeo. The Maserati brothers were named Alfieri, Bindo, Carlo, Ettore, and Ernesto. Alfieri initially raced with cars from a company called Diatto, but in 1926 when they stopped being produced, Alfieri and his brothers created a company called Maserati. One of the first cars that they made (driven by Alfieri) won the 1926 Targa Florio. Alfieri died in 1932, but the three other brothers continued making the cars. Their trident logo was probably created by an artist named Mario.\nMaserati also ran a Formula One racing team between 1950 and 1957, employing numerous drivers, including the five-time drivers' champion Juan Manuel Fangio.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Luxury_car","surface_form":"luxury car","offset":36},{"uri":"Ferrari","surface_form":"Ferrari","offset":106},{"uri":"Alfa_Romeo","surface_form":"Alfa Romeo","offset":161},{"uri":"Alfieri_Maserati","surface_form":"Alfieri","offset":206},{"uri":"Bindo_Maserati","surface_form":"Bindo","offset":215},{"uri":"Carlo_Maserati","surface_form":"Carlo","offset":222},{"uri":"Ettore_Maserati","surface_form":"Ettore","offset":229},{"uri":"Ernesto_Maserati","surface_form":"Ernesto","offset":241},{"uri":"Diatto","surface_form":"Diatto","offset":306},{"uri":"Targa_Florio","surface_form":"Targa Florio","offset":490},{"uri":"Logo","surface_form":"logo","offset":596},{"uri":"Juan_Manuel_Fangio","surface_form":"Juan Manuel Fangio","offset":785}]}
