{"id":278538,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials","text":"e=\"preserve\">Millennials (also known as Generation Y) are typically defined as the generation of people born between 1981 to 1996. Generation Y is preceded by Generation X and is succeeded by Generation Z.\nPeople in this generation are sometimes called Echo Boomers because of the high birth rate during this period. The high birth rate almost matches that of the Baby Boom period after World War II.\nSome of the famous celebrities who are from Generation Y include Harry Styles, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Kate Bosworth, Justin Bieber, Mandy Moore, Miley Cyrus, Mara Wilson, Colbie Caillat, and Avril Lavigne.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Generation_X","surface_form":"Generation X","offset":159},{"uri":"Generation_Z","surface_form":"Generation Z","offset":192},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":221},{"uri":"Birth","surface_form":"birth","offset":286},{"uri":"Rate","surface_form":"rate","offset":292},{"uri":"Baby_boomer","surface_form":"Baby Boom","offset":364},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":387},{"uri":"Harry_Styles","surface_form":"Harry Styles","offset":466},{"uri":"Katy_Perry","surface_form":"Katy Perry","offset":480},{"uri":"Lady_Gaga","surface_form":"Lady Gaga","offset":492},{"uri":"Kate_Bosworth","surface_form":"Kate Bosworth","offset":503},{"uri":"Justin_Bieber","surface_form":"Justin Bieber","offset":518},{"uri":"Mandy_Moore","surface_form":"Mandy Moore","offset":533},{"uri":"Miley_Cyrus","surface_form":"Miley Cyrus","offset":546},{"uri":"Mara_Wilson","surface_form":"Mara Wilson","offset":559},{"uri":"Colbie_Caillat","surface_form":"Colbie Caillat","offset":572},{"uri":"Avril_Lavigne","surface_form":"Avril Lavigne","offset":592}]}
