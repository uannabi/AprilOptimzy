He was married to Penelope. Odysseus and Penelope had a son called Telemachos. Odysseus is a major character in Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\".\nOdysseus fought in the Trojan War. He invented the Trojan Horse, which helped the Greeks win the war. After the war, his adventurous journey home took 10 years. The story of that journey is told in the \"Odyssey\". Odysseus angered Poseidon, the god of seas, when he half blinded his cyclops son Polyphemos. In anger, Poseidon stopped him from leaving the island. The Latin name for Odysseus is \"Ulysses\".\nThere have been many movies about Odysseus, because of his heroic and intelligent battle strategies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":3},{"uri":"Hermes","surface_form":"Hermes","offset":69},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":88},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":100},{"uri":"Ithaca","surface_form":"Ithaca","offset":107},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":122},{"uri":"Penelope","surface_form":"Penelope","offset":133},{"uri":"Telemachos","surface_form":"Telemachos","offset":182},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":227},{"uri":"Iliad","surface_form":"Iliad","offset":236},{"uri":"Odyssey","surface_form":"Odyssey","offset":248},{"uri":"Trojan_War","surface_form":"Trojan War","offset":281},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invented","offset":296},{"uri":"Trojan_Horse","surface_form":"Trojan Horse","offset":309},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greeks","offset":340},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":355},{"uri":"Adventure","surface_form":"adventurous","offset":379},{"uri":"Journey","surface_form":"journey","offset":437},{"uri":"Poseidon","surface_form":"Poseidon","offset":488},{"uri":"Cyclops","surface_form":"cyclops","offset":540},{"uri":"Polyphemos","surface_form":"Polyphemos","offset":552},{"uri":"Poseidon","surface_form":"Poseidon","offset":574},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":624}]}
