The infection is candidiasis, better known as \"thrush\". It is treated with antimycotics (anti-fungal drugs).\n\"C. albicans\" biofilms readily form on the surface of medical devices. Hospital-related infections in patients are a major health concern.\n\"C. albicans\" is among the gut flora, the many organisms that live in the human mouth and gastrointestinal tract. Under normal circumstances, it lives in 80% of the human population with no harmful effects, although overgrowth results in candidiasis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":24},{"uri":"Oral","surface_form":"oral","offset":43},{"uri":"Genital","surface_form":"genital","offset":52},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":60},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":74},{"uri":"Candidiasis","surface_form":"candidiasis","offset":99},{"uri":"Gut_flora","surface_form":"gut flora","offset":357},{"uri":"Gastrointestinal_tract","surface_form":"gastrointestinal tract","offset":420},{"uri":"Candidiasis","surface_form":"candidiasis","offset":568}]}
