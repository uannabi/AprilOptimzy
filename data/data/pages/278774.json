{"id":278774,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle","text":"The Calvin cycle (also known as the Benson-Calvin cycle) is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis.\nThe cycle is light-independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight.\nThe Calvin cycle is named after Melvin C. Calvin, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for finding it in 1961. Calvin and his colleagues, Andrew Benson and James Bassham, did the work at the University of California, Berkeley.\nContext.\nUsing the radioactive carbon-14 isotope as a tracer, Calvin, Andrew Benson and their team mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis. They traced the carbon-14 from soaking up its atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds. The single-celled algae \"Chlorulla\" was used to trace the carbon-14.\nThe Calvin group showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds, not directly on carbon dioxide as previously believed.\nSteps.\n1. Grab: A five-carbon carbon catcher called RuBP (Ribulose bisphosphate) catches one molecule of carbon dioxide and forms a six-carbon molecule.\n2. Split: the enzyme RuBisCO (with the energy of ATP and NADPH molecules) breaks the six-carbon molecule into two equal parts.\n3. Leave: A trio of carbons leave and become sugar. The other trio moves on to the next step.\n4. Switch: Using ATP and NADPH, the three carbon molecule is changed into a five carbon molecule.\n5. The cycle starts over again.\nThe product.\nThe carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or 'glucose triose phosphates' (G3P). Each step of the cycle has its own enzyme which speeds up the reaction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":71},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplast","offset":109},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":129},{"uri":"Light-independent_reaction","surface_form":"light-independent","offset":158},{"uri":"Sunlight","surface_form":"sunlight","offset":239},{"uri":"Melvin_Calvin","surface_form":"Melvin C.
