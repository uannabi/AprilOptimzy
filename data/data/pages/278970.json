{"id":278970,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_eye","text":"Compound eyes consist of many photoreceptor units or ommatidia. Each 'ommatidium' (singular) is an individual 'eye unit'.\nThe image perceived is a combination of inputs from ommatidia on a convex surface. Thus they point in slightly different directions.\nCompared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a wide-angle view. They can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light.\nThe general picture.\nEyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.\nAlmost all insects and arachnids use both simple and compound eyes.\nTypes of compound eye.\nCompound eyes fall into two groups: apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, and superposition eyes, which form a single erect image. Compound eyes are common in arthropods, and are also present in annelids and some bivalved molluscs.\nCompound eyes, in arthropods at least, grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia.\nGood fliers.\nGood fliers like flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies, have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a foveal area which gives acute vision. In the acute zone the eyes are flattened and the facets larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution.\nOther types.\nAnother version is the pseudofaceted eye, as seen in Scutigera. This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ocelli on each side of the head, organized in a way that resembles a true compound eye.\nThe body of \"Ophiocoma wendtii\", a type of brittle star, is covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye. The same is true of many chitons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":126},{"uri":"Perception","surface_form":"perceived","offset":132},{"uri":"Convex","surface_form":"convex","offset":189},{"uri":"Polarization","surface_form":"polarization","offset":377},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":506},{"uri":"Molluscs","surface_form":"molluscs","offset":591},{"uri":"Chordate","surface_form":"chordate","offset":601},{"uri":"Arthropods","surface_form":"arthropods","offset":615},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":638},{"uri":"Arachnid","surface_form":"arachnid","offset":650},{"uri":"Praying_mantis","surface_form":"praying mantis","offset":1142},{"uri":"Dragonfly","surface_form":"dragonflies","offset":1160},{"uri":"Fovea","surface_form":"fovea","offset":1226},{"uri":"Scutigera","surface_form":"Scutigera","offset":1493},{"uri":"Eye_spots","surface_form":"ocelli","offset":1555},{"uri":"Brittle_star","surface_form":"brittle star","offset":1686},{"uri":"Chiton","surface_form":"chiton","offset":1796}]}
