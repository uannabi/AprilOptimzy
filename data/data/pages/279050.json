It was discovered by Frederik Ruysch and later by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813. It is also called the vomeronasal organ or VNO.\nThis body part is mainly used to detect pheromones, chemicals that carry information between individuals of the same species. So, sometimes it is called the \"sixth sense.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":97},{"uri":"Frederik_Ruysch","surface_form":"Frederik Ruysch","offset":127},{"uri":"Ludwig_Jacobson","surface_form":"Ludwig Jacobson","offset":156},{"uri":"Pheromone","surface_form":"pheromone","offset":269}]}
