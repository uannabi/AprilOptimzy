{"id":279131,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivenza","text":"=\"preserve\">Oliven\u00E7a (Spanish: Olivenza) is a territory disputed by Portugal and Spain. The territory was under Portuguese rule between 1297 (Treaty of Alca\u00F1ices) and 1801. Then, it was occupied and ruled by Spain. After the Napoleonic Wars, Spain promised to give Oliven\u00E7a back to Portugal. It still has not done this to this day.\nPortugal does not recognize the Spanish rule of the Oliven\u00E7a/Olivenza territory. Therefore, the border between Portugal and Spain in the Oliven\u00E7a/Olivenza region has never been defined.\nOliven\u00E7a/Olivenza territory is 750 Km2 in area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":46},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":68},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":81},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Alca%C3%B1ices","surface_form":"Treaty of Alca\u00F1ices","offset":142}]}
