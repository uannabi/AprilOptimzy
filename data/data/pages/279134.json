{"id":279134,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey","text":"Lampreys are jawless fish, whose adults are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like, sucking mouth. Lampreys belong to the order Petromyzontiformes. They live in coastal and fresh waters, and are found in temperate regions around the world.\nDescription.\nLampreys are eel-like, scaleless animals. They range from about 15 to 100 centimetres (6 to 40 inches) long. They have well-developed eyes, one or two dorsal fins, a tail fin, a single nostril on top of the head, and seven gill openings on each side of the body. Like the hagfish, they lack bones, jaws, and paired fins. The skeleton of a lamprey consists of cartilage; the mouth is a round, sucking hole with horny teeth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":21},{"uri":"Eel","surface_form":"eel","offset":267},{"uri":"Hagfish","surface_form":"hagfish","offset":526}]}
