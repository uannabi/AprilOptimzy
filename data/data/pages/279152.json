The title is a gift of the monarch, unlike Prince of Wales which is always given to the eldest son\nThere can only be one Princess Royal at a time, so Elizabeth II never held the title because her aunt, Princess Mary was already called Princess Royal.\nList of Princesses Royal.\nPrincess Louisa Maria (1692\u20131712), the last daughter of King James II (d. 1701), was born after he lost his crown in the Glorious Revolution. She was given the title of \"Princess Royal\" during James's exile at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was so called by Jacobites, even though she was never even James's eldest living daughter.\nEldest daughters of English sovereigns.\nBefore Charles II in 1660 started using the title of Princess Royal, the eldest daughters of the King of England had a special status.
