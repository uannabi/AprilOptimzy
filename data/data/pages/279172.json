{"id":279172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Babchuk","text":"Anton Anatoliiovych Babchuk (; born May 6, 1984) is a Ukrainian-Russian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nOriginally from Kiev, Ukraine, Babchuk began playing hockey at the age of three. He began his training with the Sokil Kyiv junior hockey affiliate, a team which included fellow future Ukrainian NHLer Nikolai Zherdev. While participating in an overseas peewee tournament in Quebec, Canada, Babchuk's team found itself competing against a team from Elektrostal, Russia. The rival team's coach, Ravil Iskakhov, took note of both Babchuk and Zherdev, and invited the pair to further their development with the Elemash Elektrostal hockey club of the Russian Major League, to which they accepted together.\nHe was drafted into the National Hockey League (NHL) 21st overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2002 Entry Draft. Babchuk made his North American debut with the Blackhawks affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), in the 2003\u201304 season. Babchuk also made his NHL debut by seasons end, appearing in five games with the Blackhawks.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Babchuk was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for Danny Richmond on January 20, 2006. Babchuk scored his first goal for the Hurricanes on January 28, 2006. He was also named second star of the game. Babchuk played in 22 games with the Hurricanes for the season and was a part of the extended squad of the Hurricanes as they became the Stanley Cup Champions.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, on February 6, 2007, the Hurricanes activated Franti\u0161ek Kaberle from injury, forcing them to send Babchuk down to the Albany River Rats. Babchuk was the only possible defenceman they could send down because he was the only one on the Hurricanes' roster that was not subject to waiver wire claims. The next day, Carolina announced that they had suspended Babchuk because of his refusal to report to Albany. In 2007\u201308, Babchuk played in the Russian Superleague (RSL) for Avangard Omsk.\nOn July 1, 2008, Babchuk re-signed with the Hurricanes to a one-year contract for the 2008\u201309 season. He led all Hurricanes' defensemen with 16 goals in 72 games. Following a contract dispute that lead to him requesting a trade out of Carolina, Babchuk turned back to Russia on 19 September 2009, re-signing with Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club Avangard Omsk. During the very first training day in Omsk, he broke the ice rink glass with a shot at Arena Omsk.\nBabchuk was chosen to play on Team Yashin at the 2nd Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game.\nOn July 1, 2010, Babchuk again re-signed with the Carolina Hurricanes to a one-year contract for the 2010-2011 season. This contract was worth 1.4 million US dollars.\nOn November 17, 2010, Babchuk was traded along with Tom Kostopoulos to the Calgary Flames for Ian White and Brett Sutter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ukrainians_in_Russia","surface_form":"Ukrainian-Russian","offset":54},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":85},{"uri":"Defenceman_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"defenceman","offset":96},{"uri":"Calgary_Flames","surface_form":"Calgary Flames","offset":129},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":151},{"uri":"Kiev","surface_form":"Kiev","offset":213},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":219},{"uri":"Sokil_Kyiv","surface_form":"Sokil Kyiv","offset":309},{"uri":"Nikolai_Zherdev","surface_form":"Nikolai Zherdev","offset":397},{"uri":"Peewee","surface_form":"peewee","offset":449},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":470},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":478},{"uri":"Elektrostal","surface_form":"Elektrostal","offset":544},{"uri":"Russian_Major_League","surface_form":"Russian Major League","offset":742},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":821},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":870},{"uri":"2002_NHL_Entry_Draft","surface_form":"2002 Entry Draft","offset":896},{"uri":"Norfolk_Admirals","surface_form":"Norfolk Admirals","offset":987},{"uri":"American_Hockey_League","surface_form":"American Hockey League","offset":1011},{"uri":"2003%E2%80%9304_NHL_season","surface_form":"2003\u201304","offset":1048},{"uri":"2005%E2%80%9306_NHL_season","surface_form":"2005\u201306","offset":1164},{"uri":"Carolina_Hurricanes","surface_form":"Carolina Hurricanes","offset":1206},{"uri":"Danny_Richmond","surface_form":"Danny Richmond","offset":1230},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":1515},{"uri":"2006%E2%80%9307_NHL_season","surface_form":"2006\u201307","offset":1545},{"uri":"Franti%C5%A1ek_Kaberle","surface_form":"Franti\u0161ek Kaberle","offset":1607},{"uri":"Albany_River_Rats","surface_form":"Albany River Rats","offset":1679},{"uri":"Russian_Superleague","surface_form":"Russian Superleague","offset":2001},{"uri":"Avangard_Omsk","surface_form":"Avangard Omsk","offset":2031},{"uri":"2008%E2%80%9309_NHL_season","surface_form":"2008\u201309","offset":2132},{"uri":"Kontinental_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Kontinental Hockey League","offset":2359},{"uri":"Avangard_Omsk","surface_form":"Avangard Omsk","offset":2396},{"uri":"Omsk","surface_form":"Omsk","offset":2449},{"uri":"2nd_Kontinental_Hockey_League_All-Star_Game","surface_form":"2nd Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game","offset":2559},{"uri":"Tom_Kostopoulos","surface_form":"Tom Kostopoulos","offset":2823},{"uri":"Ian_White_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"Ian White","offset":2865},{"uri":"Brett_Sutter","surface_form":"Brett Sutter","offset":2879}]}
