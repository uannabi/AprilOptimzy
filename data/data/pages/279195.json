{"id":279195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Suburban","text":"Chevrolet Suburban is a fully sized SUV from Chevrolet. This vehicle was first produced around 1935, longer than any other car still being made. It was first made as a station wagon, and was later made as an SUV. Up until the eleventh generation, the Chevrolet Suburban was based on the Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck. For a number of years, the Suburban was the largest SUV made in America. There was also a GMC Suburban, although GMC's version was later rebranded the GMC Yukon XL in 2000. From 1998 to 2001 a right-hand drive version was made in Mexico and sold in Australia and New Zealand by Holden using the Suburban name, but was not a best seller and was withdrawn afterwards.\nSince its inception, there has been twelve generations of Suburbans, the latest introduced in September 2013 and went on sale in February 2014 as a 2015 model. It also became the first vehicle to no longer share the same design as the Silverado.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":45},{"uri":"Station_wagon","surface_form":"station wagon","offset":168},{"uri":"SUV","surface_form":"SUV","offset":208},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Silverado","surface_form":"Chevrolet Silverado","offset":287}]}
