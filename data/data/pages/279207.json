{"id":279207,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa","text":"Quinoa (\"Chenopodium quinoa\"; (or, from Quechua ' or ') is a species of goosefoot (\"Chenopodium\"). It is a grain-like crop grown primarily for its edible seeds.\nQuinoa is not a real cereal, or grain, but more of a vegetable, as it is not a member of the grass family. As a chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beets, spinach, and tumbleweeds. Its leaves are also eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth. Quinoa greens are not widely available for purchase. Quinoa gives high quality protein and other nutrients. It has been called a 'superfood'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quechuan_languages","surface_form":"Quechua","offset":40},{"uri":"Goosefoot","surface_form":"goosefoot","offset":72},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":107},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":182},{"uri":"Poaceae","surface_form":"grass family","offset":254},{"uri":"Chenopodioieae","surface_form":"chenopod","offset":273},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":312},{"uri":"Beet","surface_form":"beet","offset":328},{"uri":"Spinach","surface_form":"spinach","offset":335},{"uri":"Tumbleweed","surface_form":"tumbleweed","offset":348},{"uri":"Amaranth","surface_form":"amaranth","offset":418},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":507},{"uri":"Nutrients","surface_form":"nutrients","offset":525}]}
