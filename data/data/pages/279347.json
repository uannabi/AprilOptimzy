The difference between station wagons and regular sedans is that the station wagon has no trunk, plus the roofs are extended backwards over a shared passenger or cargo volume with access in the back.\nStation wagons have been mostly replaced by minivans/MPVs, SUVs, and crossovers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Right","surface_form":"A Ford Country Squire station wagon","offset":54},{"uri":"Right","surface_form":"A 1989 Pontiac Safari station wagon","offset":127},{"uri":"Sedan_(automobile)","surface_form":"sedan","offset":209},{"uri":"Minivan","surface_form":"minivan","offset":460},{"uri":"SUVs","surface_form":"SUVs","offset":475},{"uri":"Crossover","surface_form":"crossover","offset":485}]}
