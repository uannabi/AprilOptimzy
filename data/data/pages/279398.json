He died in c. 1520 and was buried in a monastery in Santar\u00E9m, Portugal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belmonte","surface_form":"Belmonte","offset":38},{"uri":"Santar%C3%A9m","surface_form":"Santar\u00E9m","offset":57},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":73},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigator","offset":94},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":108},{"uri":"Vasco_da_Gama","surface_form":"Vasco da Gama","offset":312},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":362},{"uri":"Pau-brasil","surface_form":"pau-brasil","offset":587},{"uri":"Cape_of_Good_Hope","surface_form":"Cape of Good Hope","offset":761},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":801},{"uri":"Calicut","surface_form":"Calicut","offset":819},{"uri":"Kozhikode","surface_form":"Kozhikode","offset":941},{"uri":"Vasco_da_Gama","surface_form":"Vasco da Gama","offset":1142}]}
