{"id":279418,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_prime","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Wilson prime is a special kind of prime number. A prime number \"p\" is a Wilson prime if (and only if [iff])\nformula_1\nwhere \"n\" is a positive integer (sometimes called natural number). Wilson primes were first described by Emma Lehmer.\nThe only known Wilson primes are 5, 13, and 563; if any others exist, they must be greater than 5. It has been conjectured that there are an infinite number of Wilson primes, and that the number of Wilson primes in an interval is about\nformula_1.\nCompare this with Wilson's theorem, which states that every prime \"p\" divides (\"p\" \u2212 1)! + 1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":49},{"uri":"Iff","surface_form":"iff","offset":117},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive","offset":148},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":157},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":183},{"uri":"Emma_Lehmer","surface_form":"Emma Lehmer","offset":238},{"uri":"5_(number)","surface_form":"5","offset":284},{"uri":"13_(number)","surface_form":"13","offset":287},{"uri":"Conjecture","surface_form":"conjecture","offset":362},{"uri":"Wilson%27s_theorem","surface_form":"Wilson's theorem","offset":516}]}
