As of 2016, there were about 384,000 people.\nIt is the only province in Austria that does not speak an Austro-Bavarian. Instead they speak an Alemannic dialect.

The main rivers in Vorarlberg are the Ill, the Bregenzer Ach and the Dornbirner Ach.\n78% of the population is Roman Catholic.

The respextive states are the Swiss cantons of St.Gallen and Graub\u00FCnden, and the German state of Bavaria. Lake Constance is special, there are no borders apart fro the borders on land.
