{"id":279556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Systematics is one of the main fields in biology. It is closely related to taxonomy.\nSystematics is the study of the diversification of life on the planet Earth, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time.\nRelationships are usually seen as evolutionary trees (cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies).\nPhylogenies have two components, \"branching order\" (showing group relationships) and \"branch length\" (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (anatomical or molecular characteristics), and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.\nSystematics is the field which (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. Taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":54},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":88},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":149},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":168},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":288},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"cladograms","offset":308},{"uri":"Phylogenetic_tree","surface_form":"phylogenetic tree","offset":320},{"uri":"Phylogeny","surface_form":"phylogenies","offset":340},{"uri":"Taxa","surface_form":"taxa","offset":527},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"traits","offset":567},{"uri":"Biogeography","surface_form":"biogeography","offset":652}]}
