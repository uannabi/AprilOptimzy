Her second studio album, \"The Comfort Zone\", in 1991 topped the \"Billboard\" R&B Album Chart, which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit \"Save the Best for Last\".

From 2006 to 2010, she played the role of the scheming, self-absorbed diva and former supermodel Wilhelmina Slater in the ABC comedy series \"Ugly Betty\", for which she got three Emmy Awards nominations.

There is, however, occasional confusion with similarly named actress Vanessa A. Williams, who is just two months younger.\nIt has been reported that Williams first became aware of Vanessa A. in the 1980s when her New York University registrar told her that another, similarly aged student with the same name and from the same state had applied. When Williams appeared as Miss America in a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Vanessa A. accidentally received her check for the appearance, which she returned.\nThe two ran into name conflict when Screen Actors Guild rules stopped the same stage naming. Vanessa A. had registered the name \"Vanessa Williams\" first. As a compromise, Williams was occasionally credited as \"Vanessa L. Williams\" in acting credits. Both actresses starred in versions of the drama \"Soul Food\" (Williams in the film version, and Vanessa A. in its \"Soul Food\" adaptation). The Screen Actors Guild eventually took the issue to arbitration, and decided that both actresses could use the professional name \"Vanessa Williams\". Today, Williams' prominence has led to a more wide association with the stage name \"Vanessa Williams\", so much so that it has widely become only known to her. She is credited as such in the American television series \"Ugly Betty\" and \"Desperate Housewives\". Williams is also the owner of the internet domain name vanessawilliams.com. Today, the younger Vanessa Williams is most often publicly and professionally referenced as \"Vanessa A. Williams\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":207},{"uri":"Miss_America","surface_form":"Miss America","offset":238},{"uri":"Grammy_Awards","surface_form":"Grammy","offset":461},{"uri":"Emmy_Awards","surface_form":"Emmy","offset":469},{"uri":"Tony_Awards","surface_form":"Tony Award","offset":479},{"uri":"Spawned","surface_form":"spawned","offset":568},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"Billboard Hot 100","offset":697},{"uri":"Top","surface_form":"topped","offset":765},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Oscar","offset":1015},{"uri":"List_of_Disney_animated_movies","surface_form":"Disney animated feature movie","offset":1060},{"uri":"Pocahontas_(movie)","surface_form":"Pocahontas","offset":1091},{"uri":"Millwood%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Millwood, New York","offset":1183},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":1617},{"uri":"Miss_America","surface_form":"Miss America","offset":1654},{"uri":"Scandal","surface_form":"scandal","offset":1680},{"uri":"Penthouse_magazine","surface_form":"Penthouse magazine","offset":1693},{"uri":"Nude","surface_form":"nude","offset":1733},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":2111},{"uri":"R%26amp%3BB","surface_form":"R&B","offset":2208},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Pictures","surface_form":"Disney","offset":2467},{"uri":"Arnold_Schwarzenegger","surface_form":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","offset":2627},{"uri":"Eraser_(film)","surface_form":"Eraser","offset":2663},{"uri":"Shaft_(2000_film)","surface_form":"Shaft","offset":2779},{"uri":"Ugly_Betty","surface_form":"Ugly Betty","offset":2958},{"uri":"Emmy_Awards","surface_form":"Emmy Awards","offset":2995},{"uri":"Desperate_Housewives","surface_form":"Desperate Housewives","offset":3125},{"uri":"Vanessa_A._Williams","surface_form":"Vanessa A.
