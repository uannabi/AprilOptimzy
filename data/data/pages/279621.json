{"id":279621,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSFA_award","text":"e=\"preserve\">The BSFA Awards are prizes given every year by the British Science Fiction Association (BSFA). The prize is for excellent works of science fiction. The first BSFA Award was given in 1970. Prizes are given for works from the year before the award is given. At first, the award was only for novels. Categories for short works and artwork were added in 1980. Awards for media were given from 1979 to 1992. In 2002, the BSFA Award started to be given for nonfiction too.\nMembers of the BSFA vote for the nominees who may win an award and then for the final winners. Recently members of Eastercon also vote.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Science_Fiction_Association","surface_form":"British Science Fiction Association","offset":64},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":144},{"uri":"Nominee","surface_form":"nominee","offset":513},{"uri":"Eastercon","surface_form":"Eastercon","offset":595}]}
