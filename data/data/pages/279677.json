{"id":279677,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(automobile)","text":"=\"preserve\">Mercury was the automobile division for Ford. The company was founded in 1938. Between 1945 and 2011, it was the Mercury half of the Lincoln-Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company. The vehicles made by Mercury include Mountaineer, Sable, Milan and Grand Marquis. The Mercury brand was phased out in early 2011.\nThe car was called Mercury because it was the name of the Roman god of messengers. This claims the car's performence was good.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
