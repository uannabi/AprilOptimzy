She was the mother of eight children including the future Umberto I of Italy. She was the Queen of Sardinia from 1849 until 1855 when she died as a result of childbirth. The present Italian pretender is her direct great great grandson.\nArchduchess of Austria.\nShe was born at the Royal Palace of Milan to Rainer Joseph of Austria and his wife Elisabeth of Savoy. Named \"Adelaide\", or known as \"Adele\" in the family, she held the title of Archduchess of Austria. Her father was the Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia and was a son of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II and Maria Luisa of Spain. Her mother was a member of the House of Savoy and a daughter of the then Prince of Carignano, the head of the junior branch of the House of Savoy who ruled the Kingdom of Sardinia.\nDuchess of Savoy.\nOn 12 April 1842, at the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, she married Victor Emmanuel of Savoy. The marriage was used to strengthen relations between the House of Savoy and that of the House of Habsburg but was viewed by many people of the time to increase Austrian power in Italy.\nVictor Emmanuel was her first cousin and heir apparent to the King of Sardinia. He was styled the \"Duke of Savoy\" prior to succession. Adelaide thus took on the style of \"Duchess of Savoy\". She maintained her style of \"Imperial & Royal Highness\" till she became Queen.\nHer husband's mother Maria Theresa of Austria retained great influence over her son throughout his life. Her mother-in-law was also her first cousin, both she and Adelaide being grandchildren of Emperor Leopold II. Adelaide and her husband of thirteen years had eight children. Four of these went on to have further progeny. Her husband had various extramarital affairs throughout the marriage. Adelaide was a quiet and religious woman and had had a strict upbringing. A loving wife and frequently would give to charity.\nQueen of Sardinia.\nIn March 1849 her father-in-law King Charles Albert abdicated after the events of the Revolutions of 1848. Her husband succeeded as Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia. During her tenure as queen consort she had three further children all of which died in infancy. On 8 January 1855 she gave birth to a son who was styled the \"Count of Genevois\". Days later Queen Maria Theresa died on 12 January 1855. Adelaide went to the late queens funeral on 16 January and returning to the palace caught a cold. She died four days later at the Royal Palace of Turin having had an acute attack of Gastroenteritis. Another story says that Adelaide died of her burns after stepping on a match that set fire to her clothes. She was buried at the Royal Basilica of Superga. In 1861 her husband would become the first post-unification King of Italy. Her husband wed again to Rosa Vercellana in a morganatic marriage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["royalty|consort=yes"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy","surface_form":"Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia","offset":127},{"uri":"Umberto_I_of_Italy","surface_form":"Umberto I of Italy","offset":239},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Queen of Sardinia","offset":271},{"uri":"House_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Italian pretender","offset":363},{"uri":"Archduke_Rainer_Joseph_of_Austria","surface_form":"Rainer Joseph of Austria","offset":486},{"uri":"Archduke_of_Austria","surface_form":"Archduchess of Austria","offset":619},{"uri":"Viceroy","surface_form":"Viceroy","offset":662},{"uri":"Maria_Luisa_of_Spain","surface_form":"Maria Luisa of Spain","offset":745},{"uri":"House_of_Savoy","surface_form":"House of Savoy","offset":798},{"uri":"Prince_of_Carignano","surface_form":"Prince of Carignano","offset":840},{"uri":"House_of_Savoy","surface_form":"House of Savoy","offset":898},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Sardinia","offset":927},{"uri":"Palazzina_di_caccia_di_Stupinigi","surface_form":"Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi","offset":991},{"uri":"Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy","surface_form":"Victor Emmanuel of Savoy","offset":1037},{"uri":"House_of_Savoy","surface_form":"House of Savoy","offset":1121},{"uri":"House_of_Habsburg","surface_form":"House of Habsburg","offset":1152},{"uri":"Heir_apparent","surface_form":"heir apparent","offset":1290},{"uri":"Charles_Albert_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"King of Sardinia","offset":1311},{"uri":"Duke_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Duke of Savoy","offset":1348},{"uri":"Maria_Theresa_of_Austria_(1801%E2%80%931855)","surface_form":"Maria Theresa of Austria","offset":1539},{"uri":"Leopold_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor Leopold II","offset":1713},{"uri":"Charles_Albert_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"King Charles Albert","offset":2090},{"uri":"Revolutions_of_1848","surface_form":"Revolutions of 1848","offset":2144},{"uri":"Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy","surface_form":"Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia","offset":2190},{"uri":"Queen_consort","surface_form":"queen consort","offset":2243},{"uri":"Maria_Theresa_of_Austria_(1801%E2%80%931855)","surface_form":"Queen Maria Theresa","offset":2411},{"uri":"Royal_Palace_of_Turin","surface_form":"Royal Palace of Turin","offset":2586},{"uri":"Gastroenteritis","surface_form":"Gastroenteritis","offset":2638},{"uri":"Basilica_of_Superga","surface_form":"Royal Basilica of Superga","offset":2784},{"uri":"Risorgimento","surface_form":"post-unification","offset":2854},{"uri":"King_of_Italy","surface_form":"King of Italy","offset":2871},{"uri":"Rosa_Vercellana","surface_form":"Rosa Vercellana","offset":2911},{"uri":"Morganatic_marriage","surface_form":"morganatic marriage","offset":2932}]}
