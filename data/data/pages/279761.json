{"id":279761,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20","text":"Twenty20 or T20 cricket is a short version of the game of cricket. It started in England for inter-county competitions in 2003. A Twenty20 game has two teams, each has a single innings at batting for a maximum of 20 overs.\nA Twenty20 game is usually takes about three and half hours, with each innings lasting around 75 minutes. This means that it is similar to other team sports. It was hoped that the games would have more action and that people would enjoy the games, both at the ground and on television. It has been very successful. The England Cricket Board did not want Twenty20 to take over from other forms of cricket and these are still played.\nThe game has now spread around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have their own competitions. The first ICC World Twenty20 was played in South Africa in 2007 with India winning by five runs against Pakistan in the final. Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets. England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 defeating Australia in the final by seven wickets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":58},{"uri":"Innings","surface_form":"innings","offset":177},{"uri":"Over_(cricket)","surface_form":"overs","offset":216},{"uri":"Test_cricket","surface_form":"Test","offset":778},{"uri":"ICC_World_Twenty20","surface_form":"ICC World Twenty20","offset":838},{"uri":"India_cricket_team","surface_form":"India","offset":897},{"uri":"Pakistan_cricket_team","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":932},{"uri":"2009_ICC_World_Twenty20","surface_form":"2009 ICC World Twenty20","offset":972},{"uri":"Wicket","surface_form":"wicket","offset":1026},{"uri":"2010_ICC_World_Twenty20","surface_form":"2010 ICC World Twenty20","offset":1051}]}
