{"id":279792,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The tesla (symbol T) is the SI derived unit used to measure the strength of magnetic fields. Tesla can be measured in different ways; for example, one tesla is equal to one weber per square meter.\nThe tesla was first defined in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). It was named in honor of the physicist, electrical engineer, and inventor, Nikola Tesla.\nDefinitions.\nWb = weber\nA tesla is also equal to 10,000 (104) gauss in the CGS system of units.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI derived unit","offset":41},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":89},{"uri":"Weber_(unit)","surface_form":"weber","offset":186},{"uri":"CGPM","surface_form":"General Conference on Weights and Measures","offset":253},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":333},{"uri":"Nikola_Tesla","surface_form":"Nikola Tesla","offset":379},{"uri":"Weber_(unit)","surface_form":"weber","offset":411},{"uri":"Gauss_(unit)","surface_form":"gauss","offset":455},{"uri":"Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units","surface_form":"CGS","offset":468}]}
