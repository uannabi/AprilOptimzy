{"id":279872,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_extinct_animals","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The largest extinct animals known to date are listed here. They are arranged by their taxonomy (classification). The list only deals with individual animals; size of colonies (such as coral reefs) is not dealt with here.\nFish.\nThe largest bony fish and the largest fish of all time was \"Leedsichthys problematicus\" from the Middle Jurassic, at around long. Earlier claims have been scaled down.\nThe extinct megatoothed shark, \"C. megalodon\" is by far the biggest and most powerful shark that ever lived. This giant shark reached a length of more than. Carcharocles megalodon has incredible bite power, despite a lower bite to mass ratio.\nTurtles.\nThe largest fossil turtle seems to be the freshwater turtle \"Stupendemys\", with an estimated total carapace length of more than 11\u00A0feet (3.3\u00A0metres). A close contender is \"Archelon ischyros\", a sea turtle, which reached a length of 16\u00A0feet (4.8\u00A0m) across the flippers and a weight of over 4,850\u00A0lb (2,200\u00A0kg). For comparison, the largest living turtle is the Leatherback Sea Turtle at a maximum 2000\u00A0lbs (900\u00A0kg).\nArchosaurs.\nThe largest known crocodilian is likely \"Sarcosuchus imperator\" at long and weighing 8 tonnes. A close contender in size is \"Deinosuchus\", also estimated at around.\nPterosaurs.\nThe largest pterosaur was \"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\", at 127\u00A0kg (280\u00A0lbs) and with a wingspan of 11\u00A0m (36\u00A0ft). Another close contender is \"Hatzegopteryx\", also with a wingspan of 11\u00A0m (this estimate is based on a skull 3\u00A0m long (10\u00A0ft).\nDinosaurs.\nTitanosaurs hold the world record for the size of a land animal. A recent discovery in the Argentine found \"Dreadnoughtus\", an estimated length of 26 metres (85 feet) and weight of 59,291 kg (65.4 short tons). Its bones showed it was a sub-adult.\nA notably large titanosaurid is \"Argentinosaurus\", which is known from partially preserved remains. This sauropod has been estimated as long and 73\u201399 metric tons in weight. The lack of skeletal material makes these estimates uncertain.\nThe very largest ornithopods, like \"Shantungosaurus\" were as heavy as medium-sized sauropods at up to 23 metric tons \"Lambeosaurus laticaudus\" appears to be close contender at around in length.\nThe largest known theropod is \"Spinosaurus aegyptiacus\", estimated at in length and around 7\u20139 metric tons in weight. \"Spinosaurus aegyptiacus\" is also recognized as the largest terrestrial predator yet known.\nA close contender in size is a giant theropod from South America, \"Giganotosaurus carolinii\", whose holotype specimen is estimated at in length, and another specimen is estimated at in length. A study however presents \"Carcharodontosaurus\" as a close contender in size to \"Spinosaurus aegyptiacus\". Some other notable giant theropods (e.g. \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", \"Acrocanthosaurus\", and \"Mapusaurus\") may also have rivaled these giant theropods in size. Another very large theropod was \"Deinocheirus\", being tall at hips,\nand weighing up to 16,000 pounds. The largest dromaeosaurid is \"Utahraptor\". In addition to being the largest known dromaeosaurid, it was also the largest known deinonychosaur and the largest known paravian.\nThe largest thyreophoran was \"Ankylosaurus\" at in length and 6.5 tons in weight. \"Stegosaurus\" was also 9\u00A0meters (30\u00A0ft) long but around 5 tons in weight.\nThe largest ceratopsian known is probably the newly discovered \"Eotriceratops\" with a skull alone being in length. Maximum size of this ceratopsian is suggested to be around in length and 13 tonnes in weight.\nIchthyosaurs.\nThe largest ichthyosaur was \"Shonisaurus sikanniensis\" at ~21\u00A0metres (70\u00A0ft) in length. This would make it the largest extinct marine animal. However, both Lilstock Monster and Aust Colossus may have both been larger than Shonisaurus.\nPlesiosaurs.\nThe largest plesiosaur was \"Mauisaurus haasti\", growing to about 20\u00A0metres (66\u00A0ft) in length. Next behind was \"Elasmosaurus\" at 14\u00A0metres (46\u00A0ft) long.\nThere is much controversy here. Fossil remains of a pliosaur nicknamed \"Predator X\" were excavated from Norway in 2008. It was about in length and 41 metric tons in weight. However, in 2002, a team of paleontologists in Mexico discovered the remains of a pliosaur \"Monster of Aramberri\", which is also estimated at in length. However, this specimen is thought to be a juvenile, with evidence that it had been attacked by an even larger pliosaur. Some media claimed that \"Monster of Aramberri\" was a \"Liopleurodon\" this is unconfirmed.\nSquamata.\nThe largest known prehistoric snake is \"Titanoboa\", estimated at in length and 1135\u00A0kg\u20131819\u00A0kg in weight. Another large fossil snake is \"Gigantophis\", estimated at around in length. Both these snakes lived in tropical rain forests. In third place is an aquatic snake, \"Palaeophis colossaeus\", which may have been around in length.\nGiant mosasaurs are the largest animals within this group. The largest known mosasaur is likely \"Mosasaurus hoffmanni\", estimated at least in length. A close contender in size is \"Hainosaurus bernardi\", estimated at in length. Another giant mosasaur is \"Tylosaurus\", estimated at in length.\nBirds.\nThe largest birds of all time might have been the elephant birds of Madagascar. Of almost the same size was the Australian \"Dromornis stirtoni\". Both were about 3\u00A0m tall (10\u00A0ft). The elephant birds were up to 400\u00A0kg and \"Dromornis\" was up to 500\u00A0kg in weight. The tallest bird ever was the Giant Moa (\"Dinornis maximus\") at 12\u00A0ft tall.\nThe largest flight-capable bird was \"Argentavis magnificens\" which had a wingspan of 7\u00A0m (~23\u00A0ft), and a body weight of 110\u00A0kg (244\u00A0lb), or \"Pelagornis sandersi\" with a wingspan of 6.4 to 7.4 metres.\nWhales.\n\"Basilosaurus\" was once recognized as one of the largest known extinct cetaceans at in length.\nThe largest fossil toothed whale was the Miocene whale \"Livyatan melvillei\" which was estimated to be in length. One notable feature of \"L. melvillei\" was its teeth which were 36\u00A0cm long and is unmatched by any other animal, extinct or alive.\nHowever, the largest fossil whales were baleen whales (plankton feeders) from the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs. A notable example is the bones of a Pliocene age baleen whale, assigned the questionable name \"Balaenoptera sibbaldina\", which likely rivaled the modern blue whale in size.\nLand mammals.\nThe largest perissodactyl, and land mammal, of all time was \"[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeoloxodon_namadicus Palaeoloxodon Namadicus]\". It stood 5.5\u00A0m (18\u00A0ft) tall at the shoulder, a total height of 8\u00A0m (27\u00A0ft), totally 12\u00A0m (40\u00A0ft) long and may have weighed 20 tonnes (22 tons), though mass estimates vary. Some prehistoric horned rhinos also grew to large sizes. The giant woolly rhino \"Elasmotherium\" reached 20\u00A0ft long and 6.6\u00A0ft high.\nMillipedes (Diplopoda).\nThe largest by far was the giant \"Arthropleura\". Measuring 2.5\u00A0metres (8.2\u00A0ft) and 45 centimetres (18\u00A0in) wide, it was the largest terrestrial arthropod of all time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":100},{"uri":"Colony_(biology)","surface_form":"colonies","offset":180},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral
