The view that abortion should be against the law is called pro-life.\nThe pro-choice movement is sometimes called the abortion rights movement. It is largely based on the belief, that woman should be able to decide what they want to do with their bodies. Having a baby would be a huge invasion to the body and should be a choice. They believe that an unborn embryo should not be valued over the pregnant woman. Pro-choice believes in a woman's right to choose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":30},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":94},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":246},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":264},{"uri":"Pro-life","surface_form":"pro-life","offset":334}]}
