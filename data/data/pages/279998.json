{"id":279998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamen","text":"The stamen is a male reproductive organ of a flower. It produces the pollen. The stamen has two parts: anther and stalk. The stalk is also called a filament.\nThe anther contains microsporangia. Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis, and produce pollen grains, which contain the male gametes (sperm).\nThe pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes.\nThe pollen is released by the opening of the anther. The pollen is carried by some agent (wind, or some animal) to the receptive surface of the stigma of the same or another flower. This process is known as pollination. After successful pollination, the pollen grain (immature microgametophyte) completes its development by growing a \"pollen tube\" and the two male gametes move through the pollen tube to the ovule.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproductive","offset":21},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":45},{"uri":"Pollen","surface_form":"pollen","offset":69},{"uri":"Meiosis","surface_form":"meiosis","offset":259},{"uri":"Gamete","surface_form":"gamete","offset":318},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":327},{"uri":"Haploid","surface_form":"haploid","offset":366},{"uri":"Gametophyte","surface_form":"gametophyte","offset":379},{"uri":"Stigma","surface_form":"stigma","offset":537},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"pollination","offset":600},{"uri":"Ovule","surface_form":"ovule","offset":802}]}
