{"id":28,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English","text":"e=\"preserve\">American English or United States English is the dialect of the English language spoken in the United States of America. It is different in some ways from other types of English, such as British English. Many types of American English came from local dialects in England.\nMany people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken. This may be because people hear and read American English through the media, for example movie<nowiki/>s, television, and the Internet, where the most common form of English is American English.\nBecause people all over the world use the English language, it gets many new words. English has been changing in this way for hundreds of years. For example, the many millions who speak Indian English frequently add American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from the various Indian languages.\nSometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America. These people often keep using American English in everyday life.\nThe meaning of many words are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things. For example, Italian, Spanish, and French all came from Latin.\nSpelling.\nWords that come from French that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English. In these cases Canadian English usage is to keep the British (and French) spelling.\nBooks show that many of these differences come from the writings of English-lover Noah Webster, who made the American dictionary following the American War of Independence.\nRegional accents.\nGeneral American English is the kind most spoken in mass media. It more vigorously pronounces the letter \"R\" than some other kinds do. \"R-dropping\" is frequent in certain places where \"r\" sound is not pronounced after a vowel. For example as in the words \"car\" and \"card\" sounding like \"cah\" and \"cahd\". This occurs in the Boston area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":62},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":77},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":108},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":200},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"media","offset":473},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":492},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television","offset":509},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":529},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":640},{"uri":"Indian_English","surface_form":"Indian English","offset":784},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1354},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1363},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1376},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1397},{"uri":"Canadian_English","surface_form":"Canadian English","offset":1540},{"uri":"Noah_Webster","surface_form":"Noah Webster","offset":1691},{"uri":"American_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"American War of Independence","offset":1752},{"uri":"General_American","surface_form":"General American","offset":1800},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"mass media","offset":1852},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":2020},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":2031}]}
