{"id":280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food","text":"Food is what people and animals eat to live. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called \"drinks\". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.\nFood for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism.\nFood produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the food industry). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives (such as preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers). For example, bread is processed food.\nFood processing at home is done in the kitchen, by the cook. The cook sometimes uses a cookbook. Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cookers, pots, and frying pans.\nFood can also be prepared and served in restaurants or refectory (in particular for children in school).\nThe utensils used may be a plate, knife, fork, chopsticks, spoon, bowl, or spork.\nMany people do not grow their own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People buy most of their food in shops or markets. But some people still grow most or all of their own food.\nPeople may buy food and take it home to cook it. They may buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor or a restaurant.\nProduction of Food.\nOriginally, people got food as hunter-gatherers. The agricultural revolution changed that. Farmers grew crops including those invented and improved by selective breeding. These improvements, for example the invention of maize, allowed feeding more people, and further improvements gave it a better taste.\nFood shortage has been a big problem throughout history. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need. Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are hungry. If they do not eat enough food for a long time, they will become sick and die from starvation. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that there is famine there.\nFood and water can make people sick if it is contaminated by microorganisms, bad metals, or chemicals.\nIf people do not eat the right foods, they can become sick.\nPeople may often have a variety of eating disorders that cause them to either eat too much, or not be able to eat certain things or amounts. Common diseases like Coeliac disease or food allergies cause people to experience ill effects from consuming certain foods that are normally safe. If people eat too much food, they can become overweight or obese. This causes numerous health problems. On the other hand, eating too little food, from lack of access or anorexia could cause malnutrition. Therefore, people have to balance the amount, the nutrition, and the type of food to be healthy.\nFood in religions.\nMany cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the \"Kashrut\" of Judaism and the \"Halal\" of Islam, that say that pig meat cannot be eaten. In Hinduism, eating beef is not allowed. Some Christians are \"vegetarian\" (someone who does not eat meat) because of their religious beliefs. For example, Seventh-day Adventist Church recommends vegetarianism.\nIn addition, sometime beliefs do not relate to the religion but belong to the culture. For example, some people pay respect to \"Gu\u0101n Y\u012Bn\" mothergod and those followers will not consume \"beef\" as they believe that her father has a shape of the cow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":13},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":24},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":81},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":129},{"uri":"Nutrition","surface_form":"nutrition","offset":140},{"uri":"Nutrition","surface_form":"nutrition","offset":169},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":292},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":301},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":306},{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":321},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":331},{"uri":"Dietary_mineral","surface_form":"minerals","offset":341},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":407},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":501},{"uri":"Gardening","surface_form":"gardening","offset":512},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":621},{"uri":"Eggs","surface_form":"eggs","offset":627},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":651},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":676},{"uri":"Vegetarianism","surface_form":"vegetarianism","offset":691},{"uri":"Veganism","surface_form":"veganism","offset":756},{"uri":"Food_industry","surface_form":"food industry","offset":848},{"uri":"Food_additive","surface_form":"food additive","offset":928},{"uri":"Food_preservation","surface_form":"preservative","offset":952},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":1026},{"uri":"Food_processing","surface_form":"Food processing","offset":1051},{"uri":"Kitchen","surface_form":"kitchen","offset":1090},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cook","offset":1106},{"uri":"Cookbook","surface_form":"cookbook","offset":1138},{"uri":"Pressure_cooker","surface_form":"pressure cooker","offset":1181},{"uri":"Pot","surface_form":"pot","offset":1199},{"uri":"Frying_pan","surface_form":"frying pan","offset":1209},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":1262},{"uri":"Refectory","surface_form":"refectory","offset":1277},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":1318},{"uri":"Plate","surface_form":"plate","offset":1354},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":1361},{"uri":"Fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":1368},{"uri":"Chopsticks","surface_form":"chopsticks","offset":1374},{"uri":"Spoon","surface_form":"spoon","offset":1386},{"uri":"Bowl","surface_form":"bowl","offset":1393},{"uri":"Spork","surface_form":"spork","offset":1402},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"buy","offset":1510},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":1536},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":1545},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cook","offset":1652},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"street vendor","offset":1707},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":1726},{"uri":"Hunter-gatherer","surface_form":"hunter-gatherer","offset":1789},{"uri":"Agricultural_revolution","surface_form":"agricultural revolution","offset":1811},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":1862},{"uri":"Selective_breeding","surface_form":"selective breeding","offset":1909},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":1978},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":2193},{"uri":"Hunger","surface_form":"hungry","offset":2338},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"sick","offset":2411},{"uri":"Starvation","surface_form":"starvation","offset":2429},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":2514},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"sick","offset":2559},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":2589},{"uri":"Bad_metals","surface_form":"bad metals","offset":2605},{"uri":"Eating_disorder","surface_form":"eating disorders","offset":2726},{"uri":"Coeliac_disease","surface_form":"Coeliac disease","offset":2853},{"uri":"Food_allergies","surface_form":"food allergies","offset":2872},{"uri":"Overweight","surface_form":"overweight","offset":3024},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obese","offset":3038},{"uri":"Anorexia_nervosa","surface_form":"anorexia","offset":3149},{"uri":"Malnutrition","surface_form":"malnutrition","offset":3170},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":3317},{"uri":"Taboo","surface_form":"taboo","offset":3337},{"uri":"Kashrut","surface_form":"Kashrut","offset":3478},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":3490},{"uri":"Halal","surface_form":"Halal","offset":3507},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":3517},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":3538},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":3567},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":3584},{"uri":"Seventh-day_Adventist_Church","surface_form":"Seventh-day Adventist Church","offset":3719},{"uri":"Gu%C4%81n_Y%C4%ABn","surface_form":"Gu\u0101n Y\u012Bn","offset":3902}]}
