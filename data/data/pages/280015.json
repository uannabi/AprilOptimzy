{"id":280015,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(geology)","text":"=\"preserve\">A stage or age in geology is a period of time measured in millions of years. It is less than an epoch, and more than a chron or chronozone.\nTechnically, a \"stage\" is a succession of rock strata laid down in a single age on the geologic timescale, which usually represents millions of years of sedimentation or deposition. An example of a stage in the Geologic time scale is the Kimmeridgian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":30},{"uri":"Epoch_(geology)","surface_form":"epoch","offset":108},{"uri":"Chron","surface_form":"chron","offset":131},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":199},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":305},{"uri":"Deposition_(geology)","surface_form":"deposition","offset":322},{"uri":"Historical_geology","surface_form":"Geologic time scale","offset":363},{"uri":"Kimmeridgian","surface_form":"Kimmeridgian","offset":390}]}
