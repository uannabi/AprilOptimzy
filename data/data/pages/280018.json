{"id":280018,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_beds","text":"The term red beds usually refers to strata of reddish-colored sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, siltstone or shale that were deposited in hot climates under oxidizing conditions. They are usually formed in terrestrial situations: on land, and in rivers and lakes.\nThe red color comes from iron oxide in their mineral structure. Although they have been deposited throughout the Phanerozoic, they are most commonly associated with rocks deposited during the Devonian, Permian and Triassic periods. The Old Red Sandstone is one of the most famous rock formations.\nRed beds have economic significance since many of them contain reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\nSecondary red beds are linked to the uplift, erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary red beds for their formation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stratum","surface_form":"strata","offset":36},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":46},{"uri":"Sedimentary_rock","surface_form":"sedimentary rock","offset":62},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":88},{"uri":"Siltstone","surface_form":"siltstone","offset":99},{"uri":"Shale","surface_form":"shale","offset":112},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidizing","offset":160},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":236},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":249},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":260},{"uri":"Iron_oxide","surface_form":"iron oxide","offset":292},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":312},{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic","offset":380},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":459},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":469},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":481},{"uri":"Old_Red_Sandstone","surface_form":"Old Red Sandstone","offset":503},{"uri":"Rock_formation","surface_form":"rock formation","offset":547},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"petroleum","offset":641},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":655}]}
