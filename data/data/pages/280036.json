Titanosaurus has traditionally been treated as a \"wastebasket taxon\" for poorly preserved sauropod remains. The most well-known species of \"Titanosaurus\", \"Titanosaurus\" colberti, has been renamed \"Isisaurus\". The remains were from the Upper Cretaceous of India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":21},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":30},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":39},{"uri":"Wastebasket_taxon","surface_form":"wastebasket taxon","offset":260},{"uri":"Isisaurus","surface_form":"\"Titanosaurus\" colberti","offset":365},{"uri":"Isisaurus","surface_form":"Isisaurus","offset":408},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":446},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":466}]}
