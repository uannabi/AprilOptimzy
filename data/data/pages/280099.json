The legend says that during the early time of the Spanish period in the country, two \"guardias civil\" or Spanish soldiers were lost. As they moved through the area that is now Calamba, they met a young woman. She came from a river carrying a jar of water and a wooden stove. The soldiers asked the lady what the name of the place was. They asked this in Spanish and used an angry tone to hide the fact that they were lost. She did not speak Spanish and thought she was being questioned about what she was carrying. She answered \"kalan-banga\", meaning \"clay stove\" (\"kalan\") and \"water jar\" (\"banga\"). Because they could not pronounce it correctly, the city has been called Calamba since then. This legend is immortalized with a large concrete water jar built in the city plaza with the names of the city's barangays written on it. It is said to be the World's Biggest \"Claypot\". This same jar is also in the city's seal. The idea to build the plaza came from Dr. Agapito Alzona. He was a town councilor at the time. It was built on an unused area that was at one time the old town market. The plaza was built in 1939.\nBefore it became a separate city, Calamba was a part of Tabuco. Tabuco is now known as Cabuyao, Laguna. Calamba became an independent \"pueblo\" on August 28, 1742.\nWhile the area was under the control of the Japanese in World War II, the city was the site of a massacre. The Imperial Japanese Army killed at least 2,000 civilians.\nWith the passage of Republic Acts of the Philippines-Republic Act,No. 9024 on April 7, 2001 and the approval of the people on April 21, Calamba went from being a municipality into being Laguna's second component city. San Pablo City was the other component city at the time. Calamba is seen as a major growth center.\nOn October 28, 2003, Calamba City became the regional center of Region IV-A CALABARZON.\nCalamba has been the home to five national heroes: Dr. Jose Rizal, General Paciano Rizal, Teodora Alonzo, General Vicente Lim, and Lt. Geronimo Aclan.\nThe main church in Calamba City is the St. John the Baptist Church. It was built in 1859. The church was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was rebuilt by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of Jose Rizal. The original baptismal font has been is still there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":31},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":43},{"uri":"Laguna_(province)","surface_form":"Laguna","offset":55},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":63},{"uri":"Calabarzon","surface_form":"Calabarzon","offset":105},{"uri":"Lucena_City","surface_form":"Lucena City","offset":123},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":462},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist destination","offset":496},{"uri":"Hot_spring","surface_form":"hot spring","offset":532},{"uri":"Golf","surface_form":"Golf","offset":655},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industrial center","offset":757},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":793},{"uri":"Industrial_park","surface_form":"industrial park","offset":838},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":859},{"uri":"Estate","surface_form":"estate","offset":868},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":949},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":1103},{"uri":"Birth","surface_form":"birth","offset":1186},{"uri":"Jose_Rizal","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Rizal","offset":1200},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":1220},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":1229},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":1297},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1355},{"uri":"Soldiers","surface_form":"soldiers","offset":1418},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":1507},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1530},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"jar","offset":1547},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1554},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1566},{"uri":"Stove","surface_form":"stove","offset":1573},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1659},{"uri":"Angry","surface_form":"angry","offset":1679},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":1857},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronounce","offset":1929},{"uri":"Immortal","surface_form":"immortal","offset":2013},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":2039},{"uri":"Plaza","surface_form":"plaza","offset":2076},{"uri":"Barangay","surface_form":"barangay","offset":2111},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"World","offset":2157},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"seal","offset":2220},{"uri":"Councilor","surface_form":"councilor","offset":2298},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":2386},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2630},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":2642},{"uri":"Massacre","surface_form":"massacre","offset":2683},{"uri":"Imperial_Japanese_Army","surface_form":"Imperial Japanese Army","offset":2697},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":2742},{"uri":"Philippine_municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":2915},{"uri":"Growth","surface_form":"growth","offset":3055},{"uri":"CALABARZON","surface_form":"CALABARZON","offset":3146},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Dr.","offset":3209},{"uri":"Jose_Rizal","surface_form":"Jose Rizal","offset":3213},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"General","offset":3225},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":3318},{"uri":"John_the_Baptist","surface_form":"John the Baptist","offset":3352},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptismal font","offset":3557}]}
