It is 1084.6 meters (3,563-feet) tall, of sandstone and granite. With nearby mountains and Table Bay, it surrounds the central part of Cape Town.\nIt is a significant tourist attraction, featured in the flag of Cape Town and other local government insignia. Many visitors use the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway or hike to the top. The mountain forms part of the Table Mountain National Park.\nGeology.\nThe upper part of the mountain \"mesa\" (table) consists Silurian/Ordovician quartzitic sandstone, commonly referred to as Table Mountain Sandstone (TMS). It is highly resistant to weathering and forms steep grey crags.\nBelow the sandstone is a layer of micaceous shale, which weathers quite readily. The basement of folded metamorphic shales intruded by the Cape Granite are of late Precambrian age.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":32},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":65},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":78},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":258},{"uri":"Silurian","surface_form":"Silurian","offset":547},{"uri":"Ordovician","surface_form":"Ordovician","offset":556},{"uri":"Quartz","surface_form":"quartz","offset":567},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":578},{"uri":"Weathering","surface_form":"weathering","offset":671},{"uri":"Mica","surface_form":"mica","offset":744},{"uri":"Shale","surface_form":"shale","offset":754},{"uri":"Basement_(geology)","surface_form":"basement","offset":795},{"uri":"Metamorphic_rock","surface_form":"metamorphic","offset":814},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"Granite","offset":854},{"uri":"Precambrian","surface_form":"Precambrian","offset":874}]}
