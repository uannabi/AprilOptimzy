It had bony, rounded plates along its back and probably 4 bony spikes at the tip of its tail. It had a shorter body and wider hip bones than other stegosaurids. It was one of the last genera of stegosaur known to survive, since most others died out by the end of the Jurassic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stegosaurid","surface_form":"stegosaurid","offset":21},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":33},{"uri":"Stegosaurus","surface_form":"Stegosaurus","offset":54},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":76},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":96},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":412}]}
