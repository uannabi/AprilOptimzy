Sometimes Stroma is included, which is part of Caithness.\nCulture and politics.\nThe Northern Isles are usually separated for political purposes, but they come under the Orkney and Shetland parliamentary constituency in Westminster.\nDue to their history, the islands have a Norse, rather than a Gaelic flavour, and have historic links with the Faroes, Iceland, and Norway.\nOrkney and Shetland were given to Scotland as a deposit on the dowry of Margaret of Denmark when she married James III of Scotland in 1469.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":34},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":74},{"uri":"Shetland","surface_form":"Shetland","offset":103},{"uri":"Fair_Isle","surface_form":"Fair Isle","offset":113},{"uri":"Orkney","surface_form":"Orkney","offset":127},{"uri":"Stroma%2C_Scotland","surface_form":"Stroma","offset":145},{"uri":"Caithness","surface_form":"Caithness","offset":182},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":354},{"uri":"Norse","surface_form":"Norse","offset":408},{"uri":"Gaelic","surface_form":"Gaelic","offset":429},{"uri":"Faroe_Islands","surface_form":"Faroes","offset":478},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":486},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":499},{"uri":"Orkney","surface_form":"Orkney","offset":507},{"uri":"Shetland","surface_form":"Shetland","offset":518},{"uri":"Margaret_of_Denmark%2C_Queen_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Margaret of Denmark","offset":579},{"uri":"James_III_of_Scotland","surface_form":"James III of Scotland","offset":616}]}
