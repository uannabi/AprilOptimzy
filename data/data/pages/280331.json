{"id":280331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket","text":"Brackets are tall punctuation marks used in matched pairs within text. They are used in mathematics and in literature (written language). They are sometimes used to set apart or interject other parts of the text. They are noted as left/right: the \"left bracket\" is \"[\" and the \"right bracket\" is \"]\".\nIn the American English, \"bracket\" usually refers specifically to the \"square\" or \"box\" type. In British English, \"bracket\" normally refers to the \"round\" type, which is called a \"parenthesis\" mark in American usage.\nParentheses are the curved brackets \"(\u00A0\u00A0)\". They are also called \"round brackets\", \"curved brackets\", \"oval brackets\", or, colloquially, \"parens\".\nThere are also other uses for parentheses.\nParentheses enclose text which could be left out, without destroying or altering the meaning of a sentence. In most writing, overuse of parentheses is usually a sign of a badly structured text. A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas around the text, although if the sentence contains commas for other uses, then visual confusion may result.\nThey can also note \"either singular or plural\" for nouns, such as in the word \"claim(s)\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":18},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":65},{"uri":"Mathematical_notation","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":88},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":107},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":308},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":398},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":896},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":1119}]}
