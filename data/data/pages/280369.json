{"id":280369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri_pants","text":"Capri pants are a type of pants. They are shorter than normal pants; they end between the knee and lower leg.\nThey were first made in 1948 by Sonja de Lennart, a clothes designer from Prussia. They were popular in the 1950s and 1960s, but went out of style until the 2000s, when they became popular again.\nSome pants have a zipper at the knee, allowing them to be converted into shorts. This design allows people to change between shorts and pants in variable weather conditions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pants","surface_form":"pants","offset":26},{"uri":"Knee","surface_form":"knee","offset":90},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":184},{"uri":"Zipper","surface_form":"zipper","offset":324}]}
