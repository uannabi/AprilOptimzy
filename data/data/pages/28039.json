{"id":28039,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Geneva Conventions are a set of four treaties of international law at wartime. They were formulated in Geneva, Switzerland. All of the four treaties are about humanitarian issues. The Swiss Henri Dunant was the person who started the creation of the Conventions. He did this after he saw the unimaginable cruelty of the Battle of Solferino in 1859.\nSome parts of the four Geneva Conventions say that all countries who signed must create national laws to make violations of the Geneva Conventions a crime.\nChanges.\nAfter the First Convention was agreed, the International Committee of the Red Cross was founded in 1863.\nAll four conventions were last checked and agreed on in 1949. Those versions are related to previous revisions. In some cases, ideas from the 1907 Hague Convention were added. Usually, people refer to all four conventions as the \"Geneva Conventions of 1949\" or simply the \"Geneva Conventions\". Later conferences have added text that makes it illegal to use certain kinds of warfare, like chemical warfare. They have also spoken about issues of civil wars.\nClara Barton was important in campaigning for the United States to agree to the First Geneva Convention. The United States signed that Convention in 1882.\nBy the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1949, some 47 nations had ratified the agreements.\nToday, nearly all 200 countries of the world are \"signatory\" nations. This means they have signed and agreed to follow the Geneva Conventions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaties","offset":54},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":66},{"uri":"Laws_of_war","surface_form":"wartime","offset":87},{"uri":"Geneva_City","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":120},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":128},{"uri":"Humanitarian","surface_form":"humanitarian","offset":176},{"uri":"Henri_Dunant","surface_form":"Henri Dunant","offset":207},{"uri":"Cruel","surface_form":"cruel","offset":322},{"uri":"Battle_of_Solferino","surface_form":"Battle of Solferino","offset":337},{"uri":"Violation","surface_form":"violations","offset":476},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":515},{"uri":"International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","surface_form":"International Committee of the Red Cross","offset":574},{"uri":"Chemical_warfare","surface_form":"chemical warfare","offset":1024},{"uri":"Clara_Barton","surface_form":"Clara Barton","offset":1092},{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaigning","offset":1122},{"uri":"Ratification","surface_form":"ratified","offset":1308}]}
