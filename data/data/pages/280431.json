{"id":280431,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner_Dozois","text":"Gardner Raymond Dozois (July 23, 1947 \u2013 May 27, 2018) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He was editor of \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" magazine from 1984 to 2004. He won several Hugo and Nebula awards. He won as an editor and as a writer of short fiction.\nBiography.\nDozois was born on July 23, 1947 in Salem, Massachusetts. He was in the Army from 1966 to 1969 as a journalist. He then moved to New York City to work as a science fiction editor. Dozois said that one reason he started reading fiction was to escape from his isolated home town.\nIn 2004, Dozois was badly injured in a traffic accident while going home in a taxi from a Philadelphia Phillies game. He missed Worldcon for the first time in many years because of the accident. He did make a full recovery. On July 6, 2007, Dozois had a planned heart surgery. A week later, he experienced problems and had another operation to put in a defibrillator.\nOn May 27, 2018, Dozios died of multiple organ failure complicated by an infection at a hospital in Philadelphia at the age of 70.\nFiction.\nDozois mostly wrote short stories. He won the Nebula Award for best short story twice: once for \"The Peacemaker\" in 1983, and again for \"Morning Child\" in 1984. His short fiction has been collected in \"The Visible Man\" (1977), \"Geodesic Dreams\" (a best-of collection), \"Slow Dancing through Time\" (1990, with other authors), and \"Strange Days\" (2001, another best-of collection). He wrote fewer novels. He wrote one novel by himself, \"Strangers\" (1978). He wrote, \"Nightmare Blue\" (1977) with George Alec Effinger. Dozois also wrote \"Hunter's Run\" (2008) with George R. R. Martin and Daniel Abraham. After he became editor of \"Asimov's\", Dozois wrote less fiction. Later, he began writing more. His 2006 novelette \"Counterfactual\" won the Sidewise Award for best alternate-history short story. Dozois also agreed to write short fiction reviews for \"Locus\".\nEditorial work.\nDozois mainly worked as an editor. He won 15 Hugo Awards for Best Professional Editor, nearly every year between 1988 and his retirement from \"Asimov's\" in 2004. That is more than anyone else. He also worked in the 1970s with magazines such as \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", \"If\", \"Worlds of Fantasy\", and \"Worlds of Tomorrow\".\nDozois was well known for publishing books that collected many short stories. After leaving \"Asimov's\", he continued as the editor of the series \"The Year's Best Science Fiction\". This has been published each year since 1984. He also edited a long series of themed anthologies with Jack Dann. Each book has a title that explains the theme, such as \"Cats\", \"Dinosaurs\", \"Seaserpents\", or \"Hackers\".\nDozois always said he was especially interested in adventure science fiction and space opera. He calls these two sub-genre \"center-core SF\".\nMichael Swanwick published a book-length interview with Dozois in 2001. The book was called \"Being Gardner Dozois\". It was about each published piece of fiction Dozois ever wrote. Swanwick had written some stories together with Dozois. In 2002, the interview was named as a possible Hugo Award for Best Related Book winner. It won the 2002 Locus Award for Non-Fiction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":70},{"uri":"Editing","surface_form":"editor","offset":97},{"uri":"Asimov%27s_Science_Fiction","surface_form":"Asimov's Science Fiction","offset":123},{"uri":"Hugo_Award","surface_form":"Hugo","offset":192},{"uri":"Nebula_Award","surface_form":"Nebula","offset":201},{"uri":"Salem%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Salem, Massachusetts","offset":317},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"Army","offset":353},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Phillies","surface_form":"Philadelphia Phillies","offset":649},{"uri":"Worldcon","surface_form":"Worldcon","offset":687},{"uri":"Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery","surface_form":"heart surgery","offset":821},{"uri":"Defibrillation","surface_form":"defibrillator","offset":912},{"uri":"Multiple_organ_failure","surface_form":"multiple organ failure","offset":959},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":1027},{"uri":"Nebula_Award","surface_form":"Nebula Award","offset":1113},{"uri":"Nebula_Award_for_Best_Short_Story","surface_form":"for best short story","offset":1126},{"uri":"Strangers_(science_fiction_novel)","surface_form":"\"Strangers\"","offset":1501},{"uri":"George_Alec_Effinger","surface_form":"George Alec Effinger","offset":1560},{"uri":"George_R._R._Martin","surface_form":"George R.
