Larger numbers will make the slope steeper.\nIf m is a negative number, then the line will appear to fall or go down the page when read from left to right.\nIf m is a positive number, then the line will appear to climb the page when read from left to right.\nWhile b = the y-intercept of the function.\nThis is where the function crosses the y - axis of the coordinate plane.The first equation is called slope-intercept form, because in it, the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) are easily found.The second equation is called point-slope form, because in it, a point on the graph (x1, y1) and the slope (m) are easily found.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slope","surface_form":"slope","offset":69}]}
