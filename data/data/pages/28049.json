{"id":28049,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A.S.","text":"The S.A.S. or Special Air Service, is a Special Operations Organisation of the British Army. It was founded in 1941 to attack behind the German line of defence in North Africa, in World War II. They are one of the best schooled units in the world, that makes them very valuable. There are about 500 active SAS soldiers.\nThe SAS is a secret organisation. Its members often do not tell anyone except close family that they are in it. The British Ministry of Defence (MOD) rarely speaks of the SAS and mission details are never released until much later.\nThe badge of the organisation is a flaming excalibur. It shows the motto: \"Who Dares Wins\".\nThe SAS is thought of all over the world as one of the best, if not the best Special Operations organisations.\nThis is mainly because of the intense training they are put through. The hardest part of this is intense interrogation (questioning while under torture) which the trainees must go through.\nThe SAS is respected worldwide and used to train many other Special Forces Units. Several special operations units are modeled after the SAS. For example, the U.S. Army's Delta Force was founded due in large part to Charles Beckwith, a U.S. Army special operations officer, serving as an exchange officer with the SAS. He felt that the U.S. Army was vulnerable in not having a unit comparable to the SAS.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":137},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":180},{"uri":"Ministry_of_Defence","surface_form":"Ministry of Defence","offset":444},{"uri":"Torture","surface_form":"torture","offset":899},{"uri":"Delta_Force","surface_form":"Delta Force","offset":1115}]}
