{"id":280493,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Highlands","text":"The Northwest Highlands are the northern third of Scotland, which is separated from the Grampian Mountains by the Great Glen. The Caledonian Canal, which extends from Loch Linnhe in the west, via Loch Ness to the Moray Firth in the north splits this area from the rest of the country.\nThe Highlands are formed on Lewisian gneiss, the oldest layers of rock in Scotland. There are impressive rock islands of dark red or gray Torridonian sandstone which stick up out of the gneiss. Some of the peaks, such as Beinn Eighe and Canisp, are topped with light gray or white Cambrian quartzite.\nThe city of Inverness, known as the \"Capital of the Highlands\", is by far the largest settlement in the region. It is the administrative centre for the Highland Council area.\nClimate.\nThis area's climate varies with altitude. It has wet, warm summers, average under 17C (62.6F). The winters are mild at low altitude but become snowier and colder with higher elevation.\nMountains may have up to 6 months of snow. Naturally the area would be a vast birch, pine and montane shrub forest, such as those surviving in Glen Affric. Snow may lie from more than a month to 105 days, but not at coastal or very low altitudes.\nGeography.\nThe region has steep, glacier-carved mountains, valleys and interspersed plains. Many islands (which also vary widely) lie off the coast.\nElevations of around 800 metres or over are common, as are mountains exceeding 1000 metres.\nThe Northwest Highlands are typically not quite as cold as the Cairngorms. Considering its terrain and its latitude of about 57 to 58 degrees North, the area is surprisingly warm: this is due to the mild influence of the Gulf Stream. The aurora borealis is sometimes visible on winter nights, weather permitting, especially at the climax of the 11 year cycle.\nBordering the region to the north east is the lowland area of Caithness.\nThe region has a very low population density. Significant settlements are Kyle of Lochalsh, Mallaig, Dingwall, Dornoch, and Ullapool.\nGeology.\nGeologically, the Northwest Highlands includes the Hebrides, especially Lewis and Harris.\nLewisian complex.\nThe main outcrops of the Lewisian complex are on the islands of the Outer Hebrides, including Lewis, from which the complex takes its name. It is also exposed on several islands of the Inner Hebrides, small islands north of the Scottish mainland and forms a coastal strip on the mainland.\nThe Lewisian complex or Lewisian Gneiss is a suite of Precambrian metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of Scotland, forming part of the Hebridean Terrane. These rocks are of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic age, ranging from 3.0\u20131.7 billion years ago.\nThey form the basement on which later sediments were deposited. The Lewisian consists mainly of granitic gneisses. Rocks of the Lewisian complex were caught up in the Caledonian orogeny, appearing in the hanging walls of many of the thrust faults formed during the late stages of this tectonic event.\nIts presence at the seabed and beneath Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata west of Shetland has been confirmed by shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells.\nBasement rocks of similar type are found at the base of the Moine Supergroup, sometimes with well-preserved unconformable contacts. These form part of the Lewisian, so the Lewisian complex extends at least as far southeast as the Great Glen Fault.\nCalidonian orogeny.\nThe Highlands are formed from the remains of the old Caledonian mountain range in northern Europe, the Caledonian orogeny. This included what is now Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden), Scotland, Wales, Normandy and Brittany in France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":50},{"uri":"Grampian_Mountains","surface_form":"Grampian Mountains","offset":88},{"uri":"Great_Glen","surface_form":"Great Glen","offset":114},{"uri":"Caledonian_Canal","surface_form":"Caledonian Canal","offset":130},{"uri":"Loch_Linnhe","surface_form":"Loch Linnhe","offset":167},{"uri":"Loch_Ness","surface_form":"Loch Ness","offset":196},{"uri":"Moray_Firth","surface_form":"Moray Firth","offset":213},{"uri":"Gneiss","surface_form":"gneiss","offset":322},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":351},{"uri":"Torridonian","surface_form":"Torridonian","offset":423},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":435},{"uri":"Beinn_Eighe","surface_form":"Beinn Eighe","offset":506},{"uri":"Canisp","surface_form":"Canisp","offset":522},{"uri":"Quartzite","surface_form":"quartzite","offset":575},{"uri":"Inverness","surface_form":"Inverness","offset":598},{"uri":"Glen_Affric","surface_form":"Glen Affric","offset":1098},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":1171},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":1235},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":1261},{"uri":"Cairngorms","surface_form":"Cairngorms","offset":1506},{"uri":"Gulf_Stream","surface_form":"Gulf Stream","offset":1664},{"uri":"Aurora_borealis","surface_form":"aurora borealis","offset":1681},{"uri":"Caithness","surface_form":"Caithness","offset":1865},{"uri":"Kyle_of_Lochalsh","surface_form":"Kyle of Lochalsh","offset":1950},{"uri":"Mallaig","surface_form":"Mallaig","offset":1968},{"uri":"Dingwall","surface_form":"Dingwall","offset":1977},{"uri":"Dornoch","surface_form":"Dornoch","offset":1987},{"uri":"Ullapool","surface_form":"Ullapool","offset":2000},{"uri":"Hebrides","surface_form":"Hebrides","offset":2070},{"uri":"Lewis_and_Harris","surface_form":"Lewis and Harris","offset":2091},{"uri":"Outer_Hebrides","surface_form":"Outer Hebrides","offset":2195},{"uri":"Lewis","surface_form":"Lewis","offset":2221},{"uri":"Inner_Hebrides","surface_form":"Inner Hebrides","offset":2312},{"uri":"Precambrian","surface_form":"Precambrian","offset":2470},{"uri":"Metamorphic_rock","surface_form":"metamorphic","offset":2482},{"uri":"Archaean","surface_form":"Archaean","offset":2609},{"uri":"Proterozoic","surface_form":"proterozoic","offset":2627},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":2665},{"uri":"Basement_(geology)","surface_form":"basement","offset":2698},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granitic","offset":2780},{"uri":"Gneiss","surface_form":"gneiss","offset":2789},{"uri":"Orogeny","surface_form":"orogeny","offset":2862},{"uri":"Fault_(geology)","surface_form":"faults","offset":2924},{"uri":"Tectonic","surface_form":"tectonic","offset":2969},{"uri":"Palaeozoic","surface_form":"Palaeozoic","offset":3024},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":3039},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":3048},{"uri":"Shetland","surface_form":"Shetland","offset":3063},{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":3116},{"uri":"Exploration","surface_form":"exploration","offset":3128},{"uri":"Unconformity","surface_form":"unconformable","offset":3255},{"uri":"Great_Glen_Fault","surface_form":"Great Glen Fault","offset":3377},{"uri":"Caledonian_orogeny","surface_form":"Caledonian orogeny","offset":3518},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":3564},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":3577},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":3585},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":3604},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":3611},{"uri":"Brittany","surface_form":"Brittany","offset":3624},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":3636}]}
