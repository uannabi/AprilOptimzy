{"id":28051,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire","text":"Lancashire is a ceremonial county in the North West of England. Its two cities are Lancaster and Preston. Before 1974, Liverpool and Manchester were part of administrative county of Lancashire.\nThe county has developed a fierce rivalry with Yorkshire, the next county east. This comes from rivalry in sport, such as in cricket, and comes from the War of the Roses.\nA big attraction in Lancashire is Blackpool, an English seaside resort, which has a theme park called Blackpool Pleasure Beach. It has the second largest rollercoaster in Europe (\"The Big One\") and Blackpool Tower, a tower which was made to look like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\nLancashire has market towns (like Chorley) and small villages (like Bretherton, Croston and Eccleston). It is just south of an area of outstanding natural beauty called the Lake District. Lancashire also has a lot of pleasant countryside such as White Coppice and the Rivington Moors.\nA famous food from Lancashire is \"Lancashire Hot pot\" which is made of meat, onion or other vegetables and potatoes. It is often found on many pub menus in the county and in other places in Britain.\nThe people of Lancashire are known for their friendly nature. Humour is also an important part of Lancashire life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":27},{"uri":"North_West_England","surface_form":"North West","offset":41},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":55},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":72},{"uri":"Lancaster%2C_Lancashire","surface_form":"Lancaster","offset":83},{"uri":"Preston","surface_form":"Preston","offset":97},{"uri":"Liverpool%2C_England","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":119},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":133},{"uri":"Yorkshire","surface_form":"Yorkshire","offset":241},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":319},{"uri":"Wars_of_the_Roses","surface_form":"War of the Roses","offset":347},{"uri":"Blackpool","surface_form":"Blackpool","offset":399},{"uri":"Seaside","surface_form":"seaside","offset":421},{"uri":"Resort","surface_form":"resort","offset":429},{"uri":"Theme_park","surface_form":"theme park","offset":449},{"uri":"Rollercoaster","surface_form":"rollercoaster","offset":519},{"uri":"Blackpool_Tower","surface_form":"Blackpool Tower","offset":563},{"uri":"Eiffel_Tower","surface_form":"Eiffel Tower","offset":620},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":636},{"uri":"Chorley","surface_form":"Chorley","offset":677},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":999},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":1005},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":1020},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":1035},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pub","offset":1071}]}
