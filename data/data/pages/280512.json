{"id":280512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saitama%2C_Saitama","text":"is the capital and the city of Saitama Prefecture in Japan. It is in the south-east of the prefecture. It includes the former cities of Urawa, \u014Cmiya, Yono and Iwatsuki. It is a city designated by government ordinance. It is about 15 - 30 kilometres north of central Tokyo, so many people commute from here into Tokyo.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded on May 1, 2001, and was designated on April 1, 2003 as a government ordinance. For the histories of Urawa, \u014Cmiya and Yono before the merger, see\nUrawa-ku and Saitama, \u014Cmiya-ku and Saitama and Yono and Saitama, respectively.\nOn April 1, 2005, it merged with the city of Iwatsuki to its east, which became a new ward, Iwatsuki-ku.\nGeography.\nThe city is 20 to 30\u00A0km north of central Tokyo. This is the center of the Kant\u014D Plain. The city is mostly below 20 m above sea level. There are no mountains or hills in the city.\nEconomy.\nManufacturing includes automotive (Honda manufactures the Honda Legend here), food, optical, precision and pharmaceutical products. Iwatsuki is famous for manufacturing of \"hinamatsuri\" dolls and ornate \"kabuto\" (samurai helmets).\nTransportation.\nSaitama is a regional transportation hub for both passengers and freight.\n\u014Cmiya Station is the biggest railway hub in the prefecture.\nThe closest major airports are Haneda Airport and Narita International Airport, both about two hours away.\nSports.\nSaitama has two J. League football (soccer) teams: the Urawa Red Diamonds and Omiya Ardija.\nOrigin of the name \"Saitama\".\nThe name \"Saitama\" originally comes from the Sakitama (\u57FC\u7389\u90E1) district of what is now the city of Gy\u014Dda in the northern part of what is now known as Saitama Prefecture. \"Sakitama\" has an ancient history and is mentioned in the famous 8th century poetry anthology Man'y\u014Dsh\u016B. The pronunciation has changed from Sakitama to Saitama over the years.\nWith the merger of Urawa, \u014Cmiya, and Yono it was decided that a new name, one fitting for this newly-created prefectural capital, was needed. The prefectural name \"Saitama\" (\u57FC\u7389\u770C) was changed from kanji into hiragana, thus Saitama City (\u3055\u3044\u305F\u307E\u5E02) was born. It is the only prefectural capital in Japan whose name is always written in hiragana, and belongs to the list of hiragana cities.\nHowever, Saitama written in hiragana (\u3055\u3044\u305F\u307E\u5E02) actually finished in second place in public polling to Saitama written in kanji (\u57FC\u7389\u5E02). Despite this, government officials decided to name the new city Saitama in hiragana, not kanji. In third place in the poll was \u014Cmiya (\u5927\u5BAE\u5E02). In fourth was Saitama (\u5F69\u7389\u5E02), written with an alternative kanji for \"sai\" (\u5F69) which means \"colorful\". The \"sai\" (\u57FC) used in the prefectural name is a rare form of a common character (\u5D0E) that means cape or promontory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saitama_Prefecture","surface_form":"Saitama Prefecture","offset":31},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":53},{"uri":"Urawa%2C_Saitama","surface_form":"Urawa","offset":136},{"uri":"%C5%8Cmiya-ku%2C_Saitama","surface_form":"\u014Cmiya","offset":143},{"uri":"Yono%2C_Saitama","surface_form":"Yono","offset":150},{"uri":"Iwatsuki-ku%2C_Saitama","surface_form":"Iwatsuki","offset":159},{"uri":"City_designated_by_government_ordinance","surface_form":"city designated by government ordinance","offset":177},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":266},{"uri":"City_designated_by_government_ordinance","surface_form":"government ordinance","offset":405},{"uri":"Wards_of_Japan","surface_form":"ward","offset":658},{"uri":"Iwatsuki-ku%2C_Saitama","surface_form":"Iwatsuki-ku","offset":664},{"uri":"Kant%C5%8D_Plain","surface_form":"Kant\u014D Plain","offset":762},{"uri":"Honda_Legend","surface_form":"Honda Legend","offset":934},{"uri":"Iwatsuki-ku%2C_Saitama","surface_form":"Iwatsuki","offset":1008},{"uri":"Hinamatsuri","surface_form":"hinamatsuri","offset":1049},{"uri":"Kabuto","surface_form":"kabuto","offset":1080},{"uri":"Samurai","surface_form":"samurai","offset":1089},{"uri":"Transportation_hub","surface_form":"transportation hub","offset":1145},{"uri":"%C5%8Cmiya_Station_(Saitama)","surface_form":"\u014Cmiya Station","offset":1197},{"uri":"Tokyo_International_Airport","surface_form":"Haneda Airport","offset":1288},{"uri":"Narita_International_Airport","surface_form":"Narita International Airport","offset":1307},{"uri":"J._League","surface_form":"J.
