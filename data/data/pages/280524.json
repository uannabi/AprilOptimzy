{"id":280524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_condor","text":"The Andean condor (\"Vultur gryphus\"), is a vulture-like bird species found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America. It is the largest flying land bird in the Western Hemisphere and the heaviest member of the order Accipitriformes. The condor is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion, and belongs to the New World vulture.\nAlthough about 5\u00A0cm shorter (beak to tail) on average than the California condor, the Andean condor is undoubtedly larger in wingspan: 108-122 in (274\u2013310\u00A0cm). It is also heavier: up to 24-33\u00A0lb (11\u201315\u00A0kg) for males and 16-24\u00A0lb (7.5\u201311\u00A0kg) for females. Overall length can range from 46 to 53\u00A0inches (117 to 135\u00A0cm). Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vulture","surface_form":"vulture","offset":43},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":56},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":82},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":137},{"uri":"Accipitriformes","surface_form":"Accipitriformes","offset":250},{"uri":"Scavenger","surface_form":"scavenger","offset":293},{"uri":"Carrion","surface_form":"carrion","offset":315},{"uri":"New_World_vulture","surface_form":"New World vulture","offset":343},{"uri":"California_condor","surface_form":"California condor","offset":425}]}
