{"id":280529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_vulture","text":"The black vulture (\"Coragyps atratus\"), also known as the American black vulture, is a bird in the New World vulture family.\nIts range is from the southeastern United States to Central Chile and Uruguay in South America. It is a common and widespread species, but less so than the turkey vulture, which breeds well into Canada and south to Tierra del Fuego. Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the Eurasian black vulture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":87},{"uri":"New_World_vulture","surface_form":"New World vulture","offset":99},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":160},{"uri":"Zona_Central","surface_form":"Central Chile","offset":177},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":195},{"uri":"Turkey_vulture","surface_form":"turkey vulture","offset":281},{"uri":"Tierra_del_Fuego","surface_form":"Tierra del Fuego","offset":340},{"uri":"Eurasian_black_vulture","surface_form":"Eurasian black vulture","offset":432}]}
