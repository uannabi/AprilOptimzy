{"id":28053,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Church of England is the leading Christian church in England. It is the church established by law: its formal head is the English monarch (Elizabeth II). It is the mother church of the Anglican Communion. Its headquarters are at Church House, Westminster, in London.\nThere are other Protestant churches in England which are not part of the Anglican Communion.\nHistory.\nThe Church of England became independent under King Henry VIII in 1534. Henry VIII was married to Catherine of Aragon, but asked the Pope to annul the marriage (say that it was a mistake and that Henry and Catherine were never really married). He wanted to annul the marriage because he wanted a male heir to his throne and Catherine could not produce one. When the annulment was refused, Henry VIII used his position as King to break the Church away from the Roman Catholic Church. This established the independence of the Church of England, sometimes called the Anglican (English) Church. Methodism broke away from the church in the 18th century. The Oxford Movement brought some Catholic beliefs and practices back into the church in the 19th century.\nUnder his son, King Edward VI, more Protestant forms of worship were adopted. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer started more changes. A new pattern of worship was set out in the Book of Common Prayer (1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy but influenced by Protestant principles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":50},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":60},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":70},{"uri":"State_religion","surface_form":"church established","offset":89},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":147},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Elizabeth II","offset":156},{"uri":"Anglican_Communion","surface_form":"Anglican Communion","offset":202},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":226},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":260},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":276},{"uri":"Henry_VIII","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":438},{"uri":"Catherine_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Catherine of Aragon","offset":484},{"uri":"Annulment","surface_form":"annul","offset":527},{"uri":"Heir","surface_form":"heir","offset":687},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":846},{"uri":"Methodism","surface_form":"Methodism","offset":977},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":1021},{"uri":"Oxford_Movement","surface_form":"Oxford Movement","offset":1039},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":1068},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1127},{"uri":"King_Edward_VI","surface_form":"King Edward VI","offset":1156},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":1177},{"uri":"Thomas_Cranmer","surface_form":"Thomas Cranmer","offset":1249},{"uri":"Book_of_Common_Prayer","surface_form":"Book of Common Prayer","offset":1330},{"uri":"Liturgy","surface_form":"liturgy","offset":1399}]}
