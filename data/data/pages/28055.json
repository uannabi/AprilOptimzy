{"id":28055,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense_(grammar)","text":"Tense can be shown by changing the spelling of a verb. For example, \"be\" can become \"am\", \"is\", and \"are\" in present tense, and \"was\" and \"were\" in past tense. In English, future tense is shown by adding \"will\" before the verb. For example, \"be\" becomes \"will be\" in future tense.\n\"Note:These tenses can be subdivided further (see below)\".\nAspect.\nThere are also different kinds of tense within each main tense. They are formed by adding \"helping words\" or \"auxiliary words\", such as \"be\" and \"have\", before the verb. For example, \"I give\", \"I have given\", \"I am giving\", and \"I have been giving\" are all in present tense, but have different meanings\".\" This is called aspect.\nOther languages have different ways of showing tense. For example, Latin usually shows tense by changing the verb, like English. However, Chinese and Indonesian show tense by adding new words, instead of changing the verb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":744},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":815},{"uri":"Indonesian_language","surface_form":"Indonesian","offset":827}]}
