{"id":280768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Caribbean_dollar","text":"The East Caribbean dollar (sign: $; code: XCD) is the currency of eight of the nine members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (the exception is the British Virgin Islands).\nIt has existed since 1965, when it replaced the British West Indies dollar, and it is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign \"$\" or, alternatively, \"EC$\" to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.\nThe EC$ is subdivided into 100 cents. It has been pegged to the United States dollar since 1976 and the exchange rate is currently at US$1 = EC$2.70.\nMembers of the Currency Union.\nSix of the eight countries which use the EC$ are independent (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). The other two are British overseas territories: Anguilla and Montserrat.\nAll of the countries except Dominica are Commonwealth realms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Currency_sign","surface_form":"sign","offset":27},{"uri":"ISO_4217","surface_form":"code","offset":36},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":54},{"uri":"Organisation_of_Eastern_Caribbean_States","surface_form":"Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States","offset":99},{"uri":"British_Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"British Virgin Islands","offset":162},{"uri":"British_West_Indies_dollar","surface_form":"British West Indies dollar","offset":235},{"uri":"Dollar_sign","surface_form":"dollar sign","offset":303},{"uri":"Dollar","surface_form":"dollar","offset":373},{"uri":"Cent_(currency)","surface_form":"cent","offset":435},{"uri":"Fixed_exchange_rate","surface_form":"pegged","offset":454},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"United States dollar","offset":468},{"uri":"Antigua_and_Barbuda","surface_form":"Antigua and Barbuda","offset":647},{"uri":"Dominica","surface_form":"Dominica","offset":668},{"uri":"Grenada","surface_form":"Grenada","offset":678},{"uri":"Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","surface_form":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","offset":687},{"uri":"Saint_Lucia","surface_form":"Saint Lucia","offset":710},{"uri":"Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines","surface_form":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","offset":727},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":780},{"uri":"British_overseas_territories","surface_form":"overseas territories","offset":788},{"uri":"Anguilla","surface_form":"Anguilla","offset":810},{"uri":"Montserrat","surface_form":"Montserrat","offset":823},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Commonwealth realm","offset":876}]}
