{"id":280809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_vulture","text":"New World vultures are the group of vultures that are found in the Americas. They form the family Cathartidae. There are seven species in five genera. Four of the genera contain only one species each, so they are monotypic.\nThese are large birds of prey that feed on the meat of dead or dying animals. The name \"Cathartidae\" comes from the Greek word \"katharsis\" meaning to purge or make clean.\nUnlike other birds of prey, they have a good sense of smell. The opening of their nostrils has a hole through from one side of the beak to the other. Some other vultures hop to move on the ground, but the New World vultures walk.\nThe two largest species are called condors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vulture","surface_form":"vulture","offset":36},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":67},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":91},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":127},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":143},{"uri":"Monotypic","surface_form":"monotypic","offset":213},{"uri":"Birds_of_prey","surface_form":"birds of prey","offset":240},{"uri":"Purge","surface_form":"purge","offset":374},{"uri":"Condor","surface_form":"condor","offset":660}]}
