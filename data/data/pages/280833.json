{"id":280833,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","text":"As a Commonwealth realm, St Kitts and Nevis has the same monarch as several other Commonwealth countries, Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn St Kitts, or when representing St Kitts in another country, she is known as the Queen of St Kitts and Nevis, Her full official title being: \"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Saint Christopher and Nevis and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth\".\nWhen acting as Queen of St Kitts, Elizabeth II only takes advice from the Government of St Kitts and Nevis. This is because the Statute of Westminster of 1931 said that all Commonwealth countries were independent of each other, and that the British government no longer had the right to interfere or give orders to the other countries.\nUsually the Queen's constitutional roles are carried out by the Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nRoyal succession (who is next in line to the throne) is governed by the English Act of Settlement of 1701, which is part of constitutional law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":106},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Realms","offset":367},{"uri":"Head_of_the_Commonwealth","surface_form":"Head of the Commonwealth","offset":391},{"uri":"Statute_of_Westminster","surface_form":"Statute of Westminster","offset":546},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","surface_form":"Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis","offset":818},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":933},{"uri":"Act_of_Settlement_1701","surface_form":"Act of Settlement","offset":941},{"uri":"1701","surface_form":"1701","offset":962}]}
