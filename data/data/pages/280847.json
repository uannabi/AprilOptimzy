He received the 1972 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to developing programming languages, and was the Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until 2000.\nShortly before his death in 2002, he received the ACM PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize the following year, in his honor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":60},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer scientist","offset":66},{"uri":"Turing_Award","surface_form":"Turing Award","offset":107},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":164},{"uri":"University_of_Texas_at_Austin","surface_form":"University of Texas at Austin","offset":257},{"uri":"Association_for_Computing_Machinery","surface_form":"ACM","offset":359},{"uri":"Self-stabilization","surface_form":"self-stabilization","offset":433},{"uri":"Dijkstra_Prize","surface_form":"Dijkstra Prize","offset":510}]}
