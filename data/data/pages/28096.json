{"id":28096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freecycle_Network","text":"=\"preserve\">The Freecycle Network (TFN) is a global network of people who share and regive items. They organise their network through the Internet. Freecycle is a place for people to meet. There are just two things people can do there.\nThe first thing is this: A person can ask the other people for an item. If someone has it, they can tell the person who wants it.\nThe second thing is this: A person can give away an item. Sometimes many people want the item, and the donator has to choose just one person.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Global","surface_form":"global","offset":45},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":52},{"uri":"Regiving","surface_form":"regive","offset":84},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":138}]}
