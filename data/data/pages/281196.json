Its leader is Miche\u00E1l Martin, who has also been Taoiseach since 2020. It was a faction of Sinn Fein - another Irish political party alongside Fine Gael - before splitting to become its own political party in 1926. Its name is translated from Irish as 'Soldiers of Destiny' but literally means 'Warriors of F\u00E1l' (F\u00E1l was the name of Ireland in legends).
