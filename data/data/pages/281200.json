{"id":281200,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Agnew","text":"Jim Agnew (born March 21, 1966) is a Canadian retired professional hockey defenceman. Agnew was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the 8th round (157th overall) in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. After a stellar career in the Western Hockey League with the Brandon Wheat Kings and Portland Winter Hawks, Agnew began his professional career with the Canucks in 1986.\nPlaying career.\nAgnew spent most of the 1986\u201387 in the American Hockey League, although he did receive a four-game stretch with the Canucks. He would spend four full seasons in Vancouver's minor-league system while seeing occasional action in Vancouver. Playing ten games for the team in the 1987\u201388 during which time he recorded his only career point, and was called up again for seven games in 1989\u201390.\nWhile playing for the Canucks in March 1990, Agnew seriously injured his left knee and required surgery. This would be the start of a chronic knee problem. Injuries to his left knee caused him to miss significant action six times over the next four seasons, and required three separate surgeries.\nHis knee problems struck just as he made the NHL on a full-time basis. He spent virtually the entire 1990\u201391 and 1991\u201392 seasons on the Canuck roster as a utility player seeing action at both forward and defence, but was limited to just 44 games over that stretch due to injury and failed to record a point.\nHe was released by the Canucks in 1992 and signed as a free agent with the Hartford Whalers. Again, however, he was limited to only 16 games by an injury to his left knee. After injuring his knee again during the Whalers' 1993 training camp, he decided to retire.\nAgnew appeared in 81 NHL games over parts of six seasons, recording 1 assist and 257 penalty minutes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":37},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"hockey","offset":67},{"uri":"Defenceman_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"defenceman","offset":74},{"uri":"Vancouver_Canucks","surface_form":"Vancouver Canucks","offset":111},{"uri":"1984_NHL_Entry_Draft","surface_form":"1984 NHL Entry Draft","offset":169},{"uri":"Western_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Western Hockey League","offset":221},{"uri":"Brandon_Wheat_Kings","surface_form":"Brandon Wheat Kings","offset":252},{"uri":"Portland_Winter_Hawks","surface_form":"Portland Winter Hawks","offset":276},{"uri":"1986%E2%80%9387_NHL_season","surface_form":"1986\u201387","offset":401},{"uri":"American_Hockey_League","surface_form":"American Hockey League","offset":416},{"uri":"1987%E2%80%9388_NHL_season","surface_form":"1987\u201388","offset":653},{"uri":"1989%E2%80%9390_NHL_season","surface_form":"1989\u201390","offset":757},{"uri":"1990%E2%80%9391_NHL_season","surface_form":"1990\u201391","offset":1164},{"uri":"1991%E2%80%9392_NHL_season","surface_form":"1991\u201392","offset":1176},{"uri":"Hartford_Whalers","surface_form":"Hartford Whalers","offset":1446}]}
