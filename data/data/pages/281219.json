The 869 area code was created during a split from the original (809) area code which was done in October, 1996. Like many Caribbean countries St Kitts uses +1 followed by the area code as the international direct dial phone code.\nWhen in Saint Kitts and Nevis, use the seven digits alone. When calling to Saint Kitts and Nevis from anywhere in the United States or Canada simply dial 1(869) + seven digit phone number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":27},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"area code","offset":37},{"uri":"Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","surface_form":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","offset":50},{"uri":"Area_code_809","surface_form":"(809)","offset":136},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":195},{"uri":"International_Direct_Dialing","surface_form":"international direct dial","offset":265},{"uri":"Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","surface_form":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","offset":311},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":421},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":438}]}
