{"id":281359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_song","text":"=\"preserve\">A protest song is a song that is part of a movement to change society. Many protest songs have lyrics that directly call for change, while others use humor, irony, or the ballad form to make their point.\nProtest songs can come from just about any type of music. In the 1960s in the United States, many folk musicians such as Phil Ochs, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan made protest songs. Some of these songs were against the United States fighting in the Vietnam War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":74},{"uri":"Lyrics","surface_form":"lyrics","offset":107},{"uri":"Irony","surface_form":"irony","offset":169},{"uri":"Ballad","surface_form":"ballad","offset":183},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":294},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":314},{"uri":"Phil_Ochs","surface_form":"Phil Ochs","offset":337},{"uri":"Joan_Baez","surface_form":"Joan Baez","offset":348},{"uri":"Bob_Dylan","surface_form":"Bob Dylan","offset":362},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":459}]}
