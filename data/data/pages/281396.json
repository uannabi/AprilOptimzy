{"id":281396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jumping","text":"Ski jumping is, mostly, a winter sport performed on snow where skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump forward and land as far as possible down the hill below. Judges give points both for length of the jump and for the jump style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (). Ski jumping is a part of the Winter Olympic Games.\nTrue ski jumping originates in Norway in 1809 when a Norwegian lieutenant launched himself 9.5 metres in the air in front of his soldiers. The first widely known ski jumping competition was held in Oslo in 1879, with Olaf Haugann of Norway setting the first world record for the longest ski jump at 20 metres(meters)\nSki jump techniques are divided into four sections; 1) In-run, 2) Take-off (jump), 3) Flight and 4) Landing. In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximize his or her length and style marks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":52},{"uri":"Ramp","surface_form":"ramp","offset":89},{"uri":"Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympic Games","offset":309},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":362},{"uri":"Oslo","surface_form":"Oslo","offset":529}]}
