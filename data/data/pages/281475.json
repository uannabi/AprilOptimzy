{"id":281475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyornis","text":"\"Ichthyornis\" (meaning \"fish bird\") was a tern-like bird which lived 93-83.5 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous. It lived in flocks, nested on shorelines, and hunted for fish in the Western Interior Seaway, a huge inland sea in what is now North America.\nDescription.\n\"Ichthyornis\" was about 8 inches (20 cm) long. It had a large head, toothed jaws, and a long beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds.\n\"Ichthyornis\" was originally found in 1872 in Kansas by Benjamin Franklin Mudge, a professor from Kansas State Agricultural College. Othniel C. Marsh of Yale University described and named the first fossils. Fossils of the bird have been found in Kansas, Texas and Alberta.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tern","surface_form":"tern","offset":42},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":102},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":177},{"uri":"Western_Interior_Seaway","surface_form":"Western Interior Seaway","offset":189},{"uri":"Inland_sea","surface_form":"inland sea","offset":221},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":247},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":484},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":537},{"uri":"Othniel_Charles_Marsh","surface_form":"Othniel C.
