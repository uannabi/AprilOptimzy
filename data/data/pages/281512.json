{"id":281512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonbill","text":"Spoonbills are a group of large, long-legged wading birds in the family Threskiornithidae, which also includes the Ibises.\nAll have large, flat, spatulate bills and feed by wading through shallow water, sweeping the partly-opened bill from side to side. The moment any small aquatic creature touches the inside of the bill\u2014an insect, crustacean, or tiny fish\u2014it is snapped shut. Spoonbills generally prefer fresh water to salt but are found in both environments. They need to feed many hours each day.\nSpoonbills are monogamous, but, so far as is known, only for one season at a time. Most species nest in trees or reed-beds, often with ibises or herons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Threskiornithidae","surface_form":"Threskiornithidae","offset":72},{"uri":"Ibis","surface_form":"Ibis","offset":115},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":326},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":334},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":354},{"uri":"Heron","surface_form":"heron","offset":647}]}
