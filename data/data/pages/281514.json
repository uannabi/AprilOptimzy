Being this close to its sun, the year on TrES-4 about three days long. This makes the temperature on the planet very hot. In fact, the temperature on TrES-4 is about 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit (1,260 degrees Celsius).\nTrES-4 is a gas giant that is 70 percent bigger than Jupiter. However, the planet is only as dense as cork. At the time of its discovery, TrES-4b was the largest known planet in the universe.\nDiscovery.\nThe planet was found by Georgi Mandushev at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Mandushev discovered the planet as a part of the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey project.\nTrES-4 was discovered using the transit method. When an exoplanet passes between its sun and the Earth, astronomers can see a change in light from the star.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Exoplanet","surface_form":"exoplanet","offset":13},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":27},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":45},{"uri":"GSC_02620-00648","surface_form":"GSC 02620-00648","offset":50},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":93},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":146},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Fahrenheit","offset":293},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":319},{"uri":"Gas_giant","surface_form":"gas giant","offset":341},{"uri":"Dense","surface_form":"dense","offset":422},{"uri":"Cork_(material)","surface_form":"cork","offset":431},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":511},{"uri":"Lowell_Observatory","surface_form":"Lowell Observatory","offset":580},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":602},{"uri":"Trans-Atlantic_Exoplanet_Survey","surface_form":"Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey","offset":660}]}
