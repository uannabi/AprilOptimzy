The city has a population of approximately 750,000. It is approximately halfway between Port Said to the north and Suez to the south. The Canal widens at this point to include Lake Timsah, one of the Bitter Lakes.\nKhedive Ismail the Magnificent founded the city in 1863, when the Canal was constructed. The city is named after him. The head office of the Suez Canal Authority is in Isma\u00EFlia at the shore of Lake Timsah. Many of the buildings that were built when the British and French were involved in running the canal are still standing. Some of them are still being used by Canal employees and officials.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":25},{"uri":"Suez_Canal","surface_form":"Suez Canal","offset":39},{"uri":"Capital_(political)","surface_form":"capital","offset":67},{"uri":"Ismailia_Governorate","surface_form":"Governorate with the same name","offset":82},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":129},{"uri":"Port_Said","surface_form":"Port Said","offset":202},{"uri":"Suez","surface_form":"Suez","offset":229},{"uri":"Lake_Timsah","surface_form":"Lake Timsah","offset":290},{"uri":"Bitter_Lakes","surface_form":"Bitter Lakes","offset":314},{"uri":"Ismail_Pasha","surface_form":"Ismail the Magnificent","offset":336},{"uri":"Suez_Canal_Authority","surface_form":"Suez Canal Authority","offset":469},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":581},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":593}]}
