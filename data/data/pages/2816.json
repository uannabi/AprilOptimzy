{"id":2816,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering","text":"Engineering is the use of science and math to design or make things. People who do engineering are called engineers. They learn engineering at a college or university. Engineers usually design or build things. Some engineers also use their skills to solve technical problems. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People have been engineering things for thousands of years.\nWhat is it?\nEngineers do not only work with machines. They also work a lot with other people. Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed.\nStudy.\nMost (but not all) engineers have had years of training. Much of their training involves working within a limited budget and materials.\nAmerican courses.\nIn the United States, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. After having gained enough work experience, one can sit for their Professional Engineer's (PE) License, reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their specialty.\nBritish courses.\nIn the United Kingdom, engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or four year MEng (Master of Engineering). In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of engineering (EngD). Engineers of all disciplines have common approaches to solving problems including teamwork, communication, and an Iterative design process.\nEngineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered. A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology), IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers) or ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers). Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions.\nFrench courses.\nThe best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Pr\u00E9paratoire pour les Grandes \u00C9coles is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then study for three years in an \"\u00C9cole d'Ing\u00E9nieur\" (Engineer's school).\nYou can also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for two years, and then study three years in an \"\u00C9cole d'Ing\u00E9nieur\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":26},{"uri":"Math","surface_form":"math","offset":38},{"uri":"Thing","surface_form":"things","offset":61},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":106},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":145},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":156},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":186},{"uri":"Computers","surface_form":"computers","offset":343},{"uri":"Buildings","surface_form":"buildings","offset":357},{"uri":"Interdisciplinarity","surface_form":"different kinds","offset":610},{"uri":"Budget","surface_form":"budget","offset":1140},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1187},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Doctor of Philosophy","offset":1598},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":2011},{"uri":"Grande_%C3%A9cole","surface_form":"Grandes \u00C9coles","offset":3198}]}
