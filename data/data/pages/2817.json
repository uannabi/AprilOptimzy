Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in posture.\nCommunication that tries to change somebody's mind may be called persuasion or propaganda.\nHow communication works.\nCommunication works by exchanging information or messages. In very basic terms\nBesides the content of the message, there are other things that are important. These are not part of the message itself, but rather of its context\nFor a message exchange to be successful, the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary. The word \"hedge\" can mean completely different things based on the context. In biology a hedge is a row of shrubs or trees that make a barrier or form a border. In finance, a hedge is an investment made to reduce the risk of another investment. In linguistics a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important. Without any information it is therefore very difficult to know which \"hedge\" is really meant by the speaker.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Speak","surface_form":"spoken","offset":21},{"uri":"Smile","surface_form":"smile","offset":54},{"uri":"Nonverbal_communication","surface_form":"posture","offset":241},{"uri":"Persuasion","surface_form":"persuasion","offset":315},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":329}]}
