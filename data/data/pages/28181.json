{"id":28181,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point","text":"e=\"preserve\">The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which this substance goes from the solid state to the liquid one, at a normal pressure. For water, this is 0\u00B0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit, 273,15 Kelvin). The chemical element with the highest melting point is tungsten. Some chemical compound<nowiki/>s have a higher melting point.\nWhen looking at when a liquid substance becomes solid, most people call this the freezing point. For most substances, like water, this is the same as the melting point. There are substances, where this is not the case (they melt at one temperature, and freeze at another). Agar seems to melt at 85\u00B0 Celsius, but freeze at between 35\u00B0C and 40\u00B0C. This phenomenon is a kind of hysteresis.\nAdding certain substances or impurities will change the melting point of the resulting mixture. For example, sugar or salt will lower the melting point, and alcohol will raise it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":36},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":53},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":103},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":122},{"uri":"Standard_temperature_and_pressure","surface_form":"normal pressure","offset":139},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":178},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Fahrenheit","offset":190},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"Kelvin","offset":209},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":222},{"uri":"Tungsten","surface_form":"tungsten","offset":273},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":288},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":468},{"uri":"Agar","surface_form":"Agar","offset":618},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":695},{"uri":"Hysteresis","surface_form":"hysteresis","offset":719},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":840},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":849},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":888}]}
