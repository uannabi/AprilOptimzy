{"id":282046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Chigorin","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mikhail Ivanovich Chigorin (Gatchina, Russia, 12 November 1850 \u2013 Lublin, Poland, 25 January 1908) was a leading Russian chess player.\nHe was a major source of inspiration for the \"Soviet school of chess\", which dominated the chess world in the middle and latter parts of the 20th century.\nChigorin was for a while one of the world's top four players. He twice challenged Wilhelm Steinitz for the World Chess Championship. Both matches were held in Havana. In 1889 Steinitz won 10\u00BD\u20136\u00BD, and in 1892 by 12\u00BD\u201310\u00BD. Chigorin drew an 1893 match with Siegbert Tarrasch in Saint Petersburg (11\u201311); Tarrasch was probably the world #2 at that time.\nChigorin made a number of contributions to the theory of chess openings. The most important were the Chigorin Variation of the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3 Na5) and the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6).\nChigorin gave many lectures, wrote magazine articles and chess columns. He subsidised or otherwise supported a number of periodicals to keep them afloat despite low readership levels. He also founded a chess club in Saint Petersburg and tried for many years to establish a chess association, an attempt that finally succeeded just a few years after his death.\nHis early death was caused by diabetes, for which there was no remedy at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gatchina","surface_form":"Gatchina","offset":41},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":51},{"uri":"Lublin","surface_form":"Lublin","offset":78},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":86},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":133},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":193},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Steinitz","surface_form":"Wilhelm Steinitz","offset":384},{"uri":"World_Chess_Championship","surface_form":"World Chess Championship","offset":409},{"uri":"Havana","surface_form":"Havana","offset":461},{"uri":"Siegbert_Tarrasch","surface_form":"Siegbert Tarrasch","offset":555},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg","offset":576},{"uri":"Ruy_Lopez","surface_form":"Ruy Lopez","offset":778},{"uri":"Queen%27s_Gambit","surface_form":"Queen's Gambit","offset":905},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":1330}]}
