{"id":282208,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salama_Moussa","text":"Salama Moussa (1887-1958) () was a notable Egyptian journalist and reformer in the 1920s. He was born in Zagazig. His family was Coptic Christian. Moussa was interested in many areas of science and culture. He strongly believed that human intelligence could create progress and a better life. In 1908, he travelled to Europe and studied literature, philosophy, social and natural sciences. He continued studying these subjects throughout his life.\nLanguage.\nMoussa belonged to a group of intellectuals who wanted to simplify Arabic and its grammar. They wanted Egyptian Arabic to officially become the Modern Egyptian language. His conservative opponents became angry with him. Standard Arabic had not changed for generations. Most Egyptian people could not read or write that Standard Arabic. Therefore, Moussa and other thinkers said people should write in the common, local Arabic. People still discuss making language simpler and more modern in Egypt. Salama Moussa's writings continue to be popular.\nInfluence on other writers.\nSalama Moussa was a mentor of Naguib Mahfouz. Mahfouz was an Egyptian Nobel prize-winner in literature. Moussa told Mahfouz: \"You have much talent, but your essays are no good.\" After that, Mahfouz chose his topics more carefully.\nSalama Moussa became seriously ill and died on 4 August 1958.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Writer"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":43},{"uri":"Zagazig","surface_form":"Zagazig","offset":105},{"uri":"Coptic_Christian","surface_form":"Coptic Christian","offset":129},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":318},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":337},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":349},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"social","offset":361},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"natural","offset":372},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":525},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":540},{"uri":"Egyptian_Arabic","surface_form":"Egyptian Arabic","offset":561},{"uri":"Standard_Arabic","surface_form":"Standard Arabic","offset":678},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":949},{"uri":"Naguib_Mahfouz","surface_form":"Naguib Mahfouz","offset":1063},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel prize-winner","offset":1103}]}
