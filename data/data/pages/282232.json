The name comes from the dish in which the eggs are cooked.\nProcess.\nThe eggs are placed in small dishes called ramekins with a knob of butter on top and baked at 180\u00B0C (350\u00B0F) until the white is set, but the yolk remains soft, which takes around 15 minutes.\nVariations.\nVariations involve replacing the butter with various types of cream. Provence and Normandy have their own versions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":51},{"uri":"Egg_white","surface_form":"white","offset":99},{"uri":"Egg_yolk","surface_form":"yolk","offset":123},{"uri":"Ramekin","surface_form":"ramekin","offset":240},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":264},{"uri":"%C2%B0C","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":294},{"uri":"%C2%B0F","surface_form":"\u00B0F","offset":301},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":461},{"uri":"Provence","surface_form":"Provence","offset":468},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":481}]}
