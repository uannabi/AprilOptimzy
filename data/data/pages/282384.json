{"id":282384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brillat-Savarin_cheese","text":"e=\"preserve\">Brillat-Savarin is a soft, white-crusted cow's milk cheese with at least 75% fat in dry matter (roughly 40% overall), named after the 18th century French gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. The cheese was created in the 1930s by cheese-maker Henri Androu\u00EBt.\nBrillat-Savarin is produced all year round, mainly in Normandy. It comes in 12\u201313\u00A0cm wheels and approximately 4\u00A0cm thick, and is aged for one to two weeks. It is also available as a fresh cheese (non affine) that resembles rich cream cheese.\nIt is a triple cream Brie that is creamy and faintly sour. It goes well with medjool dates and also champagne. Because of its creaminess combined with its Brie aroma and slight sharpness, it has been described as \"Dairylea for grownups\" or \"what Dairylea tastes like in heaven\".\nPairing with red wines is difficult, as any mushroominess or \"mouldy\" taste will bring out the tannins of the wine. Brillat-Savarin is also quite salty when ripe, which may disturb the taste of red wine. It does pair well with Pale Ale and Champagne. The carbonation wipes the fattiness from the palate and the malts enhance the creaminess of the cheese.\nThe French cheese making company Rouzaire also produces an older Brillat Savarin under the name Pierre Robert. The extra aging time concentrates the proteins and salt in the cheese, resulting in deeper earthy flavours and more intense salty taste. Wheels of Pierre Robert are physically shorter (due to loss of moisture), yet creamier than the regular-aged Brillat-Savarin.\nReferences.\n[http://www.fatchancemedia.com/2007/02/brillat-savarin.html Description and history of Brillat Savarin cheese]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":65},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":160},{"uri":"Jean_Anthelme_Brillat-Savarin","surface_form":"Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin","offset":175},{"uri":"Henri_Androuet","surface_form":"Henri Androu\u00EBt","offset":258},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":328},{"uri":"Cream_cheese","surface_form":"cream cheese","offset":502},{"uri":"Triple_cream","surface_form":"triple cream","offset":524},{"uri":"Brie_(cheese)","surface_form":"Brie","offset":537},{"uri":"Medjool","surface_form":"medjool","offset":593},{"uri":"Champagne_(wine)","surface_form":"champagne","offset":616},{"uri":"Dairylea","surface_form":"Dairylea","offset":730}]}
