It sometimes credited to French chef Adolphe Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9, who invented several other dishes. However, as Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9 was only ten years old when Albufera fell out of favour with the king, and had his French title of nobility taken away, it is more likely that Poularde Albufera was created by Antonin Car\u00EAme, who trained Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9\nIt consists of poached chicken with a garnish of vol-au-vents filled with quenelles, cocks' kidneys, mushrooms and truffles in Albufera sauce.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Louis_Gabriel_Suchet","surface_form":"Duke of Albufera","offset":91},{"uri":"Adolphe_Dugl%C3%A9r%C3%A9","surface_form":"Adolphe Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9","offset":146},{"uri":"Antonin_Car%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Antonin Car\u00EAme","offset":394},{"uri":"Poaching","surface_form":"poached","offset":445},{"uri":"Vol-au-vent","surface_form":"vol-au-vent","offset":479},{"uri":"Quenelle","surface_form":"quenelle","offset":504},{"uri":"Albufera_Sauce","surface_form":"Albufera sauce","offset":557}]}
