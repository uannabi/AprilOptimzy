{"id":282388,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albufera_sauce","text":"=\"preserve\">Albufera sauce (known in French as \"Sauce Albuf\u00E9ra\") is a minor sauce whose mother sauce is velout\u00E9. It was probably created by Antonin Careme, to accompany Poularde Albufera, which he also created. It was named in honour of the Duke of Albufera.\nEscoffier gives a recipe in \"Le Guide culinaire\" which consists of a base of Supr\u00EAme Sauce to which is added meat glaze in order to lend the latter an ivory-white tint which characterizes it. It is served chiefly with poultry and sweetbreads.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mother_sauce","surface_form":"mother sauce","offset":88},{"uri":"Velout%C3%A9","surface_form":"velout\u00E9","offset":104},{"uri":"Poularde_Albufera","surface_form":"Poularde Albufera","offset":169},{"uri":"Louis_Gabriel_Suchet","surface_form":"Duke of Albufera","offset":241},{"uri":"Escoffier","surface_form":"Escoffier","offset":259},{"uri":"Supr%C3%AAme_Sauce","surface_form":"Supr\u00EAme Sauce","offset":336},{"uri":"Meat_glaze","surface_form":"meat glaze","offset":368}]}
