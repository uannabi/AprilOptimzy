{"id":282392,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_in_the_Box","text":"Jack in the Box is an American fast food restaurant chain. It was founded in 1951 by Robert O. Peterson. Peterson opened his restaurant in Long Beach, California on the Pacific Coast highway. It featured a clown's head on top of the building. Instead of using carhops like other drive-in restaurants, Peterson used a two-way intercom. He also pioneered the drive-through. It allowed a customer to place their order while the car ahead of them was picking up their order. This made service much faster and Jack in the Box became known for fast service.\nJack in the Box has over 2,200 restaurants in 21 states and Guam. At first the menu was simple. Only 15 items were offered including hamburgers, cheeseburgers, french fries and soft drinks. Today the menu is expanded to include items such as onion rings, chicken tacos and shrimp. They also offer ice cream, shakes and hot apple turnovers.\nJack I. Box is a fictional character and the mascot for their advertising.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["company"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":22},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":31},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":41},{"uri":"Chain_store","surface_form":"chain","offset":52},{"uri":"Robert_O._Peterson","surface_form":"Robert O.
