She outsold artists including Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. She also became the first female artist to have two singles \"Foolish\" at number one and \"What's Luv?\" (with Fat Joe) at number two. Ashanti also became the first artist to have three top ten songs (\"Foolish\", \"What's Luv?\" and \"Always on Time\") on the Hot 100 the same week.
