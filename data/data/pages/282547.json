Other names for the festival are Sanfermines or Sanferminak. It starts at noon on 6 July with the setting off of a rocket. It ends at midnight on 14 July with the singing of the \"Pobre de M\u00ED\". A bullfight is also part of the celebrations. The festival honors Saint Fermin, the co-patron of Navarre. San Ferm\u00EDn has become the most famous Spanish festival. More than 1,000,000 people watch this festival.\nThe Running of the Bulls is held the 6th - 14th of July every year. By midnight on July 6th Pamplona is already swarming with locals and tourist<nowiki/>s all waiting for the fireworks display that marks the start of the fiesta.\nThe day begins with the \"encierro\" or running of the bulls, when only the brave and foolish dash ahead of the bulls that are let loose to run through the narrow street<nowiki/>s to the bullring where they will be fought later in the day. The runners are usually clad in the typical white trousers and shirt, with a red scarf tied at their neck, and a red beret on their head.\nBefore and after the daily bullfights, held each evening at 6 pm, bands of music, \"txistularis\", regional dancing and processions with big giant head<nowiki/>s roam the streets. The Sanfermines festival of the running of the bulls in Pamplona is not the only one celebrated in Navarre, although it is the most well-known.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":4},{"uri":"San","surface_form":"San","offset":16},{"uri":"Pamplona","surface_form":"Pamplona","offset":60},{"uri":"Navarre","surface_form":"Navarre","offset":70},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":79},{"uri":"Noon","surface_form":"noon","offset":161},{"uri":"Setting_off","surface_form":"setting off","offset":185},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":202},{"uri":"Bullfight","surface_form":"bullfight","offset":282},{"uri":"Saint_Fermin","surface_form":"Saint Fermin","offset":346},{"uri":"Patron","surface_form":"patron","offset":367},{"uri":"Spanish_festival","surface_form":"Spanish festival","offset":424},{"uri":"Running_of_the_Bulls","surface_form":"Running of the Bulls","offset":494},{"uri":"Midnight","surface_form":"midnight","offset":561},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":627},{"uri":"Firework","surface_form":"firework","offset":665},{"uri":"Fiesta","surface_form":"fiesta","offset":711},{"uri":"The_brave","surface_form":"the brave and foolish","offset":789},{"uri":"Narrow_street","surface_form":"narrow street","offset":873},{"uri":"Bullring","surface_form":"bullring","offset":904},{"uri":"Bullfighting","surface_form":"fought","offset":932},{"uri":"Scarf","surface_form":"scarf","offset":1038},{"uri":"Beret","surface_form":"beret","offset":1074},{"uri":"Dancing","surface_form":"dancing","offset":1201},{"uri":"Giant_head","surface_form":"giant head","offset":1234},{"uri":"Navarre","surface_form":"Navarre","offset":1372},{"uri":"Well-known","surface_form":"well-known","offset":1405}]}
