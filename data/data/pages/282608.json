{"id":282608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ranhofer","text":"Charles Ranhofer (November 7, 1836, Saint-Denis, France \u2014 October 9, 1899, New York) was the chef at the famous Delmonico's Restaurant in New York from 1862 to 1876 and 1879 to 1896. Ranhofer wrote \"The Epicurean\", (1894), a cookbook of over 1,000 pages, similar in scope to Escoffier's \"Le Guide Culinaire\".\nCareer.\nRanhofer was sent to Paris at the age of 12 to begin his training by studying pastry-making, and at 16 became the private chef for the prince d'H\u00E9nin, comte d'Alsace. In 1856 he moved to New York to become the chef for the Russian consul, and later worked in Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.\nHe returned to France in 1860 for a short time, where he arranged balls for the court of Napoleon III at the Tuileries Palace, but then came back to New York to work at what was then a fashionable location, \"Maison Dor\u00E9e\". In 1862, Lorenzo Delmonico hired him for Delmonico's Restaurant, and it was there that Ranhofer made his real fame, though others say that he made the fame of the restaurant as well. At that time, Delmonico's was considered the finest restaurant in the United States. He was the chef at Delmonico's until his retirement in 1896, except for a short break from 1876 and 1879 when he owned the \"Hotel American\" at Enghien-les-Bains.\nRecipes.\n\"Many others may be found under \"List of foods named after people.\"\nRanhofer did not invent baked Alaska, but he popularized it in 1876 when he named it in honor of the newly acquired Alaskan territory.\nDeath.\nRanhofer and his wife Rose had five children: three sons and two daughters. He died at home of Bright's Disease in 1899. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saint-Denis","surface_form":"Saint-Denis","offset":36},{"uri":"Chef","surface_form":"chef","offset":93},{"uri":"Delmonico%27s_Restaurant","surface_form":"Delmonico's Restaurant","offset":112},{"uri":"Auguste_Escoffier","surface_form":"Escoffier's","offset":275},{"uri":"Le_Guide_Culinaire","surface_form":"Le Guide Culinaire","offset":288},{"uri":"Napoleon_III_of_France","surface_form":"Napoleon III","offset":699},{"uri":"Tuileries_Palace","surface_form":"Tuileries Palace","offset":719},{"uri":"Lorenzo_Delmonico","surface_form":"Lorenzo Delmonico","offset":842},{"uri":"Enghien-les-Bains","surface_form":"Enghien-les-Bains","offset":1244},{"uri":"List_of_foods_named_after_people","surface_form":"List of foods named after people","offset":1305},{"uri":"Baked_Alaska","surface_form":"baked Alaska","offset":1364},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":1456},{"uri":"Bright%27s_Disease","surface_form":"Bright's Disease","offset":1577},{"uri":"Woodlawn_Cemetery%2C_Bronx","surface_form":"Woodlawn Cemetery","offset":1620}]}
