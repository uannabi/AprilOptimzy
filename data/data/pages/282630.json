{"id":282630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirochaete","text":"Spirochaetes (or Spirochetes) are the phylum Spirochaetae. These are double-membrane bacteria with long, helically coiled (spiral-shaped) cells.\nSpirochaetes are bacteria. They have flagella, which run lengthwise between the cell wall and outer membrane. The flagella cause a twisting motion which moves the spirochaete about.\nMost spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic, but there are many parasitic species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":38},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":85},{"uri":"Helix","surface_form":"helically","offset":105},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":162},{"uri":"Flagella","surface_form":"flagella","offset":182},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":225},{"uri":"Anaerobic","surface_form":"anaerobic","offset":365},{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":395}]}
