In this early experiment dead \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\" of the virulent strain type III-S, when injected along with living but non-virulent type II-R pneumococci, resulted in a deadly infection of type III-S pneumococci.\nAt that time it was thought protein might be the hereditary material. In their paper in 1944, Avery and his colleagues suggest that DNA, rather than protein was the hereditary material of bacteria, and could be analogous to genes and/or viruses in higher organisms.\nThis was an epoch-making experiment, but the three men did not get the Nobel Prize. The Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius said that Avery was the most deserving scientist not to receive the Nobel Prize for his work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oswald_Avery","surface_form":"Oswald Avery","offset":61},{"uri":"Colin_MacLeod","surface_form":"Colin MacLeod","offset":75},{"uri":"Maclyn_McCarty","surface_form":"Maclyn McCarty","offset":94},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":115},{"uri":"Transformation_(genetics)","surface_form":"bacterial transformation","offset":148},{"uri":"Rockefeller_Institute_for_Medical_Research","surface_form":"Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research","offset":247},{"uri":"Griffith%27s_experiment","surface_form":"Griffith's experiment","offset":396},{"uri":"Streptococcus_pneumoniae","surface_form":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","offset":458},{"uri":"Virulent","surface_form":"virulent","offset":491},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":781},{"uri":"Hereditary","surface_form":"hereditary","offset":814},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":837},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":873},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":886},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":986},{"uri":"Arne_Tiselius","surface_form":"Arne Tiselius","offset":1018}]}
