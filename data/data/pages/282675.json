{"id":282675,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(restaurant)","text":"Subway is a corporation that operates a large chain of fast food restaurants. These restaurants mainly sell Submarine sandwiches, but also pizzas and salads. The name \"Subway\" comes from the New York City Subway, a public transport system in New York City, and many restaurants are decorated with historic photographs and maps of the subway system.\nThe first Subway outside of North America opened in Bahrain, in December 1984. Today, there are more than 44,000 Subway locations in 112 countries across the world, making it the world's largest fast food restaurant chain by number of stores. It has more stores than McDonald's, but McDonald's earns more revenue than Subway.\nSince 2007, Subway has consistently ranked in Entrepreneur Magazines' top 500 franchise list. It also ranked 2nd on the \"Fastest Growing Franchise\" lists. In March 2011, Subway was named \"the most loved fast food chain in the US\" by Amplicate.com.\nRegional variations.\nSubway formerly had 23 kosher restaurants in Israel. All were closed by 2004. In the United States, there used to be 12 locations with kosher food. As of 2011 only 5 were open.\nSubway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef and pork products in deference to Hindu and Muslim beliefs respectively. Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":12},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":55},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":65},{"uri":"Submarine_sandwich","surface_form":"Submarine sandwich","offset":108},{"uri":"Pizza","surface_form":"pizza","offset":139},{"uri":"Salad","surface_form":"salad","offset":150},{"uri":"New_York_City_Subway","surface_form":"New York City Subway","offset":191},{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"public transport","offset":215},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":242},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":306},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":322},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":486},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":616},{"uri":"Revenue","surface_form":"revenue","offset":654},{"uri":"Kosher","surface_form":"kosher","offset":967},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":989},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1029},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1159},{"uri":"New_Delhi","surface_form":"New Delhi","offset":1176},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":1228},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":1237},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":1267},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":1277},{"uri":"Lovely_Professional_University","surface_form":"Lovely Professional University","offset":1369},{"uri":"Jalandhar","surface_form":"Jalandhar","offset":1409},{"uri":"Punjab%2C_India","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":1420}]}
