{"id":282696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_insect","text":"The family Phylliidae (often misspelt 'Phyllidae') includes the living true leaf insects or walking leaves, which include some of the most remarkable leaf mimics in the entire animal kingdom. They occur from South Asia through Southeast Asia to Australia. There are different views about their taxonomy.\nCharacteristics.\nLeaf insects use camouflage to take on the appearance of a leaf. They do this so accurately that predators often cannot distinguish them from real leaves. In some species the edge of the leaf insect's body even has the appearance of bite marks. To further confuse predators, when the leaf insect walks, it rocks back and forth, to mimic a real leaf being blown by the wind.\nThey and stick insects go together in the Order Phasmatodea.\nThe scholar Antonio Pigafetta may have been the first to document the creature. Sailing with Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigational expedition, he studied and chronicled the fauna on the island of Cimbonbon as the fleet hauled ashore for repairs.\nSee also.\nStick insect","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extant_taxon","surface_form":"living","offset":64},{"uri":"Mimicry","surface_form":"mimics","offset":155},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":208},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":227},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":245},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":294},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"camouflage","offset":338},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":418},{"uri":"Stick_insect","surface_form":"stick insect","offset":704},{"uri":"Phasmatodea","surface_form":"Phasmatodea","offset":743},{"uri":"Antonio_Pigafetta","surface_form":"Antonio Pigafetta","offset":768},{"uri":"Ferdinand_Magellan","surface_form":"Ferdinand Magellan","offset":849},{"uri":"Circumnavigation","surface_form":"circumnavigation","offset":870},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":931},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":944},{"uri":"Stick_insect","surface_form":"Stick insect","offset":1014}]}
