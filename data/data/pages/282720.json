{"id":282720,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grylloblattidae","text":"Grylloblattidae is a family of extremophile and wingless insects that live in the cold on top of mountains.\nThey are commonly called grylloblattids, but are also sometimes called ice crawlers or icebugs.\nMost are nocturnal and appear to feed on detritus (rubbish). They have long antennae (23\u201345 segments) and long cerci (appendages on the rear; 5\u20138 segments), but no wings.\nTheir closest living relatives are the recently-discovered Mantophasmatidae.\nThe family is placed in its own suborder, Grylloblattodea, and sometimes in its own order, Grylloblattaria. It contains 5 genera and 25 species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":21},{"uri":"Extremophile","surface_form":"extremophile","offset":31},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":57},{"uri":"Detritus","surface_form":"detritus","offset":245},{"uri":"Antenna_(biology)","surface_form":"antennae","offset":280},{"uri":"Cercus","surface_form":"cerci","offset":315},{"uri":"Mantophasmatidae","surface_form":"Mantophasmatidae","offset":434},{"uri":"Suborder","surface_form":"suborder","offset":484},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":536}]}
