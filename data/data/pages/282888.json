{"id":282888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_difluoride","text":"Oxygen difluoride is the chemical compound with the formula OF2. It has a V-shaped molecular structure like H2O, but has different properties. It is a strong oxidizer.\nReactions.\nIt is a very powerful oxidizing agent. This is proved by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom. This oxidising number is quite unusual. Above 200 \u00B0C, OF2 decomposes to oxygen and fluorine.\nOF2 reacts with many metals. It produces oxides and fluorides. Nonmetals also react with it. Phosphorus reacts with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3. Sulfur produces SO2 and SF4 with it. A noble gas, xenon also reacts with it. It produces XeF4 and xenon oxyfluorides.\nSafety.\nOF2 is a dangerous chemical. This is because it is highly oxidising.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":25},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":52},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"H2O","offset":108},{"uri":"Oxidizer","surface_form":"oxidizer","offset":158},{"uri":"Oxidation_number","surface_form":"oxidation number","offset":240},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":271},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":418},{"uri":"Fluoride","surface_form":"fluoride","offset":429},{"uri":"Nonmetal","surface_form":"Nonmetal","offset":440},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"Phosphorus","offset":470},{"uri":"Phosphorus_pentafluoride","surface_form":"PF5","offset":505},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"Sulfur","offset":519},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"SO2","offset":535},{"uri":"Sulfur_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"SF4","offset":543},{"uri":"Noble_gas","surface_form":"noble gas","offset":558},{"uri":"Xenon","surface_form":"xenon","offset":569},{"uri":"Xenon_tetrafluoride","surface_form":"XeF4","offset":608}]}
