{"id":28289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Poland","text":"The flag of Poland is a rectangular, divided into two stripes: white above red. It was created in its modern form in 1921. The colors white and red were earlier declared the official national colors in 1831 by the Polish Parliament in 1831.\nFor many centuries the Polish flag was a white eagle on a red background.\nDetails.\nThe ratio of height to width is 5 to 8. The two horizontal stripes are of equal height.\nThere is a second version which has a coat of arms in the upper (white) half. The use of this flag is legally restricted.\nIf the flag is shown hanging vertically, the white should be on the left.\nPolish flag day is May 2.\nThe Color White.\nThe exact color of the white was not clearly stated until 1980.\nThe Color Red.\nThe exact color of the red was not clearly stated originally, and has changed through the years. In 1919 the official act did not clearly define the red. In 1921 the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs used crimson as the shade of red in publications. In 1928 the president of Poland said the red should be vermilion. That was used until 1980, when people needed to specify the red more scientifically.\nSimilar flags in other places.\nThe same flag design is used in the German region Thuringia and the Spanish region Cantabria.\nBoth Indonesia and Monaco have flags that are the same colors, but upside-down.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crimson","surface_form":"crimson","offset":937},{"uri":"Vermilion","surface_form":"vermilion","offset":1037},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":1200},{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":1214},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1232},{"uri":"Cantabria","surface_form":"Cantabria","offset":1247},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":1263},{"uri":"Monaco","surface_form":"Monaco","offset":1277}]}
