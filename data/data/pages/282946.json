{"id":282946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_Trial","text":"__NOTOC__\nThe Ministries Trial (or, officially, \"The United States of America vs. Ernst von Weizs\u00E4cker, et al.\") was the eleventh of the twelve trials for war crimes the US authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Nuremberg after the end of World War II.\nDisagreements between the Allies meant only one trial was held by the International Military Tribunal (IMT). Other trials were held by the Allies in their own zones of occupation. The Americans held twelve trials, in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice as the IMT. These twelve trials are known as the \"Subsequent Nuremberg Trials\" or, more formally, as the \"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals\" (NMT).\nThis case is also known as the Wilhelmstrasse Trial, because the German Foreign Office was on the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. The defendants in this case were officials of various \"Reich\" ministries, facing various charges for their jobs in Nazi Germany and responsibility for the numerous atrocities committed both in Germany and in occupied countries during the war.\nThe judges in this case, heard before Military Tribunal IV, were William C. Christianson (presiding judge) from Minnesota, Robert F. Maguire from Oregon, and Leon W. Powers from Iowa. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Telford Taylor; the chief prosecutor was Robert Kempner. The indictment was filed on November 15, 1947; the hearings lasted from January 6, 1948 until November 18 that year, and then the judges took a whole five months to compile their 833-page judgment, which they presented on April 11, 1949. The sentences were handed down on April 13, 1949. Of all the twelve trials, this was the one that lasted longest and ended last. Of the 21 defendants arraigned, two were acquitted, the others were found guilty on at least one count of the indictment and received prison sentences ranging from three years including time served to 25 years' imprisonment.\nDefendants.\nStuckart was tried again in 1950 before a denazification court and sentenced as a \"Mitl\u00E4ufer\" (follower) a fine of DM 50,000.\nHerbert Ernst Backe, the former minister for agriculture who should also have been tried, committed suicide on April 6, 1947 while in custody awaiting the trial.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":155},{"uri":"Nuremberg","surface_form":"Nuremberg","offset":229},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":256},{"uri":"International_Military_Tribunal","surface_form":"International Military Tribunal","offset":340},{"uri":"Palace_of_Justice_(Nuremberg)","surface_form":"Palace of Justice","offset":509},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Trials","surface_form":"Subsequent Nuremberg Trials","offset":577},{"uri":"Foreign_Office_of_Germany","surface_form":"German Foreign Office","offset":770},{"uri":"Wilhelmstrasse","surface_form":"Wilhelmstrasse","offset":803},{"uri":"Third_Reich","surface_form":"Reich","offset":884},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":944},{"uri":"William_C._Christianson","surface_form":"William C.
