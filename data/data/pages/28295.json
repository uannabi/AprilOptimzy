{"id":28295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque","text":"In physics, torque is the tendency of a force to turn or twist. If a force is used to begin to spin an object, or to stop an object from spinning, a torque is made.\nThe force applied to a lever, multiplied by the distance from the lever's fulcrum, multiplied again by the sine of the angle created, is described as torque. This is also known as \"r cross f,\" or \"force times fulcrum distance times sine theta.\"\nFulcrum.\nFulcrum is the axis of rotation or point of support on which a lever turns in raising or moving something.\nEquation.\nwhere F is the net force vector and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting. The Greek letter Tau is used to represent torque.\nThe units of torque are force multiplied by distance. The SI unit of torque is the newton-metre. The most common English unit is the foot-pound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":3},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":40},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":95},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":103},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"lever","offset":188},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":213},{"uri":"Fulcrum","surface_form":"fulcrum","offset":239},{"uri":"Sine","surface_form":"sine","offset":272},{"uri":"Cross_product","surface_form":"cross","offset":348},{"uri":"Axis_(mathematics)","surface_form":"axis","offset":434},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotation","offset":442},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":561},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek letter","offset":658},{"uri":"Tau","surface_form":"Tau","offset":671},{"uri":"Newton-metre","surface_form":"newton-metre","offset":787},{"uri":"Foot-pound","surface_form":"foot-pound","offset":837}]}
