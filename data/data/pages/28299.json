{"id":28299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm","text":"=\"preserve\">Warm is the opposite of cool.\nWhen objects get warm, more energy is stored in them. When an object is heated, its molecules move faster. Heat always goes from a warmer object to a colder object; it never goes in the opposite way. A person usually feels good when they are warm, but they do not like to be too warm, because this may become uncomfortable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cold","surface_form":"cool","offset":36},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":114},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":126},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"Heat","offset":149},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":244}]}
