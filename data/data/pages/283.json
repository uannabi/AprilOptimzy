{"id":283,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine","text":"=\"preserve\">If someone is found guilty of a crime, their punishment may be to pay a fine, a certain amount of money. In many countries, fines can be ordered by police, court judges and some government officers.\nWhen agreeing to a contract with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so. For example, when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by Friday, they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday, they must pay a $50 fine to the business.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Guilt_(law)","surface_form":"guilty","offset":32},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":44},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":57},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":110},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":174},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":201},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":230},{"uri":"Car_rental","surface_form":"hires a car","offset":400}]}
