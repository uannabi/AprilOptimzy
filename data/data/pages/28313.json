{"id":28313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovan_language","text":"=\"preserve\">Moldovan () is the official language of Moldova. It is almost the same as Romanian. The main difference is that Moldovan was written in the Cyrillic alphabet because Moldova was part of the Soviet Union until 1989. In 1989, Moldova became its own country and started to use the Latin alphabet, which is used in Romania. On 5 December 2013, the Moldovan government chose Romanian as the official language.\nIn the unrecognized state of Transnistria, one of the official languages is still Moldovan and is still written with the Cyrillic alphabet. The other official languages are Russian and Ukrainian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":31},{"uri":"Moldova","surface_form":"Moldova","offset":52},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":86},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":152},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":202},{"uri":"1989","surface_form":"1989","offset":221},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":290},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":323},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":398},{"uri":"Unrecognized_state","surface_form":"unrecognized state","offset":424},{"uri":"Transnistria","surface_form":"Transnistria","offset":446},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":590},{"uri":"Ukrainian_language","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":602}]}
