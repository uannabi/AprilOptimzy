{"id":283154,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts","text":"The visual arts are art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. The visual arts (also known as the plastic arts) produce objects. They are contrasted with the performing arts.\nExamples are ceramics, drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking. Also, modern visual arts which use technology: photography, video, filmmaking and architecture.\nThese definitions should not be taken too strictly as many artistic disciplines (performing arts, conceptual art, textile arts) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types. Movies and performing arts, for example, make use of set and costume design, sometimes by prominent artists.\nAlso included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and decorative art.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Visual","surface_form":"visual","offset":68},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":143},{"uri":"Performing_arts","surface_form":"performing arts","offset":181},{"uri":"Ceramics","surface_form":"ceramics","offset":211},{"uri":"Drawing","surface_form":"drawing","offset":221},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":230},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":240},{"uri":"Printmaking","surface_form":"printmaking","offset":251},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":299},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":311},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":324},{"uri":"Filmmaking","surface_form":"filmmaking","offset":331},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":346},{"uri":"Conceptual_art","surface_form":"conceptual art","offset":458},{"uri":"Textile_arts","surface_form":"textile arts","offset":474},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"Movie","offset":555},{"uri":"Applied_arts","surface_form":"applied arts","offset":709},{"uri":"Industrial_design","surface_form":"industrial design","offset":730},{"uri":"Graphic_design","surface_form":"graphic design","offset":749},{"uri":"Fashion_design","surface_form":"fashion design","offset":765},{"uri":"Interior_design","surface_form":"interior design","offset":781},{"uri":"Decoration","surface_form":"decorative art","offset":801}]}
