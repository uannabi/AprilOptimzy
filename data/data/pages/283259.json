{"id":283259,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill%2C_North_Carolina","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chapel Hill is a town in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It has about 50,000 people. It is in an area called The Triangle, because it is next to Raleigh and Durham.\nGeography.\nChapel Hill is in southeastern Orange County. It is southwest of Durham and northwest of Raleigh. Interstate 40 goes north and east of Chapel Hill, while highways 15-501 and 54 go through it.\nHistory.\nChapel Hill got its name from a chapel on a hill, that was around in the 1700s. In 1792, The University of North Carolina (UNC) was started, which helped Chapel Hill grow. But it was a small town until the 1950s, when it started growing faster, like the rest of The Triangle. By 1970, it had 25,000 people. Since then, Chapel Hill has been somewhat rich. The town was the place where the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting happened, which some newspapers described as Islamophobic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":42},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":56},{"uri":"Raleigh%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Raleigh","offset":160},{"uri":"Durham%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Durham","offset":172},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"County","offset":229},{"uri":"Interstate_40","surface_form":"Interstate 40","offset":289},{"uri":"Highway","surface_form":"highways","offset":345},{"uri":"Chapel","surface_form":"chapel","offset":424},{"uri":"University_of_North_Carolina","surface_form":"University of North Carolina","offset":485},{"uri":"2015_Chapel_Hill_shooting","surface_form":"2015 Chapel Hill shooting","offset":780},{"uri":"Islamophobic","surface_form":"Islamophobic","offset":851}]}
