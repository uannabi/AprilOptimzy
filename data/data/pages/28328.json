{"id":28328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance","text":"The electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty of passing an electric current through a substance. It explains the relationship between voltage (amount of electrical pressure) and the current (flow of electricity). With more resistance in a circuit, less electricity will flow through the circuit. The inverse of resistance is conductance, a measure not much used. All objects have some resistance, except superconductors.\nCalculating resistance.\nwhere formula_1 is the length of the conductor, measured in meters [m], formula_1 is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in square meters [m\u00B2], and (Greek: rho) is the electrical resistivity (also called \"specific electrical resistance\") of the material, measured in ohm-meters (\u03A9\u00A0m).\nCalculate the resistance of copper wire with a radius of 2mm and a length of 5 meters.\nBecause: formula_1\nformula_1\nApplications.\nResistors are used in electrical circuits to provide electrical resistance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":98},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":173},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":221},{"uri":"Superconductor","surface_form":"superconductors","offset":443},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":544},{"uri":"Cross_section_(geometry)","surface_form":"cross-sectional","offset":573},{"uri":"Square_meter","surface_form":"square meter","offset":623},{"uri":"Rho_(letter)","surface_form":"rho","offset":655},{"uri":"Resistivity","surface_form":"resistivity","offset":678},{"uri":"Resistor","surface_form":"Resistor","offset":914},{"uri":"Electrical_circuit","surface_form":"electrical circuit","offset":936}]}
