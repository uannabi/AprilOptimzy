{"id":28331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction","text":"Electromagnetic induction is where a voltage or current is produced in a conductor by a changing magnetic flux. It may happen when a magnet is moved in a solenoid, thus changing the magnetic flux.\nMagnetic flux.\nWhen a coiled wire is introduced near a magnet, the magnetic lines of force pass through the coil. This causes the magnetic flux to change.\nMagnetic flux is represented by the symbol formula_1, therefore we can say that formula_1 = BAcos(a) and the resulting unit will be formula_1, where T is the unit for magnetic field and formula_1 is the unit for area.\nThe changing magnetic flux generates an electromotive force (EMF). This force moves free electrons in a certain way, which constitute a current.\nFaraday's law.\nMichael Faraday found that an electromotive force is generated when there is a change in magnetic flux in a conductor.\nformula_1\nformula_1 is the electromotive force, measured in volts;\nformula_1 is the change in magnetic flux, measured in webers;\nformula_1 is the change in time, measured in seconds.\nformula_1\nN is the number of loops in the solenoid.\nLenz's law.\nThe negative sign in both equation above is a result of Lenz's law, named after Heinrich Lenz. His law states that the electromotive force (EMF) produces a current that opposes the motion of the changing magnetic flux.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":37},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":48},{"uri":"Electrical_conductor","surface_form":"conductor","offset":73},{"uri":"Magnetic_flux","surface_form":"magnetic flux","offset":97},{"uri":"Solenoid","surface_form":"solenoid","offset":154},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"electromotive force","offset":610},{"uri":"Electrons","surface_form":"electrons","offset":659},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":706},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":730},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"electromotive force","offset":760},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"volt","offset":909},{"uri":"Weber","surface_form":"weber","offset":970},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":1023},{"uri":"Solenoid","surface_form":"solenoid","offset":1074},{"uri":"Lenz%27s_law","surface_form":"Lenz's law","offset":1152},{"uri":"Heinrich_Lenz","surface_form":"Heinrich Lenz","offset":1176},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"electromotive force","offset":1215},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":1252}]}
