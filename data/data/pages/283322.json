As \"chef de bataillon\" he was present at the Siege of Toulon in 1793, where he took General O'Hara prisoner.\nSuchet was one of the few senior French officers serving in Spain who managed to preserve their reputation intact.\nIn the campaigns of 1805 and 1806 he greatly enhanced his reputation at Austerlitz, Saalfeld, Jena, Pu\u0142tusk and Ostrolenka. He obtained the title of count on 19 March 1808, married on 16 November of the same year Mlle. Honorine Anthoine de Saint-Joseph (Marseille, 26 February 1790 \u2013 Paris, 13 April 1884), a niece of Julie Clary, the wife of Joseph Bonaparte, and soon afterwards was ordered to Spain. He was named commander of the army of Aragon and governor of that region, and in two years brought the area into complete submission. Beaten by the Spanish at Alca\u00F1iz, he sprung back and soundly defeated the army of Blake at Mar\u00EDa on 14 June 1809, and on 22 April 1810 defeated Henry Joseph O'Donnell, Count of La Bisbal at Lleida.\nHe was made marshal of France (8 July 1811). In 1812 he captured Valencia, for which he was rewarded with the ducal victory title of \"duc d'Albufera da Valencia\" in 1813.\nThe restored Bourbon king Louis XVIII made him a peer of France on 4 June, with a seat in the upper house, but, having commanded one of Napoleon's armies on the Alpine frontier during the Hundred Days, he was deprived of his peerage on 24 July 1815. He died near Marseille on 3 January 1826.\nFoods.\nCar\u00EAme named several dishes after Albufera, including","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Albufera","surface_form":"Albufera","offset":32},{"uri":"Marshal_of_France","surface_form":"Marshal of France","offset":79},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":108},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":178},{"uri":"Manufacturer","surface_form":"manufacturer","offset":183},{"uri":"Lyon","surface_form":"Lyon","offset":199},{"uri":"Siege_of_Toulon","surface_form":"Siege of Toulon","offset":441},{"uri":"Charles_O%27Hara","surface_form":"General O'Hara","offset":480},{"uri":"Battle_of_Austerlitz","surface_form":"Austerlitz","offset":692},{"uri":"Battle_of_Saalfeld","surface_form":"Saalfeld","offset":704},{"uri":"Battle_of_Jena-Auerstedt","surface_form":"Jena","offset":714},{"uri":"Battle_of_Pu%C5%82tusk","surface_form":"Pu\u0142tusk","offset":720},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"count","offset":769},{"uri":"Marseille","surface_form":"Marseille","offset":874},{"uri":"Julie_Clary","surface_form":"Julie Clary","offset":938},{"uri":"Joseph_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Joseph Bonaparte","offset":963},{"uri":"Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":1061},{"uri":"Battle_of_Alca%C3%B1iz","surface_form":"Alca\u00F1iz","offset":1182},{"uri":"Joaqu%C3%ADn_Blake_y_Joyes","surface_form":"Blake","offset":1239},{"uri":"Battle_of_Mar%C3%ADa","surface_form":"Mar\u00EDa","offset":1248},{"uri":"Henry_Joseph_O%27Donnell%2C_Count_of_La_Bisbal","surface_form":"Henry Joseph O'Donnell, Count of La Bisbal","offset":1301},{"uri":"Lleida","surface_form":"Lleida","offset":1347},{"uri":"Valencia_(city_in_Spain)","surface_form":"Valencia","offset":1420},{"uri":"Victory_title","surface_form":"victory title","offset":1471},{"uri":"Louis_XVIII_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XVIII","offset":1552},{"uri":"Peer_of_France","surface_form":"peer of France","offset":1575},{"uri":"Hundred_Days","surface_form":"Hundred Days","offset":1714},{"uri":"Marseille","surface_form":"Marseille","offset":1789},{"uri":"Antonin_Car%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Car\u00EAme","offset":1825}]}
