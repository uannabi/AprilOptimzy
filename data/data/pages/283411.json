{"id":283411,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_wood","text":"Petrified wood (from the Greek root Petro meaning \"rock\" or \"stone\"; literally \"wood turned into stone\") is the name given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. It is the result of a tree having turned completely into stone by the process of per mineralization. All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals (most often a silicate, such as quartz), while retaining the original structure of the wood. Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three dimensional representation of the original organic material.\nThe petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried under sediment and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":144},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":341},{"uri":"Silicate","surface_form":"silicate","offset":364},{"uri":"Quartz","surface_form":"quartz","offset":382},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":437},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":738}]}
