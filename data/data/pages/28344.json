{"id":28344,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor","text":"A conductor is a material which electricity, heat or sound can flow through. An electrical conductor conducts electricity. The ability to conduct electricity is called electrical conductivity.\nMost metals, like iron and copper, are electrical conductors. These metals are used to make wires to carry electric current. Plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity and is used for many purposes but metals are more used.\nImpure water can also conduct electricity. Living tissue<nowiki/>s, as in the human body, are wet and therefore conductors of electricity.\nSome materials are \"semiconductors\". This means that electricity \"can\" flow through them, but not very well.\nSome materials are \"resistors\". This means that they make it very hard for electricity to flow through them.\nA material that stops electric current is called an insulator (electricity). Wires are covered with insulators like plastic to stop the electricity from leaving the wire.\nSome materials when really cold, are superconductors. They offer no resistance at all to the flow of electricity.\nA conductor's resistance tend to get higher when the temperature also gets high.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":32},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":45},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":53},{"uri":"Electrical_conductivity","surface_form":"electrical conductivity","offset":168},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":198},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":211},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":220},{"uri":"Wires","surface_form":"wires","offset":285},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":300},{"uri":"Plasma_(physics)","surface_form":"Plasma","offset":318},{"uri":"Impurity","surface_form":"Impure","offset":422},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":429},{"uri":"Tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":472},{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"human body","offset":500},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":581},{"uri":"Resistors","surface_form":"resistors","offset":690},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":801},{"uri":"Insulator_(electricity)","surface_form":"insulator (electricity)","offset":831},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"Wire","offset":856},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":895},{"uri":"Superconductor","surface_form":"superconductor","offset":987}]}
