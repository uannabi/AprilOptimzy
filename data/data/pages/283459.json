It employs more than 13,800 people and has 339 police stations.\nVictoria Police started in the 1850s. One of their early jobs was to collect licence fees from miners searching for gold. In 1854 the miners at Ballarat refused to pay the fee and built a defensive fort, known as the Eureka Stockade. A military force of the British Army and 94 policemen attacked the stockade. About 30 miners and four soldiers were killed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":25},{"uri":"Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Victoria, Australia","offset":58},{"uri":"Ballarat%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Ballarat","offset":287},{"uri":"Eureka_Stockade","surface_form":"Eureka Stockade","offset":360}]}
