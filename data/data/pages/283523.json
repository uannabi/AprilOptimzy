{"id":283523,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarp_(landform)","text":"Scarp is a term in geology and geography with several similar meanings.\nFormation.\nMost commonly, an escarpment is a transition from one series of sedimentary rocks to another series of a different age and composition.\nEscarpments are also frequently formed by faults. When a fault displaces the ground surface so that one side is higher than the other, a fault scarp is created. This brings a piece of high ground next to an area of lower ground.\nMore loosely, the term scarp describes the zone between coastal lowlands and continental plateaus. A marked, abrupt change in height is caused by coastal erosion at the base of the plateau.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":19},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":31},{"uri":"Sedimentary_rock","surface_form":"sedimentary rock","offset":147},{"uri":"Lowlands","surface_form":"lowlands","offset":512},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":537}]}
