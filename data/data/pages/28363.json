{"id":28363,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language","text":"The Norwegian language is the official language of Norway. It is spoken by over four and a half million people, and it belongs to the group of North Germanic languages which are spoken in Scandinavia. These include Swedish, Danish, Icelandic and Faeroese.\nTwo forms of the language exist: ' (which means \"book language\") and ' (which means \"new Norwegian\").\nOld Norse.\nOld Norse is the language that was spoken hundreds of years ago in Scandinavia at the time of the Vikings. It is very similar to today\u2019s Icelandic language. This is because many Vikings sailed from Norway to Iceland in order to escape from the rule of the Norwegian kings who were making people pay lots of tax.\nBokm\u00E5l.\nDuring the 13th century the Black Death killed two thirds of the population of Norway. The Danish kings and queens noticed that Norway was weak and defenceless, so they annexed Norway (made it part of Denmark). For hundreds of years Norway was ruled by the Danes. All the rulers, priests, estate owners and noblemen were Danish. Many of them settled in Norway. This is why today\u2019s standard Norwegian (Bokm\u00E5l) is similar to Danish. Norwegians were not allowed to print books in Norwegian. Anyone wanting to study had to go to Denmark or Germany.\nIn 1814 Denmark lost a war and had to give Norway to Sweden. Then the Norwegians were allowed to have their own university. Gradually the Danish language was mixed up with the Norwegian dialects and became today\u2019s Norwegian language. Norwegian and Danish look very similar when they are written, but when they are spoken they sound different. In Danish a lot of the sounds are swallowed.\nNynorsk.\nDuring the 19th century a slightly different form of Norwegian was made up by several people. This eventually became known as \u201CNynorsk.\u201D It was based on old forms of Norwegian and dialects. During the 20th century some attempts were made to join Bokm\u00E5l and Nynorsk into one language, but they did not succeed. Today about one person in nine or ten in Norway writes Nynorsk. Children in school have to learn both forms.\nThe Norwegian alphabet.\nThe letters \"c\", \"q\", \"w\", \"x\" and \"z\" are only used for words that have been borrowed from other languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":39},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":51},{"uri":"North_Germanic_languages","surface_form":"North Germanic languages","offset":143},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":188},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":215},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":224},{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic","offset":232},{"uri":"Faroese_language","surface_form":"Faeroese","offset":246},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":467},{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic language","offset":506},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":567},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":577},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":635},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":676},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":700},{"uri":"Black_Death","surface_form":"Black Death","offset":717},{"uri":"Annex","surface_form":"annex","offset":858},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":969},{"uri":"Estate","surface_form":"estate","offset":978},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"noblemen","offset":996},{"uri":"Print","surface_form":"print","offset":1151},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":1157},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1225},{"uri":"1814","surface_form":"1814","offset":1237},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":1287},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":1346},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1420},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1642}]}
