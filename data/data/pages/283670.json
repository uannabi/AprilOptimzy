{"id":283670,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojze_Grozde","text":"Lojze Grozde was a Slovenian student who was killed by partisans during World War II. His death is recognised as martyrdom by the Catholic Church. He was beatified on June 13, 2010.\nEarly life.\nGrozde was born on May 27, 1923 in the village of Gorenje Vodale, Tr\u017Ei\u0161\u010De near Mokronog in Lower Carniola, Slovenia.\nHe was an illegitimate child. When he was four years old, his mother married. His stepfather chased him away each time he wanted to see his mother. Later, because Lojze was a good pupil, the stepfather became friendlier towards him, and so he remained at the house and his aunt took care of him. She saw to his schooling and sent him to a school in Ljubljana, where she was working as a servant. Some benefactors helped her support her nephew. He stayed at the Marijani\u0161\u010De boarding school and attended \"Classical Secondary School\" (\"Klasi\u010Dna gimnazija\") in Ljubljana. There he was an outstanding student; but found time for literary creativity too and so became poet and writer. He was a member of Catholic Action and a member of the Marian Congregation. Towards the end of his high schooling World War II was approaching. Circumstances were becoming increasingly strained. This was also the time when Lojze had to make a decision about his vocation. He sought his path in life through meditation and learning, in deep prayer, and in apostolic work for others.\nDeath.\nDuring his summer vacation of 1942 he did not go home because there was a lot of violence and it was not easy to travel. It was only for New Year 1943 that he decided to visit his relatives. He asked for a permit to travel home. First he visited a friend of his at the village of Struge. On 1 January 1943, the first Friday, he attended mass at the monastery at Sti\u010Dna, where he received communion for the last time in his young life; then travelled by train from Ivan\u010Dna Gorica to Trebnje, where he found he could not travel further because the rails had been destroyed. He decided to continue to Mirna on foot, and on the way he rode in a cart. By the first house at Mirna he had to get out of the cart because a partisan guard seized and interrogated him. On him they found a devotional book, The Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis and a booklet on Our Lady of Fatima. He was taken to a nearby inn and interrogated, tortured, and killed. Three hours earlier the seminarian Janez Ho\u010Devar, who wanted to visit his relatives in nearby \u0160entrupert, had been also shot. Lojze Grozde was suspected of being an informant; the communists saw in him the mentality that they deprecated and persecuted.\nSoon rumors spread about cruel way the Tone Tom\u0161i\u010D Partisan Brigade, which had conquered Mirna, celebrated the New Year.\nSome others maintain that Grozde was not tortured.\nOther sources state that he was tortured.\nOn 23 February 1943 the fate of Lojze Grozde was partly revealed, indicating that he had been tortured. Schoolchildren picking snowdrops found his corpse. Although there were traces of torture on his body, the corpse itself was uncorrupted. His body was taken to nearby \u0160entrupert, where a committee made a report. The body of Lojze Grozde was buried at the cemetery in \u0160entrupert because it was impossible to take it to his home parish of Tr\u017Ei\u0161\u010De under the difficult circumstances of those days. The news of the violent torture and death of this innocent student struck fear among people and shocked the students in Ljubljana.\nBeatification.\nOn the 50th anniversary of the death of Lojze Grozde, the Archdiocese of Ljubljana started a process to recognize his martyrdom and also his beatification and canonization. When Pope John Paul II visited Slovenia for the first time in 1996, he mentioned Lojze Grozde twice. He said, \"The servant of God Lojze Grozde is just one of innumerable innocent victims of Communism that raise the palm of martyrdom as an indelible memory and admonition. He was a disciple of Christ.\" Pope Benedict XVI said that \"saints are not the past, but they represent the present and the future of the Church and society. They fully realized love in truth, which is the highest value in Christian life; their figures are like prisms that in various casts reflect the unique light of Christ.\"\nOn March 27, 2010 the news came from Rome that Pope Benedict XVI had affirmed the martyrdom of Lojze Grozde. Thus a solemn beatification is allowed that took place at the Slovenian eucharistic congress in Celje on June 13, 2010.\nIn his introduction to the biography of Lojze Grozde by Anton Strle, who is also a candidate for sainthood, Taras Kermauner wrote: \"Grozde combines the ardour and apostolate of Friderik Baraga, the asceticism and suffering of Janez Fran\u010Di\u0161ek Gnidovec, a gift for organization, and the Slovenian national consciousness of Blessed Anton Martin Slom\u0161ek... He symbolizes the entire martyrdom suffered by Christians and Catholic Slovenians during World War II and afterwards for their affiliation to their faith... His personality should be returned to the common Slovenian consciousness of heroes that have been praised and elevated to the first plane as the only models. Today a man like Grozde is needed as our model \u2013 a martyr, a saint. Not a man of aggressive military action thinking he will put forward God with arms and the blood of other or foreign people... I do not fear to write that Grozde belongs among the greatest young Slovenians; that his attitude is fitting and most precious.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":19},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":72},{"uri":"Martyrdom","surface_form":"martyrdom","offset":113},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":130},{"uri":"Beatified","surface_form":"beatified","offset":154},{"uri":"Mokronog","surface_form":"Mokronog","offset":273},{"uri":"Lower_Carniola","surface_form":"Lower Carniola","offset":285},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":301},{"uri":"Marijani%C5%A1%C4%8De","surface_form":"Marijani\u0161\u010De","offset":772},{"uri":"Ljubljana","surface_form":"Ljubljana","offset":868},{"uri":"Catholic_Action","surface_form":"Catholic Action","offset":1009},{"uri":"Marian_Congregation","surface_form":"Marian Congregation","offset":1045},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1104},{"uri":"Struge","surface_form":"Struge","offset":1659},{"uri":"First_Friday_Devotions","surface_form":"first Friday","offset":1690},{"uri":"Sti%C4%8Dna","surface_form":"Sti\u010Dna","offset":1741},{"uri":"Ivan%C4%8Dna_Gorica","surface_form":"Ivan\u010Dna Gorica","offset":1843},{"uri":"Trebnje","surface_form":"Trebnje","offset":1861},{"uri":"Mirna%2C_Trebnje","surface_form":"Mirna","offset":1977},{"uri":"The_Imitation_of_Christ_(book)","surface_form":"The Imitation of Christ","offset":2175},{"uri":"Thomas_a_Kempis","surface_form":"Thomas a Kempis","offset":2202},{"uri":"Our_Lady_of_Fatima","surface_form":"Our Lady of Fatima","offset":2235},{"uri":"Janez_Ho%C4%8Devar","surface_form":"Janez Ho\u010Devar","offset":2359},{"uri":"%C5%A0entrupert","surface_form":"\u0160entrupert","offset":2418},{"uri":"Tone_Tom%C5%A1i%C4%8D","surface_form":"Tone Tom\u0161i\u010D","offset":2616},{"uri":"%C5%A0entrupert","surface_form":"\u0160entrupert","offset":3061},{"uri":"%C5%A0entrupert","surface_form":"\u0160entrupert","offset":3161},{"uri":"Archdiocese_of_Ljubljana","surface_form":"Archdiocese of Ljubljana","offset":3492},{"uri":"Beatification","surface_form":"beatification","offset":3575},{"uri":"Canonization","surface_form":"canonization","offset":3593},{"uri":"Christ","surface_form":"Christ","offset":4197},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":4243},{"uri":"Pope_Benedict_XVI","surface_form":"Pope Benedict XVI","offset":4253},{"uri":"Anton_Strle","surface_form":"Anton Strle","offset":4491},{"uri":"Taras_Kermauner","surface_form":"Taras Kermauner","offset":4543},{"uri":"Friderik_Baraga","surface_form":"Friderik Baraga","offset":4612},{"uri":"Janez_Fran%C4%8Di%C5%A1ek_Gnidovec","surface_form":"Janez Fran\u010Di\u0161ek Gnidovec","offset":4661},{"uri":"Anton_Martin_Slom%C5%A1ek","surface_form":"Anton Martin Slom\u0161ek","offset":4764},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":4877}]}
