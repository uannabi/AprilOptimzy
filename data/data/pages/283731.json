Although Alexander I employed Car\u00EAme, this dessert is not claimed by Car\u00EAme. It was possibly first made in Finland, by Swiss pastry chefs in Helsinki in 1818, when Alexander was due to visit. It is also said to be a Latvian dish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":84},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastry","offset":95},{"uri":"Raspberry","surface_form":"raspberry","offset":121},{"uri":"Preserves","surface_form":"preserves","offset":131},{"uri":"Alexander_I_of_Russia","surface_form":"Alexander I","offset":183},{"uri":"Antonin_Car%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Car\u00EAme","offset":204},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":281},{"uri":"Helsinki","surface_form":"Helsinki","offset":315},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":390}]}
