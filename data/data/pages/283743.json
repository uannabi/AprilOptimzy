The table service used for this meal is on display to this day at the oldest existing restaurant in Paris, \"La Tour d'Argent\" which is owned by the descendants of Claudius Burdel, the last owner of Caf\u00E9 Anglais which was demolished in 1913.\nThe evening of 7 June 1867 is reputed to have been the most magnificent ever to have occurred in any restaurant in the world. The three emperors and Prince Bismarck had requested of Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9 a meal that would live in their memories and the \"ma\u00EEtre de cave\", Claudius Burdel, was instructed to accompany the dishes with the greatest wines in the world.\nDishes.\nThe most famous dish attributed to Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9 is almost certainly \"Pommes Anna\". Other dishes created by Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9 include \"Potage Germiny\", a sorrel soup created for the Count of Germiny, governor of the Bank of France, \"Poularde Albufera\", dedicated to Mar\u00E9chal Suchet, Duke of Albufera, \"Souffl\u00E9 \u00E0 l'anglaise\", \"Sole Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9\" and \"Culotte de b\u0153uf Salomon\", (dedicated to Salomon de Rothschild) and \"Barbue \u00E0 la Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9\" (brill in tomato and parsley sauce).\nHe is also credited with inventing \"Tournedos Rossini\", but this dish has also been credited to both Escoffier as well as Car\u00EAme (although not the title itself). It was composer Gioachino Rossini who dubbed Dugl\u00E9r\u00E9 \"Le Mozart de la cuisine\" (The Mozart of the Kitchen). It was a title he used on the menu for the Dinner of the Three Emperors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bordeaux","surface_form":"Bordeaux","offset":22},{"uri":"Chef","surface_form":"French chef","offset":79},{"uri":"Marie-Antoine_Car%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Car\u00EAme","offset":106},{"uri":"Rothschild_family","surface_form":"Rothschild family","offset":176},{"uri":"Palais-Royal","surface_form":"Palais-Royal","offset":271},{"uri":"Provence","surface_form":"Provence","offset":336},{"uri":"Pommes_Anna","surface_form":"Pommes Anna","offset":589},{"uri":"Tsar_Alexander_II","surface_form":"Tsar Alexander II","offset":764},{"uri":"Tsar_Alexander_III","surface_form":"Tsar Alexander III","offset":834},{"uri":"William_I_of_Prussia","surface_form":"William I of Prussia","offset":863},{"uri":"Otto_von_Bismarck","surface_form":"Prince Otto von Bismarck","offset":896},{"uri":"Exposition_universelle","surface_form":"L'Exposition Universelle","offset":944},{"uri":"La_Tour_d%27Argent","surface_form":"La Tour d'Argent","offset":1079},{"uri":"Pommes_Anna","surface_form":"Pommes Anna","offset":1635},{"uri":"Bank_of_France","surface_form":"Bank of France","offset":1771},{"uri":"Poularde_Albufera","surface_form":"Poularde Albufera","offset":1788},{"uri":"Tournedos_Rossini","surface_form":"Tournedos Rossini","offset":2062},{"uri":"Auguste_Escoffier","surface_form":"Escoffier","offset":2127},{"uri":"Antoine_Car%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Car\u00EAme","offset":2148},{"uri":"Gioachino_Rossini","surface_form":"Gioachino Rossini","offset":2204}]}
