{"id":283892,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow","text":"The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae which are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. Swallow is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the Barn Swallow.\nWithin the swallow, the name \"martin\" tends to be used for the squarer-tailed species, and the name \"swallow\" for the more fork-tailed species; however, there is no scientific distinction between these two groups. The family contains around 83 species in 19 genera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"passerine","offset":40},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":50},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":178},{"uri":"Barn_Swallow","surface_form":"Barn Swallow","offset":206}]}
