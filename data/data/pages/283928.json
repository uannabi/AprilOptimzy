This is the most reliable method of altering animal genomes at present, and the technique behind gene targeting and knockout mice.\nMartin Evans and Mario Capecchi were also working on this idea, and they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":55},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":72},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel","offset":87},{"uri":"Nobel_laureate","surface_form":"laureate","offset":93},{"uri":"Gel_electrophoresis","surface_form":"gel electrophoresis","offset":115},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":188},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":205},{"uri":"Homologous_recombination","surface_form":"homologous recombination","offset":266},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":305},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":379},{"uri":"Gene_targeting","surface_form":"gene targeting","offset":424},{"uri":"Knockout_mouse","surface_form":"knockout mice","offset":443},{"uri":"Martin_Evans","surface_form":"Martin Evans","offset":458},{"uri":"Mario_Capecchi","surface_form":"Mario Capecchi","offset":475},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":556}]}
