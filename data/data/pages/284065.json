{"id":284065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettuccine_Alfredo","text":"Fettuccine Alfredo is a pasta dish made from fettuccine pasta tossed with Parmesan cheese and butter.\nThis is an old and simple recipe, in Italy it is simply called \"Fettuccine al burro\" (). The Italian restaurateur Alfredo Di Lelio doubled the amount of butter used. Alfredo invented his recipe in 1908 in the \u201Ctrattoria\u201D run by his mother Angelina in Rome, Piazza Rosa. This made it easier for his pregnant wife Ines to eat. He then in 1914 started selling his variation at his restaurant \"Alfredo\" in via della scrofa in Rome. \"\nAlfredo Di Lelio's family since 1950 continue to serve the fettuccine Alfredo in the restaurant \"Il Vero Alfredo\" in Piazza Augusto Imperatore in Rome.\nMary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate in 1927 at \"Alfredo alla Scrofa\" on their honeymoon, and this helped make the restaurant, and Fettuccine alfredo, popular with tourists.\nIn U.S. cuisine it may be mixed with other ingredients such as broccoli, parsley, cream, garlic, shrimp, or chicken.\nHistory.\nFettuccine Alfredo is named for Alfredo di Lelio, an Italian restaurant owner. He ran a restaurant in Rome in the first half of the 20th century.\nIn 1914, his wife, who was pregnant, was having difficulty eating so he adapted a meal of pasta and butter, \"pasta al burro\", for her. Later, he put the dish on the menu at his restaurant, the \"Alfredo alla Scrofa\", and called his version Fettuccine Alfredo. Hollywood celebrities Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks visited his restaurant on their honeymoon and eat the dish. When they returned home, they talked often about the dish. This caused the restaurant and the dish to become popular with American tourists.\nIn 1943, Di Lelio sold the restaurant but kept the right to the name and menu. In 1950, Alfredo Di Lelio reopened a new restaurant \"Il Vero Alfredo\" in Rome, Piazza Augusto Imperatore 30. He worked there until his death in 1959. \"Il Vero Alfredo\" is now managed by his nephews Alfredo and Ines, with the famous \u201Cgold cutlery\u201D\u201D (fork and spoon gold) donated in 1927 by two well-known American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (in gratitude for the hospitality).\nFettuccine Alfredo has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants in the United States and internationally, although in Italy this dish is not popular at all, as wrongly believed, and it is better known if called \"Fettuccine al burro\" instead of \"Fettuccine Alfredo\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pasta","surface_form":"pasta","offset":24},{"uri":"Fettuccine","surface_form":"fettuccine","offset":45},{"uri":"Parmigiano-Reggiano","surface_form":"Parmesan cheese","offset":74},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":94},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":480},{"uri":"Mary_Pickford","surface_form":"Mary Pickford","offset":684},{"uri":"Douglas_Fairbanks","surface_form":"Douglas Fairbanks","offset":702},{"uri":"Broccoli","surface_form":"broccoli","offset":924},{"uri":"Parsley","surface_form":"parsley","offset":934},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":943},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":950},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":958},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":969},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":1048},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1089},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1119},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":1392},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"celebrities","offset":1402},{"uri":"Mary_Pickford","surface_form":"Mary Pickford","offset":1414},{"uri":"Douglas_Fairbanks","surface_form":"Douglas Fairbanks","offset":1432},{"uri":"Honeymoon","surface_form":"honeymoon","offset":1482},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1632},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourists","offset":1641}]}
