{"id":284117,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipit","text":"The pipits are a cosmopolitan genus \"Anthus\", of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. Along with the wagtails and longclaws, the pipits make up the family Motacillidae. The genus is widespread, occurring across most of the world, except the driest deserts, rainforests and the mainland of Antarctica.\nThey are slender, often drab, ground-feeding insectivores of open country. Like their relatives in the family, the pipits are monogamous and territorial. Pipits are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled eggs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cosmopolitan","surface_form":"cosmopolitan","offset":17},{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"passerine","offset":55},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":65},{"uri":"Wagtail","surface_form":"wagtail","offset":113},{"uri":"Longclaw","surface_form":"longclaw","offset":126},{"uri":"Motacillidae","surface_form":"Motacillidae","offset":167}]}
