{"id":284145,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism","text":"A model organism is a non-human species that is studied over many years, building up a lot of knowledge about it in order to understand fundamental biological phenomena. The hope is that discoveries made in the model will give insight into how other organisms work.\nIn particular, model organisms are widely used in animal testing to explore potential causes and treatments for human disease when experimenting on humans would be impossible or less ethical.\nThis strategy is made possible by the similarities of all living organisms. They are similar because of their common descent and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genes over the course of evolution.\n\"Drosophila melanogaster\".\n\"Drosophila melanogaster\" was one of the first animals used for genetics. Today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best-known of all eukaryotic organisms.\nAll organisms use common genetic systems; understanding transcription and replication in fruit flies helps to understand these processes in other eukaryotes, including humans.\nStudies of X-linked traits confirmed that genes are found on chromosomes. Studies of linked traits led to the first maps of genetic loci on chromosomes. The first maps of \"Drosophila\" chromosomes were done by Alfred Sturtevant.\n\"Drosophila melanogaster\" is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology. Its complete genome was sequenced and first published in 2000.\nBecause great deal is known about its development from egg to larva to adult, it is a key model for developmental genetics, or evo-devo. The hox genes, or homeobox, which control development in metazoa, were worked out first of all in \"Drosophila\".\n\"Escherischia coli\".\nIn 1946, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum first described the phenomenon known as bacterial conjugation using \"Escherichia coli\" as a model bacterium.\n\"E. coli\" was an integral part of the first experiments to understand phage genetics, and early researchers, such as Seymour Benzer, used \"E. coli\" and phage T4 to understand the topography of gene structure. Before Benzer's research, it was not known whether the gene was a linear structure, or if it had a branching pattern.\n\"E. coli\" was one of the first organisms to have its genome sequenced; the complete genome of \"E. coli\" K12 was published by \"Science\" in 1997.\nThe long-term evolution experiments using \"E. coli\", begun by Richard Lenski in 1988, have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary shifts in the laboratory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":32},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":148},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomena","offset":159},{"uri":"Animal_testing","surface_form":"animal testing","offset":316},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":384},{"uri":"Bioethics","surface_form":"ethical","offset":449},{"uri":"Common_descent","surface_form":"common descent","offset":568},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolic","offset":607},{"uri":"Developmental_biology","surface_form":"developmental","offset":621},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":648},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":673},{"uri":"Drosophila_melanogaster","surface_form":"Drosophila melanogaster","offset":712},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":758},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":775},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryotic","offset":859},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":937},{"uri":"DNA_replication","surface_form":"replication","offset":955},{"uri":"Humans","surface_form":"humans","offset":1049},{"uri":"Sex_linkage","surface_form":"X-linked traits","offset":1068},{"uri":"Genetic_linkage","surface_form":"linked traits","offset":1142},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":1241},{"uri":"Alfred_Sturtevant","surface_form":"Alfred Sturtevant","offset":1266},{"uri":"Organisms","surface_form":"organisms","offset":1338},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":1437},{"uri":"DNA_sequence","surface_form":"sequenced","offset":1448},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":1549},{"uri":"Developmental_genetics","surface_form":"developmental genetics","offset":1587},{"uri":"Evo-devo","surface_form":"evo-devo","offset":1614},{"uri":"Hox_genes","surface_form":"hox genes","offset":1628},{"uri":"Homeobox","surface_form":"homeobox","offset":1642},{"uri":"Metazoa","surface_form":"metazoa","offset":1681},{"uri":"Joshua_Lederberg","surface_form":"Joshua Lederberg","offset":1766},{"uri":"Edward_Tatum","surface_form":"Edward Tatum","offset":1787},{"uri":"Bacterial_conjugation","surface_form":"bacterial conjugation","offset":1840},{"uri":"Escherichia_coli","surface_form":"Escherichia coli","offset":1869},{"uri":"Bacteriophage","surface_form":"phage","offset":1979},{"uri":"Seymour_Benzer","surface_form":"Seymour Benzer","offset":2026},{"uri":"Science_(journal)","surface_form":"Science","offset":2362},{"uri":"Richard_Lenski","surface_form":"Richard Lenski","offset":2442}]}
