It is sometimes called \"Princess of Ethiopia\" or \"the Chained Woman\" in English. It has also been called \"Persea\" (\"Perseus's wife\") or \"Cepheis\" (\"Cepheus's daughter\"). The astronomer named Ptolemy listed Andromeda when he made a list of 48 constellations. It is also one of the 88 constellations made by the International Astronomical Union.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is inside Andromeda. It is the closest spiral galaxy to Earth, at about 2.2 million light-years from Earth (estimates range up to 2.5 million light-years). The brightest star in Andromeda is called Alpha Andromedae, which is a binary star.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":15},{"uri":"Andromeda_(mythology)","surface_form":"Andromeda","offset":81},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":94},{"uri":"Ptolemy","surface_form":"Ptolemy","offset":302},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":421},{"uri":"Andromeda_Galaxy","surface_form":"Andromeda Galaxy","offset":459},{"uri":"Spiral_galaxy","surface_form":"spiral galaxy","offset":515},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":703}]}
