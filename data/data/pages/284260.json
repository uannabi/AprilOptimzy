{"id":284260,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Reproductive isolation refers to the situation where different species may live in the same area, but properties of individuals prevent them from interbreeding.\nThe things which stop species or groups of organisms reproducing sexually are called isolating mechanisms.\nMembers of one species do not, in general, mate with members of another species, though there are many exceptions and variations to this. And, if such mating does take place, the offspring may not develop, or may not be fertile.\nIf species arise by the splitting of ancestral species, it might be asked what stops the new species continuing to reproduce together. If they did, they would again become one species.\nPre-mating mechanisms.\nFactors which cause individuals to mate with their own species.\nPost-mating isolating mechanisms.\nIncompatibility of the two genomes stops normal development in the hybrid.\nThere is still much debate as to whether the Dobzhansky/Mayr account is satisfactory. Modern researchers tends to avoid the general term 'isolating mechanisms' in favour of the more specific terms 'mate choice', 'hybrid incompatibility' and other forms of 'reproductive isolation'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":76},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":196},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":217},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"reproducing sexually","offset":227},{"uri":"Speciation","surface_form":"splitting","offset":534},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":843},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":883}]}
