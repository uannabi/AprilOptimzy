Malenkov served as the Premier (official head of government) of the country while Nikita Krushchev was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nHe formed a team with Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Lazar Kaganovich, and together they tried to throw Khrushchev out of power. Krushchev eventually won the battle for power, and in 1957 Malenkov was forced to leave his position in the Party Politburo. In 1961, he was kicked out of the Party and forced to move to Kazakhstan.\nAlong with Krushchev, Malenkov was one of a few important members of Stalin's group of partners (called the \"inner circle\") who died a natural death, and was not executed.\nTogether with Lavrentiy Beria & Krushchev, Malenkov began the process of destalinization, completing the process in 1961.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Republic_of_Macedonia","surface_form":"Macedonian","offset":111},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":122},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":130},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":148},{"uri":"Premier","surface_form":"Premier","offset":169},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":184},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":216},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":308},{"uri":"Nikita_Krushchev","surface_form":"Nikita Krushchev","offset":349},{"uri":"First_Secretary","surface_form":"First Secretary","offset":374},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Communist Party of the Soviet Union","offset":397},{"uri":"Nikolai_Bulganin","surface_form":"Nikolai Bulganin","offset":456},{"uri":"Vyacheslav_Molotov","surface_form":"Vyacheslav Molotov","offset":474},{"uri":"Lazar_Kaganovich","surface_form":"Lazar Kaganovich","offset":498},{"uri":"Politburo","surface_form":"Politburo","offset":688},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":761},{"uri":"Lavrentiy_Beria","surface_form":"Lavrentiy Beria","offset":959},{"uri":"Destalinization","surface_form":"destalinization","offset":1018}]}
