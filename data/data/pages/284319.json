Benito Mussolini founded the party in 1919 and served as its Chairman (Italian:\"Presidente del Partito Nazionale Fascista\") from 1919\u20131943. The Party came to power after Mussolini led thousands of Blackshirts on a march in Rome and forced King Victor Emmanuel III to appoint him Prime Minister. As Prime Minister (the \"real\" head of government), Mussolini banned all other political parties and established a one-party police state, which lasted until he was thrown out of power by his own citizens and ordered to be arrested by the King in 1943. After Mussolini's arrest, the National Fascist Party was destroyed.\nRepublican Fascist Party.\nHowever, Mussolini was rescued from prison by German soldiers sent by Adolf Hitler in 1943, and was made the head of state (this time a member of the newly created Republican Fascist Party) of the Italian Social Republic, a puppet state whose real laws were made by the Nazis.\nMussolini was killed by Italian citizens in 1945 and the Republican Fascist Party was dissolved and banned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Italy","surface_form":"Kingdom of Italy","offset":51},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":84},{"uri":"Chairman","surface_form":"Chairman","offset":145},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":155},{"uri":"Blackshirts","surface_form":"Blackshirts","offset":281},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":307},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":323},{"uri":"Victor_Emmanuel_III","surface_form":"Victor Emmanuel III","offset":328},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":363},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":409},{"uri":"One-party","surface_form":"one-party","offset":493},{"uri":"Police_state","surface_form":"police state","offset":503},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":795},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":834},{"uri":"Italian_Social_Republic","surface_form":"Italian Social Republic","offset":922},{"uri":"Puppet_state","surface_form":"puppet state","offset":949},{"uri":"Ban","surface_form":"ban","offset":1102}]}
