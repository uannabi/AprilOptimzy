{"id":284372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state","text":"e=\"preserve\">A one-party system is a form of government where the country is ruled by a single political party, meaning only one political party exists and the forming of other political parties is forbidden.\nSome countries have many political parties that exist, but only one that can by law be in control. This is called a one-party dominant state. In this case opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. For example, in China all power is vested in the Communist Party of China. Other parties are allowed to exist only if they accept the leading role of the Communist Party\nThe Soviet Union from 1922\u20131991, Nazi Germany from 1933\u20131945, Italy under Benito Mussolini from 1922\u20131943, and various Eastern Bloc states are some of the best-known examples of one-party states in history. Some one-party states are considered dictatorships and called a police state or a military dictatorship, if a secret police force or the military is used to keep a dictator in power through force.\nThe one-party system is also a common trait of communist Marxist-Leninist and fascist political philosophies.\n\"De facto\" one-party states.\nCountries where other parties are legal, but none exists at present. Also, in some kingdom<nowiki/>s a royal family actually rules the country with or without political parties. Kingdoms and Emirates in the Middle East are examples.\nDominant-party system.\nExamples commonly cited include: United Russia (CP) in Russia, the New Azerbaijan Party in Azerbaijan, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey, Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) in Serbia, Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) in Montenegro, the People's Action Party (PAP) in Singapore, the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, the Ba'ath Party in the Syrian Arab Republic, Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea in Equatorial Guinea, Awami League in Bangladesh, the Belaya Rus in Belarus, PSUV in Venezuela, MPLA in Angola, the FRELIMO in Mozambique, the Colorado Party in Paraguay, the ZANU-PF in Zimbabwe, and the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan.\nIn some countries which have this system, methods are used to suppress other parties, without actually banning them. In some cases state power is used directly and indirectly to prevent smaller parties getting more votes. This can include electoral fraud, gerrymandering or court decisions (which are controlled by the government). In many cases, opposition leaders and other figures are prevented from using the mass media at election time, and also they often are threatened, harrassed, jailed and even killed. In other cases, apart from the government candidates, only candidates from smaller allied parties and \"independent\" candidates who are closely allied to the dominant ruling party, get an overwhelming advantage.\nIn these cases, the defeat of the government \"cannot be expected for the forseeable future\".\nVery few one-party states are genuinely democratic, where there are no limits against other parties. In Mexico, Presidential candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":129},{"uri":"One-party_dominant_state","surface_form":"one-party dominant state","offset":325},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party of China","offset":521},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":646},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":675},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":704},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":716},{"uri":"Eastern_Bloc","surface_form":"Eastern Bloc","offset":761},{"uri":"Dictatorship","surface_form":"dictatorship","offset":886},{"uri":"Secret_police","surface_form":"secret police","offset":959},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":986},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":1093},{"uri":"Marxism-Leninism","surface_form":"Marxist-Leninist","offset":1103},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"fascist","offset":1124},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":1268},{"uri":"Royal_family","surface_form":"royal family","offset":1288},{"uri":"Emirate","surface_form":"Emirate","offset":1376},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":1392},{"uri":"United_Russia","surface_form":"United Russia","offset":1474},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1496},{"uri":"New_Azerbaijan_Party","surface_form":"New Azerbaijan Party","offset":1508},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":1532},{"uri":"Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)","surface_form":"Justice and Development Party","offset":1548},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":1587},{"uri":"Serbian_Progressive_Party","surface_form":"Serbian Progressive Party","offset":1595},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":1630},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_of_Socialists_of_Montenegro","surface_form":"Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro","offset":1638},{"uri":"Montenegro","surface_form":"Montenegro","offset":1692},{"uri":"People%27s_Action_Party","surface_form":"People's Action Party","offset":1708},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":1739},{"uri":"African_National_Congress","surface_form":"African National Congress","offset":1754},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1789},{"uri":"Ba%27ath_Party","surface_form":"Ba'ath Party","offset":1807},{"uri":"Syrian_Arab_Republic","surface_form":"Syrian Arab Republic","offset":1827},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_of_Equatorial_Guinea","surface_form":"Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea","offset":1849},{"uri":"Equatorial_Guinea","surface_form":"Equatorial Guinea","offset":1890},{"uri":"Bangladesh_Awami_League","surface_form":"Awami League","offset":1909},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":1925},{"uri":"Belaya_Rus","surface_form":"Belaya Rus","offset":1941},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":1955},{"uri":"United_Socialist_Party_of_Venezuela","surface_form":"PSUV","offset":1964},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":1972},{"uri":"MPLA","surface_form":"MPLA","offset":1983},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":1991},{"uri":"FRELIMO","surface_form":"FRELIMO","offset":2003},{"uri":"Mozambique","surface_form":"Mozambique","offset":2014},{"uri":"Colorado_Party","surface_form":"Colorado Party","offset":2030},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":2048},{"uri":"ZANU-PF","surface_form":"ZANU-PF","offset":2062},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":2073},{"uri":"Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)","surface_form":"Liberal Democratic Party","offset":2091},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2119},{"uri":"Electoral_fraud","surface_form":"electoral fraud","offset":2365},{"uri":"Gerrymandering","surface_form":"gerrymandering","offset":2382},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":2400},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"mass media","offset":2539},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":3047}]}
