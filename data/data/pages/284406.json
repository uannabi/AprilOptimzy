Bhangra is also popular in Canada where singer, Jazzy B sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, Folk and Funky and became one of the best-selling Punjabi folk artists in the world.\nThe outfits for Bhangra are Turla or torla, \"Pag\", which is a turban that is a sign of pride/honor in Punjab and is tied differently than the traditional turbans that the Sikhs and other people wear on the street, \"Kurta\" which is a silk shirt, with about four buttons and is very loose with embroidered patterns, \"Lungi\" or chadar which is a loose loincloth tied around the dancer's waist, \"Jugi\" which is a waistcoat with no buttons, and \"Rum\u0101l\" which are small scarves that are worn tied on to the fingers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punjab_region","surface_form":"Punjab region","offset":23},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":58},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":68},{"uri":"Punjabi_people","surface_form":"Punjabi","offset":127},{"uri":"Sikhs","surface_form":"Sikhs","offset":158},{"uri":"Muslims","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":165},{"uri":"Hindus","surface_form":"Hindus","offset":177},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":216},{"uri":"Audio_cassette","surface_form":"cassettes","offset":331},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":461}]}
