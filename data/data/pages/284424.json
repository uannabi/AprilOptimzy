{"id":284424,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leader","text":"=\"preserve\">In politics, the party leader is the most powerful official within a political party. The party leader is typically responsible for managing the party's relationship with the general public. As such, he or she b.v.will be the person in the party the most responsible for convincing the electorate to vote for the party.\nIn many representative democracies, party leaders compete directly for high political office. For example, leaders of parties in presidential and semi-presidential republics will often run for President. In parliamentary systems of government, party leaders typically seek to become prime minister. In these countries, the party leader will try to be elected to the legislature, and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's parliamentary leader.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":15},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":81},{"uri":"Semi-presidential_system","surface_form":"semi-presidential","offset":478},{"uri":"Parliamentary_system","surface_form":"parliamentary systems","offset":539},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":615}]}
