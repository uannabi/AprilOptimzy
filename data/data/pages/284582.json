{"id":284582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Dart","text":"Raymond Arthur Dart (4 February 1893 \u2013 22 November 1988) was an Australian anatomist and anthropologist, who worked for much of his life in South Africa.\nIn 1924 he discovered the first fossil of an Australopithecine, at Taung in Northwestern South Africa (now Botswana). It was \"Australopithecus africanus\", an extinct hominid closely related to humans. This was a great event in the study of human evolution.\nEarly life.\nDart was born in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the son of a farmer and tradesman. He studied at the University of Queensland, the University of Sydney and University College London, before taking a position as head of the newly established department of anatomy at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1922.\nCareer.\nBecause he was an Australian, and not a part of the scientific establishment, and because he found the fossil in Africa, and not Europe or Asia, where the establishment looked to for man's origins, his findings were initially dismissed.\nDart's closest ally was Robert Broom whose discoveries of further Australopithecines (and Wilfrid Le Gros Clark's support) eventually vindicated Dart. So much so that in 1947, Sir Arthur Keith said \"...Dart was right, and I was wrong.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":64},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomist","offset":75},{"uri":"Anthropology","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":89},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":140},{"uri":"Australopithecine","surface_form":"Australopithecine","offset":199},{"uri":"Taung","surface_form":"Taung","offset":221},{"uri":"Botswana","surface_form":"Botswana","offset":261},{"uri":"Australopithecus_africanus","surface_form":"Australopithecus africanus","offset":280},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":312},{"uri":"Hominid","surface_form":"hominid","offset":320},{"uri":"Human_evolution","surface_form":"human evolution","offset":394},{"uri":"Brisbane","surface_form":"Brisbane","offset":440},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":450},{"uri":"University_of_Queensland","surface_form":"University of Queensland","offset":526},{"uri":"University_of_Sydney","surface_form":"University of Sydney","offset":556},{"uri":"University_College_London","surface_form":"University College London","offset":581},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":680},{"uri":"University_of_Witwatersrand","surface_form":"University of Witwatersrand","offset":695},{"uri":"Johannesburg","surface_form":"Johannesburg","offset":726},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":740},{"uri":"Robert_Broom","surface_form":"Robert Broom","offset":1031},{"uri":"Australopithecine","surface_form":"Australopithecine","offset":1073},{"uri":"Wilfrid_Le_Gros_Clark","surface_form":"Wilfrid Le Gros Clark","offset":1097}]}
