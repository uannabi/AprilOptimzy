{"id":284796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_unsaturation","text":"=\"preserve\">Degree of unsaturation (DOU) is a way to figure out how many rings or double bonds are in a molecule.\nCalculation.\nEach degree either equals one ring structure or pi bond. A double bond would have one DOU. A triple bond would have a DOU of two (triple bond is one sigma bond with two pi bonds).\nNon-hydrocarbons.\nFor the below, use the same rules as above, using the definitions below.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
