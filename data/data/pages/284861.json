The game's main character can either fight the Koreans in the main game or the Americans in the multiplayer game.\nThere has been controversy over the game's release in Japan where they censored the game by removing all the references to North Korea which included pictures of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il because they thought that to \"use their real names would have been 'malicious' to an 'existing person' and an 'existing country.'\". The game has also been banned from all types of sales in South Korea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"first-person shooter","offset":17},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":38},{"uri":"Kaos_Studios","surface_form":"Kaos Studios","offset":57},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":74},{"uri":"Xbox_360","surface_form":"Xbox 360","offset":90},{"uri":"Digital_Extremes","surface_form":"Digital Extremes","offset":103},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":513},{"uri":"Kim_Jong-il","surface_form":"Kim Jong-il","offset":572},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":773}]}
