{"id":28488,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination","text":"Discrimination\" is when someone is treated unfairly or differently. Discrimination is when a person is treated unfairly or badly because the person is one of a particular group. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all persons must be protected against any kind of discrimination, or even its inciting.\nA person might be discriminated against because of their race, age, sex, politics, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, the way they look, a past criminal record, the person's lifestyle, their choice of clothing, their age or their disabilities whether they are a member of or fit in with a social clique (group), social class, social status or caste, and many other reasons.\nDiscrimination can take many forms. It can include being fired from a job, not being able to be hired for a job, being paid less money than others at the same job, being refused a home or apartment, teasing, harassment, or simply being treated differently than other people. Laws known as \"equal opportunity legislation\" protect people from discrimination. They say people should be employed whatever their race, age, sex or religion. There should be reasonable care for people with disabilities or accessibility. Two people in the same position must be paid the same wage if they have exactly the same job.\nIn some countries, discrimination against somebody on the basis of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, or disability is illegal. Even in those countries where discrimination is unlawful, it still takes place for reasons not covered by the law. In some other countries, discrimination against somebody is legal or even official government policy. This especially takes place in countries in which there is an official religion, and people of other religions are discriminated against.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":93},{"uri":"Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","surface_form":"Universal Declaration of Human Rights","offset":182},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":378},{"uri":"Aging","surface_form":"age","offset":384},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":389},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":394},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":404},{"uri":"Gender_identity","surface_form":"gender identity","offset":424},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":441},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":477},{"uri":"Lifestyle","surface_form":"lifestyle","offset":507},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":534},{"uri":"Ageism","surface_form":"age","offset":550},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabilities","offset":563},{"uri":"Clique","surface_form":"clique","offset":629},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"social class","offset":645},{"uri":"Social_status","surface_form":"social status","offset":659},{"uri":"Caste","surface_form":"caste","offset":676},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":777},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":836},{"uri":"Home","surface_form":"home","offset":887},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"apartment","offset":895},{"uri":"Teasing","surface_form":"teasing","offset":906},{"uri":"Harass","surface_form":"harass","offset":915},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"Law","offset":982},{"uri":"Employ","surface_form":"employ","offset":1090},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabilities","offset":1190},{"uri":"Accessibility","surface_form":"accessibility","offset":1206},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"position","offset":1244},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":1445}]}
