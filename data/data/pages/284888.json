At present it is the farthest confirmed object ever seen. UDFy-38135539 is 13.1 billion light years from the Earth.\nCharacteristics.\nThe galaxy is in the constellation Fornax, and it is estimated that the galaxy contains a billion stars.\nSignificance.\nThe universe's first stars were massive,\nionizing hydrogen in the surrounding environment. This is called the ionization epoch.\nUDFy-38135539 (HUDF.YD3) is probably the first galaxy seen in the reionization epoch. Caltech astronomer Brant Robertson, commenting on the study, stated that the \"galaxy happens to reside at a very special time in cosmic history when the properties of gas in the universe were changing rapidly, and therefore this galaxy and others like it may teach us a lot about the early history of the universe\". Michele Trenti, an astronomer who was not involved in the study but provided commentary published with the report, says that the discovery of the distant galaxy is","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":44},{"uri":"Fornax","surface_form":"Fornax","offset":58},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":65},{"uri":"Most_distant_things","surface_form":"farthest confirmed object","offset":101},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light year","offset":168},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":189},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":311},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":353},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":382},{"uri":"Ionization_epoch","surface_form":"ionization epoch","offset":442},{"uri":"Caltech","surface_form":"Caltech","offset":546}]}
