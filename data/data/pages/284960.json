{"id":284960,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer","text":"Bulldozers are crawling machines which have blades. These machines are used for pushing large amounts of dirt or rubble during demolition or construction. They have claw-like devices in the rear to loosen materials which are densely compacted.\nBulldozers are structurally different from excavators, but in many respects their functions are similar. If we talk about universal types of construction equipment, then bulldozers are used when a large amount of work is expected. According to the method of movement, the bulldozers are divided into wheeled and tracked. This construction equipment is used for levelling the soil layer, digging trenches, as well as for transporting bulk cargo. The bulldozer is an economical and efficient construction assistant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
