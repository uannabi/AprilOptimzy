{"id":285027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Cruze","text":"The Chevrolet Cruze is a four-door sedan and hatchback that is built by General Motors' Chevrolet brand. A subcompact Cruze based on the Suzuki Ignis was built between 2001 and 2008. Since 2008, the current compact has been produced as a replacement for the Chevrolet Cobalt. The Cruze is actually a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti Premiere, prior to its introduction, the original model was sold under Suzuki in America. Chevrolet Cruze is the only compact model to not have a Pontiac twin, instead it shares similarities with the new Buick Verano.\nIn the US, the Cruze is available with either a 1.8-liter or 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine producing 138\u00A0hp. Both are available with six-speed manual and automatic transmissions. GM has announced that in late 2016 a hatchback version of the Cruze will be offered in North America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sedan_(automobile)","surface_form":"sedan","offset":35},{"uri":"Hatchback","surface_form":"hatchback","offset":45},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"General Motors","offset":72},{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":88},{"uri":"Suzuki_Ignis","surface_form":"Suzuki Ignis","offset":137},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Cobalt","surface_form":"Chevrolet Cobalt","offset":258},{"uri":"Buick","surface_form":"Buick","offset":528}]}
