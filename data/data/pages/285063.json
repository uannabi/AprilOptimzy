{"id":285063,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Double_(Seattle_Mariners)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Double was a double hit by Edgar Mart\u00EDnez of the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 Major League Baseball playoffs. The Mariners were trailing by one run in the bottom of the 11 inning. When Mart\u00EDnez came to bat, Joey Cora was on third base and Ken Griffey, Jr. was on first. Mart\u00EDnez's hit drove in Cora and Griffey, giving the Mariners a 6\u20135 victory over the New York Yankees. This game gave the Mariners a 3-2 win in the American League Division Series. Former Mariners manager Lou Piniella called The Double \"the hit... that saved baseball in Seattle.\"\nThe play.\nAfter the Yankees took a 4\u2013 2 lead on a Don Mattingly 2-RBI double in the 6th inning, the Mariners came back to tie the score at 4\u2013 4 in the 8th inning. Since the score remained tied after 9 innings, extra innings had to be played. In the top of the 11th inning the Yankees scored a run on a single by Randy Velarde.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Double_(baseball)","surface_form":"double","offset":30},{"uri":"Edgar_Mart%C3%ADnez","surface_form":"Edgar Mart\u00EDnez","offset":44},{"uri":"Seattle_Mariners","surface_form":"Seattle Mariners","offset":66},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":95},{"uri":"Playoff","surface_form":"playoff","offset":117},{"uri":"Run_(baseball)","surface_form":"run","offset":161},{"uri":"Inning","surface_form":"inning","offset":189},{"uri":"Joey_Cora","surface_form":"Joey Cora","offset":224},{"uri":"Third_base","surface_form":"third base","offset":241},{"uri":"Ken_Griffey%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Ken Griffey, Jr.","offset":256},{"uri":"First_base","surface_form":"first","offset":280},{"uri":"Hit_(baseball)","surface_form":"hit","offset":298},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":372},{"uri":"American_League_Division_Series","surface_form":"American League Division Series","offset":435},{"uri":"Manager","surface_form":"manager","offset":484},{"uri":"Lou_Piniella","surface_form":"Lou Piniella","offset":492},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":558},{"uri":"Don_Mattingly","surface_form":"Don Mattingly","offset":618},{"uri":"Run_batted_in","surface_form":"RBI","offset":634},{"uri":"Extra_innings","surface_form":"extra innings","offset":778},{"uri":"Single_(baseball)","surface_form":"single","offset":870},{"uri":"Randy_Velarde","surface_form":"Randy Velarde","offset":880}]}
