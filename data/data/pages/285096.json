{"id":285096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cayley_volcanic_field","text":"The Mount Cayley volcanic field is a volcanic area on the south coast of British Columbia, Canada. It is long. The field gets its name from Mount Cayley, the biggest of several active volcanos in the area.\nMost of the volcanoes there were created when material from inside the earth spilled onto the surface. Under the earth were layers of glacial ice from the last ice age. There are tuya\u2014steep, flat-topped volcanoes\u2014and lava domes. The first eruptions in the field occurred between 1.6\u00A0and 5.3\u00A0million years ago, and at least 23\u00A0eruptions have occurred in all.\nThe southern area has the most known volcanoes\u201411. The center of the field has at least five volcanoes, and the north has two volcanoes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":37},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":73},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":91},{"uri":"Mount_Cayley","surface_form":"Mount Cayley","offset":140},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":177},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacial","offset":340},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":348},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":366},{"uri":"Lava_dome","surface_form":"lava dome","offset":423}]}
