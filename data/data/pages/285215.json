The franchise, which used to be called Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, consists of over 2,600 restaurants in over 40 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and over 30 other countries worldwide.\nPopeyes was started in 1972, and in 1992 became owned by AFC Enterprises, which until 2004 also owned Church's Chicken. In 2017, the company was bought out by Restaurant Brands International (owned by 3G Capital of Brazil), and Popeyes restaurants are now operated as a subsidiary along with Burger King and Tim Hortons.\nPopeyes' headquarters recently moved from Atlanta to Miami.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fried_chicken","surface_form":"fried chicken","offset":57},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":71},{"uri":"District_of_Columbia","surface_form":"District of Columbia","offset":217},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":239},{"uri":"Church%27s_Chicken","surface_form":"Church's Chicken","offset":392},{"uri":"Restaurant_Brands_International","surface_form":"Restaurant Brands International","offset":449},{"uri":"3G_Capital","surface_form":"3G Capital","offset":491},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":505},{"uri":"Subsidiary","surface_form":"subsidiary","offset":560},{"uri":"Burger_King","surface_form":"Burger King","offset":582},{"uri":"Tim_Hortons","surface_form":"Tim Hortons","offset":598}]}
