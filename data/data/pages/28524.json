{"id":28524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid","text":"An ellipsoid is a shape like a sphere, but it may be longer in one or more directions, like an egg, or a rugby ball. It is the 3 dimensional analogue of an ellipse.\nThe Earth is shaped slightly like an ellipsoid. Its shape is called an oblate spheroid. An ellipsoid shaped like the Earth, called a reference ellipsoid, is often preferred to the geoid because it makes calculations simpler.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":31},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":95},{"uri":"Rugby_football","surface_form":"rugby","offset":105},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"ellipse","offset":156},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":169},{"uri":"Oblate_spheroid","surface_form":"oblate spheroid","offset":236},{"uri":"Geoid","surface_form":"geoid","offset":345}]}
