{"id":285392,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_Bartlett","text":"=\"preserve\">Enoch Bartlett (1779\u20131860) was a farmer from Dorchester, Massachusetts.\nHe bought Thomas Brewer's farm in Roxbury. This farm had a field of pear trees, which he named after himself, as he did not know the fruit already had a name.\nIn 1828 a new batch of pear trees arrived from England, and it was realised that the Bartlett pear was the same as the Williams pear, but by this time the name had stuck, and is still the commonest name for this type of pear in Canada and the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dorchester%2C_Masschusetts","surface_form":"Dorchester","offset":57},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":69},{"uri":"Roxbury%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Roxbury","offset":118},{"uri":"Bartlett_pear","surface_form":"Bartlett pear","offset":328},{"uri":"Williams_pear","surface_form":"Williams pear","offset":362}]}
