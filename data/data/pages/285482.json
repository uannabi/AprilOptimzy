{"id":285482,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eared_dove","text":"The Eared Dove, \"Zenaida auriculata\", is a New World tropical dove. It is seen throughout South America from Colombia to southern Argentina and Chile, and on the offshore islands from the Grenadines southwards. It appears to be partly migratory, but it may only be when it needs more food. When it lays its eggs, it builds a small stick nest several meters up in a tree.\nIt is a close relative of the North American Mourning Dove.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":43},{"uri":"Dove","surface_form":"dove","offset":62},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":90},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":109},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":130},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":144},{"uri":"Grenadines","surface_form":"Grenadines","offset":188},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"partly migratory","offset":228},{"uri":"Mourning_Dove","surface_form":"Mourning Dove","offset":416}]}
