{"id":285484,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_dove","text":"The Socorro dove (\"Zenaida graysoni\") is a dove that was endemic to Socorro Island on the west coast of Mexico. The last bird was seen there in 1972. For this reason, IUCN has classified the species as extinct in the wild. In captivity, there are not more than about 200 and probably fewer than 100 purebred birds. Because of this, a reintroduction program is being prepared.\nIt is a close relative of the mourning and eared doves. It was at one time considered a subspecies of the mourning dove.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dove","surface_form":"dove","offset":43},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":57},{"uri":"Socorro_Island","surface_form":"Socorro Island","offset":68},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":104},{"uri":"International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":167},{"uri":"Mourning_dove","surface_form":"mourning","offset":406},{"uri":"Eared_dove","surface_form":"eared dove","offset":419},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":464}]}
