{"id":285498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sky_Conference","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Big Sky Conference is a NCAA conference that play in the NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Ogden, Utah and features universities and colleges from the Western United States, plus one in the Midwestern U.S. In football, the league plays in the second-level Division I FCS.\nMembers.\nAs of the 2017\u201318 school year, the Big Sky has 12 full members, or schools that play almost all of their sports in the conference. Of these schools, only Idaho does not play football in the conference. Its team in that sport plays in the top-level Division I FBS as a single-sport member of the Sun Belt Conference.\nAfter the full Sun Belt members decided not to renew their football membership contract with Idaho when it expired after the 2017 season, Idaho decided to downgrade its football program to the FCS level and return to Big Sky football in 2018.\nNorth Dakota left the non-football side of the Big Sky to join the Summit League, home to many of its traditional rivals, in 2018. The school's football team will join the Missouri Valley Football Conference in 2020. It played the 2018 season as an FCS independent (not in a conference), and will do so again in 2019. However, North Dakota still plays a full Big Sky football schedule, and games against North Dakota count in the Big Sky standings for other conference members.\nAssociate members.\nThe Big Sky has four \"associate\" members that play only one sport in the conference.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":74},{"uri":"Division_I_(NCAA)","surface_form":"Division I","offset":79},{"uri":"Ogden%2C_Utah","surface_form":"Ogden, Utah","offset":126},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":244},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":490},{"uri":"Sun_Belt_Conference","surface_form":"Sun Belt Conference","offset":611},{"uri":"Missouri_Valley_Football_Conference","surface_form":"Missouri Valley Football Conference","offset":1047}]}
