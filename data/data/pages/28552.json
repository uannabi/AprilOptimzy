{"id":28552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthology_(language)","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"For the use in evolutionary biology, see Orthology (biology)\"\nOrthology is the study of the right use of words in language. The word comes from Greek \"ortho\"- (\"correct\") and -\"logy\" (\"science of\"). This science is a place where psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and many other fields of learning come together. The most noted use of \"Orthology\" is for the selection of words\nfor the language of Basic English by the Orthological Institute.\nThe book, \"The Meaning of Meaning\", by C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, is an important book dealing with orthology. The term \"Orthology\" comes from the book \"The Grammar of Science\" by Karl Pearson.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orthology_(biology)","surface_form":"Orthology (biology)","offset":56},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":129},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":159},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":219},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":244},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":256},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistics","offset":268},{"uri":"Learning","surface_form":"learning","offset":306},{"uri":"Basic_English","surface_form":"Basic English","offset":414},{"uri":"Orthological_Institute","surface_form":"Orthological Institute","offset":435},{"uri":"Charles_Kay_Ogden","surface_form":"C.K.
