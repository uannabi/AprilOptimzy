Taffner's estate and the international rights are handled by FremantleMedia (whose company Thames originated the sitcom \"Man About the House\").\nThe show is set in Santa Monica, California. It is about a man pretending to be gay so his landlord won't evict him, it is also about financial struggling such as the roommates not being able to pay their rent. The sitcom heavily relies on innuendo and sexy misunderstandings. It is also a comedy of errors. The show had two spinoffs also based on Britcoms: \"The Ropers\" (\"George & Mildred\") & \"Three's a Crowd\" (\"Robin's Nest\").\nThe series was later the subject of the made-for-TV movie '. The movie showed how cast changes led to the show ending.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":24},{"uri":"Situation_comedy","surface_form":"situation comedy","offset":33},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":67},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":160},{"uri":"Man_About_the_House","surface_form":"Man About the House","offset":176},{"uri":"Don_L._Taffner","surface_form":"Don L.
