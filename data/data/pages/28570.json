{"id":28570,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_Ga_Yo","text":"Kimigayo (\u304D\u307F \u304C \u3088; Kanji: \u541B\u304C\u4EE3) is the national anthem of Japan. The name of the song roughly means 'Imperial Reign' in English. The anthem is based on a poem written by an unknown poet from Japan about one thousand years ago. The music was written more recently (about two hundred years ago) and was then rewritten shortly afterwards because the original tune was unpopular.\nAlthough popular for a long period and sung in situations where people from other countries would usually sing their country's national anthem, Kimi Ga Yo was only considered as Japan's official national anthem in 1999. The law that stated this also defined the Flag of Japan in a similar way.\n\"Kimigayo\" is one of the shortest known national anthems of any country. It is only 56 seconds long.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":37},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":56},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":79},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":118},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":152},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":229},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":456},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":598},{"uri":"Flag_of_Japan","surface_form":"Flag of Japan","offset":636},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":755}]}
