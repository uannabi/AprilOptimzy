{"id":285701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repenomamus","text":"\"Repenomamus\" is the largest known mammal from the Cretaceous period. Its fossil was found in Manchuria.\nThere is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs. It is not known whether \"Repenomamus\" was a hunter or a scavenger.\nLife style.\n\"Repenomamus\" was carnivorous. A specimen of \"R. robustus\" has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile \"Psittacosaurus\" preserved in its stomach.\nThis is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs, though there were earlier indications of this.\nThe larger species, \"R. giganticus\", is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous. \"R. giganticus\" was more than 1 metre (39\u00A0inches) long and weighed about 12\u201314\u00A0kg (26\u201331\u00A0lb). Its skull measures 16\u00A0cm (6.25\u00A0in) long, its body 52\u00A0cm (20.5\u00A0in), and the preserved part of its tail 36\u00A0cm (14\u00A0in).\nDiscovery.\nThe fossils were recovered from the lagerst\u00E4tte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China, renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been dated to 130 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous period.\n\"Repenomamus\" is a genus of triconodonts, a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":35},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":51},{"uri":"Manchuria","surface_form":"Manchuria","offset":94},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":143},{"uri":"Hunter","surface_form":"hunter","offset":198},{"uri":"Scavenger","surface_form":"scavenger","offset":210},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":251},{"uri":"Psittacosaurus","surface_form":"Psittacosaurus","offset":357},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":390},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":435},{"uri":"Largest_mammals","surface_form":"largest mammal","offset":561},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":635},{"uri":"Lagerst%C3%A4tte","surface_form":"lagerst\u00E4tte","offset":861},{"uri":"Yixian_Formation","surface_form":"Yixian Formation","offset":880},{"uri":"Liaoning","surface_form":"Liaoning","offset":904},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"Province","offset":913},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":925},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":1070},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":1114},{"uri":"Triconodont","surface_form":"triconodont","offset":1123},{"uri":"Mammaliaformes","surface_form":"mammaliaformes","offset":1148}]}
