This was an increase of 9.7 percent over the 281,421,906 people counted during the 2000 Census. This was the twenty-third federal census.\nThe Census Bureau did not use a long form for the 2010 Census. The 2010 Census used only a short form asking ten basic questions.\nCost.\nThe 2010 census cost $13 billion. It cost about $42 per capita. To compare, the 2010 census per-capita cost for China was about US$1; for India, the cost was US$0.40. Operational costs were $5.4 billion, under the $7 billion budget. In December 2010 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that the cost of doing the census has doubled each decade since 1970. In a detailed 2004 report to Congress, the GAO asked the Census Bureau to fix cost and design problems. They estimated the 2010 Census cost to be $11 billion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":94},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":112},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"Census Bureau","offset":146},{"uri":"2000_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2000 Census","offset":328},{"uri":"Federal","surface_form":"federal","offset":367},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":375},{"uri":"Government_Accountability_Office","surface_form":"Government Accountability Office","offset":773},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":917}]}
