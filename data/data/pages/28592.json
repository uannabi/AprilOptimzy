On this day, practical jokes (or \"April Fools\") are played on friends and family. The jokes are done to embarrass them. In some countries, April Fools only last until noon, and if someone plays a joke after, they are an April Fool.\nOrigins.\nPeople have set aside a special day for playing jokes for centuries. The ancient Romans had a holiday called Hilaria.\nIn the Middle Ages, New Year's Day was celebrated on March 25 in most European towns. In some areas of France, New Year's was a week-long holiday ending on April 1. Some people think that April Fools' started because those who celebrated on January 1 made fun of those who celebrated on other dates.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the U.K., a person playing a joke would yell \"April Fool!\" at the recipient. According to tradition, the joking was supposed to stop at midday.\nNordic countries.\nIn the Nordic countries, many news outlets would publish or broadcast a fake news story on April 1.\nFrance.\nIn France, an April fools joke is called a \"Poisson d'Avril'. One tradition there is to try and stick a paper fish on one's friends back, and shout \"Poisson d'Avril!' when it is discovered.\nMedia outlets.\nSometimes a large media corporation would broadcast or publish a fake news story on April 1.
