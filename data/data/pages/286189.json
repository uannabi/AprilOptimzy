{"id":286189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie","text":"A bain-marie (or water bath) is a piece of equipment used in science, industry, and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time.\nDescription.\nThe bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts: a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working liquid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath. Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source.\nTypically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.\nThe smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching.\nWhen a bain-marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of water at sea level). Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures.\nAlternatives.\nA contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric \"dry-heat\" bain-marie, heated by element below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts.\nElectric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or \"bath\"), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam.\nOrigin.\nBains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy, when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which precious metals were believed to be germinated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":61},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":70},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":84},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":1283},{"uri":"Heating_element","surface_form":"heated by element","offset":1590},{"uri":"Alchemy","surface_form":"alchemy","offset":2213},{"uri":"Precious_metal","surface_form":"precious metal","offset":2481},{"uri":"Germination","surface_form":"germinated","offset":2517}]}
