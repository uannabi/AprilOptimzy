{"id":286359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, an operation is a function which takes some input (or inputs) and produces an output. Some of the most common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all of which take two inputs and produce an output. These are called binary operations, and are often used when solving math problems.\nThere are more operations than these, including raising numbers to exponents, taking the root and applying the logarithm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":47},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":158},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtraction","offset":168},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":181},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"division","offset":200},{"uri":"Binary_operation","surface_form":"binary operations","offset":279},{"uri":"Exponents","surface_form":"exponents","offset":412},{"uri":"Nth_root","surface_form":"root","offset":434},{"uri":"Logarithm","surface_form":"logarithm","offset":456}]}
