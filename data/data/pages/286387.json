It is regarded as the twin city of Fargo, North Dakota, since they are right next to each other. The town was first built in 1870 near a natural crossing point for the Red River. It was named after William G.Moorhead, who was a director of the Northern Pacific Railway.\nMusician Buddy Holly was on his way to Moorhead when he died in a plane crash. This was called \"the Day that Music Died\" in the song \"American Pie\", by Don McLean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":34},{"uri":"Fargo","surface_form":"Fargo","offset":108},{"uri":"North_Dakota","surface_form":"North Dakota","offset":115},{"uri":"Red_River_of_the_North","surface_form":"Red River","offset":241},{"uri":"Buddy_Holly","surface_form":"Buddy Holly","offset":352},{"uri":"Don_McLean","surface_form":"Don McLean","offset":495}]}
