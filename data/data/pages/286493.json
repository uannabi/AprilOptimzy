{"id":286493,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)","text":"=\"preserve\">Vagrancy is a phenomenon in biology when animals appear very far from their normal range. These animals are called vagrants. The term accidental can be used as well. There are a number of reasons for such animals to become a vagrant - such as weather conditions - but these causes are still rather confused.\nVagrancy is known to occur in birds, insects, mammals and turtles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":26},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":40},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":255},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":350},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":357},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":366},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"turtle","offset":378}]}
