{"id":286619,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page-turner","text":"e=\"preserve\">A page-turner is a person whose job is to turn sheet music pages for a solo musician, often a pianist, usually during a performance.\nWhile some music is arranged so that the pages end at places where the musician can spare one hand to turn them, this is not always possible. A page-turner is often needed by musicians who are playing difficult pieces and prefer not to play from memory. A page-turner needs to be able to understand the musician's signals and follow the music to know when to turn the page. Page-turners are sometimes friends of the performer or members of the accompanying orchestra helping the musician. Professional page-turners are usually freelance casual workers.\nMechanical page-turners are also available, sometimes controlled by the musician via a foot pedal. Charles Halle is said to have invented the automatic page-turner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sheet_music","surface_form":"sheet music","offset":60},{"uri":"Pianist","surface_form":"pianist","offset":107},{"uri":"Freelance","surface_form":"freelance","offset":673},{"uri":"Charles_Halle","surface_form":"Charles Halle","offset":798}]}
