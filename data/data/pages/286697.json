{"id":286697,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlothiana","text":"\"Westlothiana lizziae\" is an early tetrapod. It is a transitional fossil, with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters.282 Its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day lizards. It lived during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago.\nThe type specimen was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry, Bathgate, Scotland, in 1984. It was named after the County of West Lothian where it was found.\n\"Westlothiania\" in life.\nThis species probably lived near a freshwater lake, probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat. It was a slender animal, with rather small legs and a long tail.\nTogether with \"Casineria\", another transitional fossil found in Scotland, it is one of the smallest terapods known, being a mere 20 cm in adult length.\nThe small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote, as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals. There are derived (advanced) features which tie it in with the amniotes rather than amphibians. These are: unfused ankle bones, lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth, a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull.\nThe long body and small legs were a possible adaptation to burrowing, similar to that seen in modern skinks.\nPhylogeny.\nIdeas of how \"Westlothiana\" should be classified has varied from basal amniote to an amphibian Lepospondyl. The actual phylogenetic position of \"Westlothiania\" is uncertain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"tetrapod","offset":35},{"uri":"Transitional_fossil","surface_form":"transitional fossil","offset":53},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":92},{"uri":"Amniote","surface_form":"amniote","offset":112},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":194},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":223},{"uri":"Type_specimen","surface_form":"type specimen","offset":278},{"uri":"East_Kirkton_Quarry","surface_form":"East Kirkton Quarry","offset":310},{"uri":"Bathgate","surface_form":"Bathgate","offset":331},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":341},{"uri":"West_Lothian","surface_form":"West Lothian","offset":393},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":486},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":497},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":569},{"uri":"Casineria","surface_form":"Casineria","offset":658},{"uri":"Transitional_fossil","surface_form":"transitional fossil","offset":678},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":707},{"uri":"Amniote","surface_form":"amniote","offset":866},{"uri":"Labyrinthodont","surface_form":"labyrinthodont","offset":1078},{"uri":"Dentine","surface_form":"dentine","offset":1110},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":1121},{"uri":"Otic_notch","surface_form":"otic notch","offset":1141},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":1226},{"uri":"Skink","surface_form":"skink","offset":1282},{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classified","offset":1339},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":1366},{"uri":"Lepospondyli","surface_form":"Lepospondyl","offset":1396}]}
