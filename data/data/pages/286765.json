{"id":286765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbricus_terrestris","text":"\"Lumbricus terrestris\", also known as the common worm, lob worm, or dew worm, is a large reddish worm native to Europe, but now also widely distributed elsewhere around the world (along with several other lumbricids), due to human introductions. In some areas where it has been introduced, some people consider it to be a serious pest species, since it is out-competing locally native worms.\nThrough much of Europe it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm, typically reaching 20 \u2013 25\u00A0cm in length when extended (though in parts of southern Europe there are native species which are much larger). It has an unusual habit of copulating on the surface at night, which makes it more visible than most other earthworms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Worm","surface_form":"worm","offset":97},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":112},{"uri":"Lumbricid","surface_form":"lumbricid","offset":205}]}
