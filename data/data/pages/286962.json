{"id":286962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer","text":"A tablet computer (sometimes called a tablet) is a type of computer that can be carried easily. Unlike a laptop it has no physical keyboard or trackpad, though users sometimes add those things. Users control a tablet mostly by using its touchscreen with multi-touch technology similar to a smartphone. The screen can be anywhere from (sometimes called a phablet) to in size, but many have a screen size of about diagonal.\nAlmost all tablet computers can access the Internet using Wi-Fi, and many can use mobile phone networks like 2G, 3G, and 4G. Like smartphones, many tablets have sensors such as a camera and a microphone. Other features tablets have are high definition, anti-glare (with less reflection) displays, a Bluetooth radio (to connect to printers and other devices), flash memory, and cloud storage services to back up information on the tablet and synchronize data.\nScience fiction started putting tablets in stories after the middle 20th century. Some companies started making real tablets late in the century. The release of the Apple iPad in 2010 got much attention, and other companies made and sold more.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nCompared to laptop computers, tablets are lighter, more portable, have longer battery life, make less heat, and do not need a mouse or keyboard to be connected. Typing is usually done on the touch screen with a \"virtual\" keyboard which appears on the screen. Many tablets let the user to get reminders even when the tablet is powered off or on standby\nOne bad thing is that the \"virtual\" keyboards are sometimes slow and easy to make typos on. Some tablets can connect to computer keyboards and computer mice to let the user use them in ways similar to a PC. Tablets often have limited storage compared to a laptop.\nThe majority run a mobile operating system and may not support as many file formats and different types of software as laptops, but they may work with the same kinds of mobile apps that smartphones use. These weaknesses sometimes result in a tablet being used mainly to consume media made by someone else who used a full-service computer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":59},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"laptop","offset":105},{"uri":"Keyboard_(computer)","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":131},{"uri":"Trackpad","surface_form":"trackpad","offset":143},{"uri":"Touchscreen","surface_form":"touchscreen","offset":237},{"uri":"Multi-touch","surface_form":"multi-touch","offset":254},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":290},{"uri":"Phablet","surface_form":"phablet","offset":354},{"uri":"Diagonal","surface_form":"diagonal","offset":412},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":465},{"uri":"Wi-Fi","surface_form":"Wi-Fi","offset":480},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":504},{"uri":"2G","surface_form":"2G","offset":531},{"uri":"3G","surface_form":"3G","offset":535},{"uri":"4G","surface_form":"4G","offset":543},{"uri":"Sensor","surface_form":"sensor","offset":583},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":601},{"uri":"Microphone","surface_form":"microphone","offset":614},{"uri":"High-definition_television","surface_form":"high definition","offset":658},{"uri":"Reflection","surface_form":"reflection","offset":697},{"uri":"Computer_monitor","surface_form":"displays","offset":709},{"uri":"Bluetooth","surface_form":"Bluetooth","offset":721},{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"printers","offset":752},{"uri":"Flash_memory","surface_form":"flash memory","offset":781},{"uri":"Cloud_storage","surface_form":"cloud storage","offset":799},{"uri":"Backup","surface_form":"back up","offset":825},{"uri":"Synchronization_(computer_science)","surface_form":"synchronize","offset":863},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":875},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"Science fiction","offset":881},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":949},{"uri":"IPad","surface_form":"iPad","offset":1052},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"laptop","offset":1167},{"uri":"Battery","surface_form":"battery","offset":1233},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":1257},{"uri":"Typographical_error","surface_form":"typos","offset":1589},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PC","offset":1710},{"uri":"Data_storage","surface_form":"storage","offset":1741},{"uri":"Mobile_operating_system","surface_form":"mobile operating system","offset":1790},{"uri":"File_format","surface_form":"file format","offset":1842},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":1878},{"uri":"Mobile_app","surface_form":"mobile app","offset":1940}]}
