{"id":287090,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles","text":"The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body. They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles. They are in the auditory system of all mammals.\nThey are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness.\nAnatomy.\nThe ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The terms mean hammer, anvil, and stirrup.\nDevelopment.\nStudies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified (turned into bone) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the quadrate, prearticular, articular, and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":36},{"uri":"Auditory_system","surface_form":"auditory system","offset":128},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":151},{"uri":"Middle_ear","surface_form":"middle ear","offset":190},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":229},{"uri":"Labyrinth_(inner_ear)","surface_form":"labyrinth","offset":269},{"uri":"Cochlea","surface_form":"cochlea","offset":280},{"uri":"Deafness","surface_form":"deafness","offset":358},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":513},{"uri":"Anvil","surface_form":"anvil","offset":521},{"uri":"Stirrup","surface_form":"stirrup","offset":532},{"uri":"Dentary","surface_form":"dentary","offset":626},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":662},{"uri":"Cartilage","surface_form":"cartilage","offset":717},{"uri":"Meckel%27s_cartilage","surface_form":"Meckel's cartilage","offset":737},{"uri":"Quadrate_bone","surface_form":"quadrate","offset":1087},{"uri":"Prearticular","surface_form":"prearticular","offset":1097},{"uri":"Articular","surface_form":"articular","offset":1111},{"uri":"Angular","surface_form":"angular","offset":1126},{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"land vertebrates","offset":1156}]}
