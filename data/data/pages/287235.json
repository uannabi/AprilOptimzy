Boysen worked as Anaheim City Parks superintendent from 1921-1950. He created the boysenberry, a hybrid between several types of blackberries, raspberries, and loganberries.\nBoysenberry.\nRudolph Boysen experimented with various berry crosses in Napa, California in the 1920s. In 1923, his hybrid successfully grew and bore fruit. However, unable to make his new berry a commercial success, Boysen abandoned his crop after breaking his back in an accident.\nYears later, after he had moved to Orange County, a fellow grower named Walter Knott heard about the berry and tracked down Boysen. Walter Knott was able to bring a few dying vines back to life at his farm, now known as Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. Knott named the fruit after Boysen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Horticulturist","surface_form":"horticulturist","offset":89},{"uri":"Anaheim%2C_California","surface_form":"Anaheim","offset":122},{"uri":"Boysenberry","surface_form":"boysenberry","offset":187},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":202},{"uri":"Blackberry","surface_form":"blackberries","offset":234},{"uri":"Raspberry","surface_form":"raspberries","offset":248},{"uri":"Loganberry","surface_form":"loganberries","offset":265},{"uri":"Napa%2C_California","surface_form":"Napa, California","offset":350},{"uri":"Walter_Knott","surface_form":"Walter Knott","offset":693},{"uri":"Knott%27s_Berry_Farm","surface_form":"Knott's Berry Farm","offset":781},{"uri":"Buena_Park%2C_California","surface_form":"Buena Park, California","offset":803}]}
