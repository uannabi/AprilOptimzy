{"id":287268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue","text":"e=\"preserve\">Connective tissue is a fibrous tissue. It is one of the four traditional classes of tissues (the others being epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue).\nConnective tissue (CT) is found throughout the body. It has 3 main components; cells, fibres, and extracellular matrix.\nConnective tissue makes up a variety of physical structures including, tendons, blood, cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, and lymphatic tissue. CT is classified into three subtypes: embryonic CT, proper CT, and special CT.\nCollagen is the main protein of connective tissue in animals and the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% of the total protein content.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":44},{"uri":"Epithelium","surface_form":"epithelial","offset":123},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":135},{"uri":"Nervous_tissue","surface_form":"nervous tissue","offset":147},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":243},{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibre","offset":250},{"uri":"Tendon","surface_form":"tendon","offset":355},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":364},{"uri":"Cartilage","surface_form":"cartilage","offset":371},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":382},{"uri":"Adipose_tissue","surface_form":"adipose tissue","offset":388},{"uri":"Lymphatic_system","surface_form":"lymphatic tissue","offset":408},{"uri":"Collagen","surface_form":"Collagen","offset":505},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":526},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":558},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":599}]}
