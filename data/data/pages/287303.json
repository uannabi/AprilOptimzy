They live mainly in Rwanda and Burundi.\nPopulation statistics.\nThe Hutu are the largest of the three ethnic groups in Burundi and Rwanda. The United States Central Intelligence Agency says 84% of Rwandans and 85% of Burundians are Hutu. Other sources have found different statistics. The division between the Hutu and the Tutsi (the larger of the other two groups) is mainly based on social class, not ethnicity. There are no differences in language, culture or appearance between them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_Africa","surface_form":"Central Africa","offset":41},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":57},{"uri":"Rwanda","surface_form":"Rwanda","offset":91},{"uri":"Burundi","surface_form":"Burundi","offset":102},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":172},{"uri":"Burundi","surface_form":"Burundi","offset":189},{"uri":"Rwanda","surface_form":"Rwanda","offset":201},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":213},{"uri":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","surface_form":"Central Intelligence Agency","offset":227},{"uri":"Tutsi","surface_form":"Tutsi","offset":393},{"uri":"Ethnicity","surface_form":"ethnicity","offset":473}]}
