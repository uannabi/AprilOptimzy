There was trouble when finding a location because most strip clubs did not serve alcohol. The dancers were from mainly the Tropicana which was Vince Neil's favourite club and the Seventh Veil. The song and album were both written during a time when main songwriter Nikki Sixx, and co-writer Dominic Catanzarito were both addicted to heroin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":50},{"uri":"M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe","surface_form":"M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe","offset":67},{"uri":"Lady_GaGa","surface_form":"Lady GaGa","offset":263},{"uri":"Vince_Neil","surface_form":"Vince Neil","offset":633},{"uri":"Nikki_Sixx","surface_form":"Nikki Sixx","offset":755}]}
