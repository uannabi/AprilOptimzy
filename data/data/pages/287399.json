{"id":287399,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyle%27s_law","text":"Boyle's law (also called Mariotte's law and the Boyle-Mariotte law) is a law about ideal gases.\nIn other words, the volume of a constant mass of ideal gas at a constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure applied on it.\nwhere \"P\" is the pressure of the gas, \"V\" is the volume of the gas, and \"k\" is a constant.\nFor a given mass of gas at a constant temperature, the product of the pressure and the volume is constant. As the volume decreases, the pressure increases in proportion, and vice versa. For example, when the pressure halves, the volume doubles.\nSuppose you have a tank that contains a certain volume of gas at a certain pressure. When you decrease the volume of the tank, the same number of gas particles is now contained in a smaller space. Therefore, the number of collisions increases. Therefore, the pressure is greater.\nExample: The pressure of a gas is 3 atm and the volume is 5 litres. If the pressure is reduced to 2 atm, what is the volume?\n\u2234 The volume will be 7.5 litres.\nThe law was found by Robert Boyle in 1662, and afterwards independently by Edme Mariotte in 1679.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ideal_gas","surface_form":"ideal gas","offset":83},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":137},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":271},{"uri":"Constant_(mathematics)","surface_form":"constant","offset":319},{"uri":"Robert_Boyle","surface_form":"Robert Boyle","offset":1033},{"uri":"Edme_Mariotte","surface_form":"Edme Mariotte","offset":1087}]}
