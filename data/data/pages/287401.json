{"id":287401,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dik_Trom","text":"Dik Trom is the main character in a series of five children\u2019s books written in the Dutch language. The author, C.Joh. Kieviet wrote the first book in 1891. It was called \u201CUit het leven van Dik Trom\u201D (\u201CFrom the life of Dik Trom\u201D). The books became extremely popular and they continue to be very popular today, more than 100 years after they were written.\nThe Life of Dik Trom.\nDik Trom was a naughty boy who got up to lots of tricks with his friends. However, he is a very honest boy and he is very kind, so the readers like him.\nDik Trom lived in the village of Hoofddorp in the Harlemmermeer in the north of Holland. This is the village where the author grew up, so he was setting the stories in his own village, and based a lot of the characters on real people he had known.\nDik\u2019s real name was \u201CDirk\u201D. This is a common Dutch name. Dirk was very fat, even as a boy, so he soon became known as \u201CDik\u201D (the Dutch word \u201Cdik\u201D means \u201Cfat\u201D). The word \u201Ctrom\u201D means \u201Cdrum\u201D so his name really means \u201CFat Drum\u201D.\nDik\u2019s parents love him very much, but they are no good at disciplining him. When he does something naughty his father just says: \u201C\u2018t is toch een bijzonder kind - dat is-ie\u201D (\u201Che\u2019s a really special child, that he is\u201D).\nDik is always brave, he is never a coward. His friends want to go and annoy a little old lady, but Dik persuades them to go and annoy the village policeman, and he has a leading role in that adventure.\nAnother adventure tells how Dik said he could ride a donkey without falling off. The donkey belonged to the village merchant, and it was a stubborn beast that always tried to throw off its riders. Dik managed to stay on by sitting backwards on the donkey and holding on to its tail. This is how Dik is usually seen in pictures, and there is a statue of him in the village of Hoofddorp which shows him on the donkey.\nOther books about Dik Trom.\nKieviet found it difficult at first to find a publisher for his book, because the main character was naughty. Once it had appeared in a second edition with some illustrations it became very popular, and Kieviet followed it with four other books about Dik, and one about Dik\u2019s son. Eight films have been made about Dik Trom, the most recent in 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch language","offset":83},{"uri":"Cornelis_Johannes_Kieviet","surface_form":"C.Joh.
