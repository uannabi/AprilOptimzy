{"id":287461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo","text":"The sudo command is a program for Unix-like operating systems like Linux distributions. It allows users to run programs as another user. The \"su\" portion is sometimes described as substitute user, super user, or switch user.\nImportance.\nThe sudo command gives the administrator the option of allowing certain users access to otherwise disallowed commands on a granular level. This power must be carefully administered as it could potentially allow users to make changes to files that could cause serious damage to other users' files as well as damaging the operating system itself.\nUsage.\nThe sudo command is used from the command line.\nImagine a system has three users: student, JOE, and BOB.\nWhen the password is entered correctly (assuming proper entries in the sudoers file), the computer would then run the command.\nPrograms with a graphical user interface can also be run with sudo, but it may mess them up.\nVarious desktops for Unix-like systems usually have their own version of sudo for such programs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unix","surface_form":"Unix","offset":34},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux distributions","offset":67},{"uri":"Command_line","surface_form":"command line","offset":623}]}
