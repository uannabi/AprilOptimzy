These seeds are harvested just before the pods become ripe.\nWhite mustard seeds are hard and round, usually around 1 to 1.5 millimetres, with a color forming from beige or yellow to light brown.\nIn Greece, the plant's leaves can be eaten during the winter, before it blooms. Greeks call it \"vrouves\" or \"lapsana\".\nThe blooming season of this plant (February\u2013March) is celebrated in the Mustard Festival.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Annual_plant","surface_form":"annual plant","offset":20},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":47},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":54},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":69},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":125},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":148},{"uri":"Ripe","surface_form":"ripe","offset":186},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":276},{"uri":"Beige","surface_form":"beige","offset":295},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":304},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":320},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":330},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":350},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":381},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":459},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"Festival","offset":526}]}
