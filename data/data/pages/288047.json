{"id":288047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderney_concentration_camps","text":"The Alderney concentration camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany during its World War II occupation of the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands were the only British Commonwealth soil to be occupied by the Nazis. The Nazis built four concentration camps on Alderney Island, subcamps of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg. They were named after the Frisian Islands: Lager Norderney, Lager Borkum, Lager Sylt and Lager Helgoland. The Nazi Organisation Todt operated each subcamp and used forced labour to build bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters, and concrete fortifications. The camps started working in January 1942 and had a total inmate population of about 6,000.\nThe \"Borkum\" and \"Helgoland\" camps were \"volunteer\" (Hilfswillige) labour camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but a little bit better than the inmates at the \"Sylt\" and \"Norderney\" camps. The prisoners in \"Lager Sylt\" and \"Lager Norderney\" were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney. \"Sylt camp\" held Jewish enforced labourers. \"Norderney camp\" housed European (usually Eastern but including Spaniard) and Russian enforced labourers. \"Lager Borkum\" was used for German technicians and \"volunteers\" from different countries of Europe. \"Lager Helgoland\" was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers.\nIn 1942, \"Lager Norderney\", containing Russian and Polish POWs, and \"Lager Sylt\", holding Jews, were placed under the control of the SS Hauptsturmf\u00FChrer Max List. Over 700 of the inmates lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to Nazi Germany in 1944.\nWar crime trials.\nAfter World War II, a court-martial case was prepared against ex-SS Hauptsturmf\u00FChrer Max List, citing atrocities on Alderney. However, he did not stand trial, and is believed to have lived near Hamburg until his death in the 1980s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":60},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":84},{"uri":"Occupation_of_the_Channel_Islands","surface_form":"occupation of the Channel Islands","offset":97},{"uri":"Channel_Islands","surface_form":"Channel Islands","offset":136},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"British Commonwealth","offset":166},{"uri":"Nazi_concentration_camps","surface_form":"concentration camps","offset":242},{"uri":"Alderney","surface_form":"Alderney Island","offset":265},{"uri":"Neuengamme_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Neuengamme","offset":298},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":322},{"uri":"Frisian_Islands","surface_form":"Frisian Islands","offset":357},{"uri":"Lager_Norderney","surface_form":"Lager Norderney","offset":374},{"uri":"Lager_Borkum","surface_form":"Lager Borkum","offset":391},{"uri":"Lager_Sylt","surface_form":"Lager Sylt","offset":405},{"uri":"Lager_Helgoland","surface_form":"Lager Helgoland","offset":420},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":441},{"uri":"Organisation_Todt","surface_form":"Organisation Todt","offset":446},{"uri":"Forced_labour","surface_form":"forced labour","offset":495},{"uri":"Bunker","surface_form":"bunker","offset":518},{"uri":"Labour_camps","surface_form":"labour camps","offset":752},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":1075},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1126},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1180},{"uri":"Max_List","surface_form":"Max List","offset":1530},{"uri":"Court-martial","surface_form":"court-martial","offset":1713}]}
