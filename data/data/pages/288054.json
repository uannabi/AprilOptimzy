These were the only Nazi concentration camps on British soil.\nIt was organised by the Schutzstaffel - SS-Baubrigade I\u2013which was first under supervision of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin; and from mid-February 1943 under the Neuengamme camp in northern Germany. It was used by the Nazi Organisation Todt forced labour programme, to build bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters, and concrete fortifications.\n\"Lager Helgoland\" was in the northwest corner of Alderney. The \"Borkum\" and \"Helgoland\" camps were called \"volunteer\" (Hilfswillige) labour camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but marginally better than the inmates at the \"Sylt\" and \"Norderney\" camps. The prisoners in \"Lager Sylt\" and \"Lager Norderney\" were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney. \"Sylt camp\" held Jewish enforced labourers and was a death camp. \"Norderney camp\" housed European (usually Eastern but including Spaniard) and Russian enforced labourers. \"Lager Borkum\" was used for German technicians and volunteers from different countries of Europe. \"Lager Helgoland\" was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers.
