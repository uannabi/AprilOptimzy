{"id":28819,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k","text":"B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k (b. Nagyszentimikl\u00F3s, Hungary, 25 March 1881; d. New York City 26 September 1945) was a famous Hungarian composer and pianist. He was one of the most important and original composers of the 20th century. He became very interested in folk music and travelled a lot in Hungary and other countries, including Romania, listening to the folk songs which the country people sang. He often used the style of these songs in his music. He is famous for his piano music, string quartets and several pieces for orchestra including one called \"Concerto for Orchestra\". Bart\u00F3k\u2019s harmonies and lively rhythms were sometimes quite new to classical music and some audiences found them difficult to understand at first.\nChildhood and early years.\nB\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k was born in the small town of Nagyszentmikl\u00F3s. In those days it was in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but today it is in Romania. When he was very small he showed great musical talent, and his mother taught him to play the piano.\nB\u00E9la was often ill when he was a child. When he was seven his father died, and his mother took him and his sister to live in Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s (today it is called Vinogradiv and is in the Ukraine), and then to Pozsony (today it is Bratislava in Slovakia). There he gave his first public recital when he was eleven. He included some music which he had composed himself.\nEarly musical career.\nSoon he was studying the piano with Istv\u00E1n Thoman who had studied with the famous Franz Liszt. He had lessons in composition from J\u00E1nos Koessler at the Royal Academy of Music in Budapest. There he met the composer Zolt\u00E1n Kod\u00E1ly, who was a great influence on him and who became a lifelong friend.\nHe soon started to compose longer pieces of music. He liked the music of Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy and these influenced his style of music. He started to be interested in folk music. This can be heard in the first of his six string quartets.\nBart\u00F3k and Kod\u00E1ly travelled together into the countryside to collect and study old Hungarian folk melodies. People in those days thought that real Magyar (old Hungarian) folk music was Gypsy music. Bart\u00F3k and Kod\u00E1ly showed that there were other traditions beside these. They found music which used pentatonic scales similar to those used in some parts of Asia. The two composers started to use these folk ideas in their own compositions. Kod\u00E1ly often quoted (copied) actual folk songs in his own music, while Bart\u00F3k preferred to compose music which sounded like folksong without actually copying it.\nMiddle years and career.\nIn 1909, Bart\u00F3k married M\u00E1rta Ziegler. Their son, also named B\u00E9la, was born in 1910.\nIn 1911, Bart\u00F3k wrote his only opera, \"Bluebeard's Castle\". There are only two singers in the opera: Bluebeard and his wife Judith. He also wrote a ballet called \"The Wooden Prince\". This started to make him famous abroad. Another ballet, \"The Miraculous Mandarin\", is even more famous today. It shows the influence of Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, as well as Richard Strauss. He wrote a lot of chamber music including a total of 6 string quartets, 2 violin sonatas and a \"Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion\". He wrote some pieces for smaller orchestras: \"Divertimento for strings\" and \"Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta\".\nBart\u00F3k divorced M\u00E1rta in 1923, and married a piano student, Ditta P\u00E1sztory. His second son, P\u00E9ter, was born in 1924.\nWorld War II and later career.\nWhen World War II broke out Bart\u00F3k criticized the Nazis. After they came into power in Germany, he refused to give concerts there and did not use his German publisher. His political ideas gave him a great deal of trouble in Hungary.\nHaving first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bart\u00F3k felt he had to emigrate to the USA with Ditta P\u00E1sztory. They lived in New York City. Their son P\u00E9ter joined them in 1942 and later joined the United States Navy. Bart\u00F3k \u2018s older son B\u00E9la stayed in Hungary.\nBart\u00F3k did not feel comfortable in the USA, and found it very difficult to compose. He was also not very well known in America, and not many people were interested in his music. He and his wife Ditta gave concerts, and for a while, they were given some money to work on a collection of Yugoslav folk songs. They did not have very much money, although he had some friends who gave them enough to live on. Serge Koussevitsky asked him to write the \" Concerto for Orchestra \". This soon became Bart\u00F3k's most popular work, and brought him some money. He was also asked by Yehudi Menuhin to write a \"Sonata for Solo Violin\". This seemed to make him interested again in composing, and he went on to write his \"Piano Concerto No. 3\" and began work on his \" Viola Concerto\".\nBart\u00F3k died by polycythemia in New York City from on 26 September 1945, aged 64. He left the Viola Concerto unfinished at his death; it was later finished by his pupil Tibor Serly.\nMusic.\nBart\u00F3k\u2019s music has many modern techniques such atonality, bitonality and modern harmonies. He often uses different kinds of scales (not just major and minor ones), and very complicated rhythms. A lot of these are inspired by the folk music he heard. He wrote a lot of piano music, including some easy pieces for people who are learning the piano. This includes a collection of pieces in six volumes called \"Mikrokosmos\" which are very popular with young musicians today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":34},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":61},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":117},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"pianist","offset":130},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":202},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":245},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":318},{"uri":"String_quartet","surface_form":"string quartet","offset":473},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":512},{"uri":"Concerto_for_Orchestra_(Bart%C3%B3k)","surface_form":"Concerto for Orchestra","offset":544},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmonies","offset":578},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":599},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":635},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":660},{"uri":"Austro-Hungarian_Empire","surface_form":"Austro-Hungarian Empire","offset":829},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":873},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":1163},{"uri":"Bratislava","surface_form":"Bratislava","offset":1206},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":1220},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":1391},{"uri":"Franz_Liszt","surface_form":"Franz Liszt","offset":1448},{"uri":"Composition_(music)","surface_form":"composition","offset":1479},{"uri":"Zolt%C3%A1n_Kod%C3%A1ly","surface_form":"Zolt\u00E1n Kod\u00E1ly","offset":1580},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1611},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":1735},{"uri":"Claude_Debussy","surface_form":"Claude Debussy","offset":1755},{"uri":"String_quartet","surface_form":"string quartet","offset":1896},{"uri":"Magyar","surface_form":"Magyar","offset":2060},{"uri":"Roma_people","surface_form":"Gypsy","offset":2098},{"uri":"Pentatonic","surface_form":"pentatonic","offset":2211},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":2268},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":2654},{"uri":"Bluebeard%27s_Castle","surface_form":"Bluebeard's Castle","offset":2662},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":2771},{"uri":"The_Wooden_Prince","surface_form":"The Wooden Prince","offset":2786},{"uri":"The_Miraculous_Mandarin","surface_form":"The Miraculous Mandarin","offset":2863},{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Igor Stravinsky","offset":2942},{"uri":"Arnold_Schoenberg","surface_form":"Arnold Schoenberg","offset":2959},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":2989},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber music","offset":3024},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":3080},{"uri":"Sonata","surface_form":"sonata","offset":3087},{"uri":"Sonata_for_Two_Pianos_and_Percussion","surface_form":"Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion","offset":3102},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":3269},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":3415},{"uri":"Criticize","surface_form":"criticize","offset":3445},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":3460},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":3665},{"uri":"Emigrate","surface_form":"emigrate","offset":3719},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":3735},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":3774},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":3846},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslav","offset":4196},{"uri":"Serge_Koussevitsky","surface_form":"Serge Koussevitsky","offset":4314},{"uri":"Concerto_for_Orchestra_(Bart%C3%B3k)","surface_form":"Concerto for Orchestra","offset":4358},{"uri":"Yehudi_Menuhin","surface_form":"Yehudi Menuhin","offset":4478},{"uri":"Viola","surface_form":"Viola","offset":4660},{"uri":"Atonality","surface_form":"atonality","offset":4912},{"uri":"Bitonality","surface_form":"bitonality","offset":4923},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmonies","offset":4945},{"uri":"Mikrokosmos","surface_form":"Mikrokosmos","offset":5272}]}
