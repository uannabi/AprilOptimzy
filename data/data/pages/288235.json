{"id":288235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_the_Isle_of_Man","text":"The Chief Minister (Manx: \"Ard-choylargh\") is the executive head of the Isle of Man Government. He is the Prime Minister of the island.\nThe office comes from that of Chairman of the Executive Council. Before 1980 the Executive Council was chaired by the Lieutenant Governor, but afterwards the chairman was elected by Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man. The title was changed to \"Chief Minister\" in 1986.\nThe Chief Minister is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor on the nomination of Tynwald after a general election of the House of Keys. He holds office until the next general election (i.e., for 5 years), and is eligible for re-appointment, but may be removed from office by Tynwald on a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers.\nAfter the general election in November 2006, Mr John Shimmin MHK, Mr Stephen Rodan MHK (Minister for Health and Social Security) and Mr David Cannan MHK (former Minister for the Treasury) tried to become Chief Minister, but none got enough votes in Tynwald. On a second vote Mr Tony Brown (Speaker of the House of Keys) was nominated unopposed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Isle_of_Man_Government","surface_form":"Isle of Man Government","offset":72},{"uri":"Executive_Council_of_the_Isle_of_Man","surface_form":"Executive Council","offset":182},{"uri":"Lieutenant_Governor","surface_form":"Lieutenant Governor","offset":254},{"uri":"Tynwald","surface_form":"Tynwald","offset":318},{"uri":"Isle_of_Man","surface_form":"Isle of Man","offset":349},{"uri":"Lieutenant_Governor","surface_form":"Lieutenant Governor","offset":452},{"uri":"Tynwald","surface_form":"Tynwald","offset":493},{"uri":"House_of_Keys","surface_form":"House of Keys","offset":533},{"uri":"Council_of_Ministers_(Isle_of_Man)","surface_form":"Council of Ministers","offset":729},{"uri":"Member_of_the_House_of_Keys","surface_form":"MHK","offset":812},{"uri":"Member_of_the_House_of_Keys","surface_form":"MHK","offset":834},{"uri":"Member_of_the_House_of_Keys","surface_form":"MHK","offset":900},{"uri":"Tynwald","surface_form":"Tynwald","offset":1000}]}
