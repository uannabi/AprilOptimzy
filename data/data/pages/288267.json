{"id":288267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_English_Bible_translations","text":"There are many translations of the Bible in English.\nPeople don't agree about what is the \"original Bible\". Because there are many versions of Greek and Latin Bibles, there are also many versions of the English Bible.\nSome translations are word-for-word from the original language. These translations are usually difficult to read. Other translations are idea-for-idea. These translations change the ideas of the original Bible into English. Some idea-for-idea translations use very easy English. Literal translations are difficult for some people to understand. But, non-literal translations can change the meaning. \"Dynamic Equivalence\" means making the Bible easy to read, without changing the meaning.\nChristian Translations.\nMost English Bible translations are written from a Christian point of view.\nThe King James Version.\nThe Authorized King James Version (KJV) is very popular. Many parts of it are literal (word-for-word) translations of the original Greek and Hebrew. The KJV Bible was produced from 1604 to 1611, as a revision of the Bishops Bible. Since 1600, many English words have changed. Because the KJV Bible is 400 years old, it is more difficult to read. But even though it is 400 years old, many expressions and idioms used in everyday modern English come from the KJV.\nSince 1611, the first KJV Bible has been changed. The edition usually used today is the 1769 edition. The new versions, which are revisions of the KJV include the Revised Version (1885), the Revised Standard Version (1952), the New Revised Standard Version (1989), and the English Standard Version (2001).\nOther Translations.\nOn the internet, there are many translations of the Bible. You can read virtual Bibles. If you want to read part of the Bible, you can print that part. This is called \"print on demand\".\nToday, there are many translations that are literal, not literal, and between. The Young's Literal Translation is very literal. The Message Bible and The Word on the Street are not literal.\nGender Neutral Versions.\nIn the Bible, men and women are equal. They just have different roles. Men are supposed to be the dominant figures in society. Some new translations weaken male dominance. These translations are called \"feminist,\" \"gender neutral, or gender accurate.\"\nSome gender-neutral translations are: the New Revised Standard Version (1989), the Revised English Bible (1989), Today's New International Version (2005), New International Version (2011). The English Standard Version (2001) also tries to be more equal.\nSimplified English Bibles.\nMany people have written simpler Bibles. These Bibles use few words. Some are written for non-native speakers of English.\nWorld English Bible.\nThe \"World English Bible\" is a version of the Bible written in modern English. It began in 1997 and was a revision of the \"American Standard Version 1997\". The project began with the goal of producing an English-language version of the Bible that does not use older English nor Basic English.\nIt is based on the 1901 \"American Standard Version\", the Greek \"Majority Text\", and the Hebrew \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\" with some minor changes made because of alternative readings in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Septuagint but these alternative readings are ignored or restricted to the footnotes. There are seven passes of editing and reading for each book. The first pass updated about 1,000 words, phrases and grammatical constructs. The first manual pass was to add quotation marks and other punctuation, and to check the version against the Greek and Hebrew texts where there are large textual variants or the meaning is not clear.\nJewish Translations.\nMany Jewish Bible translations show the English and original Hebrew on facing pages. None of these translations is considered Simple English or Basic English.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":35},{"uri":"Bible_version_debate","surface_form":"versions of the English Bible","offset":187},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":781},{"uri":"Authorized_King_James_Version","surface_form":"Authorized King James Version","offset":834},{"uri":"Expression","surface_form":"expressions","offset":1218},{"uri":"Idiom","surface_form":"idioms","offset":1234},{"uri":"New_Revised_Standard_Version","surface_form":"New Revised Standard Version","offset":2313},{"uri":"Revised_English_Bible","surface_form":"Revised English Bible","offset":2354},{"uri":"Today%27s_New_International_Version","surface_form":"Today's New International Version","offset":2384},{"uri":"New_International_Version","surface_form":"New International Version","offset":2426},{"uri":"English_Standard_Version","surface_form":"English Standard Version","offset":2464},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":2741},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":2765},{"uri":"Basic_English","surface_form":"Basic English","offset":2973},{"uri":"Original","surface_form":"original","offset":3707},{"uri":"Basic_English","surface_form":"Basic English","offset":3799}]}
