He was a physician and biochemist.\nKrebs researched metabolism. He is famous because he discovered the urea cycle and the citric acid cycle (also called the \"Krebs Cycle\"). Krebs won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this, in 1953.\nEarly years.\nKrebs was born in Hildesheim, Germany. His mother was Alma Davidson. His father was Georg Krebs. Georg Krebs was an ear, nose, and throat doctor.\nEducation.\nKrebs studied medicine at the University of G\u00F6ttingen and the University of Freiburg from 1918\u20131923. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Hamburg in 1925. Next, he studied chemistry in Berlin for one year. In Berlin, he helped Otto Warburg at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology until 1930.\nCareer.\nKrebs worked as a doctor in the Altona hospital and at the University of Freiburg. At the University of Freiburg he researched the urea cycle.\nBecause he was Jewish, Krebs could not be a doctor in Germany. In 1933 he moved to England. He worked at Cambridge with Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. In Cambridge he researched biochemistry. In 1945 he became a Professor (teacher) at the University of Sheffield.\nIn 1954 he became a professor in Oxford. After his retirement, Krebs continued work at the Radcliffe Infirmary until his death. He was a fellow of Trinity College in Oxford.\nHonors.\nIn 1953 Krebs received the Nobel Prize in Physiology for his \"discovery of the citric acid cycle\". He was knighted in 1958.\nKrebs was elected Honorary Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge University in 1979.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1938, Krebs married Margaret Cicely Fieldhouse. They had three children: two boys and a girl. His son John Krebs was an ornithologist (scientist who studies birds) and member of the House of Lords. His other son was called Paul. His daughter was Helen.\nKrebs died in Oxford, England in 1981.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":75},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":82},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":89},{"uri":"Naturalisation","surface_form":"naturalised","offset":112},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":124},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":132},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":150},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":164},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":193},{"uri":"Urea_cycle","surface_form":"urea cycle","offset":244},{"uri":"Citric_acid_cycle","surface_form":"citric acid cycle","offset":263},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":328},{"uri":"Hildesheim","surface_form":"Hildesheim","offset":416},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":428},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":569},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":731},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":744},{"uri":"Otto_Heinrich_Warburg","surface_form":"Otto Warburg","offset":786},{"uri":"Urea_cycle","surface_form":"urea cycle","offset":994},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":1111},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":1184},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"fellow","offset":1407},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology","offset":1479},{"uri":"Girton_College","surface_form":"Girton College","offset":1613},{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge University","offset":1629},{"uri":"Ornithologist","surface_form":"ornithologist","offset":1797},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":1859},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":1944},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1952}]}
