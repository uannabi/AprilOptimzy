{"id":288404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage","text":"Mechanical advantage (also written as MA in formulas) is the factor by which a machine multiplies force. The mechanical advantage of a machine can be used to find out how well a machine works and whether it can perform a particular job.\nThe mechanical advantage of a machine is the ratio of the load (the resistance overcome by a machine) to the effort (the force applied).\nThere is no unit for mechanical advantages since the unit for both input and output forces cancel out.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":79},{"uri":"Forces","surface_form":"forces","offset":458}]}
