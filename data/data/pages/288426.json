The band was composed of sisters Dorothy \"Dot\" Wiggin (vocals/lead guitar), Betty Wiggin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Helen Wiggin (drums), and later Rachel Wiggin (bass).\nThe sisters' father, Austin Wiggin, made Dot, Betty and Helen start a band. When Austin was young, his mother had predicted that Austin would have daughters who would be part of a famous music group.\nThe band's only studio album, \"Philosophy of the World\", was released in 1969. The album was not very well-known, though the band's live performances were popular in their local area. The Shaggs disbanded in 1975 after the death of Austin.\nHelen Wiggin died in 2006. The widow of Austin Wiggin, Jr., Annie Wiggin, died in 2005.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":19},{"uri":"All-female_band","surface_form":"all-female","offset":28},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":39},{"uri":"Fremont%2C_New_Hampshire","surface_form":"Fremont, New Hampshire","offset":60},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"vocals","offset":147},{"uri":"Lead_guitar","surface_form":"lead guitar","offset":154},{"uri":"Backing_vocalist","surface_form":"vocals","offset":182},{"uri":"Rhythm_guitar","surface_form":"rhythm guitar","offset":189},{"uri":"Drum_kit","surface_form":"drums","offset":219},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":252},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":475},{"uri":"Philosophy_of_the_World","surface_form":"Philosophy of the World","offset":490}]}
