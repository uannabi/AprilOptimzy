{"id":288429,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest","text":"e=\"preserve\">Random forest is a statistical algorithm that is used to cluster points of data in functional groups. When the data set is large and/or there are many variables it becomes difficult to cluster the data because not all variables can be taken into account, therefore the algorithm can also give a certain chance that a data point belongs in a certain group.\nSteps of the algorithm.\nThis is how the clustering takes place.\nUsing the algorithm.\nIn a random forest algorithm the number of trees grown (ntree) and the number of variables that are used at each split (mtry) can be chosen by hand; example settings are 500 trees, 71 variables.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistical","offset":32},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":44},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"points of data","offset":78},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":124},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":164}]}
