{"id":28846,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel","text":"=\"preserve\">A sequel is a story, book, or movie that comes or takes place after another story, book, or movie. The opposite is called a prequel. A combination of the two makes a midquel. When there are many sequels, this is called a film series.\nA sequel has important parts of the first story like characters and places. Audiences like sequels because they have more of the characters and places they like. Storytellers and publishers like sequels because they are popular and people buy them.\nSequel names are often similar to the name of a first story or other stories in a series. They often have a second title or a number to show that they are alike or different from a first story or other stories in a series. Sometimes sequels have different names in different countries because they mean different things to different audiences.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"story","offset":26},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":33},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":42},{"uri":"Prequel","surface_form":"prequel","offset":136},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"Audiences","offset":322},{"uri":"Publisher","surface_form":"publishers","offset":425}]}
