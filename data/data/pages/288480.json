The president is the chief executive of the Federal Council of Switzerland and is the most senior member of the executive branch of the Swiss government.\nRole.\nUnder the Swiss constitution of 1999, the Federal Council is the \"highest executive authority\". Although the president of the confederation has some extra duties to represent Switzerland, he is not the head of state.\nAll decisions are that a head of state would make are decided by a meeting of the Federal Council. For example, treaties are signed on behalf of the Federal Council, and all members of the federal council sign the \"letters of credence\" to introduce ambassadors sent by Switzerland to a foreign country. All ambassadors sent by a foreign country to Switzerland meet all of the members of the Federal Council, not just the President.\nThe President of the Confederation is sometimes called the \"primus inter pares\" (first equal) in the Federal Council.\nOnly three other countries in the world do not have one person as a head of state, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andorra and San Marino.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":48},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":66},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":88},{"uri":"Chief_executive","surface_form":"chief executive","offset":122},{"uri":"Federal_Council_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"Federal Council of Switzerland","offset":145},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":1111},{"uri":"Andorra","surface_form":"Andorra","offset":1135},{"uri":"San_Marino","surface_form":"San Marino","offset":1147}]}
