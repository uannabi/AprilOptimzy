The word is derived from the Latin root \"alere\" meaning \"to nurse, to rear, or to nourish\", which means that young has to be taken care of for a long time before it can overcome its helplessness.\nBirds or mammals which need much less care after birth are called precocial, meaning they are precocious.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":185},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"Bird","offset":352},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":361},{"uri":"Precocial","surface_form":"precocial","offset":418}]}
