{"id":288645,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Medawar","text":"Sir Peter Brian Medawar OM CBE FRS (28 February 1915 \u2013 2 October 1987) was a British biologist.\nHis work was important to skin grafts and organ transplants.\nTransplants of skin and organs from other people are usually rejected. This is an action by the immune system. Medawar showed that sometimes this reaction can be avoided, and why.\nHe worked on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired immune tolerance. He was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, with Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet.\nUntil he was partially disabled by a stroke, Medawar was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London.\nAchievements.\nMedawar was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham (1947\u201351) and University College London (1951\u201362). In 1962 he was appointed director of the National Institute for Medical Research, and became professor of experimental medicine at the Royal Institution (1977\u201383), and president of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (1981\u201387). Medawar was a scientist of great inventiveness who was interested in many other subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket.\nHe was knighted in 1965, and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1981.\nOutcome of research.\nMedawar was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1960 for work in tissue grafting, which is the basis of organ transplants. He and his team discovered \"acquired immunological tolerance\".\nAt birth, babies are protected by antibodies from the mother. During embryonic life and immediately after birth, immune cells develop. They 'learn' to distinguish between their own tissues on the one hand, and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other.\nMedawar's work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself. Various ways have been found to suppress the body's rejection of organ transplants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"OM","offset":24},{"uri":"Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"CBE","offset":27},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":31},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":85},{"uri":"Skin_graft","surface_form":"skin graft","offset":122},{"uri":"Organ_transplant","surface_form":"organ transplant","offset":138},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":253},{"uri":"Graft_rejection","surface_form":"graft rejection","offset":350},{"uri":"Acquired_immune_tolerance","surface_form":"acquired immune tolerance","offset":387},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":438},{"uri":"Frank_Macfarlane_Burnet","surface_form":"Frank Macfarlane Burnet","offset":486},{"uri":"Stroke_(medicine)","surface_form":"stroke","offset":548},{"uri":"University_of_Birmingham","surface_form":"University of Birmingham","offset":700},{"uri":"University_College_London","surface_form":"University College London","offset":739},{"uri":"Royal_Institution","surface_form":"Royal Institution","offset":911},{"uri":"Royal_Postgraduate_Medical_School","surface_form":"Royal Postgraduate Medical School","offset":961},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":1105},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":1112},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":1127},{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"knighted","offset":1143},{"uri":"Order_of_Merit_(Commonwealth)","surface_form":"Order of Merit","offset":1182},{"uri":"Organ_transplant","surface_form":"organ transplant","offset":1322},{"uri":"Antibody","surface_form":"antibodies","offset":1438},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":1473},{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissues","offset":1585},{"uri":"Immunology","surface_form":"immunology","offset":1729}]}
