{"id":288770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fire","text":"Andrew Zachary Fire (born April 27, 1959 in Palo Alto, California) is an American biologist. He is a professor of pathology and genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine. Fire was given the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of RNA interference. The research was conducted at Carnegie Institution for Science and published in 1998.\nEducation.\nFire completed high school at age 15. He wanted to study at Stanford University, where he would later work, but was not accepted. He studied at the University of Californiaat Berkeley. Fire graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics at 19, and earned a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1983.\nNobel prize.\nIn 2006, Fire and Craig Mello shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work first published in 1998 in the journal \"Nature\". The paper reports that tiny snippets of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) effectively shut down specific genes, and so caused the destruction of messenger RNA (mRNA) with sequences matching the dsRNA. As a result, the mRNA cannot be translated into protein.\nFire and Mello found that dsRNA was much more effective in gene silencing than the previously described method of RNA interference with single-stranded RNA. Because only small numbers of dsRNA molecules were required for the observed effect, Fire and Mello proposed that a catalytic process was involved. This hypothesis was confirmed by later research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Palo_Alto%2C_California","surface_form":"Palo Alto, California","offset":44},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":73},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":82},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":101},{"uri":"Pathology","surface_form":"pathology","offset":114},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":128},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":140},{"uri":"Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine","surface_form":"School of Medicine","offset":160},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":204},{"uri":"RNA_interference","surface_form":"RNA interference","offset":263},{"uri":"Carnegie_Institution_for_Science","surface_form":"Carnegie Institution for Science","offset":311},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":393},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":438},{"uri":"University_of_California","surface_form":"University of California","offset":526},{"uri":"Berkeley","surface_form":"Berkeley","offset":553},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":568},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor's degree","offset":585},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":606},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":638},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","offset":651},{"uri":"Craig_Mello","surface_form":"Craig Mello","offset":735},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":758},{"uri":"Nature_(journal)","surface_form":"Nature","offset":845},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":910},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":993},{"uri":"Gene_silencing","surface_form":"gene silencing","offset":1165},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalytic process","offset":1379},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":1416}]}
