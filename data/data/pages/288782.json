He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986. His research helped people understand how cancer starts and how to design anti-cancer drugs.\nHe was also, with Herbert Boyer, one of the first to do any kind of genetic engineering.\nBiography.\nCohen majored in chemistry and biology at Brooklyn College. He received a bachelor's degree in 1943, and worked as a bacteriologist at a plant that processes milk. Later in 1945, he received an M.A. in zoology from Oberlin College. He also received a Ph.D. from the department of biochemistry at the University of Michigan in 1948.\nIn the 1950s, Cohen worked with Rita Levi-Montalcini at Washington University in St. Louis. He isolated the nerve growth factor and then discovered the epidermal growth factor. In 1959, he began teaching biochemistry at Vanderbilt University.\nCohen also received the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1983 and the National Medal of Science in 1986.\nCohen died on February 5, 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 97.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":60},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":69},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":110},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":199},{"uri":"Herbert_Boyer","surface_form":"Herbert Boyer","offset":268},{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetic engineering","offset":318},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":367},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":381},{"uri":"Brooklyn_College","surface_form":"Brooklyn College","offset":392},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor's degree","offset":424},{"uri":"Bacteriologist","surface_form":"bacteriologist","offset":467},{"uri":"Master_of_Arts","surface_form":"M.A.","offset":544},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoology","offset":552},{"uri":"Oberlin_College","surface_form":"Oberlin College","offset":565},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":601},{"uri":"University_of_Michigan","surface_form":"University of Michigan","offset":650},{"uri":"Rita_Levi-Montalcini","surface_form":"Rita Levi-Montalcini","offset":714},{"uri":"Washington_University_in_St._Louis","surface_form":"Washington University in St. Louis","offset":738},{"uri":"Isolate","surface_form":"isolate","offset":777},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":790},{"uri":"Growth_factor","surface_form":"growth factor","offset":796},{"uri":"Epidermis","surface_form":"epidermal","offset":834},{"uri":"Vanderbilt_University","surface_form":"Vanderbilt University","offset":902},{"uri":"Louisa_Gross_Horwitz_Prize","surface_form":"Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize","offset":949},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":981},{"uri":"National_Medal_of_Science","surface_form":"National Medal of Science","offset":1017},{"uri":"Nashville%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Nashville, Tennessee","offset":1086}]}
