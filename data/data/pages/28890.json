{"id":28890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia","text":"Abkhazia is a partially recognised independent country on the eastern coast of the Black Sea.\nThe country fought a war with Georgia for its independence in 1991, the Georgian\u2013Abkhaz conflict. Since its declaration of independence from Georgia in 1991, it has been ruled by the partly-recognized Republic of Abkhazia.\nGeorgia believes Abkhazia is part of its territory and has listed the province, in its official subdivisions, as an autonomous republic On 28 August 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a \"Russian-occupied territory\".\nThe Republic of Abkhazia, with Sukhumi as its capital, is a client state of Russia. It is formally recognised by Russia and by Nicaragua, and the \"de facto\" independent republics of South Ossetia and Transnistria. The European Union, OSCE, and NATO recognise Abkhazia as an integral part of the territory of Georgia.\nThe secessionist movement of the Abkhaz minority led to the Georgian\u2013Abkhaz conflict. The War in Abkhazia resulted in a Georgian military defeat and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population from Abkhazia.\nThere was a 1994 ceasefire agreement. There is a UN-monitored and Russian-dominated CIS peacekeeping operation. The sovereignty dispute has not been resolved. The dispute is a source of conflict between Georgia and Russia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":83},{"uri":"Georgian%E2%80%93Abkhaz_conflict","surface_form":"Georgian\u2013Abkhaz conflict","offset":166},{"uri":"Declaration_of_independence","surface_form":"declaration of independence","offset":202},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":235},{"uri":"Autonomous_republic","surface_form":"autonomous republic","offset":433},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Georgia","surface_form":"Parliament of Georgia","offset":476},{"uri":"Sukhumi","surface_form":"Sukhumi","offset":600},{"uri":"Client_state","surface_form":"client state","offset":629},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":682},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":696},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":751},{"uri":"Transnistria","surface_form":"Transnistria","offset":769},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":787},{"uri":"OSCE","surface_form":"OSCE","offset":803},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":813},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":877},{"uri":"Ethnic_cleansing","surface_form":"ethnic cleansing","offset":1055},{"uri":"Georgians","surface_form":"Georgian","offset":1079},{"uri":"Ceasefire","surface_form":"ceasefire","offset":1131},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"UN","offset":1163},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Independent_States","surface_form":"CIS","offset":1198}]}
