{"id":28902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Protector","text":"A Lord Protector is a British title for heads of state. It has two different meanings at different times in history.\nThe title of \"Lord Protector\" was first used by royal princes or other nobles who ruled as regent while the English monarch was still too young to rule or was not able to rule for some other reason, in this case the Lord Protector would make all the decisions for the country, and the young monarch would decide whether they agree or not.\nThe Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was the title of the head of state during the Interregnum, following the first period of the Commonwealth under Council of State government. It was held by Oliver Cromwell (December 1653 \u2013 September 1658), leader of the roundheads and his son Richard Cromwell (September 1658 \u2013 May 1659) during what is now known as the Protectorate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":22},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"heads of state","offset":40},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":171},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":208},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":233},{"uri":"English_Interregnum","surface_form":"Interregnum","offset":574},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_England","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":621},{"uri":"English_Council_of_State","surface_form":"Council of State","offset":640},{"uri":"Oliver_Cromwell","surface_form":"Oliver Cromwell","offset":684},{"uri":"Roundheads","surface_form":"roundheads","offset":748},{"uri":"Richard_Cromwell","surface_form":"Richard Cromwell","offset":771},{"uri":"The_Protectorate","surface_form":"Protectorate","offset":848}]}
