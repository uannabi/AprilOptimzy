Although the word fantasy is most often applied to low-tech worlds, it also can depict high tech worlds, overlapping with science fiction (e.g. Star Wars). Or it is used for historical fiction, if it is magical in some way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":13},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":22},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":69},{"uri":"Middle-earth","surface_form":"Middle-earth","offset":206},{"uri":"Narnia","surface_form":"Narnia","offset":222},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":353},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":375},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":405}]}
