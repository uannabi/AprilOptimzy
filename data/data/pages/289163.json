It was at Seneca Falls, New York in on July 19 and July 20, 1848. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a women's rights activist, wrote a \"Declaration of Sentiments\" that would list some things she believed and that would be talked about at the meaning. One of these ideas was that men and women are equal. Many of the people there were Quakers, which is a sect of Christianity. Over one hundred people who were there signed a document called the Seneca Falls Declaration. Both men and women signed it. One man at the meeting was Frederick Douglass.\nBackground.\nMany women were upset that they did not have the same rights as men. They could not vote, sign contracts, or buy property. If they were married, they had to give any money they earned to their husbands. They also made less money than men.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Women%27s_rights","surface_form":"Women's rights","offset":79},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton","surface_form":"Elizabeth Cady Stanton","offset":161},{"uri":"Quakers","surface_form":"Quakers","offset":419},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":447},{"uri":"Frederick_Douglass","surface_form":"Frederick Douglass","offset":612}]}
