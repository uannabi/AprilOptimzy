{"id":289197,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophreniform_disorder","text":"=\"preserve\">Schizophreniform disorder is a mental illness. Usually, people suffering from this disorder show certain symptoms of schizophrenia, but they do not have all of them, or the symptoms are not present long enough. To be recognised as schizophrenia, the symptoms need to be present a full six months. If symptoms are not present for that time period, the illness may be classified as shizophreniform disorder.\nThe disorder can be treated in much the same way as schizophrenia. There are certain antipsychotic drugs and therapies that can help treat the symptoms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":43},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":117},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":129},{"uri":"Antipsychotic","surface_form":"antipsychotic","offset":503},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":517},{"uri":"Therapy","surface_form":"therapies","offset":527}]}
