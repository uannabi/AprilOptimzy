{"id":289349,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnepropetrovsk_maniacs","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dnepropetrovsk maniacs is a media name for two serial killers from Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, who caused 21 murders in June and July 2007. The murderers are named Viktor Sayenko (born March 1, 1988) and Igor Suprunyuck (born April 20, 1988). They gained notoriety when a video recording of one of the murders was leaked to the internet. The video on the internet is often called \"3guys1hammer\". Sayenko and Suprunyuck were charged with murder after they were arrested. Alexander Hanzha, one of their friends, was charged with two robberies that took place before the murder spree. They were all found guilty by a court in February 2009, and Suprunyuck and Sayenko were sentenced to life imprisonment. Hanzha received nine years in prison.\nThe leaked internet video shows the murder of a 48-year-old man named Sergei Yatzenko. He is shown lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck many times in the face with a hammer that is held inside a yellow plastic bag. Suprunyuck pokes out Yatzenko's eyes, and stabs him in the abdomen with a screwdriver. He is then struck with the hammer again in order to ensure that he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim slips in and out of consciousness. During the video, Suprunyuck is shown smiling at the camera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":64},{"uri":"Dnipropetrovsk","surface_form":"Dnipropetrovsk","offset":84},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":100}]}
