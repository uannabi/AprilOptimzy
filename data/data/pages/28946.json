{"id":28946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata","text":"A sonata is a piece of music for one instrument or one instrument with another instrument accompanying. The word comes from the Italian \u201Csonare\u201D which means \u201Cto sound\u201D.\nA composer could call any solo instrumental piece \u201Csonata\u201D if he or she wants to, but usually a sonata is quite a long piece with several movements. A sonatina is a simple and short sonata.\nHistory.\nThe term \"sonata\" was used in the 16th century to mean anything that was not sung.\nIn the Baroque period (17th and early 18th centuries) many composers like Arcangelo Corelli wrote sonatas with several movements. There were two types: \u201Csonata da camera\u201D (\u201Croom sonata\u201D i.e. \u201Cchamber sonata\u201D) which were for playing in people\u2019s homes, and \u201Csonata da chiesa\u201D (\u201Cchurch sonata\u201D) which were for being played in churches. The first type would have harpsichord accompaniment and the second type organ accompaniment. There would also be a cello playing the bass line. The solo instrument might be a violin, flute, recorder or oboe.\nAt the end of the Baroque period Domenico Scarlatti wrote over 500 sonatas for harpsichord. These are all short pieces in binary form (two sections).\nBy the time we come to the Classical period sonatas have become longer pieces with three or four movements. They would usually start with a fast movement, then a slow one, and then a fast one at the end. If there were four movements the extra one would be a minuet and trio or a scherzo, either before or after the slow movement. The first movement would be in sonata form. The most important composers of sonatas at this time were Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven\nMany composers in the Romantic period wrote sonatas, for example: Brahms wrote piano sonatas as well as sonatas for violin and piano, cello and piano, and clarinet and piano.\nIn the 20th century composers who have written sonatas include Bartok, Tippett and William Walton.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":23},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":128},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":171},{"uri":"Baroque_music","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":458},{"uri":"Arcangelo_Corelli","surface_form":"Arcangelo Corelli","offset":525},{"uri":"Harpsichord","surface_form":"harpsichord","offset":810},{"uri":"Accompaniment_(music)","surface_form":"accompaniment","offset":822},{"uri":"Organ_(music)","surface_form":"organ","offset":856},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":959},{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":967},{"uri":"Recorder","surface_form":"recorder","offset":974},{"uri":"Oboe","surface_form":"oboe","offset":986},{"uri":"Domenico_Scarlatti","surface_form":"Domenico Scarlatti","offset":1025},{"uri":"Classical_music_period","surface_form":"Classical period","offset":1169},{"uri":"Minuet","surface_form":"minuet","offset":1400},{"uri":"Scherzo","surface_form":"scherzo","offset":1421},{"uri":"Sonata_form","surface_form":"sonata form","offset":1503},{"uri":"Joseph_Haydn","surface_form":"Haydn","offset":1574},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":1581},{"uri":"Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":1592},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic period","offset":1624},{"uri":"Johannes_Brahms","surface_form":"Brahms","offset":1668},{"uri":"Cello","surface_form":"cello","offset":1736},{"uri":"Clarinet","surface_form":"clarinet","offset":1757},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1784},{"uri":"Bela_Bartok","surface_form":"Bartok","offset":1840},{"uri":"Michael_Tippett","surface_form":"Tippett","offset":1848}]}
