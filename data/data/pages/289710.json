{"id":289710,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricornus","text":"Capricornus is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It is often called Capricorn, especially when referring to the corresponding astrological sign. Its name is Latin for \"horned male goat\" or \"goat horn\", and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half fish. Its symbol is (Unicode \u2651).\nCapricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by Aquila, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus and Aquarius. The constellation is in an area of sky called the Sea or Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus.\nNotable features.\nCapricornus is the second faintest constellation in the zodiac after Cancer. Its brighter stars are on a triangle whose corners are \u03B12 Capricorni (also known as Giedi), \u03B4 Capricorni (Deneb Algiedi), and \u03C9 Capricorni.\nDeep sky objects.\nCapricorn has several galaxies and clusters. Messier 30 is a globular cluster that is one degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907.\nHistory.\nDespite it being very faint, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations. It has consistently been represented as a cross of a goat and a fish since the Middle Bronze Age. The earliest picture of Capricornus is on a cylinder-seal dating c. 21st century BCE. From the mid second Millennium it became a popular motif on boundary stones. It was explicitly recorded in the Babylonian star catalogues as \"The Goat-Fish\" before 1000 BC. The constellation was a symbol of Ea and in the Early Bronze Age marked the winter solstice.\nBecause of the precession of the equinoxes the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus. The astrological sign called Capricorn now begins with the solstice. The sun's most southerly position is now called the Tropic of Capricorn. This term also applies to the line on earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice.\nThe planet Neptune was discovered in this constellation by German astronomer Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (\u03B4 Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is reasonable as Capricornus can be seen best at 4:00am in September.\nIn Chinese astronomy, constellation Capricornus is in \"The Black Tortoise of the North\" (\u5317\u65B9\u7384\u6B66, \"B\u011Bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00E1n W\u01D4\").\nMythology.\nCapricorn the sea goat was a goat that decided to take over the world. The gods of Greece looked down upon that and sent there wrath and killed him with one of Zeus thunderbolts. Then they hung him in the sky to humiliate him.\nAstrology.\nAs of 2002, the Sun appears in the constellation Capricornus from January 19 to February 15. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Capricorn from December 22 to January 19, and in sidereal astrology, from January 15 to February 15.\nVisualizations.\nPtolemy's method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.\nH. A. Rey has suggested an alternative way to join the stars, which graphically shows a goat. The goat's head is formed by the triangle of stars \u03B9 Cap, \u03B8 Cap, and \u03B6 Cap. The goat's horn sticks out with stars \u03B3 Cap and \u03B4 Cap. Star \u03B4 Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat's tail consists of stars \u03B2 Cap and \u03B12 Cap: star \u03B2 Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat's hind foot consists of stars \u03C8 Cap and \u03C9 Cap. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.\nCapricornus as the name.\nUSS Capricornus (AKA-57) is once of United States navy ship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":26},{"uri":"Zodiac","surface_form":"zodiac","offset":48},{"uri":"Capricorn_(astrology)","surface_form":"astrological sign","offset":133},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":164},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":187},{"uri":"Horn_(anatomy)","surface_form":"horn","offset":202},{"uri":"Ptolemy","surface_form":"Ptolemy","offset":475},{"uri":"Aquila_(constellation)","surface_form":"Aquila","offset":530},{"uri":"Sagittarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Sagittarius","offset":538},{"uri":"Microscopium","surface_form":"Microscopium","offset":551},{"uri":"Piscis_Austrinus","surface_form":"Piscis Austrinus","offset":565},{"uri":"Aquarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Aquarius","offset":586},{"uri":"Sea_(astronomy)","surface_form":"Sea","offset":646},{"uri":"Cancer_(constellation)","surface_form":"Cancer","offset":834},{"uri":"Alpha_Capricorni","surface_form":"\u03B12 Capricorni","offset":897},{"uri":"Delta_Capricorni","surface_form":"\u03B4 Capricorni","offset":934},{"uri":"Omega_Capricorni","surface_form":"\u03C9 Capricorni","offset":968},{"uri":"Messier_30","surface_form":"Messier 30","offset":1045},{"uri":"NGC_7103","surface_form":"NGC 7103","offset":1123},{"uri":"NGC_6907","surface_form":"NGC 6907","offset":1187},{"uri":"Mythological_hybrid","surface_form":"cross","offset":1338},{"uri":"Middle_Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Middle Bronze Age","offset":1375},{"uri":"Kudurru","surface_form":"boundary stones","offset":1540},{"uri":"Babylonian_star_catalogues","surface_form":"Babylonian star catalogues","offset":1591},{"uri":"Ea_(god)","surface_form":"Ea","offset":1687},{"uri":"Winter_solstice","surface_form":"winter solstice","offset":1729},{"uri":"Precession_of_the_equinoxes","surface_form":"precession of the equinoxes","offset":1761},{"uri":"Tropic_of_Capricorn","surface_form":"Tropic of Capricorn","offset":2005},{"uri":"Neptune","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":2142},{"uri":"Johann_Gottfried_Galle","surface_form":"Johann Galle","offset":2208},{"uri":"Chinese_astronomy","surface_form":"Chinese astronomy","offset":2357},{"uri":"Black_Tortoise_(Chinese_constellation)","surface_form":"The Black Tortoise of the North","offset":2409},{"uri":"Tropical_astrology","surface_form":"tropical astrology","offset":2815},{"uri":"Capricornus_(astrology)","surface_form":"Capricorn","offset":2875},{"uri":"Sidereal_astrology","surface_form":"sidereal astrology","offset":2924},{"uri":"H._A._Rey","surface_form":"H.
