{"id":289804,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadhin_Bangabhumi_Andolan","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bangabhumi (, meaning the land of Bengal) also known as Bir Bango (), is a separatists movement to create a Hindu country using southwestern East Bengal envisioned by Banga Sena of Bangladesh.\nThe movement was founded in 1973 in the Republic of India soon after Bangladeshi independence to support the Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, who were targeted by the Pakistani national army in the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities based on ideas of reconquest. However, this movement did not receive much support at that time. In an interview with BBC in 2001, Chittaranjan Sutar, one of the alleged organisers of the movement, denied any existence of the movement at that time. The movement openly became active again on 2003 when it declared the independence of Hindu Republic of Bangabhumi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":121},{"uri":"Banga_Sena","surface_form":"Banga Sena","offset":180},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":194},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":275},{"uri":"Bangladesh_Liberation_War","surface_form":"independence","offset":287},{"uri":"1971_Bangladesh_atrocities","surface_form":"1971 Bangladesh atrocities","offset":403},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":547}]}
