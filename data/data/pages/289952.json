{"id":289952,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amborellaceae","text":"Amborellaceae is a family of flowering plants native to New Caledonia. The family contains only one species, \"Amborella trichopoda\". Botanists think it is the most basal plant in the angiosperm clade.\nThe Amborellaceae are distinctive. They are sprawling evergreen shrubs or small trees. Their tissue is different from any other Angiosperm. The xylem of \"Amborella\" contains only tracheids; vessel elements are absent. Xylem of this form has long been regarded as a \"primitive\" feature of flowering plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":29},{"uri":"New_Caledonia","surface_form":"New Caledonia","offset":56},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":100},{"uri":"Amborella","surface_form":"Amborella trichopoda","offset":110},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":164},{"uri":"Angiosperm","surface_form":"angiosperm","offset":183},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":194},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":255},{"uri":"Shrubs","surface_form":"shrubs","offset":265},{"uri":"Angiosperm","surface_form":"Angiosperm","offset":329},{"uri":"Tracheid","surface_form":"tracheid","offset":380},{"uri":"Vessel_element","surface_form":"vessel element","offset":391}]}
