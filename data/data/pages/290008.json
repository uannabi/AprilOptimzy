{"id":290008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann","text":"Otto Adolf Eichmann (19 March 1906 in Solingen - 31 May 1962 in Ramla) was a German SS officer (he had the rank of SS-Obersturmbannf\u00FChrer, comparable with lieutenant colonel).\nEichmann was an important person of Nazi Germany during the Third Reich. As head of a subdivision of the Reich Main Security Office (\"Reichssicherheitshauptamt, Referat IV B4\") he was the architect of The Holocaust who organized the death camps, like the Auschwitz concentration camp, that were used to kill 11 million people during World War 2.\nAfter the war he escaped and in 1960 was discovered to be living in Argentina. The Israeli secret service, the Mossad, kidnapped him and took him back to Israel. Eichmann was put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was found guilty on 11 December 1961, and executed by hanging in Ramla. His body was cremated in an unusually hot furnace, and the ashes were scattered in the sea. Eichmann is one of the few people to ever be executed by Israel.\nThe trial of Adolf Eichmann was broadcast on radio in Israel, and millions of people around the world watched it on television. This was the first time that victims of the Holocaust talked openly about what had happened. This was an event that helped bring together and unify the many people who had come to live in the new nation of Israel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solingen","surface_form":"Solingen","offset":38},{"uri":"Ramla","surface_form":"Ramla","offset":64},{"uri":"Schutzstaffel","surface_form":"SS","offset":84},{"uri":"Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer","surface_form":"Obersturmbannf\u00FChrer","offset":118},{"uri":"Lieutenant_colonel","surface_form":"lieutenant colonel","offset":155},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":212},{"uri":"Third_Reich","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":236},{"uri":"Reich_Main_Security_Office","surface_form":"Reich Main Security Office","offset":281},{"uri":"The_Holocaust","surface_form":"The Holocaust","offset":377},{"uri":"Auschwitz_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Auschwitz concentration camp","offset":431},{"uri":"World_War_2","surface_form":"World War 2","offset":509},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":590},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":605},{"uri":"Mossad","surface_form":"Mossad","offset":633},{"uri":"Kidnapping","surface_form":"kidnapped","offset":641},{"uri":"War_crimes","surface_form":"war crimes","offset":714},{"uri":"Crimes_against_humanity","surface_form":"crimes against humanity","offset":729},{"uri":"Capital_punishment","surface_form":"executed","offset":799}]}
