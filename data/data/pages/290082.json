Araya is ranked fifty-eighth by \"Hit Parader\" on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time.\nAraya was employed as a respiratory therapist in the early 1980s and used his earnings to finance Slayer's debut album \"Show No Mercy\". Much of Araya's lyrical content is about serial killers, a subject he finds interesting, first making his lyrical contribution to 1985's \"Hell Awaits\" with the track \"At Dawn They Sleep\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vi%C3%B1a_del_Mar","surface_form":"Vi\u00F1a del Mar","offset":52},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":66},{"uri":"Thrash_metal","surface_form":"thrash metal","offset":161},{"uri":"Slayer","surface_form":"Slayer","offset":179},{"uri":"Hit_Parader","surface_form":"Hit Parader","offset":220},{"uri":"Respiratory_therapist","surface_form":"respiratory therapist","offset":320},{"uri":"Show_No_Mercy","surface_form":"Show No Mercy","offset":416},{"uri":"Serial_killers","surface_form":"serial killers","offset":473},{"uri":"Hell_Awaits","surface_form":"Hell Awaits","offset":570}]}
