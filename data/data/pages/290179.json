{"id":290179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_religion","text":"e=\"preserve\">Philosophy of religion is a branch of philosophy. Religions, and religious beliefs can manifest themselves in different ways. Philosophy of religion looks into explaining certain answers to questions of religion using understanding. It is also looks into different ways religions are practiced and their importance for the everyday lives of the people practicing them. Other domains of it include criticism and analysis of religious texts using philosophy of language.\nThe problem with this is that using only these definitions leas to a common \"philiosphy of religion\" that is harly usable for studies. The other approach (called \"functional\") tries to counter this: Rather than trying to get an \"abstract idea\" of religion, it looks at the use or function religion has in the live of people or societies. Among the things mentioned are that religions help keep a psychological equilibrium and that they provide a certain amount of stability to a society. Thinkers with this opion include Karl Marx, \u00C9mile Durkheim, Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski and Talcott Parsons. Critics of these theories say that such explanations often go against common sense, as religions can also have the popposite effect to that mentioned.\nOther topics include arguments for the existence of God, the problem of evil, divine attributes and the relationship between science and religion.\nImportant philosophers of religion include Thomas Aquinas, Augustine and Alvin Plantinga.
