{"id":290343,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratone_Studio","text":"=\"preserve\">Maratone is a music production company, started by two music producers and songwriters, Max Martin and Tom Talomaa. It was started in January 2001 after the closing of the Cheiron Studios.\nThe first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for Britney Spears\u00B4 third album \"Britney\".\nWith Kelly Clarkson's hits \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", which were produced at Maratone, Max Martin had reinvented himself (together with Lukasz Gottwald) by using a completely different sound than the \"Cheiron sound\" which he was so famous for. He has continued to use the new rock sound on hits for a-ha, Pink and many more.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_production","surface_form":"music production","offset":26},{"uri":"Max_Martin","surface_form":"Max Martin","offset":100},{"uri":"Cheiron_Studios","surface_form":"Cheiron Studios","offset":184},{"uri":"Britney_Spears","surface_form":"Britney Spears","offset":277},{"uri":"Kelly_Clarkson","surface_form":"Kelly Clarkson","offset":321},{"uri":"Lukasz_Gottwald","surface_form":"Lukasz Gottwald","offset":476},{"uri":"A-ha","surface_form":"a-ha","offset":639},{"uri":"Pink_(singer)","surface_form":"Pink","offset":645}]}
