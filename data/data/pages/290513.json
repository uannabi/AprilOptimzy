{"id":290513,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinoe","text":"=\"preserve\">In Greek mythology, Melinoe is the goddess of ghosts. She is the daughter of Persephone and Hades. She lives in the Underworld. She has a pale complexion and a short temper and takes after her father in almost every way, except from her beauty that she gets from her mother Persephone. Melinoe has the powers to turn any mortal insane by her phantoms.\nLittle is known about Melinoe, but ancient Greeks used to conduct rituals and acts of praises to her as a sign of devotion and to garner protection from ghosts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":15},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":58},{"uri":"Persephone","surface_form":"Persephone","offset":89},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":104},{"uri":"Greek_underworld","surface_form":"Underworld","offset":128},{"uri":"Mortality","surface_form":"mortal","offset":333},{"uri":"Insanity","surface_form":"insane","offset":340}]}
