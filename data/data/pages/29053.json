{"id":29053,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380","text":"The Airbus A380 (also called \"Super-jumbo-jet\") is a four-engined, double-decked airplane manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's biggest passenger airplane, larger than the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. However, it is not the biggest airplane in the world; the Antonov An-225 super-freighter is bigger.\nThe Airbus A380 can carry up to 850 passengers (but it usually carries about 525), and weighs over 550 tonnes. It has four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines or four Engine Alliance GP7000 engines. The companies General Electric and Pratt & Whitney make alliance engines.\nOrders.\nHundreds of A380-800 airplanes have been ordered by 20 airlines. One has been ordered by a Saudi Arabian Prince, Al-Walid bin Talal and 10 by a company called ILFC (who gives other airlines airplanes for rent).\nEmirates Airlines (an airline from the United Arab Emirates) will have the most A380 aircraft, because they have ordered 162 aircraft. Singapore Airlines took delivery of the first A380, which flew to Sydney in Australia on October 25, 2007. Singapore Airlines now have 19 A380s and are still waiting for 5 more.\nOther airlines which have ordered the A380 are Qantas (from Australia, currently operating 7), Air France (whick has four), China Southern Airlines, Lufthansa (the German airline, which has four), Kingfisher Airlines (from India), Korean Air (from South Korea), Thai Airways, Malaysia Airlines, British Airways, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways (from the United Arab Emirates), Virgin Atlantic (from the United Kingdom) and Air Austral (France).\nMore than 200 A380 have been delivered, including 15 in 2017 and 12 in 2018.\nFreighter Version.\nAirbus was going to make a version of the A380 to carry cargo instead of people. This would look almost the same as the normal passenger version, but with no windows and much bigger doors. Some cargo companies ordered the plane, like FedEx and UPS. Because Airbus took too long to make the A380, those orders were canceled. Because Airbus has not got any orders for the plane anymore, they decided to not make the freighter version for a while and focus on making the passenger version of the A380.\nIncidents.\nThe Airbus A380 had 1 incident, with no deaths.\nSome Facts.\n1. [https://emirates.com Emirates] owns over 100 A380s.\n2. The A380 was built to contend with the Boeing 747 \"Jumbo Jet\"\n3. It's officially dead. Airbus are planning to stop A380 production by 2021.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":81},{"uri":"Airbus","surface_form":"Airbus","offset":106},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":140},{"uri":"Boeing_747","surface_form":"Boeing 747","offset":176},{"uri":"Antonov_An-225","surface_form":"Antonov An-225","offset":256},{"uri":"Tonne","surface_form":"tonne","offset":401},{"uri":"Rolls-Royce","surface_form":"Rolls-Royce","offset":421},{"uri":"General_Electric","surface_form":"General Electric","offset":505},{"uri":"Pratt_%26amp%3B_Whitney","surface_form":"Pratt & Whitney","offset":526},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":628},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":664},{"uri":"Emirates_(Airline)","surface_form":"Emirates Airlines","offset":784},{"uri":"United_Arab_Emirates","surface_form":"United Arab Emirates","offset":823},{"uri":"Singapore_Airlines","surface_form":"Singapore Airlines","offset":919},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":985},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":995},{"uri":"Qantas","surface_form":"Qantas","offset":1144},{"uri":"Air_France","surface_form":"Air France","offset":1192},{"uri":"China_Southern_Airlines","surface_form":"China Southern Airlines","offset":1221},{"uri":"Lufthansa","surface_form":"Lufthansa","offset":1246},{"uri":"Kingfisher_Airlines","surface_form":"Kingfisher Airlines","offset":1294},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1320},{"uri":"Korean_Air","surface_form":"Korean Air","offset":1328},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":1345},{"uri":"Thai_Airways","surface_form":"Thai Airways","offset":1359},{"uri":"Malaysia_Airlines","surface_form":"Malaysia Airlines","offset":1373},{"uri":"British_Airways","surface_form":"British Airways","offset":1392},{"uri":"Qatar_Airways","surface_form":"Qatar Airways","offset":1409},{"uri":"Etihad_Airways","surface_form":"Etihad Airways","offset":1424},{"uri":"Virgin_Atlantic","surface_form":"Virgin Atlantic","offset":1472},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1498},{"uri":"Air_Austral","surface_form":"Air Austral","offset":1518},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":1692},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":1709},{"uri":"FedEx","surface_form":"FedEx","offset":1870},{"uri":"UPS","surface_form":"UPS","offset":1880},{"uri":"Airbus_A330","surface_form":"A380","offset":2269},{"uri":"Airbus_A330","surface_form":"A380","offset":2380}]}
