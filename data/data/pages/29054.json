{"id":29054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(mythology)","text":"Paris, also called Alexandros, is a person in Greek mythology. He is an important person in the Trojan War, and Homer's \"Iliad\".\nAlexandros (Paris) was the son of King Priam of Troy and his wife Hecuba. Because it was prophesied that he would bring the end and destruction of Troy, he was left to die in the wilderness. But Alexandros was found by another man, who took him as a son and named him Paris.\nThree goddesses, Hera, Aphrodite, and Athene, had a beauty contest. They all bribed Paris with different offers. Hera offered him power, Athene offered him wisdom, and Aphrodite promised him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen.\nThe problem was that Helen was already married to Menelaus. Paris used a trick to take Helen home with him to Troy. This caused the Trojan War.\nDuring the war, Paris killed Achilles by shooting his heel with a poisoned arrow.\nLate in the war, Paris was killed by Philoctetes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":46},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer's","offset":112},{"uri":"Iliad","surface_form":"Iliad","offset":121},{"uri":"Priam","surface_form":"Priam","offset":168},{"uri":"Troy","surface_form":"Troy","offset":177},{"uri":"Hecuba","surface_form":"Hecuba","offset":195},{"uri":"Hera","surface_form":"Hera","offset":421},{"uri":"Aphrodite","surface_form":"Aphrodite","offset":427},{"uri":"Athena","surface_form":"Athene","offset":442},{"uri":"Beauty_contest","surface_form":"beauty contest","offset":456},{"uri":"Menelaus","surface_form":"Menelaus","offset":691},{"uri":"Trojan_War","surface_form":"Trojan War","offset":773},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrow","offset":860},{"uri":"Philoctetes","surface_form":"Philoctetes","offset":904}]}
