{"id":290705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_nervous_system","text":"=\"preserve\">The somatic nervous system (SNS) is part of the peripheral nervous system. It controls various muscles and the sensory input from external stimuli\nThe SNS controls voluntary body movements by skeletal muscles. Its outgoing (efferent) nerves stimulate muscle contraction. Its incoming (afferent) nerves relay sensation from the skin, and sense organs to the central nervous system. This includes touch, hearing, and sight.\nThe SNS does not, however, control reflex arcs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peripheral_nervous_system","surface_form":"peripheral nervous system","offset":60},{"uri":"Sense","surface_form":"sensory","offset":123},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimuli","offset":151},{"uri":"Voluntary","surface_form":"voluntary","offset":176},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":213},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":246},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":339},{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"sense organs","offset":349},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":369},{"uri":"Touch","surface_form":"touch","offset":407},{"uri":"Hearing","surface_form":"hearing","offset":414},{"uri":"Visual_perception","surface_form":"sight","offset":427},{"uri":"Reflex_arc","surface_form":"reflex arc","offset":469}]}
