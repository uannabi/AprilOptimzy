He is the currently leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the leader of the Main Opposition in Turkey. He has been the Member of Parliament for \u0130stanbul since 2002.\nHe became popular with the documents about lawlessness. The CHP nominated him as candidate for Mayor of Istanbul in 2009 local elections, in which he gained 36.8% of all votes. Despite this result he could not be first. However this result was a big success for social democrats because they had not ruled Istanbul for many years and this city had become the power centre of AK Parti for long years. This popularity provided him with a great advantage. Upon Deniz Baykal's resignation in 2010, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00E7daro\u011Flu became the leader with a record voting rate.\nFirstly he took part in the Turkish general election in 2011. The Republican People's Party gained 25.98% of all votes with an increase of about 6 points. However, this was not enough to be ruling party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkish_people","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":48},{"uri":"Republican_People%27s_Party","surface_form":"Republican People's Party","offset":102},{"uri":"Official_Opposition","surface_form":"Main Opposition","offset":156},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":175},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":199},{"uri":"%C4%B0stanbul","surface_form":"\u0130stanbul","offset":224},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"Mayor","offset":340},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":349}]}
