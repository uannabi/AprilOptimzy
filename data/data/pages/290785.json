It often occurs in disputes.\nThe word is derived from the Greek \"polemikos\" (\u03C0\u03BF\u03BB\u03B5\u03BC\u03B9\u03BA\u03CC\u03C2), meaning \"warlike, hostile\".\nHistory.\nPolemic journalism was common in continental Europe, when libel laws were not as stringent.\nTo support study of the polemics and controversies of the 17th-19th centuries, a British research project has placed thousands of pamphlets of that era online.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":37},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversy","offset":49},{"uri":"Opinion","surface_form":"opinion","offset":78},{"uri":"Doctrine","surface_form":"doctrine","offset":87},{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":143},{"uri":"Discussion","surface_form":"discussion","offset":153},{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"dispute","offset":184},{"uri":"Libel","surface_form":"libel","offset":349}]}
