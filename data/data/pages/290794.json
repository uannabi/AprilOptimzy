{"id":290794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone","text":"=\"preserve\">Follicle-stimulating hormone (abbreviated FSH, sometimes called \"Follitropine\") is a glycoprotein and sex steroid. It is synthesised in the adeno hypophysis of pituitary gland. In females it controls the synthesising process of progesteron and will cause the growth of follicles in the ovaries. In males, it will lead to the production of sperm. Other hormones control the release of FSH. Luteinizing hormone will cause ovulation in females, or the production of testosterone in males.\nThis hormone is made by the pituitary glands in the brain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Glycoprotein","surface_form":"glycoprotein","offset":97},{"uri":"Sex_steroid","surface_form":"sex steroid","offset":114},{"uri":"Adeno_hypophysis_of_pituitary_gland","surface_form":"adeno hypophysis of pituitary gland","offset":152},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":192},{"uri":"Progesteron","surface_form":"progesteron","offset":240},{"uri":"Ovarian_follicle","surface_form":"follicles","offset":281},{"uri":"Ovary","surface_form":"ovaries","offset":298},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":310},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":351},{"uri":"Luteinizing_hormone","surface_form":"Luteinizing hormone","offset":401},{"uri":"Testosterone","surface_form":"testosterone","offset":475}]}
