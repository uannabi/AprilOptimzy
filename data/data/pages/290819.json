They may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the \"shovel\" more like a modern-day scythe, grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gomphothere","surface_form":"Gomphothere","offset":21},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":44},{"uri":"Herbivores","surface_form":"herbivores","offset":58},{"uri":"Elephants","surface_form":"elephants","offset":87},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":173},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":213},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":221},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":229},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":238},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":326},{"uri":"Savanna","surface_form":"savanna","offset":349},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":388},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":507},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":517},{"uri":"Incisor","surface_form":"incisor","offset":553},{"uri":"Scythe","surface_form":"scythe","offset":622}]}
