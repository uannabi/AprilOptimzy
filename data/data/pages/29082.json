This was the period called the \u201CRomantic period\u201D by musicians. In literature and some other arts the \u201CRomantic period\u201D is often said to begin and finish earlier: around mid 18th to mid 19th century.\nIn the Classical period artists liked to see clear forms. 18th century architecture nearly always shows a lot of symmetry. The gardens of the palace at Versailles are a good example of this with their very tidy patterns of straight paths, circular ponds and neatly clipped hedges.\nIn music the Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert liked to compose music which had a clear plan like sonata form.\nIn the Romantic period artists thought that feeling and passions were more important than formal plans. This can be seen in the gardens designed by Capability Brown, e.g. in at Blenheim Palace, Oxford. The gardens are made to blend into nature.\nIn music the Romantic composers may still use plans like sonata form, but feelings and passions are important. They often write what is called programme music which means: music that describes something or tells a story. Beethoven\u2019s Sixth Symphony is called the \u201CPastoral\u201D which means that it is about the countryside. Although Beethoven is usually called a composer of the Classical period he is also an early Romantic. Later composers such as Felix Mendelssohn wrote pieces like \"Hebrides Overture\" which describes the sea coming into Fingal\u2019s Cave in the Inner Hebrides Islands in Scotland. Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) wrote a lot of music which tells a story. His \"Symphonie Fantastique\" is about an artist madly in love. Berlioz\u2019s whole way of life was wild and romantic. He fell in love with an actress he saw on stage playing the part of Juliet in Shakespeare\u2019s \"Romeo and Juliet\" and he actually married her! Other composers who wrote a lot of programme music include Franz Liszt (1811-1886) and Richard Strauss (1864-1949). Strauss always wrote in a late-Romantic style even although he lived well into the 20th century.\nThe Romantic period was also the period of Nationalism. \"Nationalism\" means being proud of one's country. In the 19th century a lot of European countries as we know them were being formed. In music a lot of composers were writing music which was typical of their country. They often did this by using folk music. Anton\u00EDn Dvo\u0159\u00E1k (1841-1904) and Bed\u0159ich Smetana (1824-1884) wrote music which sounds very Czech. Pyotr Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) wrote music with Russian folk songs in them. Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) used German folk songs in his symphonies, and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958) collected English folk songs and put them in his music. One of those pieces was a Fantasy on the famous tune \"Greensleeves\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":52},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":98},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":118},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":132},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th","offset":239},{"uri":"Classical_music_period","surface_form":"Classical period","offset":272},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":323},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":336},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":378},{"uri":"Versailles","surface_form":"Versailles","offset":417},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circular","offset":504},{"uri":"Hedge","surface_form":"hedges","offset":538},{"uri":"Classical_music_period","surface_form":"Classical","offset":559},{"uri":"Joseph_Haydn","surface_form":"Haydn","offset":587},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":594},{"uri":"Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":602},{"uri":"Schubert","surface_form":"Schubert","offset":617},{"uri":"Sonata_form","surface_form":"sonata form","offset":677},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"gardens","offset":818},{"uri":"Capability_Brown","surface_form":"Capability Brown","offset":838},{"uri":"Blenheim","surface_form":"Blenheim","offset":867},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":884},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":927},{"uri":"Programme_music","surface_form":"programme music","offset":1078},{"uri":"Felix_Mendelssohn","surface_form":"Felix Mendelssohn","offset":1380},{"uri":"Inner_Hebrides","surface_form":"Inner Hebrides","offset":1493},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":1519},{"uri":"Hector_Berlioz","surface_form":"Hector Berlioz","offset":1529},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":1735},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare\u2019s","offset":1789},{"uri":"Franz_Liszt","surface_form":"Franz Liszt","offset":1910},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":1938},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":2050},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"Nationalism","offset":2107},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"European","offset":2199},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":2365},{"uri":"Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k","surface_form":"Anton\u00EDn Dvo\u0159\u00E1k","offset":2377},{"uri":"Bed%C5%99ich_Smetana","surface_form":"Bed\u0159ich Smetana","offset":2408},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":2466},{"uri":"Pyotr_Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","offset":2473},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":2520},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Gustav Mahler","offset":2548},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":2579},{"uri":"Ralph_Vaughan_Williams","surface_form":"Ralph Vaughan Williams","offset":2620},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":2665}]}
