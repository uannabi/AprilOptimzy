{"id":290895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tatum","text":"Edward Lawrie Tatum (December 14, 1909 \u2013 November 5, 1975) was an American geneticist.\nHe shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 with George Beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in metabolism. The other half of that year's award went to Joshua Lederberg.\nBeadle and Tatum's experiments exposed the bread mold \"Neurospora crassa\" to x-rays, causing mutations. They showed the mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. These experiments, published in 1941, led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the \"one gene, one enzyme\" hypothesis.\nTatum went on to study genetics in bacteria. Tatum and his student Lederberg showed that \"Escherichia coli\" could share genetic information through recombination.\nEd Tatum was born in Boulder, Colorado. He attended college at the University of Chicago and received his PhD in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1934. Starting in 1937, he worked at Stanford University, where he began his collaboration with Beadle. He then moved to Yale University in 1945 where he mentored Lederberg. He returned to Stanford in 1948 and then joined the faculty of Rockefeller Institute in 1957. A heavy cigarette smoker, he died in New York City of heart failure complicated by chronic emphysema.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"American","offset":66},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":75},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":109},{"uri":"George_Beadle","surface_form":"George Beadle","offset":160},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":191},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":225},{"uri":"Joshua_Lederberg","surface_form":"Joshua Lederberg","offset":281},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":318},{"uri":"Neurospora_crassa","surface_form":"Neurospora crassa","offset":354},{"uri":"X-rays","surface_form":"x-rays","offset":376},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":392},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":456},{"uri":"Metabolic_pathway","surface_form":"metabolic pathway","offset":476},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":643},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":690},{"uri":"Escherichia_coli","surface_form":"Escherichia coli","offset":745},{"uri":"Genetic_recombination","surface_form":"recombination","offset":803},{"uri":"Boulder%2C_Colorado","surface_form":"Boulder, Colorado","offset":839},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":885},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":931},{"uri":"University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison","surface_form":"University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison","offset":953},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":1025},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":1109},{"uri":"Rockefeller_Institute","surface_form":"Rockefeller Institute","offset":1225},{"uri":"Cigarette","surface_form":"cigarette","offset":1264},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1293},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":1310},{"uri":"Emphysema","surface_form":"emphysema","offset":1347}]}
