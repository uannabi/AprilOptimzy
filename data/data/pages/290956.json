Brickfilms are often used to help the Lego Group advertise more sets and themes. The first known Brickfilm was called \"The Magic Portal\". It was made 1980\u20131989 in Perth, Western Australia by Lindsay Fleay.\nA brickfilm can be made by taking a Lego character, and placing it on a board. The creator takes a picture, and slightly moves the character, and Repeats this step many times. The easiest way to stream the pictures together, is to use video editing software, adding the pictures, and finally, setting them to a very short time. Fifteen frames per second (15 fps) is common, if a video editor only uses fps instead of changing time length.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stop-motion","surface_form":"stop-motion","offset":17},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":29},{"uri":"Lego","surface_form":"Lego","offset":41},{"uri":"Lego_Group","surface_form":"Lego Group","offset":128},{"uri":"Advertising","surface_form":"advertise","offset":139},{"uri":"Perth%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Perth","offset":253},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":260}]}
