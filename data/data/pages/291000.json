{"id":291000,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luria%E2%80%93Delbr%C3%BCck_experiment","text":"The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00FCck experiment, 1943, also called the 'Fluctuation Test', asks the question: are mutations independent of natural selection? Or are they directed by the selection?\nMax Delbr\u00FCck and Salvador Luria showed that in bacteria, DNA mutations happen randomly. This means they happen at any time, rather than being a response to selection.\nSo, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms.\nDelbr\u00FCck and Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine partly for this work.\nThe experiment.\nIn their experiment, Luria and Delbr\u00FCck grew bacteria in tubes. After a period of growth, they put equal volumes of these separate cultures onto agar containing phage (virus). If virus resistance were not due to random gene mutations, then each plate should contain roughly the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbr\u00FCck and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically.\nLuria and Delbr\u00FCck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":96},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":121},{"uri":"Max_Delbr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Max Delbr\u00FCck","offset":179},{"uri":"Salvador_Luria","surface_form":"Salvador Luria","offset":196},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":226},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":236},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":240},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":257},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Darwin","offset":350},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":369},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":504},{"uri":"Agar","surface_form":"agar","offset":725},{"uri":"Bacteriophage","surface_form":"phage","offset":741},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":799}]}
