{"id":291022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Delbr%C3%BCck","text":"Max Ludwig Henning Delbr\u00FCck (September 4, 1906 \u2013 March 9, 1981) was a German-American biophysicist and Nobel laureate.\nDelbr\u00FCck was one of the most influential people in the movement of physical scientists into biology during the 20th century.\nDelbr\u00FCck's big idea was to explore genetics by means of the bacteriophage viruses which infect bacteria. This was important in the early development of molecular biology.\nBiography.\nDelbr\u00FCck was born in Berlin, German Empire. Trained as a physicist, he got his Ph.D. in 1930. he traveled through England, Denmark, and Switzerland. He met Wolfgang Pauli and Niels Bohr, who got him interested in biology.\nIn 1937, he moved to the United States to pursue his interests in biology, taking up research in the Biology Division at Caltech on genetics of the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\". While at Caltech Delbr\u00FCck became acquainted with bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophage or 'phage').\nDelbr\u00FCck remained in the US during World War II, teaching physics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville while pursuing his genetic research. In 1942, he and Salvador Luria of Indiana University demonstrated that bacterial resistance to virus infection is caused by random mutation and not adaptive change. This research, known as the Luria-Delbr\u00FCck experiment, was also significant for its use of mathematics to make quantitative predictions for the results to be expected from alternative models. For that work, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969, sharing it with Alfred Hershey.\nDuring the 1940s Delbr\u00FCck developed a course in bacteriophage genetics at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to encourage interest in the field. In 1947, Delbr\u00FCck returned to Caltech as a professor of biology where he remained until 1977.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":70},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":77},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"biophysicist","offset":86},{"uri":"Nobel_prize","surface_form":"Nobel laureate","offset":103},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":211},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":279},{"uri":"Bacteriophage","surface_form":"bacteriophage","offset":304},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":318},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":339},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":396},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":447},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":455},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":483},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":540},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":549},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":562},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Pauli","surface_form":"Wolfgang Pauli","offset":582},{"uri":"Niels_Bohr","surface_form":"Niels Bohr","offset":601},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":639},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":673},{"uri":"Caltech","surface_form":"Caltech","offset":769},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":780},{"uri":"Drosophila_melanogaster","surface_form":"Drosophila melanogaster","offset":807},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":972},{"uri":"Vanderbilt_University","surface_form":"Vanderbilt University","offset":1006},{"uri":"Nashville%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Nashville","offset":1031},{"uri":"Salvador_Luria","surface_form":"Salvador Luria","offset":1094},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":1149},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":1173},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":1209},{"uri":"Luria-Delbr%C3%BCck_experiment","surface_form":"Luria-Delbr\u00FCck experiment","offset":1271},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":1472},{"uri":"Alfred_Hershey","surface_form":"Alfred Hershey","offset":1535},{"uri":"Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory","surface_form":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","offset":1629}]}
