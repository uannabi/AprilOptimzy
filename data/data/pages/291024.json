{"id":291024,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Luria","text":"Salvador Edward Luria (Turin, Italy, August 13, 1912 \u2013 Lexington, Massachusetts, February 6, 1991) was an Italian microbiologist.\nHe won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his pioneering work with Max Delbr\u00FCck and Alfred Hershey on phages in molecular biology.\nBiography.\nLuria was born Salvatore Edoardo Luria in Turin, Italy to an influential Italian Sephardic Jewish family. He attended the medical school at the University of Turin. There, he met two other future Nobel laureates: Rita Levi-Montalcini and Renato Dulbecco.\nIn Rome, he was introduced to Max Delbr\u00FCck's theories on the gene as a molecule and began to formulate methods for testing genetic theory with bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria.\nIn 1938, he received a fellowship to study in the United States, where he intended to work with Delbr\u00FCck. Soon after Luria received the award Benito Mussolini's fascist regime banned Jews from academic research fellowships.\nWithout funding sources for work in the U.S. or Italy, Luria left his home country for Paris, France in 1938. As the Nazi German armies invaded France in 1940, Luria fled on bicycle to Marseilles where he received an immigration visa to the United States.\nPhage research.\nLuria arrived in New York City on September 12, 1940 and soon changed his first and middle names. With the help of physicist Enrico Fermi, whom he knew from his time at the University of Rome, Luria received a fellowship at Columbia University. He soon met Delbr\u00FCck and Hershey, and they collaborated on experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and in Delbr\u00FCck's lab at Vanderbilt University.\nHis famous experiment with Delbr\u00FCck in 1943, known as the Luria-Delbr\u00FCck experiment, demonstrated that inheritance in bacteria follows Darwinian rather than Lamarckian principles and that mutant genes occurring randomly can still give viral resistance without the virus being present. The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences, for example, it explains how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance.\nFrom 1943 to 1950, he worked at Indiana University, Bloomington. His first graduate student was James D. Watson, who went on to discover the structure of DNA with Francis Crick. In January 1947, Luria became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\nIn 1950, Luria moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While investigating how a culture of \"E. coli\" was able to stop the production of phages, Luria discovered that specific bacterial strains produce enzymes that cut DNA at certain sequences. These enzymes became known as restriction enzymes and developed into one of the main molecular tools in molecular biology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":23},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":30},{"uri":"Lexington","surface_form":"Lexington","offset":55},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":66},{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":106},{"uri":"Microbiology","surface_form":"microbiologist","offset":114},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":146},{"uri":"Max_Delbr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Max Delbr\u00FCck","offset":213},{"uri":"Alfred_Hershey","surface_form":"Alfred Hershey","offset":230},{"uri":"Phage","surface_form":"phage","offset":248},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":258},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":330},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":337},{"uri":"Sephardic","surface_form":"Sephardic","offset":369},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":379},{"uri":"University_of_Turin","surface_form":"University of Turin","offset":432},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel","offset":484},{"uri":"Rita_Levi-Montalcini","surface_form":"Rita Levi-Montalcini","offset":501},{"uri":"Renato_Dulbecco","surface_form":"Renato Dulbecco","offset":526},{"uri":"Max_Delbr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Max Delbr\u00FCck","offset":573},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":604},{"uri":"Bacteriophage","surface_form":"bacteriophage","offset":686},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":712},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":732},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":792},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":884},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"fascist","offset":903},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1053},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1060},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":1083},{"uri":"Marseilles","surface_form":"Marseilles","offset":1151},{"uri":"Visa","surface_form":"visa","offset":1195},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1255},{"uri":"Enrico_Fermi","surface_form":"Enrico Fermi","offset":1363},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":1462},{"uri":"Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory","surface_form":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","offset":1557},{"uri":"Vanderbilt_University","surface_form":"Vanderbilt University","offset":1612},{"uri":"Luria-Delbr%C3%BCck_experiment","surface_form":"Luria-Delbr\u00FCck experiment","offset":1693},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Darwin","offset":1770},{"uri":"Lamarckism","surface_form":"Lamarckian","offset":1792},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutant","offset":1823},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":2042},{"uri":"Indiana_University","surface_form":"Indiana University","offset":2097},{"uri":"Bloomington","surface_form":"Bloomington","offset":2117},{"uri":"James_D._Watson","surface_form":"James D.
