{"id":291077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","text":"The central dogma of molecular biology is a phrase by Francis Crick, who proposed the double helix structure of DNA.\nIt means that information passes from DNA to proteins via RNA, but proteins cannot pass the information back to DNA.\nCrick first wrote it in 1958, and repeated it in 1970.\nThe dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of sequence information.\nThe general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), DNA information can be copied into mRNA, (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation).\nThe dogma is a modern version of the Weismann barrier (after August Weismann). This is the principle that hereditary information moves only from genes to body cells, and never in reverse. Hereditary information moves only from germline cells to somatic cells.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Francis_Crick","surface_form":"Francis Crick","offset":54},{"uri":"Helix","surface_form":"helix","offset":93},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":112},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":348},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":357},{"uri":"DNA_replication","surface_form":"DNA replication","offset":470},{"uri":"MRNA","surface_form":"mRNA","offset":523},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":530},{"uri":"Translation_(genetics)","surface_form":"translation","offset":623},{"uri":"August_Weismann","surface_form":"August Weismann","offset":698},{"uri":"Inherit","surface_form":"hereditary","offset":743},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":782},{"uri":"Gamete","surface_form":"germline cells","offset":864},{"uri":"Somatic_cell","surface_form":"somatic cell","offset":882}]}
