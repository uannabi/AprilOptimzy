He served on the House Appropriations and Calendars committees during his three two-year terms in office.\nIn 1990, as a newly Republican, Perry challenged Jim Hightower, the incumbent Democratic Agriculture Commissioner. Karl Rove was Perry\u2019s campaign manager. Perry won the election.\nIn April 1993, Perry, while serving as Texas agriculture commissioner, expressed support for the effort to reform the nation's health care, describing it as \"most commendable\".\nIn 1994, Perry was reelected Agriculture Commissioner by a large margin.\nIn 1998, Perry chose not to seek a third term as Agriculture Commissioner, running instead for Lieutenant Governor to succeed the retiring Democrat Bob Bullock. He won the election.\nGovernor of Texas (2000-2015).\nPerry assumed the office of governor on December 21, 2000, following the resignation of George W.

Perry denied ever mentioning Joe Biden in his discussions with Trump or Ukrainian officials.\nPersonal life.\nAlthough Perry is a Methodist, he now attends an Evangelical \"megachurch\".
