{"id":29122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name","text":"e=\"preserve\">A given name is a name given to a person at birth or baptism. Given names are referred as first names. It is different from a surname. A surname is the last name or family name.\nIn most Western countries the given name comes first (before the last name or family name). However, in many Eastern countries such as Japan and China it comes after the last name or family name, and occasionally also in Europe, e.g. in Hungarian.\nChristians often call their first name their \"Christian name\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":31},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptism","offset":66},{"uri":"Surname","surface_form":"surname","offset":139},{"uri":"Family_name","surface_form":"family name","offset":178},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":326},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":336},{"uri":"Hungarian_language","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":428},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":439}]}
