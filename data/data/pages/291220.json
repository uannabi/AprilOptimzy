{"id":291220,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_cheque","text":"=\"preserve\">A traveler's cheque (also traveller's cheque, travellers cheque, traveller's check or traveler's check) is a preprinted cheque for a fixed amount. The person who buys it must sign it and then sign it again when he \"cashes\" it. It is a good way for a traveller to take money when going on holiday. If a traveler's cheque is stolen it can be replaced so long as the person still has a receipt to prove that he bought it.\nTraveler's cheques were a large part of the business of American Express. Since 2005 the American Express have been issuing \"American Express Travelers Cheque Cards\". These can be used in stores like a credit card.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cheque","surface_form":"cheque","offset":132},{"uri":"Receipt","surface_form":"receipt","offset":395},{"uri":"American_Express","surface_form":"American Express","offset":487},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":511}]}
