{"id":29123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name","text":"e=\"preserve\">A family name is a name shared by people in the same family. Different cultures have different orders for a person's family name and given name. In English, the family name is always at the end, so it is also called a last name or surname. Children usually have the same family name as their father. A married woman often changes her family name to be the same as her husband.\nMany languages put the family name first. Some give a child the mother's family name. Some use more complex names that list the family name of both parents, and sometimes additional family relations. Some, such as Javanese, do not very often give anyone a family name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":32},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"family","offset":66},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":84},{"uri":"Given_name","surface_form":"given name","offset":146},{"uri":"Last_name","surface_form":"last name","offset":231},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father","offset":305},{"uri":"Mother","surface_form":"mother","offset":454},{"uri":"Parent","surface_form":"parent","offset":538},{"uri":"Javanese_language","surface_form":"Javanese","offset":604}]}
