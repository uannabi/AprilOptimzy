{"id":291333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_pot","text":"A chamber pot (also a chamberpot), a piss pot, a potty, or a thunder pot) is a container with a handle, usually used as a urinal at night. It is kept in a bedroom under a bed or in a nightstand.\nDuring Victorian times, some chamber pots were built into a cabinet with a closeable cover.\nHistory.\nThe chamber pot was originally designed for females. Called the \"Bourdaloue\", it allowed women to urinate squatting or sitting without accidents. It was supposedly named after the French Catholic priest Louis Bourdaloue, whose sermon were so long that women brought \"Bourdaloue\" so they could urinate without having to leave.\nIn the 19th century, water closets started to be more common than chamber pots, but chamber pots were still used until the mid-20th century. Today, they are used in countries that have no indoor plumbing.\nIn North America and the UK, \"potty\" refer to the toilets made especially for potty training. These toilets are similar to chamber pots.\nIn the Philippines, chamber pots are used as urinals and are commonly called \"Arinola\" in Philippine languages like Tagalog and Cebuano.\nIn Korea, chamber pots are referred to as yogang (\uC694\uAC15). Currently, they are still used in some country regions in the North.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"container","offset":79},{"uri":"Handle_(grip)","surface_form":"handle","offset":96},{"uri":"Urinal","surface_form":"urinal","offset":122},{"uri":"Nightstand","surface_form":"nightstand","offset":183},{"uri":"Victorian_era","surface_form":"Victorian","offset":202},{"uri":"Cupboard","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":255},{"uri":"Louis_Bourdaloue","surface_form":"Louis Bourdaloue","offset":499},{"uri":"Sermon","surface_form":"sermon","offset":523},{"uri":"Flush_toilet","surface_form":"water closet","offset":643},{"uri":"Plumbing","surface_form":"plumbing","offset":817},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":830},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":971},{"uri":"Tagalog_language","surface_form":"Tagalog","offset":1080},{"uri":"Cebuano_language","surface_form":"Cebuano","offset":1092},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":1104},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North","offset":1218}]}
