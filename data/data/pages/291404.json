It took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defenses stopped the German attack on Moscow, the Soviet capital, which was one of the Axis's primary military and political objectives in the invasion of the Soviet Union.\nThe German strategic offensive named Operation Typhoon was planned to attack Moscow from the north and south. The Soviets reacted by sending in more reserve from the Far East. Shortly, German attacks were stopped, and the Soviets began counter-attack and forced to push the Axis back.\nReferences.\nBattle of Moscow September 1941-January 1942","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)","surface_form":"Eastern Front during World War II","offset":113},{"uri":"Operation_Barbarossa","surface_form":"invasion of the Soviet Union","offset":355},{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategic","offset":396}]}
