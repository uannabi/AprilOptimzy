{"id":291405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein","text":"The Second Battle of El Alamein was a great turning point in the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. The battle lasted from 23 October to 5 November 1942. The First Battle of El Alamein had stopped the Axis from attacking deep into Egypt further. Thereafter, Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took command of the British Eighth Army in August 1942. In the second battle he took the offensive, with great success.\nThe Allied victory turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended Axis's hopes of occupying Egypt, taking control of the Suez Canal, and reaching the Middle Eastern oil fields.\nThe battle forced Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Corps to retreat back to the former French fortifications in the Mareth Line in the border between Tunisia and Libya.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":96},{"uri":"Bernard_Montgomery","surface_form":"Bernard Montgomery","offset":291},{"uri":"Offensive_(military)","surface_form":"offensive","offset":399},{"uri":"North_African_Campaign","surface_form":"North African Campaign","offset":472},{"uri":"Axis_countries","surface_form":"Axis","offset":505},{"uri":"Suez_Canal","surface_form":"Suez Canal","offset":560},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":589},{"uri":"Oil_field","surface_form":"oil field","offset":604},{"uri":"Erwin_Rommel","surface_form":"Erwin Rommel","offset":634},{"uri":"Afrika_Corps","surface_form":"Afrika Corps","offset":655},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":761},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":773}]}
