Their group in the Cavendish Laboratory was the first to determine the structure of proteins, using X-ray crystallography. He was also a Fellow (teacher) at Peterhouse College in Cambridge.\nIn what became the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Kendrew determined the structure of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle cells.\nHe spent the early months of World War II doing research on radar. In 1940 he became engaged in operational research at the Royal Air Force headquarters, holding the honorary rank of Wing Commander R.A.F.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"CBE","offset":25},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":29},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":72},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":80},{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallographer","offset":95},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":132},{"uri":"Max_Perutz","surface_form":"Max Perutz","offset":162},{"uri":"Cavendish_Laboratory","surface_form":"Cavendish Laboratory","offset":193},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":258},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":274},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Fellow","offset":311},{"uri":"Peterhouse%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Peterhouse College","offset":331},{"uri":"MRC_Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology","surface_form":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology","offset":383},{"uri":"Myoglobin","surface_form":"myoglobin","offset":468},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":492},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":502},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":509},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":545},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":576},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":640},{"uri":"Wing_Commander","surface_form":"Wing Commander","offset":699}]}
