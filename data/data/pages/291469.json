{"id":291469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spliceosome","text":"=\"preserve\">A spliceosome is a complex of special RNA and protein subunits. Spliceosomes are amazingly complex molecular machines. They remove introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA segment. This process is generally referred to as splicing.\nEach spliceosome is composed of five small nuclear RNAs, (snRNA)s, and more than 50 proteins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":50},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":58},{"uri":"Intron","surface_form":"intron","offset":143},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcribed","offset":158},{"uri":"RNA_splicing","surface_form":"splicing","offset":229},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"nuclear","offset":282},{"uri":"SnRNA","surface_form":"snRNA","offset":297}]}
