Although considered a separate ethnicity from both whites and blacks, many Dominickers married into local white families, so that group boundaries blurred; some descendants still live in the area. The 1950 federal census identified 60 members of this group living in Holmes County at that time. Few facts are known about their origins, and little has been published about them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_(United_States)","surface_form":"county","offset":19},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":33},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":47},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"U.S. Census Bureau","offset":99},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":163},{"uri":"Bonifay%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Bonifay, Florida","offset":178},{"uri":"Indian_Chief","surface_form":"Indian Chief","offset":238},{"uri":"Cerro_Gordo%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Cerro Gordo","offset":374},{"uri":"Westville%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Westville","offset":392},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":609},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"population density","offset":714},{"uri":"Race_(United_States_Census)","surface_form":"White","offset":900},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":922},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":946},{"uri":"Asian","surface_form":"Asian","offset":969},{"uri":"Pacific_Islander","surface_form":"Pacific Islander","offset":982},{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":1087},{"uri":"Latino","surface_form":"Latino","offset":1099},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married couples","offset":1230},{"uri":"Median","surface_form":"median","offset":1746},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":1893},{"uri":"Per_capita_income","surface_form":"per capita income","offset":2060},{"uri":"Poverty_line","surface_form":"poverty line","offset":2175},{"uri":"Dominickers","surface_form":"Dominickers","offset":2297},{"uri":"Mixed-race","surface_form":"mixed-race","offset":2331},{"uri":"Yuchi","surface_form":"Euchee Indian","offset":2361},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":2414},{"uri":"Ponce_de_Leon%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Ponce de Leon","offset":2490},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"segregated","offset":2532},{"uri":"Elementary_school","surface_form":"elementary school","offset":2550},{"uri":"Ethnicity","surface_form":"ethnicity","offset":2600}]}
