He was of Jewish descent.\nBrenner made significant contributions to work on the genetic code, and other areas of molecular biology.\nHe established the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" as a model organism for the investigation of developmental biology. He founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California.\nWork.\nBrenner made several important contributions to molecular biology in the 1960s. With Francis Crick and others, he worked out the genetic code, where triplets of nucleic acid bases are translated into amino acids.\nBrenner then focused on establishing \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" as a model organism for the investigation of animal development including development of the nervous system. Brenner chose this 1 millimeter-long soil roundworm mainly because it is simple, is easy to grow in bulk populations, and turned out to be convenient for genetic analysis. For this work, he shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert Horvitz and John Sulston. His Nobel lecture in December 2002, \"Nature's gift to science\" is a homage to this modest nematode. He considers chosing the right organism is as important as picking the right problems to work on. In recognition of his pioneering work on \"C. elegans\", another closely related nematode was given the scientific name \"Caenorhabditis brenneri\".\nBrenner founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, CA in 1996. He is currently associated with the Salk Institute, the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Singapore Biomedical Research Council and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In August 2005 Brenner was appointed president of the [http://www.oist.jp Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology]. He is also on the Board of Scientific Governors at the Scripps Research Institute.\nKnown for his scientific insight and wit, Brenner for many years penned a regular column (\"Loose Ends\") in the journal \"Current Biology\". Brenner was noted for his generosity of ideas and the great number of students and colleagues his ideas have stimulated.\nBrenner died on 5 April 2019 in Singapore. He was 92.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour","surface_form":"CH","offset":15},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":18},{"uri":"South_African","surface_form":"South African","offset":61},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":75},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":96},{"uri":"Robert_Horvitz","surface_form":"Robert Horvitz","offset":156},{"uri":"John_Sulston","surface_form":"John Sulston","offset":175},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":199},{"uri":"Genetic_code","surface_form":"genetic code","offset":269},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":302},{"uri":"Roundworm","surface_form":"roundworm","offset":340},{"uri":"Caenorhabditis_elegans","surface_form":"Caenorhabditis elegans","offset":351},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":380},{"uri":"Developmental_biology","surface_form":"developmental biology","offset":420},{"uri":"Molecular_Sciences_Institute","surface_form":"Molecular Sciences Institute","offset":458},{"uri":"Berkeley%2C_California","surface_form":"Berkeley, California","offset":490},{"uri":"Francis_Crick","surface_form":"Francis Crick","offset":603},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":679},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":718},{"uri":"Caenorhabditis_elegans","surface_form":"Caenorhabditis elegans","offset":769},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":798},{"uri":"Developmental_biology","surface_form":"development","offset":845},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":886},{"uri":"Roundworm","surface_form":"roundworm","offset":944},{"uri":"Genetic","surface_form":"genetic","offset":1056},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":1108},{"uri":"Nematode","surface_form":"nematode","offset":1274},{"uri":"Salk_Institute","surface_form":"Salk Institute","offset":1637},{"uri":"Institute_of_Molecular_and_Cell_Biology","surface_form":"Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology","offset":1657},{"uri":"Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute","surface_form":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute","offset":1748},{"uri":"Scripps_Research_Institute","surface_form":"Scripps Research Institute","offset":1956},{"uri":"Wit","surface_form":"wit","offset":2021},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":2275}]}
