{"id":29156,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters","text":"Chinese characters are symbols used to write the Chinese and Japanese languages. In the past, other languages like Korean and Vietnamese also used them. The beginning of these characters was at least 3000 years ago, making them one of the oldest writing systems in the world that is still used today. In Chinese they are called \"hanzi\" (), which means \"Han character\". In Japanese they are called \"kanji,\" \"hanja\" in Korean, and \"Han Nom\" in Vietnamese.\nChinese characters are an important part of East Asian culture. Chinese characters may be considered to be abstract art, because of how the characters are made up of lines and dots. The art of writing Chinese characters is called calligraphy.\nWriting.\nChinese characters are a type of logogram, which are written symbols that represent words instead of sounds. Most earlier Chinese characters were pictographs, which are simple pictures used to mean some kind of thing or idea. Today, very few modern Chinese characters are pure pictographs, but are a combination of two or more simple characters, also known as radicals. While many radicals and characters show a word's meaning, some give hints of the word's pronunciation instead.\nCommon examples of words using phonetic characters are the names of countries, such as Canada, which is pronounced \"Ji\u0101n\u00E1d\u00E0\" (\u52A0\u62FF\u5927) in Chinese. While the third character \u5927 \"d\u00E0\", which has the meaning \"big/large/great\", seems to describe Canada well, since it is a big country, the first two characters \u52A0 \"ji\u0101\", meaning \"to add\", and \u62FF \"n\u00E1\", meaning \"to take\", have no obvious relation to Canada. Therefore, it is safe to say that these characters were chosen only because the pronunciation of each character sounds similar to the syllables of the English name of the country.\nNobody knows exactly how many Chinese characters there are, but the biggest Chinese dictionaries list about fifty thousand characters, even though most of them are only variants of other characters seen in very old texts. For example, the character \u56DE (hu\u00ED) has also been written as the variant characters \u8FF4\uFF0C\u5EFB\uFF0C\u56EC\uFF0C\u9025\uFF0C\u5EFD\uFF0Cand \u56D8, although most Chinese people only know and use the variant \u56DE. Studies in China show that normally three to four thousand characters are used in daily life, so it is safe to say that someone needs to know three to four thousand characters to be functionally literate in Chinese, or be able to read everyday writing without serious problems.\nCharacters are a kind of graphic language, much different from languages that use an alphabet such as English. The correct way to tell between them is to remember the structure and meaning of every character, not pronunciation, because there is a very close relationship between meaning and structure of characters. Example: \u623F(house)=\u6237+\u65B9. \u623F is a shape-pronunciation character. \u6237 is for shape and \u65B9 is for pronunciation. \u6237 means 'door'. \u623F means 'A person lives behind a door'. \u65B9 pronunciation is \"fang\" and tone is 1, and with the tone mark it is written as \"f\u0101ng\". \u623F pronunciation is also \"fang\", but tone is 2, with the tone mark it is written as \"f\u00E1ng\".\nChinese characters in other languages.\nChinese characters have been used to write other languages.\nThere are still many Chinese characters that are used in Japanese and Korean. Generally the educational level of a Japanese person is decided by the number of Chinese characters understood by this person. While Koreans nowadays mostly write in hangul, the native Korean alphabet, people have found that some meanings cannot be expressed clearly by just hangul, so people need to use Chinese characters as a note with a bracket. Before 1446, Korean people only used Chinese characters.\nIn Japanese, characters that are borrowed from the Chinese language are called kanji. Kanji can be used to write both native Japanese words and Chinese loanwords. Japanese writing uses a mix of kanji and two kana systems. Kanji is mostly used to show a word's meaning, while hiragana and katakana are syllabaries that show the pronunciation of Japanese words. Both writing systems are used often when writing Japanese.\nIn Korean, they are called hanja. Throughout most of Korean history, hanja was the only writing system most literate Koreans knew. Even though hangul was invented in 1446, it was only used by commoners and not the government until Korea gained independence from Japan. Nowadays, most Koreans write mostly in hangul. In North Korea, people write almost completely in hangul since Kim Il-sung abolished hanja from Korean. In South Korea, people mostly write in hangul, and they sometimes write hanja. Native Korean words are almost always written in hangul. Hanja are usually only used to write words that are borrowed from the Chinese language, and are usually only used when the word's meaning isn't obvious based on the context.\nIn Vietnamese, they are called ch\u1EEF N\u00F4m. Many Chinese loanwords were used in Vietnamese, especially in old Vietnamese literature. While Vietnamese used many Chinese characters, they also invented tens of thousands of their own characters to write Vietnamese words. The radicals used in ch\u1EEF N\u00F4m were usually a mix of the words' meanings and pronunciations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":23},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"write","offset":39},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":49},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":61},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":70},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":115},{"uri":"Vietnamese_language","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":126},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"writing system","offset":246},{"uri":"Kanji","surface_form":"kanji","offset":398},{"uri":"Hanja","surface_form":"hanja","offset":407},{"uri":"Sino-Vietnamese_characters","surface_form":"Han Nom","offset":430},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":498},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":509},{"uri":"Abstract_art","surface_form":"abstract art","offset":561},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":620},{"uri":"Dot","surface_form":"dot","offset":630},{"uri":"Calligraphy","surface_form":"calligraphy","offset":684},{"uri":"Logogram","surface_form":"logogram","offset":739},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":790},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":807},{"uri":"Pictograph","surface_form":"pictograph","offset":852},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":882},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":926},{"uri":"Combination","surface_form":"combination","offset":1006},{"uri":"Radical_(Chinese_character)","surface_form":"radicals","offset":1066},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"functionally literate","offset":2328},{"uri":"Graphic","surface_form":"graphic","offset":2449},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":2509},{"uri":"Hangul","surface_form":"hangul","offset":3423},{"uri":"Kanji","surface_form":"kanji","offset":3743},{"uri":"Yamato_kotoba","surface_form":"native Japanese words","offset":3782},{"uri":"Sino-Japanese_vocabulary","surface_form":"Chinese loanwords","offset":3808},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese writing","offset":3827},{"uri":"Syllabary","surface_form":"syllabaries","offset":3965},{"uri":"Hanja","surface_form":"hanja","offset":4110},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literate","offset":4191},{"uri":"Hangul","surface_form":"hangul","offset":4226},{"uri":"Commoner","surface_form":"commoner","offset":4275},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":4297},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":4314},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":4327},{"uri":"Kim_Il-Sung","surface_form":"Kim Il-sung","offset":4462},{"uri":"Sino-Vietnamese_characters","surface_form":"ch\u1EEF N\u00F4m","offset":4844},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":4930}]}
