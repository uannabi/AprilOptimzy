This turbine is connected to an electrical generator. After this, the water is condensed, and may be used again. This is known as the Rankine cycle. There are different procedures that can be used to heat the water;\nMain disadvantage of fossil fuel thermal power plant.\nFossil fueled thermal power plants produce a large part of man-made CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and efforts to reduce these are varied and widespread.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Power_plant","surface_form":"power plant","offset":27},{"uri":"Steam","surface_form":"steam","offset":45},{"uri":"Steam_turbine","surface_form":"steam turbine","offset":70},{"uri":"Condensation","surface_form":"condensed","offset":164},{"uri":"Rankine_cycle","surface_form":"Rankine cycle","offset":219}]}
