{"id":29162,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_(building)","text":"The Reichstag building was designed as a home to the parliament of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894. The original building's design was made by Paul Wallot. It was built on the site of an old palace in Berlin, Germany.\nThe building was used by the parliament of the German Empire until 1918. The parliament of the Weimar Republic, also called the Reichstag sat there until the 1933 Reichstag fire. The Third Reich seldom used its parliament, so the building remained empty and derelict until after German reunification.\nThen it became the seat of the German parliament again in 1999 after a reconstruction led by British architect Lord Norman Foster.\nToday's parliament of Germany is called the \"Bundestag.\" The \"Reichstag\" as a parliament dates back to the Holy Roman Empire and ceased to act as a true parliament in the years of Nazi Germany (1933-1945). In today's usage, the German term \"Reichstag\" refers to the building, while the term \"Bundestag\" refers to the institution.\nThe Reichstag dome.\nThe original Reichstag dome was damaged in the 1933 fire and again during the war. It was replaced by a large glass dome. The new dome has a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. The main hall of the parliament below can also be seen from inside the dome, and natural light from above emits down to the parliament floor. A large sun shield tracks the movement of the sun electronically and blocks direct sunlight which would make the space too hot and dazzle those below. Construction work was finished in 1999 and the seat of parliament was transferred to the Bundestag in April of that year. The dome is no longer open to anyone without prior registration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["building"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":53},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":71},{"uri":"1894","surface_form":"1894","offset":103},{"uri":"Paul_Wallot","surface_form":"Paul Wallot","offset":152},{"uri":"Berlin%2C_Germany","surface_form":"Berlin, Germany","offset":210},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Weimar Republic","offset":322},{"uri":"Reichstag_fire","surface_form":"Reichstag fire","offset":390},{"uri":"Third_Reich","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":410},{"uri":"German_reunification","surface_form":"German reunification","offset":506},{"uri":"1999","surface_form":"1999","offset":586},{"uri":"Norman_Foster_(architect)","surface_form":"Norman Foster","offset":644},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":681},{"uri":"Bundestag","surface_form":"Bundestag","offset":704},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"\"Reichstag\" as a parliament","offset":720},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":766},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":839},{"uri":"1933","surface_form":"1933","offset":853},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":858},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":887},{"uri":"Dome","surface_form":"dome","offset":1125},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":1185},{"uri":"Bundestag","surface_form":"Bundestag","offset":1585},{"uri":"April","surface_form":"April","offset":1598}]}
