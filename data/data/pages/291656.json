{"id":291656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sulston","text":"Sir John Edward Sulston FRS (27 March 1942 \u2013 6 March 2018) was a British biologist. He was a joint winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nHe was the first Director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and then Chair of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester.\nSulston was one of 20 Nobel laureates who signed the \"Stockholm memorandum\" at the 3rd Nobel Laureate Symposium on Global Sustainability in Stockholm, Sweden on 18 May 2011.\nWork.\nHe first studied at the University of Cambridge in Pembroke College, where he graduated in 1963. He then stayed on to do his PhD there. After working at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, for a while, he returned to Cambridge to work under Sydney Brenner at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.\nSulston played a central role in both the \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" roundworm and human genome sequencing projects. As sequencing of the worm genome proceeded, the project to sequence the human genome began. At this point he was made director of the newly established Sanger Centre (named after Fred Sanger).\nOne of Sulston's most important contributions during his research years at the LMB was to find the precise order in which cells in \"C. elegans\" divide. In fact, he and his team succeeded in tracing the nematode's entire embryonic cell lineage. Sulston was a leading campaigner against the patenting of human genetic information.\nDeath.\nSulston died on 6 March 2018 at the age of 75.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":24},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":65},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":118},{"uri":"Wellcome_Sanger_Institute","surface_form":"Wellcome Sanger Institute","offset":190},{"uri":"University_of_Manchester","surface_form":"University of Manchester","offset":291},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":521},{"uri":"Pembroke_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Pembroke College","offset":548},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":622},{"uri":"Salk_Institute","surface_form":"Salk Institute","offset":654},{"uri":"La_Jolla","surface_form":"La Jolla","offset":670},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":680},{"uri":"Sydney_Brenner","surface_form":"Sydney Brenner","offset":744},{"uri":"MRC_Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology","surface_form":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology","offset":766},{"uri":"Caenorhabditis_elegans","surface_form":"Caenorhabditis elegans","offset":846},{"uri":"Roundworm","surface_form":"roundworm","offset":870},{"uri":"Human_Genome_Project","surface_form":"human genome","offset":884},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"sequencing","offset":897},{"uri":"Human_genome","surface_form":"human genome","offset":990},{"uri":"Fred_Sanger","surface_form":"Fred Sanger","offset":1097},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":1233},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"divide","offset":1255},{"uri":"Nematode","surface_form":"nematode","offset":1313},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":1331},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":1400}]}
