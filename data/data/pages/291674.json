{"id":291674,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Klug","text":"Sir Aaron Klug OM PRS (August 11, 1926 \u2013 November 20, 2018) was a Lithuanian-born British chemist and biophysicist.\nKlug won the 1982 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing crystallographic electron microscopy and working out the structure of nucleic acid-protein complexes.\nBiography.\nKlug was born in \u017Delva, Lithuania to Jewish parents. The family moved to South Africa when he was two. Klug graduated with a degree in science at the University of Witwatersrand and studied crystallography at the University of Cape Town before moving to England, completing his doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1953.\nHe moved to Birkbeck College, University of London, in late 1953, and started working with Rosalind Franklin in John Bernal's lab. This experience aroused a lifelong interest in viruses. During his time there he worked on the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus.\nIn 1962 he moved to the newly built MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Klug used methods from X-ray diffraction to develop crystallographic electron microscopy. In this method, two-dimensional images of crystals taken from different angles are combined to make three-dimensional images of the target. He worked out the structure of important nucleic acid-protein complexes.\nBetween 1986 and 1996 he was Director of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, and was knighted in 1988. He was elected President of the Royal Society, and served from 1995\u20132000. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1995.\nKlung died on November 20, 2018 in Cambridge at the age of 92.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"OM","offset":15},{"uri":"President_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"PRS","offset":18},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":66},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":82},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":90},{"uri":"Biophysicist","surface_form":"biophysicist","offset":102},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":134},{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallographic","offset":174},{"uri":"Electron_microscope","surface_form":"electron microscopy","offset":191},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":244},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":257},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":311},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":324},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":360},{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallography","offset":477},{"uri":"University_of_Cape_Town","surface_form":"University of Cape Town","offset":500},{"uri":"Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Trinity College, Cambridge","offset":578},{"uri":"Birkbeck_College","surface_form":"Birkbeck College","offset":626},{"uri":"University_of_London","surface_form":"University of London","offset":644},{"uri":"Rosalind_Franklin","surface_form":"Rosalind Franklin","offset":705},{"uri":"J._D._Bernal","surface_form":"John Bernal","offset":726},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":792},{"uri":"Tobacco_mosaic_virus","surface_form":"tobacco mosaic virus","offset":857},{"uri":"MRC_Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology","surface_form":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology","offset":915},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray diffraction","offset":988},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":1087},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":1097},{"uri":"Three-dimensional","surface_form":"three-dimensional","offset":1155},{"uri":"Target","surface_form":"target","offset":1187},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":1236},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":1249},{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"knighted","offset":1367},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":1417},{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"Order of Merit","offset":1483},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":1542}]}
