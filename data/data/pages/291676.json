After the name change, the actual Deportivo Petare uses those colors as second choice. In the 2010-2011 championship the main colors are white and black.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deportivo_Italia_(1948-2010)","surface_form":"Deportivo Italia F\u00FAtbol Club","offset":69},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":104},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":115},{"uri":"Caracas","surface_form":"Caracas","offset":138},{"uri":"Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n_Venezolana","surface_form":"Primera Divisi\u00F3n Venezolana","offset":338},{"uri":"Copa_de_Venezuela","surface_form":"Copa de Venezuela","offset":385},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":526},{"uri":"Venezuelan_First_Division","surface_form":"Venezuelan First Division","offset":850},{"uri":"Copa_Venezuela","surface_form":"Copa Venezuela","offset":935},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1176},{"uri":"Deportivo_Tachira","surface_form":"Deportivo Tachira","offset":1603},{"uri":"Estadio_Br%C3%ADgido_Iriarte","surface_form":"Estadio Br\u00EDgido Iriarte","offset":1710},{"uri":"Estadio_Ol%C3%ADmpico_(Caracas)","surface_form":"Estadio Ol\u00EDmpico (Caracas)","offset":1819},{"uri":"Italian_national_football_team","surface_form":"Italian national football team","offset":2051}]}
