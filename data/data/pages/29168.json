{"id":29168,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender","text":"Lavender is a type of plant found on almost all continents. It has a purplish colour. It has a colour named after it, called lavendar. Its Latin and scientific name is \"Lavandula\".\nUse in gardens.\nLavenders are very popular among gardeners. Sometimes their petals are dried and sealed in pouches for good scent, and sometimes put inside clothes to prevent moths, who can damage the clothes.\nUse in food.\nLavenders are also used in cake decorating, because the flowers can become candied. Sometimes they are used in flavoring baked goods and chocolate desserts, and sometimes they use it to make a very delicious \"lavender sugar\". Lavender flowers are also used to make tea. The French make lavender syrup, which is used to make lavender scones and lavender marshmallows.\nMedicine.\nLavenders are sometimes put in medicine, too, and sometimes to prevent infection - such as lavender oil, that was used in World War 1 to disinfect walls and floors of the hospital. As the folk wisdom says, lavender oil is also helpful to headaches when rubbed on your temple, and lavender tea helps you relax before bed time. Lavender is also very helpful when applied to insect bites.\nOther uses.\nSometimes, dried petals of lavender are used to throw confetti at a wedding. It is also used for lavender theme wedding decoration where the flowers are put in the vases and kept on the venue table.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":22},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":48},{"uri":"Colouring","surface_form":"colour","offset":78},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":95},{"uri":"Lavender_(colour)","surface_form":"lavendar","offset":125},{"uri":"Scent","surface_form":"scent","offset":305},{"uri":"Syrup","surface_form":"syrup","offset":699},{"uri":"Scone","surface_form":"scone","offset":737},{"uri":"Marshmallow","surface_form":"marshmallow","offset":757},{"uri":"Disinfect","surface_form":"disinfect","offset":918}]}
