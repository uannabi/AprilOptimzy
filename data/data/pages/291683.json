{"id":291683,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Planck units are physical units of measurement. The system of these units was first developed by Max Planck. The four basic Planck units are based only on four physical constants found in nature. When Planck units are used to express any of these four physical constants, the value is 1. This allows physicists to simplify many equations about physical law. Planck proposed these units in 1899.\nEach of these constants has at least one fundamental physical theory: \"c\" with special relativity, \"G\" with general relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, \"\u0127\" with quantum mechanics, \"\u03B5\"0 with electrostatics, and \"k\"B with statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.\nPlanck units are very important for theoretical physics, because they simplify several recurring algebraic expressions of physical law. They are particularly relevant in research on unified theories such as quantum gravity.\nPlanck units may sometimes be semi-humorously referred to by physicists as \"God's units\". They eliminate human centred arbitrariness from the system of units: some physicists argue that communication with extraterrestrial intelligence would have to use such a system of units to make common reference to scale. Unlike the meter and second, which exist as fundamental units in the SI system for historical reasons, the Planck length and Planck time are linked at a fundamental physical level.\nThe strength of gravity is simply what it is and the strength of the electromagnetic force is simply what it is.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"units of measurement","offset":43},{"uri":"Max_Planck","surface_form":"Max Planck","offset":114},{"uri":"Physical_constant","surface_form":"physical constant","offset":177},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":345},{"uri":"Special_relativity","surface_form":"special relativity","offset":491},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":520},{"uri":"Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation","surface_form":"Newton's law of universal gravitation","offset":543},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":591},{"uri":"Electrostatics","surface_form":"electrostatics","offset":620},{"uri":"Statistical_mechanics","surface_form":"statistical mechanics","offset":650},{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamics","offset":676},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebraic expression","offset":789},{"uri":"Physical_law","surface_form":"physical law","offset":814},{"uri":"Quantum_gravity","surface_form":"quantum gravity","offset":899},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"extraterrestrial intelligence","offset":1121},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":1238},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":1248},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":1296},{"uri":"Planck_length","surface_form":"Planck length","offset":1334},{"uri":"Planck_time","surface_form":"Planck time","offset":1352}]}
