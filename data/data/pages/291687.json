{"id":291687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin","text":"Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin (12 May 1910 \u2013 29 July 1994), was a British chemist, credited with the development of protein crystallography. Hodgkin received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964.\nEarly Life.\nHodgkin was born in Cairo, Egypt. She and her sisters were sent to live in England when World War l started. She spent the rest of her life there. Her mother was an expert on nature and Ancient Egyptian Textiles. Hodgkin\u2019s father was a British archeologist and scholar.\nCareer.\nShe studied crystals and became a teacher Somerville College at University of Oxford. In 1969, Hodgkin was able to use computer technology discover the structure of Insulin. Insulin is a protein in the body that is used to treat diabetes.\nShe advanced the technique of X-ray crystallography, a method used to determine the three dimensional structures of biomolecules.\nErnst Chain thought he found the structure of penicillin. Hodgkin proved he was right. She also found the structure of vitamin B12. For her work she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nIn 1969, after 35 years of work and five years after winning the Nobel Prize, Hodgkin was able to find the structure of insulin.\nX-ray crystallography became a widely used tool and helped to find structures of many biological molecules such as DNA. The structure of molecules helps us understand how they work.\nHonors.\nApart from the Nobel Prize, she was appointed to the Order of Merit, and given the Copley Medal, the top award of the Royal Society.\nShe was Chancellor of Bristol University from 1970 to 1988, and President of Pugwash from 1976 to 1988. Pugwash is an organization which holds conferences on Science and World Affairs.\nHer best-known student was Margaret Thatcher, who consulted her when she (Thatcher) was in office.\nControversies.\nHodgkin was not allowed to enter the United States without special permission from the CIA. She protested and wanted world peace. She also had a good relationship with J.D. Bernal, who was considered too liberal. She received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1987.\nHodgkin died of a stroke in 1994.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":74},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":162},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":228},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":235},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":283},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War l","offset":296},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archeologist","offset":452},{"uri":"Somerville_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Somerville College","offset":528},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"University of Oxford","offset":550},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":755},{"uri":"Three_dimensional","surface_form":"three dimensional","offset":809},{"uri":"Ernst_Chain","surface_form":"Ernst Chain","offset":855},{"uri":"Penicillin","surface_form":"penicillin","offset":901},{"uri":"B_vitamin_complex","surface_form":"vitamin B","offset":974},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":1020},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":1166},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":1290},{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"Order of Merit","offset":1418},{"uri":"Copley_Medal","surface_form":"Copley Medal","offset":1448},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":1483},{"uri":"University_of_Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol University","offset":1520},{"uri":"Pugwash","surface_form":"Pugwash","offset":1575},{"uri":"Margaret_Thatcher","surface_form":"Margaret Thatcher","offset":1710},{"uri":"CIA","surface_form":"CIA","offset":1884},{"uri":"J.D._Bernal","surface_form":"J.D.
