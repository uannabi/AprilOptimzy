{"id":291770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_crystallography","text":"e=\"preserve\">Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).\nThis method works in many cases where X-ray crystallography does not. The latter needs large 3-D crystals to work.\nProtein structures are usually done from 2-dimensional crystals (sheets or helices), polyhedrons such as viral capsids, or dispersed proteins. Electrons can be used in these situations, whereas X-rays cannot, because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than X-rays do.\nElectron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The method was invented by Aaron Klug, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this, and his studies on virus structures and transfer RNA, in 1982.\nThe first electron crystallographic protein structure to be solved was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990.\nSince then, several other high-resolution structures have been done by electron crystallography, including the light-harvesting complex, and the bacterial flagellum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":82},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":91},{"uri":"Electron_microscope","surface_form":"electron microscope","offset":119},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":184},{"uri":"3-D","surface_form":"3-D","offset":239},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":243},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"Protein","offset":261},{"uri":"Helix","surface_form":"helices","offset":336},{"uri":"Polyhedron","surface_form":"polyhedron","offset":346},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"viral","offset":366},{"uri":"Electron_microscope","surface_form":"electron microscope","offset":644},{"uri":"Aaron_Klug","surface_form":"Aaron Klug","offset":698},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":722},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":776},{"uri":"Transfer_RNA","surface_form":"transfer RNA","offset":797},{"uri":"Bacteriorhodopsin","surface_form":"bacteriorhodopsin","offset":891},{"uri":"Light-harvesting_complex","surface_form":"light-harvesting complex","offset":1029},{"uri":"Flagellum","surface_form":"flagellum","offset":1073}]}
