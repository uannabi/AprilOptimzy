{"id":291829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius","text":"Svante August Arrhenius (19 February 1859 \u2013 2 October 1927) was a Nobel Prize-winning Swedish scientist who made discoveries in physics, chemistry and earth science.\nOriginally he was a physicist, but he won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and was a founder of physical chemistry.\nLater in life, he turned to other scientific problems. He was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide, from processes like the burning of fossil fuels, would cause global warming.\nEarly work.\nHis early work was on the conductivity of electrolytes. In 1884, based on this work, he submitted a 150-page essay on electrolytic conductivity to University of Uppsala for his doctorate. It did not impress the professors, and he received a low-class degree. Later, extensions of this work would earn him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nThe most important idea in the thesis was his explanation that neither pure salts nor pure water is a conductor, but solutions of salts in water are.\nArrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt splits up into charged particles (which Michael Faraday had given the name ions many years earlier). Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of electrolysis; Arrhenius' idea was that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions. He proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.\nIn an extension of his ionic scientific theory Arrhenius proposed definitions for acids and bases, in 1884. He believed that acids were substances which produce hydrogen ions in a solution and that bases were substances which produce hydroxide ions in a solution.\nThe Nobel Prize.\nAbout 1900, Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the Nobel Prizes. For the rest of his life, he would be a member of the Nobel Committee on Physics and a member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry.\nHe used his positions to arrange prizes for his friends (Jacobus van't Hoff, Wilhelm Ostwald, Theodore Richards) and to attempt to deny them to his enemies (Paul Ehrlich, Walther Nernst). In 1903 he became the first Swedish persn to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nLater work.\nAfter he had made his name, he turned to other scientific questions.\nPhysiology.\nIn 1904 he delivered (at the University of California) several lectures, to try and show the application of the methods of physical chemistry to the study of the theory of toxins and antitoxins, and which were published in 1907 under the title \"Immunochemistry\".\nEarth and planetary sciences.\nHe also turned his attention to geology (the origin of ice ages), astronomy, physical cosmology, and astrophysics, accounting for the birth of the solar system by interstellar collision.\nHe considered radiation pressure as accounting for comets, the solar corona, the aurora borealis, and zodiacal light.\nHe thought life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of spores. This idea is now known as panspermia.\nGreenhouse effect.\nArrhenius thought of a theory to explain the ice ages, and in 1896 he was the first scientist to think that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could make a big change to the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. He was influenced by the work of others, including Joseph Fourier. Arrhenius used infrared observations of the moon to work out the absorption of infrared radiation by atmospheric CO2 and water vapour.\nHe was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes would cause global warming. Arrhenius clearly believed that a warmer world would be a positive change. Nevertheless, until about 1960, most scientists dismissed the greenhouse effect because they thought it was very unlikely to happen. Milutin Milankovitch had presented a mechanism for ice ages: it used cyclical changes in the orbit of the Earth (Milankovitch cycles). Nowadays, the accepted explanation is that orbital forcing sets the timing for ice ages with CO2 acting as amplifying feedback.\nHuman affairs.\nHe thought of the idea of a universal language (one language that would be spoken by everybody), proposing a modification of the English language.\nArrhenius was one of several leading Swedish scientists who helped create The State Institute for Racial Biology in 1922. This was a eugenics-influenced idea. It had originally been proposed as a Nobel Institute. Arrhenius was a member of the institute's board, as he had been in The Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene (Eugenics), founded in 1909.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":66},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":86},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":94},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":128},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":137},{"uri":"Earth_science","surface_form":"earth science","offset":151},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":186},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":217},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical chemistry","offset":264},{"uri":"Emission","surface_form":"emission","offset":379},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":392},{"uri":"Fossil_fuel","surface_form":"fossil fuel","offset":443},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":469},{"uri":"Conductivity","surface_form":"conductivity","offset":523},{"uri":"Electrolyte","surface_form":"electrolyte","offset":539},{"uri":"Uppsala","surface_form":"University of Uppsala","offset":644},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctorate","offset":674},{"uri":"Thesis","surface_form":"thesis","offset":863},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":908},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":923},{"uri":"Electrical_conductor","surface_form":"conductor","offset":934},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":949},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":1086},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":1121},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolysis","offset":1215},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":1351},{"uri":"Scientific_theory","surface_form":"scientific theory","offset":1440},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":1493},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":1503},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":1572},{"uri":"Hydroxide","surface_form":"hydroxide","offset":1645},{"uri":"Jacobus_van%27t_Hoff","surface_form":"Jacobus van't Hoff","offset":1975},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Ostwald","surface_form":"Wilhelm Ostwald","offset":1995},{"uri":"Theodore_Richards","surface_form":"Theodore Richards","offset":2012},{"uri":"Paul_Ehrlich","surface_form":"Paul Ehrlich","offset":2075},{"uri":"Walther_Nernst","surface_form":"Walther Nernst","offset":2089},{"uri":"University_of_California","surface_form":"University of California","offset":2314},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":2457},{"uri":"Antitoxin","surface_form":"antitoxin","offset":2468},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":2610},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":2633},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":2644},{"uri":"Physical_cosmology","surface_form":"physical cosmology","offset":2655},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysics","offset":2679},{"uri":"Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System","surface_form":"birth of the solar system","offset":2712},{"uri":"Radiation_pressure","surface_form":"radiation pressure","offset":2779},{"uri":"Comet","surface_form":"comet","offset":2816},{"uri":"Solar_corona","surface_form":"solar corona","offset":2828},{"uri":"Aurora_borealis","surface_form":"aurora borealis","offset":2846},{"uri":"Zodiacal_light","surface_form":"zodiacal light","offset":2867},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":2965},{"uri":"Panspermia","surface_form":"panspermia","offset":2999},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":3075},{"uri":"Greenhouse_effect","surface_form":"greenhouse effect","offset":3259},{"uri":"Joseph_Fourier","surface_form":"Joseph Fourier","offset":3329},{"uri":"Milankovitch","surface_form":"Milankovitch","offset":3856},{"uri":"Milankovitch_cycles","surface_form":"Milankovitch cycles","offset":3961},{"uri":"Orbital_forcing","surface_form":"orbital forcing","offset":4026},{"uri":"Feedback","surface_form":"amplifying feedback","offset":4090},{"uri":"Universal_language","surface_form":"universal language","offset":4154},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":4255},{"uri":"Eugenics","surface_form":"eugenics","offset":4406},{"uri":"Nobel_Institute","surface_form":"Nobel Institute","offset":4469}]}
