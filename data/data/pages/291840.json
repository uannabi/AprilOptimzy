{"id":291840,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg","text":"Sir William Henry Bragg (2 July 1862 \u2013 12 March 1942) was a British physicist, chemist, mathematician and active sportsman.\nBragg shared a Nobel Prize with his son William Lawrence Bragg \u2013 the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nAdelaide.\nIn 1885, at 23, Bragg was appointed Elder Professor of Mathematics and Experimental Physics at the University of Adelaide, and started work there early in 1886.\nBragg was an able and popular lecturer; he encouraged the formation of the student union, and the attendance, free of charge, of science teachers at his lectures.\nBragg was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1907.\nLeeds.\nBragg returned to England at the end of 1908 and took the Cavendish Chair in Physics at the University of Leeds in 1909. He published an imporant early work on radioactivity, \"Studies in radioactivity\", in 1912.\nHe invented the X-ray spectrometer, and began work with his son. Together they founded the new technique of X-ray crystallography, for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915. That year was also marked by their book \"X-rays and crystal structure\", the standard text for many years.\nFrom 1914, both father and son contributed to the war effort; W.H. Bragg was connected with submarine detection, at Aberdour on Forth and at Harwich, and returned to London in 1918 as a consultant to the Admiralty.\nUniversity College London.\nBragg was appointed Quain Professor of Physics at University College London in 1915, but did not take up his duties there until after World War I.\nRoyal Institution.\nFrom 1923 he was Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory. This institution was practically rebuilt in 1929-30 and, under Bragg's directorship, many valuable papers were issued from the laboratory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":60},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":68},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":79},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":88},{"uri":"William_Lawrence_Bragg","surface_form":"William Lawrence Bragg","offset":164},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":198},{"uri":"Thomas_Elder","surface_form":"Elder","offset":268},{"uri":"University_of_Adelaide","surface_form":"University of Adelaide","offset":331},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"Fellow of the Royal Society","offset":574},{"uri":"Cavendish","surface_form":"Cavendish","offset":676},{"uri":"University_of_Leeds","surface_form":"University of Leeds","offset":710},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactivity","offset":778},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":846},{"uri":"Spectrometer","surface_form":"spectrometer","offset":852},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":938},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":1215},{"uri":"Harwich","surface_form":"Harwich","offset":1264},{"uri":"Admiralty","surface_form":"Admiralty","offset":1327},{"uri":"University_College_London","surface_form":"University College London","offset":1415},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1499},{"uri":"Royal_Institution","surface_form":"Royal Institution","offset":1588},{"uri":"Humphrey_Davy","surface_form":"Davy","offset":1626},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Faraday","offset":1631}]}
