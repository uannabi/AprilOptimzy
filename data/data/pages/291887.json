{"id":291887,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaid","text":"A bridesmaid is a member of the bride's group in a wedding. A bridesmaid is usually a young woman, and often a close friend or sister. She helps the bride on the day of a wedding or marriage ceremony. Traditionally, bridesmaids were chosen from unmarried young women who were old enough to be married.\nThe main bridesmaid may be called the chief bridesmaid or maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married. A junior bridesmaid is a girl who is clearly too young to get married, but who is included as an honorary bridesmaid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bride","surface_form":"bride","offset":32},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":51},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":92},{"uri":"Bride","surface_form":"bride","offset":149},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":171},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":182}]}
