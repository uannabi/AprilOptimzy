{"id":291892,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow","text":"Harlow is a former Mark One New Town and local government district in the west of Essex, England. Situated on the border with Hertfordshire, it occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper Stort Valley, which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its watermill. Old Harlow is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its high street buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named Harlowbury, a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a scheduled ancient monument.\nThe M11 motorway passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the London commuter belt and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes Cambridge and London Stansted to the north.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Planned_community","surface_form":"New Town","offset":28},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":82},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":89},{"uri":"Hertfordshire","surface_form":"Hertfordshire","offset":126},{"uri":"Watermill","surface_form":"watermill","offset":307},{"uri":"M11_motorway","surface_form":"M11 motorway","offset":669},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":918},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":932},{"uri":"Stansted","surface_form":"Stansted","offset":939}]}
