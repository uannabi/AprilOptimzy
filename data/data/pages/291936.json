Lawrence Bragg was educated in Adelaide, Australia and in England. He was awarded the Military Cross in World War I.\nLawrence Bragg discovered (1912) the Bragg law of X-ray diffraction, the basis of X-ray crystallography. He was joint winner (with his father, Sir William Bragg) of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915.\nTo date, Lawrence Bragg is the youngest Nobel Laureate. He was the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953.\nHe was elected an FRS in 1921. He was knighted by George VI in 1941, and received both the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Companion_of_Honour","surface_form":"CH","offset":27},{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"OBE","offset":30},{"uri":"Military_Cross","surface_form":"MC","offset":34},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":37},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":78},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":94},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":102},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":116},{"uri":"William_Bragg","surface_form":"William Bragg","offset":209},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":255},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":265},{"uri":"Military_Cross","surface_form":"Military Cross","offset":310},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":328},{"uri":"Diffraction","surface_form":"diffraction","offset":397},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":423},{"uri":"Sir_William_Bragg","surface_form":"Sir William Bragg","offset":484},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_for_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize for Physics","offset":510},{"uri":"Nobel_Laureate","surface_form":"Nobel Laureate","offset":583},{"uri":"Cavendish_Laboratory","surface_form":"Cavendish Laboratory","offset":626},{"uri":"James_D._Watson","surface_form":"James D.
