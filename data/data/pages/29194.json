A nineteenth play, \"Rhesus\" is sometimes thought to be by Euripides, but not all classicists agree on this.\nEuripides was the last of the three greatest Ancient Greek writers of tragedies, the others being Aeschylus and Sophocles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":36},{"uri":"Classical_Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":62},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"plays","offset":88},{"uri":"Tragedy","surface_form":"tragedies","offset":110},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":365},{"uri":"Aeschylus","surface_form":"Aeschylus","offset":418},{"uri":"Sophocles","surface_form":"Sophocles","offset":432}]}
