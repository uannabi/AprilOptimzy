{"id":29209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field","text":"The magnetic field is the area around a magnet in which there is magnetic force. Moving electric charges can make magnetic fields. Magnetic fields can illustrated by magnetic flux lines. At all times the direction of the magnetic field is shown by the direction of the magnetic flux lines. The strength of a magnet has to do with the spaces between the magnetic flux lines. The closer the flux lines are to each other, the stronger the magnet is. The farther away they are, the weaker. The flux lines can be seen by placing iron filings over a magnet. The iron filings move and arrange into the lines. Magnetic fields give power to other particles that are touching the magnetic field.\nIn physics, the magnetic field is a field that passes through space and which makes a magnetic force move electric charges and magnetic dipoles. Magnetic fields are around electric currents, magnetic dipoles, and changing electric fields.\nWhen placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles are in one line with their axes to be parallel with the field lines, as can be seen when iron filings are in the presence of a magnet. Magnetic fields also have their own energy and momentum, with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity. The magnetic field is measured in the units of teslas (SI units) or gauss (cgs units).\nThere are some notable kinds of magnetic field. For the physics of magnetic materials, see magnetism and magnet, and more specifically diamagnetism. For magnetic fields made by changing electric fields, see electromagnetism.\nThe electric field and the magnetic field are components of the electromagnetic field.\nThe law of electromagnetism was founded by Michael Faraday.\nH-field.\nPhysicists can say that the force and torques between two magnets are caused by magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other. This is like the Coulomb force repelling the same electric charges or attracting opposite electric charges. In this model, a magnetic \"H-field\" is produced by \"magnetic charges\" that are 'smeared' around each pole. So, the H-field is like the electric field E which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, all H-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out) all H-field lines point toward the south pole. A north pole, then, feels a force in the direction of the H-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H-field.\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength \"q\"m separated by a very small distance d, such that m = \"q\"m d.\nUnfortunately, magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other. All magnets have north/south pairs which cannot be separated without creating two magnets each having a north/south pair. Also, magnetic poles do not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents nor the force that a magnetic field applies to moving electric charges.\n\"H\"-field and magnetic materials.\nwhere is the surface free current density.\nwhich does not depend on the free currents.\nwhere is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents.\nThe magnetic -field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of 'magnetic charges'. The field lines loop only around 'free current' and, unlike the magnetic field, begins and ends at near magnetic poles as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":40},{"uri":"Magnetic_force","surface_form":"magnetic force","offset":65},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"electric charge","offset":88},{"uri":"Magnetic_flux_line","surface_form":"magnetic flux line","offset":166},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":204},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":524},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":638},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":689},{"uri":"Dipole","surface_form":"dipole","offset":967},{"uri":"Tesla_(unit)","surface_form":"teslas","offset":1288},{"uri":"SI_unit","surface_form":"SI unit","offset":1296},{"uri":"Gauss_(unit)","surface_form":"gauss","offset":1309},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":1419},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":1433},{"uri":"Diamagnetism","surface_form":"diamagnetism","offset":1463},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"electromagnetism","offset":1535},{"uri":"Component","surface_form":"components","offset":1599},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":1683},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":1737},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":1747},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":1767},{"uri":"Coulomb_force","surface_form":"Coulomb force","offset":1857},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"electric charge","offset":1890},{"uri":"Electric_field","surface_form":"electric field","offset":2083},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"electric charge","offset":2127},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":2936},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":2966},{"uri":"Demagnetizing_field","surface_form":"demagnetizing field","offset":3254}]}
