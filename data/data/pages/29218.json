{"id":29218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit","text":"e=\"preserve\">All planets in our solar system follow an elliptical path. This path is known as an orbit. Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle. If we were to draw the Earth's orbit on a sheet of paper as a perfect circle, the width of the line would be larger than the elliptical path of the Earth.\nThe Earth's orbit takes about 365 days, this is also called a year. This means that in 365 days (a year) the Earth has gone around the Sun. From this we can find that the orbital speed of the Earth is about through space.\nThe closest distance Earth is to the Sun, or perihelion, is and the farthest or aphelion is. It takes light (or any other electromagnetic radiation) just over eight minutes to travel from Sun to Earth.\nThe seasonal changes on Earth are because of the 23.44\u00B0 axial tilt of its rotation and slightly elliptical path around the Sun.\nThe orbit varies over long periods of time according to the Milankovitch cycles. These cycles are one of the main causes of climate change.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Planets","surface_form":"planets","offset":17},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":32},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":55},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":97},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"elliptical path","offset":268},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":360},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":433},{"uri":"Orbital_speed","surface_form":"orbital speed","offset":469},{"uri":"Perihelion","surface_form":"perihelion","offset":565},{"uri":"Aphelion","surface_form":"aphelion","offset":600},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":622},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_radiation","surface_form":"electromagnetic radiation","offset":642},{"uri":"Axial_tilt","surface_form":"axial tilt","offset":778},{"uri":"Milankovitch_cycle","surface_form":"Milankovitch cycle","offset":910},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":974}]}
