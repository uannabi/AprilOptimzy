It is a parable about a fig tree which does not produce fruit, unlike the parable of the budding fig tree.\nWhat it means.\nThe owner of the vineyard represents God. The fig tree is a symbol for Jerusalem (and also for Jesus's church). The vineyard where the tree was planted is the earth. The tree was meant to bear the good fruit of the Holy Spirit and the gardener (vinedresser) is Jesus. Fig trees are often planted in vineyards.\nThe parable indicates Jesus is giving his hearers one last chance to repent their sins. \"These three years\" refers to the period of his ministry on earth. The parable is connected to the miracle of cursing the fig tree. Richard Whately commented that this parable \"is one which our Lord may be said to have put before his hearers twice; once in words, once in action.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gospel_of_Luke","surface_form":"Luke","offset":36},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":64},{"uri":"Parables_of_Jesus","surface_form":"parable of Jesus","offset":83},{"uri":"Common_fig","surface_form":"fig tree","offset":125},{"uri":"Parable_of_the_budding_fig_tree","surface_form":"parable of the budding fig tree","offset":175},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":318},{"uri":"Gardener","surface_form":"gardener","offset":458},{"uri":"Cursing_the_fig_tree","surface_form":"cursing the fig tree","offset":731},{"uri":"Richard_Whately","surface_form":"Richard Whately","offset":753}]}
