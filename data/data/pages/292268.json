{"id":292268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_Drawing_in_the_Net","text":"The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 13:47\u201352. It is a parable about the final judgment. It is the seventh and last parable in the chapter which began with the Parable of the Sower.\nWhat it means.\nIt is, like The Tares and the Wheat and The Sheep and the Goats, a parable about the final judgment. Here, the edible fish must be separated from the inedible fish after they caught with a net.\nFour of his disciples were fishermen and Jesus spoke using imagery they understood. Because it is a parable about the end of the age, a modern interpretation can be considered, with the net representing the Internet. Jesus's next words about old and new treasures indicated he did have in mind a future time. At that time, \"true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdom's treasure for all to see.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parables_of_Jesus","surface_form":"parable of Jesus","offset":39},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":71},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Matthew","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":88},{"uri":"Last_Judgment","surface_form":"final judgment","offset":132},{"uri":"Parable_of_the_Sower","surface_form":"Parable of the Sower","offset":219},{"uri":"The_Tares_and_the_Wheat","surface_form":"The Tares and the Wheat","offset":268},{"uri":"The_Sheep_and_the_Goats","surface_form":"The Sheep and the Goats","offset":296},{"uri":"Last_Judgment","surface_form":"final judgment","offset":341},{"uri":"Fishermen","surface_form":"fishermen","offset":477},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":657}]}
