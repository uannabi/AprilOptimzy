Bilby shaped chocolates are sold in many Australian shops to raise money to help protect the bilbies.\nAuthor Rose-Marie Dusting wrote a book in 1979 called \"Billy, the Aussie Easter Bilby\". Some of the money from each book sold goes to helping the bilbies.\nThe Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia began to use the Easter Bilby concept in 1991. They wanted to show the damage that rabbits do to the Australian environment. The ideas was taken up by an Easter egg company, Darrell Lea. They give a portion of their profits to the foundation.\nAustralian children's book author and illustrator Irena Sibley produced three Easter Bilby books between 1994 and 2000 including the best selling \"The Bilbies' First Easter\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":4},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":23},{"uri":"Easter_Bunny","surface_form":"Easter Bunny","offset":53},{"uri":"Bilby","surface_form":"Bilbies","offset":67},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered species","offset":82},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":115},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":508},{"uri":"Easter_egg","surface_form":"Easter egg","offset":579},{"uri":"Irena_Sibley","surface_form":"Irena Sibley","offset":718}]}
