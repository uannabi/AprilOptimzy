He contributed to the fields of consumer demand theory in microeconomics. In 1937, he developed the LM model which summarizes a Keynesian view of macroeconomics. His book \"Value and Capital\" (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory. The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him.\nHe was made a Knight Bachelor in 1964.\nIn 1972 he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly) for his pioneering contribution to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory.\nHicks died on 20 May 1989 at his home in the Cotswold village of Blockley at the age of 85.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":66},{"uri":"Consumer_theory","surface_form":"consumer demand theory","offset":109},{"uri":"Microeconomics","surface_form":"microeconomics","offset":135},{"uri":"LM_model","surface_form":"LM model","offset":177},{"uri":"Keynesian","surface_form":"Keynesian","offset":205},{"uri":"Macroeconomics","surface_form":"macroeconomics","offset":223},{"uri":"Value_and_Capital","surface_form":"Value and Capital","offset":249},{"uri":"General_equilibrium_theory","surface_form":"general-equilibrium","offset":298},{"uri":"Compensated_demand_function","surface_form":"compensated demand function","offset":340},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences","offset":487},{"uri":"General_equilibrium_theory","surface_form":"general equilibrium theory","offset":565},{"uri":"Welfare_economics","surface_form":"welfare theory","offset":596},{"uri":"Cotswold","surface_form":"Cotswold","offset":657},{"uri":"Blockley","surface_form":"Blockley","offset":677}]}
