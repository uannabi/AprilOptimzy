{"id":29260,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan","text":"Yerevan () is the capital and largest city of Armenia. In 2004 about 1,088,300 people lived in Yerevan. Some people write Yerevan as Erevan. In past, Yerevan was called Erebuni or Erivan.\nIt is on the Hrazdan River, and is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country.\nThe history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the Urartian fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC. Eventually, the letter \"b\" in the name \"Erebuni\" changed in the 5th or 4th century BC, becoming \"v\".\nClimate.\nThe climate of Yerevan is continental, with dry, hot summers and cold, snowy and short winters. The temperature in August can reach 40\u00B0C (104\u00B0F), while January may be as cold as -15\u00A0\u00B0C (5\u00A0\u00B0F). The amount of precipitation is small, amounting annually to about 350\u00A0mm (14\u00A0in).\nCulture.\nAs a centre of Armenian culture, Yerevan is the site of Yerevan State University (1919), the Armenian Academy of Sciences, a historical museum, an opera house, a music conservatory and several technical institutes. The Matenadaran archives hold a rich collection of valuable ancient Armenian, Greek, Assyrian, Hebrew, Roman and Persian manuscripts. Yerevan has several large public libraries, a number of museums and theaters, botanical gardens and zoos. It is also at the heart of an extensive rail network and is a major trading centre for agricultural products. In addition, industries in the city produce metals, machine tools, electrical equipment, chemicals, textiles and food products.\nTwo major tourist attractions are the Opera House, the ruins of an Urartu fortress and a Roman fortress. The Armenia Marriott Hotel is in the heart of the city at Republic Square (also known as Hraparak).\nMetro.\nThe Yerevan Metro is a rapid transit system that serves the capital city.\nIts interior resembles that of western former Soviet nations with chandeliers hanging\nfrom the corridors. The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Independence of the Republic of Armenia.\nEconomy.\nYerevan is Armenia's industrial, transportation, and cultural center. Manufactures include chemicals, primary metals, machinery, rubber products, plastics, textiles, and processed food. Not only is Yerevan the headquarters of major Armenian companies, but of international ones as well, as it's seen as an attractive outsourcing location for Western European, Russian and American multinationals.\nDevelopment.\nRecently, Yerevan has been undergoing an ambitious redevelopment process in which old Soviet-style apartments and buildings are being demolished and replaced with modern buildings. However, this urban renewal plan has been met with opposition and ([http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&CID=1258&IID=1042&AID=1054]) criticism from some residents.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":18},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":38},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":46},{"uri":"Hrazdan_River","surface_form":"Hrazdan River","offset":201},{"uri":"Urartian","surface_form":"Urartian","offset":373},{"uri":"Erebuni","surface_form":"Erebuni","offset":394},{"uri":"Continental_climate","surface_form":"continental","offset":549},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"C","offset":658},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"F","offset":665},{"uri":"Millimeter","surface_form":"mm","offset":786},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"in","offset":793},{"uri":"Armenian_people","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":822},{"uri":"Matenadaran","surface_form":"Matenadaran","offset":1026},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":1100},{"uri":"Assyrian","surface_form":"Assyrian","offset":1107},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":1117},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":1125},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":1135},{"uri":"Urartu","surface_form":"Urartu","offset":1567},{"uri":"Rapid_transit","surface_form":"rapid transit","offset":1735},{"uri":"Machinery","surface_form":"machinery","offset":2158},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":2169},{"uri":"Textiles","surface_form":"textiles","offset":2196},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":2412}]}
