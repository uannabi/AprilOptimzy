{"id":29263,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China","text":"Ancient China is a very old civilization. There are written records of the history of China which date from 1500 BC in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BC).\nChina is one of the world's oldest continuous (still alive) civilizations. Turtle shells with writing like ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty () have been carbon dated to about 1500 BC. They say that China began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. Many people say that China became a big Kingdom or Empire in 221 BC. The Qin () emperor Qin Shi Huang made everyone write the same way. He also had ideas about the state which he based on legalism and fought Confucianism. This began what we call the Chinese civilization. Ancient China fought wars and Civil wars and was also sometimes conquered by other people.\nChinese civilization originated in various regional centers along both the Yellow River and the Yangtze River valleys in the Neolithic era, but the Yellow River is said to be the cradle of Chinese civilization. With thousands of years of continuous history, China is one of the world's oldest civilizations. The written history of China can be found as early as the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BC) although ancient historical texts such as the Records of the Grand Historian (ca. 100 BC) and Bamboo Annals say that a Xia Dynasty existed before the Shang. Much of Chinese culture, literature and philosophy further developed during the Zhou Dynasty (1045 \u2013 256 BC).\nThe Zhou Dynasty began to bow to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the kingdom eventually broke apart into smaller states, beginning in the Spring and Autumn Period and reaching full expression in the Warring States period. This is one of multiple periods of failed statehood in Chinese history (the most recent of which was the Chinese Civil War).\nBetween eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, Chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of China. In some eras, control has stretched as far as Central Asia, Tibet and Vietnam. This Chinese imperialism began with the Qin Dynasty: in 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang conquered the various warring kingdoms and created the first Chinese empire. Successive dynasties in Chinese history developed bureaucratic systems that gave the Emperor of China direct control of vast territories.\nThe conventional view of Chinese history is that of alternating periods of political unity and disunity, with China occasionally being dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were in turn assimilated into the Han Chinese population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of immigration, expansion, and cultural assimilation, are part of the modern culture of China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civilization","surface_form":"civilization","offset":28},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":113},{"uri":"Shang_dynasty","surface_form":"Shang dynasty","offset":123},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"Turtle","offset":231},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":250},{"uri":"Carbon_dating","surface_form":"carbon dated","offset":323},{"uri":"Yellow_River","surface_form":"Yellow River","offset":402},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"Empire","offset":474},{"uri":"Qin_Shi_Huang","surface_form":"Qin Shi Huang","offset":511},{"uri":"Legalism","surface_form":"legalism","offset":611},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucianism","offset":631},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"Civil war","offset":725},{"uri":"Yellow_River","surface_form":"Yellow River","offset":861},{"uri":"Yangtze_River","surface_form":"Yangtze River","offset":882},{"uri":"Xia_Dynasty","surface_form":"Xia Dynasty","offset":1305},{"uri":"Zhou_Dynasty","surface_form":"Zhou Dynasty","offset":1457},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":1975},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":1989},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":1999},{"uri":"Qin_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qin Dynasty","offset":2048}]}
