{"id":292632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hunt","text":"Sir Richard Timothy Hunt FRS (born 19 February 1943 in Neston, Cheshire) is an English biochemist. He is usually known as Tim Hunt.\nHunt shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on cell division.\nEarly life.\nAt the age of eight he was accepted into the Dragon School, where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher, Gerd Sommerhoff.\nWhen he was fourteen he moved to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where the science prizes now bear his name. There he became even more interested in science studying subjects such as chemistry and biology.\nHe is a son of Richard William Hunt.\nCareer.\nIn 1961, Hunt was accepted into Clare College, Cambridge to study natural sciences, graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry.\nHe finished his PhD in 1968 and worked in New York to work on protein synthesis. Tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes (immature red blood cells), and tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge he continued work on substances which started or inhibited protein synthesis.\nIn 1982 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, he used the sea urchin (\"Arbacia punctulata\") egg as his model organism. He discovered the cyclin molecule. Hunt found that cyclins begin to be made after the eggs are fertilized and increase in levels during interphase, until they drop very quickly in the middle of mitosis in each cell division.\nHe also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells where they also regulate the cell cycle. His group showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases, now called the cyclin-dependent kinases. One of these had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse.\nIn 1990, he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their work on cell division. Other honours followed, and he was knighted by the Queen in 2006.\nPersonal life.\nHunt is married to Mary Collins. The couple have two daughters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":25},{"uri":"Neston","surface_form":"Neston","offset":55},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":63},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":79},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":87},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":153},{"uri":"Dragon_School","surface_form":"Dragon School","offset":279},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":356},{"uri":"Gerd_Sommerhoff","surface_form":"Gerd Sommerhoff","offset":372},{"uri":"Magdalen_College_School%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Magdalen College School, Oxford","offset":422},{"uri":"Richard_William_Hunt","surface_form":"Richard William Hunt","offset":611},{"uri":"Clare_College","surface_form":"Clare College","offset":673},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":688},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":891},{"uri":"Glutathione","surface_form":"glutathione","offset":918},{"uri":"Inhibit","surface_form":"inhibited","offset":930},{"uri":"Reticulocyte","surface_form":"reticulocyte","offset":961},{"uri":"Red_blood_cell","surface_form":"red blood cell","offset":985},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":1023},{"uri":"Marine_Biological_Laboratory","surface_form":"Marine Biological Laboratory","offset":1182},{"uri":"Woods_Hole%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Woods Hole, Massachusetts","offset":1214},{"uri":"Sea_urchin","surface_form":"sea urchin","offset":1253},{"uri":"Cyclin","surface_form":"cyclin","offset":1332},{"uri":"Fertilization","surface_form":"fertilized","offset":1409},{"uri":"Mitosis","surface_form":"mitosis","offset":1508},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":1524},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":1581},{"uri":"Kinase","surface_form":"kinase","offset":1707},{"uri":"Paul_Nurse","surface_form":"Paul Nurse","offset":1827},{"uri":"Imperial_Cancer_Research_Fund","surface_form":"Imperial Cancer Research Fund","offset":1865},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":1923},{"uri":"Leland_H._Hartwell","surface_form":"Leland Hartwell","offset":1966},{"uri":"Paul_Nurse","surface_form":"Paul Nurse","offset":1986},{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"knighted","offset":2065},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"the Queen","offset":2077},{"uri":"Mary_Collins_(immunologist)","surface_form":"Mary Collins","offset":2130}]}
