{"id":292634,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church%2C_Oxford","text":"Christ Church is one of the largest colleges of the University of Oxford. The college was founded by Henry VIII in 1546.\nAs well as being a college, Christ Church is also the cathedral church of the diocese of Oxford, namely Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.\nChrist Church has produced thirteen British prime ministers. This is equal to the number produced by all 45 other Oxford colleges put together, and two short of the total number for the University of Cambridge (fifteen).\nThe college is the setting for parts of Evelyn Waugh's \"Brideshead Revisited\", as well as Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". More recently it has been used in the filming of the movies of J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series and also the movie adaptation of Philip Pullman's novel \"Northern Lights\" (the movie bearing the title of the US edition of the book, \"The Golden Compass\").\nDistinctive features of the college's architecture have been used as models by a number of other academic institutions. The University of Chicago and Cornell University both have reproductions of Christ Church's dining hall. Christ Church Cathedral, New Zealand, after which the City of Christchurch is named, is itself named after Christ Church, Oxford. Stained glass windows in the cathedral and other buildings are by the Pre-Raphaelite William Morris group with designs by Edward Burne-Jones.\nThe college has admitted female students since 1978.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"University of Oxford","offset":52},{"uri":"Henry_VIII","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":101},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":175},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":199},{"uri":"Christ_Church_Cathedral%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford","offset":225},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British prime ministers","offset":294},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":444},{"uri":"Evelyn_Waugh","surface_form":"Evelyn Waugh","offset":519},{"uri":"Brideshead_Revisited","surface_form":"Brideshead Revisited","offset":535},{"uri":"Lewis_Carroll","surface_form":"Lewis Carroll","offset":569},{"uri":"Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland","surface_form":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","offset":586},{"uri":"J._K._Rowling","surface_form":"J.
