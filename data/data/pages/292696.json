{"id":292696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Over_the_Limit","text":"e=\"preserve\">Over the Limit was a professional wrestling event that was held yearly by WWE, and aired live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The first one was held in 2010, taking the place of Judgment Day in the May slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The last event took place on May 20, 2012 at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was replaced by WWE Battleground in 2013.\nAs is the case with most lower level PPV's made by WWE, the event was held only in arenas in the United States. Championship bouts were scheduled on every card, with the lower level title matches on the undercard and the top level featured on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigns its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":34},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":87},{"uri":"Live_television","surface_form":"live","offset":102},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":115},{"uri":"WWE_Judgment_Day","surface_form":"Judgment Day","offset":187},{"uri":"PNC_Arena","surface_form":"PNC Arena","offset":297},{"uri":"Raleigh%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Raleigh","offset":310},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":319},{"uri":"WWE_Battleground","surface_form":"WWE Battleground","offset":354},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":463},{"uri":"Championship_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"Championship","offset":492},{"uri":"Card_(sports)","surface_form":"card","offset":535},{"uri":"Main_event","surface_form":"main card","offset":627},{"uri":"WWE_Brand_Extension","surface_form":"Brand Extension","offset":648},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"Raw","offset":702},{"uri":"WWE_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown","offset":709}]}
