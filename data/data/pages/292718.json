{"id":292718,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_2","text":"\"Shrek 2\" is a 2004 animated comedy movie and is the second movie in the \"Shrek\" movie series. It was directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad and stars Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the donkey, Cameron Diaz as Fiona, Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots, Julie Andrews as Fiona's mother, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, John Cleese as Fiona's father and Jennifer Saunders as Fairy Godmother. Like the first movie, this one is a parody of fairy tales. It was followed by \"Shrek the Third\".\nSoundtrack.\nSinger and songwriter Adam Duritz from Counting Crows said that his band's song, \"Accidentally in Love\", \"fits into the movie because it's the story of people who fall in love who weren't supposed to fall in love.\" Composer James Horner operated the sound of the score on different levels which James said as \"Fun\". His score came out as an Eels song into a romantic scene with Shrek and Fiona, or a funny scene with Donkey. George Bruns did not compose the film score with Horner, due to a conflict.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"2004_in_movies","surface_form":"2004","offset":15},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":20},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":29},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":36},{"uri":"Shrek","surface_form":"Shrek","offset":74},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":87},{"uri":"Andrew_Adamson","surface_form":"Andrew Adamson","offset":114},{"uri":"Kelly_Asbury","surface_form":"Kelly Asbury","offset":130},{"uri":"Conrad","surface_form":"Conrad","offset":147},{"uri":"Mike_Myers","surface_form":"Mike Myers","offset":164},{"uri":"Eddie_Murphy","surface_form":"Eddie Murphy","offset":185},{"uri":"Cameron_Diaz","surface_form":"Cameron Diaz","offset":213},{"uri":"Antonio_Banderas","surface_form":"Antonio Banderas","offset":236},{"uri":"Julie_Andrews","surface_form":"Julie Andrews","offset":271},{"uri":"Rupert_Everett","surface_form":"Rupert Everett","offset":304},{"uri":"John_Cleese","surface_form":"John Cleese","offset":339},{"uri":"Jennifer_Saunders","surface_form":"Jennifer Saunders","offset":373},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parody","offset":447},{"uri":"Fairy_tale","surface_form":"fairy tale","offset":457},{"uri":"Shrek_the_Third","surface_form":"Shrek the Third","offset":490},{"uri":"Counting_Crows","surface_form":"Counting Crows","offset":559},{"uri":"Accidentally_in_Love","surface_form":"Accidentally in Love","offset":602},{"uri":"James_Horner","surface_form":"James Horner","offset":744},{"uri":"George_Bruns","surface_form":"George Bruns","offset":945}]}
