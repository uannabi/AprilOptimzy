{"id":292719,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobili_Turismo_e_Sport","text":"e=\"preserve\">ATS (Automobili Turismo e Sport, which roughly translates in English to \"Tourism and Sports Cars\") was an Italian car maker and briefly, a constructor in Formula One. The team ran in F1 in 1963, and made cars from 1963 to 1965. The company was founded by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini, intended to compete directly with Ferrari.\nThe two most well-known cars were the ATS 2500 GT, a sports car, and The Tipo 100, a Formula One car, which was a virtual copy of the Ferrari 156, which was a Formula One car in 1961. Unfortunately, with the cars being frequently withdrawn and technical problems through the season, the F1 team was shut down after 1963. In fact, out of the 10 entries ATS qualified for (Five races, two cars per race), only two cars were classified at the end of the race, albeit very slow, with Giancarlo Baghetti being classified at 23 laps down (23 laps behind the eventual race winner, Jim Clark). By contract, Phil Hill (with no relation to Graham Hill) finished seven laps down.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":119},{"uri":"Constructor","surface_form":"constructor","offset":152},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":167},{"uri":"Carlo_Chiti","surface_form":"Carlo Chiti","offset":268},{"uri":"Giotto_Bizzarrini","surface_form":"Giotto Bizzarrini","offset":284},{"uri":"Ferrari","surface_form":"Ferrari","offset":337},{"uri":"ATS_2500_GT","surface_form":"ATS 2500 GT","offset":384},{"uri":"Sports_car","surface_form":"sports car","offset":399},{"uri":"Giancarlo_Baghetti","surface_form":"Giancarlo Baghetti","offset":826},{"uri":"Jim_Clark","surface_form":"Jim Clark","offset":920},{"uri":"Graham_Hill","surface_form":"Graham Hill","offset":976}]}
