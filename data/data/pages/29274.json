{"id":29274,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski","text":"J\u00F3zef Klemens Pi\u0142sudski (December 5, 1867 \u2013 May 12, 1935) was an important leader of Poland.\nFrom 1795 to 1918, Poland was not an independent country. It was divided into three parts between Russia, Prussia (Germany) and Austria-Hungary. Pi\u0142sudski was born in the Russian part. The government tried to make Poles become Russian but Pi\u0142sudski was born in family of patriots. In 1887 he got into trouble, because he helped people who tried to kill the Tsar. He was sent to Siberia. When he came back from there he got more and more involved in politics.\nLater Pi\u0142sudski became a soldier and wanted to make Poland independent again. At the beginning of World War I, most people, who agreed with Pilsudski, helped Austria-Hungary, because they preferred it to Russia. When they stopped helping Austria-Hungary and Germany, Pi\u0142sudski was arrested. When the War was over, he was freed. He came to Warsaw in November 1918 and helped to organize Poland. Then, for a short time, he became its leader (not president). Gabriel Narutowicz became Poland's first president, but he was shot by his enemy a few days later and Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski became the next president. Poland's situation was not good and the politicians argued a lot. Many people, especially the soldiers, wanted Pi\u0142sudski back, so he told Wojciechowski to resign. When Wojciechowski said no, Pi\u0142sudki took over with the help of the Army. Parliament elected Ignacy Mo\u015Bcicki to be the new president, but he had to do what Pi\u0142sudski wanted him to do. Together, they changed the Polish constitution and made a lot of other changes.\nChildhood and youth.\nJoseph Pi\u0142sudski, was born in 5 December 1867 in Zu\u0142owo in Lithuania, into a patriotic family.
