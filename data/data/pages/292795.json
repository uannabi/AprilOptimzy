{"id":292795,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_South_MRT_line","text":"The North South MRT line is the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore to be built. It is 45\u00A0km long with 26 stations, and it is being operated by SMRT Trains. It would usually take one hour to travel from one end of the MRT line to the other. This line is coloured red on the MRT Rail map.\nThis line joins the Central area of Singapore to the Northern and Southern areas of Singapore. To transfer to the East West MRT line, a commuter can transfer at Jurong East, Raffles Place or City Hall. Transferring to the North East MRT Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut with a linkway. Bishan MRT Station, Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station and Marina Bay MRT Station can transfer a commuter to the Circle MRT Line. Transfer to the Downtown line is provided at Newton MRT Station.\nMain route.\nThe first section of the north south line opened on 7 November 1987 between Toa Payoh and Yio Chu Kang. Afterwards, the section to Outram Park (now on the East West MRT line) opened. Following that, the rest of the line opened stage by stage.\nWoodlands Extension.\nThe Woodlands Extension was planned to close the gap between Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. It consists of 6 stations, and opened on 10 February 1996.\nMarina South Pier extension (NSLe).\nA 1-kilometre extension of the line to Marina South Pier MRT Station was opened in 2014.\n2017.\nOn 7 October, services on the line was stopped between Ang Mo Kio and Marina South Pier around 6pm, after the tunnels between Bishan and Braddell flooded following heavy rain, and a fire was seen near Raffles Place. Services between Newton and Marina South Pier was resumed at around 9.30pm but the section between Newton and Ang Mo Kio remained closed overnight. It opened at 2pm the following day after staff and the SCDF worked overnight to clear the water from the tunnel. SMRT reported that a faulty water pump was the cause of the flooding. This was the worst train incident in SMRT's history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":38},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":71},{"uri":"SMRT_Trains","surface_form":"SMRT Trains","offset":157},{"uri":"East_West_MRT_line","surface_form":"East West MRT line","offset":415},{"uri":"Commuter","surface_form":"commuter","offset":437},{"uri":"Jurong_East_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Jurong East","offset":462},{"uri":"Raffles_Place_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Raffles Place","offset":475},{"uri":"City_Hall_MRT_Station","surface_form":"City Hall","offset":492},{"uri":"North_East_MRT_Line","surface_form":"North East MRT Line","offset":523},{"uri":"Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Dhoby Ghaut","offset":554},{"uri":"Bishan_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Bishan MRT Station","offset":582},{"uri":"Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station","offset":602},{"uri":"Marina_Bay_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Marina Bay MRT Station","offset":630},{"uri":"Circle_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Circle MRT Line","offset":684},{"uri":"Downtown_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Downtown line","offset":717},{"uri":"Newton_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Newton MRT Station","offset":746},{"uri":"Toa_Payoh_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Toa Payoh","offset":854},{"uri":"Yio_Chu_Kang_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Yio Chu Kang","offset":868},{"uri":"Outram_Park_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Outram Park","offset":909},{"uri":"East_West_MRT_line","surface_form":"East West MRT line","offset":933},{"uri":"Yishun_MRT_station","surface_form":"Yishun","offset":1103},{"uri":"Choa_Chu_Kang_MRT/LRT_station","surface_form":"Choa Chu Kang","offset":1114},{"uri":"Marina_South_Pier_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Marina South Pier MRT Station","offset":1263},{"uri":"Ang_Mo_Kio_MRT_station","surface_form":"Ang Mo Kio","offset":1374},{"uri":"Marina_South_Pier_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Marina South Pier","offset":1389},{"uri":"Bishan_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Bishan","offset":1445},{"uri":"Braddell_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Braddell","offset":1456},{"uri":"Raffles_Place_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Raffles Place","offset":1520},{"uri":"Newton_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Newton","offset":1552}]}
