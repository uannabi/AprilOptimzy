{"id":292814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_(album)","text":"\"Demonic\" is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Testament. It was released in 1997. The lyrics deal with occult themes more like their 1980s efforts instead of the political topics covered on more recent releases.\nMusically, Testament takes a slower, almost death metal oriented approach with grinding guitar riffs and Chuck Billy's vocal work consisting primarily of death growls.\nThis album also marked the first time, as Testament, that the band used the old Legacy pentagram graphic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album | &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":25},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":50},{"uri":"Testament_(band)","surface_form":"Testament","offset":67},{"uri":"Occult","surface_form":"occult","offset":124},{"uri":"Death_metal","surface_form":"death metal","offset":277},{"uri":"Pentagram","surface_form":"pentagram","offset":488}]}
