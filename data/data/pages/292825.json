It was originally established with former Elf members, though over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. In addition to lead singers Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White, the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neo-classical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.\nRainbow was ranked #90 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hard_rock","surface_form":"hard rock","offset":91},{"uri":"Ritchie_Blackmore","surface_form":"Ritchie Blackmore","offset":131},{"uri":"Elf_(band)","surface_form":"Elf","offset":227},{"uri":"Ronnie_James_Dio","surface_form":"Ronnie James Dio","offset":386},{"uri":"Graham_Bonnet","surface_form":"Graham Bonnet","offset":404},{"uri":"Joe_Lynn_Turner","surface_form":"Joe Lynn Turner","offset":419},{"uri":"Doogie_White","surface_form":"Doogie White","offset":439},{"uri":"Neo-classical_metal","surface_form":"neo-classical metal","offset":564}]}
