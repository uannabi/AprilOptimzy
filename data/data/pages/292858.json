The words to many Negro spirituals have Christian themes. This is because Black slaves in the United States turned to religion, as a way to cope with the pain of slavery. Negro spirituals combine traditional West African musical style with the style of Christian hymns from Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"Spirituality","offset":59},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":149},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":163},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th","offset":184},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th centuries","offset":193},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":249},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":303},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":417},{"uri":"Hymn","surface_form":"hymn","offset":472},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":483}]}
