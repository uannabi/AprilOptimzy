{"id":29286,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_civilization","text":"The Indus Valley civilization was a Bronze Age civilization(3300\u20131300 BC; mature period 2700-1700 BC)\nThe civilization was in the subcontiet. It was discovered by archaeologists in the 1880s.\nIt developed along the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River and even that areas are now in modern Pakistan, north-west India and Afghanistan. The civilization started during the Bronze Age and the height of its development was between 2500 BC and 1500 BC. Including the civilizations directly before and after, it may have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th century BC.\nThe Indus Valley civilization covered a large area from Balochistan (Pakistan) to Gujarat (Republic of India). The first city to be discovered by excavation (digging up) was Harappa and therefore this civilization is also known as 'Harappan Civilization'.\nThey were good builders. The ruins of the site shows skillful design. Their buildings had two or sometimes more stories. The bathrooms were attached to the rooms. One of the unique features of the city was its elaborate drainage system. A brick-lined drainage channel flowed alongside every street. Removable bricks were placed at regular intervals for easy cleaning and inspection.\nThe harappan traders used seals on the knots of the sacks to be transported to make sure that they were not opened during the journey. Nobody knows how to read their writing system.\nIn 1842 Charles Masson wrote a book that mentioned the sites of Indus Valley Civilisation. Few people paid attention. Later, in 1921-22, John Marshall organised the first archaeological dig at Harappa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":36},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":70},{"uri":"Civilization","surface_form":"civilization","offset":106},{"uri":"Subcontiet","surface_form":"subcontiet","offset":130},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":163},{"uri":"Indus","surface_form":"Indus River","offset":215},{"uri":"Ghaggar-Hakra_River","surface_form":"Ghaggar-Hakra River","offset":235},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":293},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":314},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":324},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":373},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":447},{"uri":"Balochistan_(Pakistan)","surface_form":"Balochistan","offset":619},{"uri":"Gujarat","surface_form":"Gujarat","offset":645},{"uri":"Harappa","surface_form":"Harappa","offset":737},{"uri":"Drainage","surface_form":"drainage","offset":1039},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":1215},{"uri":"Seal_(device)","surface_form":"seals","offset":1228},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"writing system","offset":1368},{"uri":"Archaeological","surface_form":"archaeological","offset":1555}]}
