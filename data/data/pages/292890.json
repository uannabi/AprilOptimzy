{"id":292890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopan_Monastery","text":"Kopan Monastery is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery near Boudhanath, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, Nepal. It belongs to the FPMT, an international network of Gelugpa dharma centers, and once served as its headquarters.\nThe monastery was established by the FPMT founders, Lamas Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, who bought the property from Nepal's royal astrologer in 1969. Its name comes from the name of the hill on which it was built.\nKopan has become famous for teaching Buddhism to visiting Western foreigners. The first of what would become annual month-long (November-December) meditation courses was held in 1971. These courses generally combine traditional Lam Rim teachings with informal discussion, several periods of guided meditation, and a vegetarian diet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tibetan_Buddhism","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhist","offset":21},{"uri":"Boudhanath","surface_form":"Boudhanath","offset":53},{"uri":"Kathmandu","surface_form":"Kathmandu","offset":85},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":96},{"uri":"FPMT","surface_form":"FPMT","offset":121},{"uri":"Gelugpa","surface_form":"Gelugpa","offset":155},{"uri":"Thubten_Yeshe","surface_form":"Thubten Yeshe","offset":274},{"uri":"Thubten_Zopa_Rinpoche","surface_form":"Thubten Zopa Rinpoche","offset":292},{"uri":"Lam_Rim","surface_form":"Lam Rim","offset":670}]}
