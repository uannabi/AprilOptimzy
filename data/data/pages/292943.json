{"id":292943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_MRT_line","text":"The North East MRT Line (NEL) is the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour. This line is coloured purple in the rail map.\nThe line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations.\nThis line is the first MRT line in Singapore to be completely underground (running in a tunnel all the way between HarbourFront and Punggol). It is also the first (and so far, the only) line where trains get their power from overhead wires above the track, instead of a third rail beside the track.\nAll the trains on the North East Line are automated (computer-controlled) and do not have an operator driving the train at the front. It is one of the world's first rapid transit lines that does not need drivers and is one of three such lines in the MRT network today. The others are the Circle Line and the Downtown Line.\nStations.\nThe Land Transport Authority has announced that it will extend the North East Line from its current northern terminal at Punggol to a new station called Punggol Coast. Construction will begin in 2018, and it is expected to open in 2023.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":43},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":70},{"uri":"SBS_Transit","surface_form":"SBS Transit","offset":137},{"uri":"North_South_MRT_Line","surface_form":"North South Line","offset":366},{"uri":"Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Dhoby Ghaut station","offset":394},{"uri":"East_West_MRT_Line","surface_form":"East West Line","offset":415},{"uri":"Outram_Park_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Outram Park station","offset":433},{"uri":"Circle_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Circle Line","offset":454},{"uri":"Serangoon_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Serangoon","offset":469},{"uri":"Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Dhoby Ghaut","offset":483},{"uri":"Downtown_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Downtown MRT Line","offset":499},{"uri":"Chinatown_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Chinatown","offset":520},{"uri":"Little_India_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Little India stations","offset":534},{"uri":"Tunnel","surface_form":"tunnel","offset":645},{"uri":"Overhead_lines","surface_form":"overhead wires","offset":782},{"uri":"Third_rail","surface_form":"third rail","offset":827},{"uri":"Automatic_train_operation","surface_form":"automated","offset":898},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":909},{"uri":"Rapid_transit","surface_form":"rapid transit","offset":1021},{"uri":"Land_Transport_Authority","surface_form":"Land Transport Authority","offset":1193},{"uri":"Punggol_Coast_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Punggol Coast","offset":1342}]}
