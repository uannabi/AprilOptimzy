{"id":292978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow_A.F.C.","text":"Barrow A.F.C. are an English football team. The club was founded in 1901. It is based in the town of Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, England. After they were promoted at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, they began playing in the Conference National. The club spent over fifty years in the Football League between 1921 and 1972, and have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football. Barrow have twice won non-league football's highest cup competition, the FA Trophy - in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only non-league club to have won the trophy at both old and new Wembley stadia.\nThe club colours are blue and white. The combination of these has varied over time. It has led to their nickname \"The Bluebirds\". Attendances at the club's Holker Street field vary - the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea City in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954. But during the 1990s and 2000s, the average remained between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 1,590 during the 2008-09 season.\nThe club won their second FA Trophy title on the 8th May 2010 after beating Stevenage Borough 2-1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":21},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":29},{"uri":"Barrow-in-Furness","surface_form":"Barrow-in-Furness","offset":101},{"uri":"Cumbria","surface_form":"Cumbria","offset":122},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":131},{"uri":"2007-08_in_English_football","surface_form":"2007\u201308","offset":183},{"uri":"Conference_National","surface_form":"Conference National","offset":225},{"uri":"Football_League","surface_form":"Football League","offset":285},{"uri":"Non-league","surface_form":"non-league","offset":381},{"uri":"FA_Trophy","surface_form":"FA Trophy","offset":475},{"uri":"Holker_Street","surface_form":"Holker Street","offset":754},{"uri":"Swansea_City_A.F.C.","surface_form":"Swansea City","offset":823},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":843},{"uri":"FA_Trophy","surface_form":"FA Trophy","offset":1034},{"uri":"Stevenage_Borough","surface_form":"Stevenage Borough","offset":1084},{"uri":"Wembley_Stadium","surface_form":"Wembley Stadium","offset":1122}]}
