{"id":293303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_(rock_band)","text":"Jerusalem is a Swedish Christian rock band, founded in 1975 by Ulf Christiansson. It was one of the first bands to combine Christian lyrics with a hard rock sound.\nHistory.\nJerusalem's message was primarily aimed at youth, with their lyrics describing the band's relationship to God in an ordinary, but radical way. The band's purpose was expressly evangelistic. Their concerts have been described as a series of revival meetings which often included altar calls and occasionally exorcisms.\u00A1When the band first toured in the mid-1970s in Sweden, their combination of Christian lyrics with a hard rock sound was very controversial. The band was only permitted to perform at a few churches.\nDiscography.\n\"For albums released in both Swedish and English versions, the English titles are in parentheses.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":15},{"uri":"Christian_rock","surface_form":"Christian rock","offset":23},{"uri":"Ulf_Christiansson","surface_form":"Ulf Christiansson","offset":63},{"uri":"Lyrics","surface_form":"lyrics","offset":133},{"uri":"Hard_rock","surface_form":"hard rock","offset":147},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":279},{"uri":"Evangelism","surface_form":"evangelistic","offset":349},{"uri":"Revival_meeting","surface_form":"revival meeting","offset":413},{"uri":"Altar_call","surface_form":"altar call","offset":451},{"uri":"Exorcisms","surface_form":"exorcisms","offset":480}]}
