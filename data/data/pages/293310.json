Around 2 \u00D7 1019 grams of this is the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In addition, 71% of the Earth\u2019s surface, an area of 361 million square kilometers, is covered by ocean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":42},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":50},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":93},{"uri":"Physical_geography","surface_form":"physical geography","offset":115},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":203},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":265},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":305},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":406},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":515}]}
