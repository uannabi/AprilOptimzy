{"id":29335,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics","text":"Cosmetics (also called makeup, make up, or make-up) are products used to make the human body look different. Often cosmetics are used to make someone more attractive to one person, or to a culture or sub-culture. In Western culture, women are the main users of cosmetics. Their use by men is less frequent, except on stage, television and movies. Cosmetics are widely used in the world of acting.\nAll cosmetics are temporary. They need to be renewed after a certain time. Cosmetics include lipstick, powders (e.g. blush, eyeshadow), and lotions as well as other things.\nFacial cosmetics.\nMost cosmetic products and methods are intended to improve the look of the face. There are two categories: those which improve the basic quality of the skin, and those which sit on the skin during active social life.\nHistory of cosmetics.\nThe word \"cosmetics\" comes from the Greek \u03BA\u03BF\u03C3\u03BC\u03B7\u03C4\u03B9\u03BA\u03CC\u03C2 (\"kosm\u0113tikos\"), \"skilled in ordering or arranging\".\nThe Ancient Greeks also used cosmetics. Cosmetics are mentioned also in the Old Testament. Men who think makeup is dishonest sometimes call makeup \"fakeup\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stage","surface_form":"stage","offset":317},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":324},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":339},{"uri":"Acting","surface_form":"acting","offset":389},{"uri":"Lipstick","surface_form":"lipstick","offset":490},{"uri":"Powder","surface_form":"powder","offset":500},{"uri":"Blush","surface_form":"blush","offset":514},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":521},{"uri":"Sun_screen","surface_form":"lotion","offset":537},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":863},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":936},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":1008}]}
