{"id":29342,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavichord","text":"A clavichord is a musical instrument like a small keyboard. It was very popular for many years, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\nSound.\nThe clavichord is a very quiet instrument. It was not suitable for playing with other instruments because it was so quiet. But it sounds very beautiful in slow, expressive music. It was used as a practice instrument by harpsichord players, or by organists who wanted to practise at home instead of in a (often very cold) church. They were so small that they could be lifted up and put on a table. They could be put one on top of another so that an organist could practise music written for a two-manual organ. Sometimes they even had pedals for organists to practise this skill.\nUses.\nMany German composers like Johann Sebastian Bach wrote music for the \u201CClavier\u201D. This meant any keyboard instrument: harpsichord, clavichord or organ. The player could choose which they wanted to use.\nWhen the piano suddenly became popular \u2013 in the 1760s and 1770s \u2013 people started to forget about harpsichords and clavichords. Today a few people make harpsichords and clavichords again so that people can play Renaissance and Baroque music - the music from when the clavichord was popular.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":18},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":50},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th","offset":114},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th","offset":120},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th","offset":129},{"uri":"Harpsichord","surface_form":"harpsichord","offset":371},{"uri":"Organ_(music)","surface_form":"organ","offset":655},{"uri":"Pedal_(music)","surface_form":"pedals","offset":686},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":742},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":764},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":946},{"uri":"1760s","surface_form":"1760s","offset":985},{"uri":"1770s","surface_form":"1770s","offset":995},{"uri":"Renaissance_music","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":1147},{"uri":"Baroque_music","surface_form":"Baroque music","offset":1163}]}
