{"id":293433,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(goddess)","text":"Iris was known as the goddess of the rainbow and another messenger for the gods in Greek mythology.\nShe is depicted as a beautiful golden goddess, with wings (for flight), sandals, a staff, and a tunic. There is often much art, such as vases and murals, shown of her because she is worshiped and very beautiful. She was also seen briefly in Homer's \"Legacies\".\nIris is generally seen as Hera's personal servant and messenger. Iris is very swift and fast and she generally travels by rainbow. It is even said that the reason the rainbow comes and goes so fast is because Iris only uses it for travel and since she is so fast, it is only in the sky for a small amount of time.\nShe is seen today in both Roman, and Greek mythology, as an important figure to Greece, and the gods. In Greek mythology it is believed that if you throw a drachma (Greek currency) into a rainbow you can communicate with anyone anywhere (like the Skype of ancient times).\nHer parents are Thaumas (marine titan) and Elektra (cloud nymph). Her husband is Zephryus (west wind). In some versions of Greek mythology, Iris is the mother of Pothos.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rainbow","surface_form":"rainbow","offset":37},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":83},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":341},{"uri":"Hera","surface_form":"Hera","offset":387},{"uri":"Thaumas","surface_form":"Thaumas","offset":963},{"uri":"Elektra","surface_form":"Elektra","offset":990},{"uri":"Zephryus","surface_form":"Zephryus","offset":1028},{"uri":"Pothos","surface_form":"Pothos","offset":1109}]}
