The club is playing in the Austrian Bundesliga.\nThe club was founded in 2008 as the Upper Austrian club SC Schwanenstadt decided to transfer to Oberwaltersdorf because of financial problems. Because SC Schwanenstadt was 7th in the second league the new club could also play in this league.\nThe first match was against FC Wacker Innsbruck (0-3). The rest of the season was more successful. They became champion of the second league and promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga.\nThe club\u00B4s president was Frank Stronach, the founder of Magna Inetrnational. He was also the main sponsor. But he decided to leave the club, so the future of the club is not clear. For the 2011/12 season Wiener Neustadt has got a new coach, Peter St\u00F6ger, who came from GAK, because Peter Sch\u00F6ttl became new coach of SK Rapid Wien. After Peter St\u00F6ger went to Austria Wien, because the earlier Austria coach Ivica Vastic was not very successful, the team had to look for a new coach. Just before the season 2011/2012 began, the SC Wiener Neustadt presented Heimo Pfeifenberger as the new coach.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Upper_Austria","surface_form":"Upper Austria","offset":187},{"uri":"SK_Rapid_Wien","surface_form":"SK Rapid Wien","offset":891},{"uri":"Austria_Wien","surface_form":"Austria Wien","offset":933},{"uri":"Ivica_Vastic","surface_form":"Ivica Vastic","offset":981},{"uri":"Heimo_Pfeifenberger","surface_form":"Heimo Pfeifenberger","offset":1130}]}
