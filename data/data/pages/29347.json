For other meanings, see Bow (disambiguation).\"\nA bow is a weapon used to shoot arrows. It is used in hunting, sport, and a long time ago, war.\nUsing a bow is called archery. A person who uses a bow is an archer and a person who makes bows is a bowyer.\nA bow is a long curved stick and a string which is tied to both ends. Ancient bows were made of natural materials like wood or bone and sinew, but today they are often made of plastic and similar materials.\nTo shoot a bow, the arrow is put on the bow, with one end to the string, which is pulled back. When the string is let loose, it throws the arrow forwards.\nThere are many different types of bows, for example the longbow or the automatic crossbow\nThere are many different ways that people protect themselves from arrow attacks. The Roman Army, for instance, had the testudo formate, or tortoise formation. They first made the shields lock into a somewhat tortoise like formation, which provide a shell that was make out of shields. The arrows would eventually run out, and the Romans would charge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bow_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"Bow (disambiguation)","offset":73},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":107},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrow","offset":128},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":150},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":159},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":187},{"uri":"Archery","surface_form":"archery","offset":214},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":420},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":428},{"uri":"Sinew","surface_form":"sinew","offset":437},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":477},{"uri":"Longbow","surface_form":"longbow","offset":719},{"uri":"Crossbow","surface_form":"crossbow","offset":744},{"uri":"Testudo_formate","surface_form":"testudo formate","offset":872}]}
