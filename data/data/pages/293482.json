Some psychobilly songs include thrash metal or country music styles. Psychobilly is commonly played with a simple guitar/bass/drum/vocal arrangement, with many bands consisting of only three members. Often the guitarist or bassist will be the lead vocalist.\nThe first psychobilly band was the Meteors, a band from London, UK.\nPsychobilly band members and fans often shave part of their heads.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock music","offset":26},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":60},{"uri":"Rockabilly","surface_form":"rockabilly","offset":71},{"uri":"Thrash_metal","surface_form":"thrash metal","offset":132},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":148},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":215},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":222},{"uri":"Drum_kit","surface_form":"drum","offset":227},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"vocal","offset":232},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":311},{"uri":"Bassist","surface_form":"bassist","offset":324},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"vocalist","offset":349}]}
