{"id":293514,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_rock","text":"e=\"preserve\">Funk rock (also typed as funk-rock) is a music genre that fuses funk and rock elements.\nIts earliest incarnation was heard in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s by acts such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience (last two albums), Eric Burdon and War, Trapeze, Parliament-Funkadelic, Betty Davis and Mother's Finest. In the 1990s acts such as Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and Faith No More revived the genre.\nCharacteristics.\nFunk rock is a fusion of funk and rock. Many instruments may be incorporated into the music, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars. The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more intensity, while the guitar can be funk-or-rock-influenced, usually with distortion, which is similar to overdrive or fuzz.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fuses_(music)","surface_form":"fuses","offset":71},{"uri":"Funk","surface_form":"funk","offset":77},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":86},{"uri":"Jimi_Hendrix_Experience","surface_form":"Jimi Hendrix Experience","offset":196},{"uri":"Eric_Burdon_and_War","surface_form":"Eric Burdon and War","offset":239},{"uri":"Trapeze","surface_form":"Trapeze","offset":260},{"uri":"Parliament-Funkadelic","surface_form":"Parliament-Funkadelic","offset":269},{"uri":"Betty_Davis","surface_form":"Betty Davis","offset":292},{"uri":"Mother%27s_Finest","surface_form":"Mother's Finest","offset":308},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"Prince","offset":351},{"uri":"Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers","surface_form":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","offset":359},{"uri":"Rage_Against_the_Machine","surface_form":"Rage Against the Machine","offset":382},{"uri":"Faith_No_More","surface_form":"Faith No More","offset":411},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":603},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":611},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric guitar","offset":625},{"uri":"Distortion_(guitar)","surface_form":"distortion","offset":785}]}
