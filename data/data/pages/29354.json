{"id":29354,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recitative","text":"e=\"preserve\">Recitative (Italian: \u201Crecitativo\u201D) is music which is telling a story quite quickly, as if it were being spoken, \"talky\". The word means: \u201Cto recite\u201D i.e. to tell a story.\nRecitative is used in opera, oratorio and cantatas. When opera was invented around 1600 the composers needed to tell the story in music. In recitative the story is sung quickly, with maybe just a harpsichord playing a few chords. After a while, the situation in the story has changed, and the singer can sing an aria which is more interesting musically.\nWhen recitative is just accompanied by a keyboard instrument it is called \u201Crecitativo secco\u201D (dry recitative). Sometimes the orchestra joins this. This is called \u201Crecitativo accompagnato\u201D (accompanied recitative). There are no bar lines in recitative because there is no regular beat.\nRecitative is simple musically, it can sometimes describe the words being sung in quite interesting or amusing ways. Sometimes this might be improvised by the harpsichordist.\nIn the 19th century the difference between aria and recitative gradually disappeared. Wagner wrote operas where everything had musical interest and the various sections flowed into one another.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":206},{"uri":"Oratorio","surface_form":"oratorio","offset":213},{"uri":"Cantata","surface_form":"cantata","offset":226},{"uri":"Harpsichord","surface_form":"harpsichord","offset":380},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"chords","offset":406},{"uri":"Aria","surface_form":"aria","offset":496},{"uri":"Improvisation","surface_form":"improvised","offset":964},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Wagner","offset":1084}]}
