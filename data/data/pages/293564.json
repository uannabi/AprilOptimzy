An ode is a poem which is written in praise of something or someone, saying how wonderful they are.\nVery often an ode will have the title \"Ode to...\" followed by the name of the thing or person that it describes, e.g. John Keats wrote a poem \"Ode to a Nightingale\".\nOdes were written by the poets of Ancient Greece as well as by the Romans. Horace was particularly famous for his odes, and many English odes written centuries later were based on Horace's lyrical verses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lyric_poetry","surface_form":"lyric","offset":32},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":38},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":68},{"uri":"John_Keats","surface_form":"John Keats","offset":301},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":416},{"uri":"Horace","surface_form":"Horace","offset":424}]}
