{"id":293598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_fly","text":"A horse fly is a type of insect and a member of the family Tabanidae (order Diptera), but more specifically are any member of the genus \"Tabanus\". These stout flies, as small as a housefly or as large as a bumblebee, are sometimes known as greenheaded monsters; their metallic or iridescent eyes meet dorsally in the male and are separate in the female. Gad-fly, a nickname, may refer either to the fly\u2019s roving habits or to its mouthparts, which resemble a wedge-shaped miner\u2019s tool.\nThe bites of the female fly often carry parasites onto the victim (such as a horse). The resulting sore can be extremely distressing to the animal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":25},{"uri":"Diptera","surface_form":"Diptera","offset":76},{"uri":"Tabanus","surface_form":"Tabanus","offset":137},{"uri":"Bumblebee","surface_form":"bumblebee","offset":206},{"uri":"Gad-fly","surface_form":"Gad-fly","offset":354},{"uri":"Parasites","surface_form":"parasites","offset":525}]}
