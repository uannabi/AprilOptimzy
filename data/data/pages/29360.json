{"id":29360,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site","text":"World Heritage Sites are places in the world which are very important from the cultural or natural point of view. These places are selected by UNESCO, a part of the United Nations.\nThe World Heritage Convention (\"Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage\") is a United Nations treaty. It governs the selection and protection of these sites. The nations that have agreed to the treaty elect 21 nations to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. That committee sets the site list.\nThe sites are places (such as a forest, mountain, lake, desert, monument, building, complex, or city)., 1007 sites in 161 different countries are listed. There are 779 cultural sites, 197 natural sites, and 31 mixed properties. Italy has 50 sites on the list, which is the most for any country.\nEach World Heritage Site remains part of the legal territory of the nation where the site is located. UNESCO wants everyone in the world to work to protect each site. Sometimes UNESCO provides funds to help protect a site. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have destroyed some sites.\nSelection criteria.\nUntil the end of 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of \"outstanding universal value\" and meet at least one of the ten criteria. If a site meets criteria in both cultural and natural, it is called a \"mixed site\".\nLegal status of designated sites.\nUNESCO designation as a World Heritage Site provides \"prima facie\" evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the Geneva Convention, its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and international law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":79},{"uri":"Natural","surface_form":"natural","offset":91},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":143},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":165},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":311},{"uri":"Protection","surface_form":"protection","offset":348},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Committee","surface_form":"World Heritage Committee","offset":449},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":542},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":550},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":560},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":566},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":574},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":584},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":606},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":738},{"uri":"Protect","surface_form":"protect","offset":953},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","surface_form":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","offset":1028},{"uri":"Prima_facie","surface_form":"prima facie","offset":1567},{"uri":"Geneva_Convention","surface_form":"Geneva Convention","offset":1686},{"uri":"Hague_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Cultural_Property_in_the_Event_of_Armed_Conflict","surface_form":"Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict","offset":1785}]}
