{"id":29382,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_(music)","text":"Indie is a word that is short for independent. When people talk about indie in music, they mean music that is made by people independently from major record labels (mainly rock and roll groups and artists). Indie music could also be very experimental, meaning that people try out things like new or different sounds. The styles can range from rock music to house music to pop music.\nExamples of what could be described as indie music include indie rock and indie pop.\nThe group of stereotypical teens who tend to listen to indie music are called indie kids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock music","offset":343},{"uri":"House_music","surface_form":"house music","offset":357},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":372},{"uri":"Indie_rock","surface_form":"indie rock","offset":442},{"uri":"Indie_pop","surface_form":"indie pop","offset":457}]}
