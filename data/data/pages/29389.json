{"id":29389,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.D._Chivas_USA","text":"Club Deportivo Chivas USA was an American football (soccer) team that played in Major League Soccer (MLS) in Carson, California. They began play in 2005, and played at the home of the Los Angeles Galaxy.\nWhen the team was formed, it was planned to be a \"little brother\" to the very popular Mexican team C.D. Guadalajara. \"Chivas\", the Spanish word for \"goats\", is the nickname of C.D. Guadalajara. The team was originally owned by two Mexican businessmen, one of whom also owned C.D. Guadalajara. Due to falling attendance and ownership failures, MLS bought the team back in February 2014, with plans to sell it to new owners who would give the team a new name. In September 2014, the team was sold to a new group. As part of the sale, Chivas USA was dissolved at the end of the 2014 season. A new team, Los Angeles FC, will start play in 2017 replacing the old Chivas USA.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":33},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football (soccer)","offset":42},{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"Major League Soccer","offset":80},{"uri":"Carson%2C_California","surface_form":"Carson, California","offset":109},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Galaxy","surface_form":"Los Angeles Galaxy","offset":184},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":290},{"uri":"C.D._Guadalajara","surface_form":"C.D.
