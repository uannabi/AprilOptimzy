{"id":294,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm","text":"A farm is a piece of land used to grow crops and/or raise animals.\nPeople who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers. This work is called farming.\nLand that is used to grow plants is called farmland. Land that is used to feed animals with its grass is called pasture. Land that can be used to grow plants for food is called arable land.\nMany farms are very large and can cause damage. In some places farms are many and small, and can also cause damage. Farms provides most of the food for people. Some people farm to eat the food they produce (subsistence agriculture). Other farms, including large ones, sell their products to markets far away in urban areas (commercial or industrial farming). Most subsistence farms are in poorer countries, while industrial farms are in richer countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":21},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":39},{"uri":"Animal_husbandry","surface_form":"raise animal","offset":52},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":130},{"uri":"Pasture","surface_form":"pasture","offset":280},{"uri":"Arable_land","surface_form":"arable land","offset":345},{"uri":"Subsistence_agriculture","surface_form":"subsistence agriculture","offset":565},{"uri":"Product_(consumer_goods)","surface_form":"product","offset":637},{"uri":"Urban_area","surface_form":"urban area","offset":669}]}
