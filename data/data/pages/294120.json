{"id":294120,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity","text":"e=\"preserve\">Validity is an idea that is used in everyday language and in logic. In ordinary language it means correct or in the right form.\nAn argument is valid if it seems appropriate, well-grounded and can be defended. A contract is valid if it is enforceable in law. In other words, it applies legally to a particular situation. A bank-note is valid if it can be exchanged and used for purchase, and a passport is valid if it lets the holder come in and go out of a country. A will is valid if correctly made, and certified by an appropriate court. In all these cases, valid refers to the soundness in some situation. Logical uses of this idea are similar, but phrased much more exactly.\nIn logic.\nIt is nothing to do with ordinary ideas of truth. Truth points outwards to the world. Validity, on the other hand, points inwards to the syllogism.\nAnd it is not true that Socrates was green.\nThe problem with the argument is that it is not \"sound\". In order for a deductive argument to be sound, the deduction must be valid and all the premises true.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":28},{"uri":"Everyday_language","surface_form":"everyday language","offset":49},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":74},{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":144},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":224},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":266},{"uri":"Bank-note","surface_form":"bank-note","offset":335},{"uri":"Passport","surface_form":"passport","offset":406},{"uri":"Will_(law)","surface_form":"will","offset":481},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":546},{"uri":"Truth","surface_form":"truth","offset":745},{"uri":"Syllogism","surface_form":"syllogism","offset":839}]}
