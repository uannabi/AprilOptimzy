{"id":294230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_processes","text":"Many things that appear to be one organism are in fact several living together. An example is lichen. Lichen is a symbiosis between a blue-green alga<nowiki/>e and fungi. Organisms that live together may not reproduce together, but their life processes bound up together. They help each other to live.\nModern ideas.\nModern ideas from molecular biology, cell biology and cybernetics give us more ways of describing biological processes.\nCells and macro-molecules.\nAll life processes on Earth use the chemistry of carbon compounds. In particular, all life uses long-chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid. With water, which is essential, the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells. This is true of all known life.\nSystems theory.\nLiving organisms are open systems. The main idea is that the processes serve to keep them alive by homeostasis. They are always changing, but always staying within certain limits as long as they live.\nThey do this by exchanging materials and information with their environment. They undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli and reproduce. All of this preserves the individual and its race or species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lichen","surface_form":"lichen","offset":94},{"uri":"Symbiosis","surface_form":"symbiosis","offset":114},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"blue-green alga","offset":134},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":164},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":334},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cell biology","offset":353},{"uri":"Cybernetics","surface_form":"cybernetics","offset":370},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":499},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":512},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":588},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":601},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":620},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"membranes","offset":685},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":703},{"uri":"Cybernetics","surface_form":"open systems","offset":779},{"uri":"Homeostasis","surface_form":"homeostasis","offset":857},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":986},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":1000},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":1023},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":1049},{"uri":"Homeostasis","surface_form":"homeostasis","offset":1070},{"uri":"Cell_growth","surface_form":"grow","offset":1105},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimuli","offset":1122},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproduce","offset":1134}]}
