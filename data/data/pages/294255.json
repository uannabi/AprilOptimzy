They prefer dry woodland regions and savannah regions. At the end of the night, group members use a special rallying call and gather to sleep in a nest made of leaves, in a group of branches, or in a hole in a tree.\nThey are small primates (130mm and 95-300 grams) with woolly thick fur that ranges from silvery gray to dark brown. They are good jumpers.\nBush babies have 1-2 babies per litter, with gestation period being 110\u2014120 days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":126},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":182},{"uri":"Savannah","surface_form":"savannah","offset":203},{"uri":"Gestation","surface_form":"gestation","offset":566}]}
