{"id":29437,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_primality_test","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fermat's primality test is an algorithm. It can test if a given number \"p\" is probably prime. There is a flaw however: There are numbers that pass the test, and that are not prime. These numbers are called Carmichael numbers.\nConcept.\nFermat's little theorem states that if \"p\" is prime and formula_1, then\nIf we want to test if \"n\" is prime, then we can pick random \"as in the interval and see if the equation above holds. If the equality does not hold for a value of \"a\", then \"n\" is composite (not prime). If the equality does hold for many values of \"a\", then we can say that \"n\" is probably prime, or a pseudoprime.\nIt may be in our tests that we do not pick any value for \"a\" such that the equality fails. Any \"a\" such that\nwhen \"n\" is composite is known as a \"Fermat liar\". If we do pick an \"a\" such that\nthen \"a\" is known as a \"Fermat witness\" for the compositeness of \"n\".\n\"formula_1\" is the modulo operation. Its result is what remains, if p is divided by n. As an example,\nWhat this test is used for.\nThe RSA algorithm for public-key encryption can be done in such a way that it uses this test. This is useful in cryptography.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":43},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime","offset":100},{"uri":"Flaw","surface_form":"flaw","offset":118},{"uri":"Carmichael_number","surface_form":"Carmichael number","offset":219},{"uri":"Fermat%27s_little_theorem","surface_form":"Fermat's little theorem","offset":248},{"uri":"Interval","surface_form":"interval","offset":391},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":415},{"uri":"Composite_number","surface_form":"composite","offset":499},{"uri":"Pseudoprime","surface_form":"pseudoprime","offset":621},{"uri":"Modular_arithmetic","surface_form":"modulo","offset":914},{"uri":"RSA_algorithm","surface_form":"RSA algorithm","offset":1029},{"uri":"Public-key_cryptography","surface_form":"public-key encryption","offset":1047},{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":1137}]}
