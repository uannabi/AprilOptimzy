{"id":294426,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola","text":"The parabola (from the Greek \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03B1\u03B2\u03BF\u03BB\u03AE) is a type of curve. Menaechmus (380\u2013320 BC) discovered the parabola, and Apollonius of Perga (262 BC\u2013c190 BC) first named it.\nA parabola is a conic section. If a cone is dissected by a plane which is parallel to one of the surfaces of the cone, the result is a parabola. The point where the parabola reaches its maximum or minimum is called the \"vertex.\" At this point the curvature of the parabola is greatest.\nEach parabola has a focal point. Any ray that enters the parabola and is parallel to the axis of symmetry will pass through this point after being reflected by the curve. Because of this fact, parabolas are important in devices such as satellite dishes, or magnifying mirrors. Parabolas are often used to approximate curves that are more difficult to model by themselves.\nEvery parabola uses the equation formula_1, where formula_1, formula_1 and formula_1 are constants, and formula_1 is not equal to formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":23},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":52},{"uri":"Menaechmus","surface_form":"Menaechmus","offset":59},{"uri":"Apollonius_of_Perga","surface_form":"Apollonius of Perga","offset":112},{"uri":"Conic_section","surface_form":"conic section","offset":181},{"uri":"Cone","surface_form":"cone","offset":201},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":224},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel","offset":239},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":262},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"point","offset":314},{"uri":"Maximum_and_minimum","surface_form":"maximum or minimum","offset":351},{"uri":"Ray","surface_form":"ray","offset":488},{"uri":"Satellite_dish","surface_form":"satellite dish","offset":687},{"uri":"Mirror","surface_form":"mirror","offset":719},{"uri":"Approximation","surface_form":"approximate","offset":756},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":847},{"uri":"Constant","surface_form":"constants","offset":912}]}
