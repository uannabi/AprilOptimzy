At the site were numerous examples of cuts where the flesh had been flensed from the bones, which indicates that \"H. antecessor\" could have practised cannibalism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Homo_(genus)","surface_form":"human species","offset":32},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":245},{"uri":"Atapuerca","surface_form":"Atapuerca","offset":343},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":354},{"uri":"Cannibalism","surface_form":"cannibalism","offset":511}]}
