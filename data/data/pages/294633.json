The show was made at WNEW-TV in New York City.\n\"Wonderama\" also was run in five other markets in which Metromedia owned television stations, including WTTG in Washington D.C., KMBC-TV in Kansas City, KTTV in Los Angeles, WXIX-TV in Cincinnati and WTCN-TV in Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul. The show ran three hours long, and later two hours on Sunday mornings.\nThe Bob McAllister years.\nDespite the frequent turnover of hosts throughout the 1950s, \"Wonderama\" experienced its greatest viewership by way of one-time Baltimore kids' show host Bob McAllister, who replaced Sonny Fox as host in 1967 and remained host until 1977.\nEach show's taping included \"(but was not necessarily limited to)\" education, music, audience participation, games, interviews and cartoon shorts.\nMcAllister sang the program's closing theme song. It was called \"Kids Are People Too\" (\"wacka-doo, wacka-doo, wacka-doo\"). This later became the show's title when it moved to ABC on Sunday mornings.\n1980 revival.\nBeginning in 1980, a documentary/magazine show for children (and hosted by teens) ran on Sunday mornings on WNEW-TV. While this show maintained the \"Wonderama\" title, the show itself was nothing like the kids festival that it once was. This hour-long incarnation ran until 1983; reruns edited to 30 minutes aired from 1984 to 1986 on WNEW-TV/WNYW on Saturday mornings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Children%27s_television","surface_form":"children's television","offset":31},{"uri":"Metromedia","surface_form":"Metromedia","offset":77},{"uri":"WNYW","surface_form":"WNEW-TV","offset":143},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":154},{"uri":"WTTG","surface_form":"WTTG","offset":273},{"uri":"Washington_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington D.C.","offset":281},{"uri":"KMBC-TV","surface_form":"KMBC-TV","offset":298},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City","offset":309},{"uri":"KTTV","surface_form":"KTTV","offset":322},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":330},{"uri":"WXIX-TV","surface_form":"WXIX-TV","offset":343},{"uri":"Cincinnati%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cincinnati","offset":354},{"uri":"KARE","surface_form":"WTCN-TV","offset":369},{"uri":"Minneapolis_%E2%80%93_Saint_Paul","surface_form":"Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul","offset":380},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":631},{"uri":"Kids_Are_People_Too","surface_form":"Kids Are People Too","offset":954}]}
