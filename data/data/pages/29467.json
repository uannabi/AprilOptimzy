{"id":29467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%C5%A1ovce","text":"Mo\u0161ovce is one of the biggest villages in the Turiec Region of Slovakia.\nHistory.\nMo\u0161ovce has existed for 770 years. In this time people built many old and beautiful buildings. King Andrew II wrote about the village for the first time in 1233.\nAt first, \"Mo\u0161ovce\" had two parts: The first one, \"Machyuch\", was in the area of today\u2019s \"Star\u00FD Rad\" Street. The village took its today's name from the second part, \"Terra Moys\", which was in the place of the present day \"Vidrmoch\" Street. Because of the name of the second part, which means \"The Land of Moj\u0161\", we believe that all the village was the property of a certain Mr. \"Moj\u0161\". His name could be a short form of a longer Slavic name \"Mojtech\", similar to the names \"Vojtech\" or \"Mojm\u00EDr\". In the history the name of the village changed from \"Mossovych\", \"Mosocz\", \"Mossowecz\", \"villa regia Mayos alio nomine Mossovych\", \"oppidioum Mayus sue Mosocz\", \"Mosocz olim Mayus\" to the present-day \"Mo\u0161ovce\".\nThe name of a separate very old part of \"Mo\u0161ovce\", \"Chornukov\", chaged to the modern form of \"\u010Cer\u0148akov\".\nMo\u0161ovce was at first a royal village, and in about 1350 changed into a privileged town, which belonged to the royal castle of Blatnica. In 1527 the R\u00E9vay family became its owners, and they took away the town privileges of \"Mo\u0161ovce\" for almost 400 years.\nIn the past, Mo\u0161ovce was an important craft center of the Turiec region. Crafts were very successful, and there were around 15 guilds in the town; the bootmaker and the most famous furrier guild existed for the longest time. The present-day Mo\u0161ovce is an important tourist area with many interesting places.\nInteresting places.\nOne of the most interesting buildings is a small Rococo-Classical Palace with a big English park. People built the palace in about 1750-1800. Other places in the town are: The birthplace of J\u00E1n Koll\u00E1r, a Neo-gothic Catholic church with a valuable altar built on the place of an older church, a Lutheran church built in 1784, a Mausoleum, an Art-Nouveau greenhouse and a pavilion from 1800. In the Mausoleum there is now a Museum of Crafts.\nNature.\nThe nature around Mo\u0161ovce is really beautiful. A system of old roads with trees and small forests create a nice landscape. This landscape looks nice with the forests of the Ve\u013Ek\u00E1 Fatra Mountains. This mountain range is one of the nicest ones in Slovakia. People from all parts of the world come visit the beautiful Limestone and dolomite rocks, and the beautiful nature in the Blatnick\u00E1 and Gadersk\u00E1 Valleys, which are not far away.\nCulture and traditions.\nMany important people were born in Mo\u0161ovce. The greatest ones are Frico Kafenda (1883-1963), composer; Anna Lackov\u00E1-Zora (1899-1988), writer; \u0160tefan Kr\u010Dm\u00E9ry (1892-1955), literary critic, historian, and poet; J\u00FAr Tes\u00E1k Mo\u0161ovsk\u00FD, Baroque playwright; and Miloslav Schmidt, the founder of the amateur fire brigades in Slovakia.\nProbably the most important person born in Mo\u0161ovce is the great Slavic poet, philosopher, and Lutheran priest, J\u00E1n Koll\u00E1r (1793-1852), who was very active in the literature of at least two nations. He wrote a book of poems called Sl\u00E1vy Dcera. His work was very important for the patriots and national activists, who lived at the same time as Koll\u00E1r. People translated the book into many Slavic and non-Slavic languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":30},{"uri":"Turiec","surface_form":"Turiec","offset":46},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"Region","offset":53},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":63},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":177},{"uri":"Andrew_II","surface_form":"Andrew II","offset":182},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":673},{"uri":"Royal","surface_form":"royal","offset":1079},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":1085},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1138},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"royal","offset":1166},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":1172},{"uri":"Blatnica","surface_form":"Blatnica","offset":1182},{"uri":"R%C3%A9vay","surface_form":"R\u00E9vay","offset":1204},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":1348},{"uri":"Turiec","surface_form":"Turiec","offset":1368},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":1375},{"uri":"Guild","surface_form":"guild","offset":1437},{"uri":"Boot","surface_form":"boot","offset":1461},{"uri":"Fur_clothing","surface_form":"furrier","offset":1491},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":1575},{"uri":"Rococo","surface_form":"Rococo","offset":1687},{"uri":"Classicism","surface_form":"Classical","offset":1694},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"Palace","offset":1704},{"uri":"English_park","surface_form":"English park","offset":1722},{"uri":"J%C3%A1n_Koll%C3%A1r","surface_form":"J\u00E1n Koll\u00E1r","offset":1828},{"uri":"Neo-gothic","surface_form":"Neo-gothic","offset":1842},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":1853},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":1862},{"uri":"Altar","surface_form":"altar","offset":1885},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":1932},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":1941},{"uri":"Mausoleum","surface_form":"Mausoleum","offset":1965},{"uri":"Art-Nouveau","surface_form":"Art-Nouveau","offset":1979},{"uri":"Greenhouse","surface_form":"greenhouse","offset":1991},{"uri":"Pavilion","surface_form":"pavilion","offset":2008},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"Museum","offset":2060},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"Craft","offset":2070},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":2198},{"uri":"Ve%C4%BEk%C3%A1_Fatra","surface_form":"Ve\u013Ek\u00E1 Fatra","offset":2259},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":2287},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":2331},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"Limestone","offset":2401},{"uri":"Dolomite","surface_form":"dolomite rocks","offset":2415},{"uri":"Blatnick%C3%A1_Valley","surface_form":"Blatnick\u00E1","offset":2463},{"uri":"Gadersk%C3%A1_Valley","surface_form":"Gadersk\u00E1 Valley","offset":2477},{"uri":"Frico_Kafenda","surface_form":"Frico Kafenda","offset":2609},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":2636},{"uri":"Anna_Lackov%C3%A1-Zora","surface_form":"Anna Lackov\u00E1-Zora","offset":2646},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":2677},{"uri":"%C5%A0tefan_Kr%C4%8Dm%C3%A9ry","surface_form":"\u0160tefan Kr\u010Dm\u00E9ry","offset":2685},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"literary critic","offset":2713},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":2730},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":2745},{"uri":"J%C3%BAr_Tes%C3%A1k_Mo%C5%A1ovsk%C3%BD","surface_form":"J\u00FAr Tes\u00E1k Mo\u0161ovsk\u00FD","offset":2751},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":2771},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":2779},{"uri":"Miloslav_Schmidt","surface_form":"Miloslav Schmidt","offset":2795},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":2832},{"uri":"Firefighter","surface_form":"fire brigades","offset":2840},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":2857},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":2931},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":2938},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":2944},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":2961},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":2970},{"uri":"J%C3%A1n_Koll%C3%A1r","surface_form":"J\u00E1n Koll\u00E1r","offset":2978},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":3029},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":3056},{"uri":"Sl%C3%A1vy_Dcera","surface_form":"Sl\u00E1vy Dcera","offset":3097},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"patriots","offset":3146},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":3168},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":3254},{"uri":"Languages","surface_form":"languages","offset":3276}]}
