The aye-aye spends most of its time in trees. During the day, it sleeps in a nest in the fork of a tree. It builds the nest out of leaves and twigs.\nThe aye-aye has rodent-like teeth and a special thin middle finger to get at the insect grubs under tree bark. It fills the same ecological niche as woodpeckers do elsewhere. It taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward slanting incisors. Then it sticks in its middle finger to pull the grubs out.\nLemurs are primates, and so are related to monkeys, apes, and me","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lemur","surface_form":"lemur","offset":50},{"uri":"Rain_forests","surface_form":"rain forests","offset":71},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":87},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":141},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":185},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":258},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":384},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"grubs","offset":456},{"uri":"Ecological_niche","surface_form":"ecological niche","offset":497},{"uri":"Woodpeckers","surface_form":"woodpeckers","offset":517},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":711},{"uri":"Monkey","surface_form":"monkey","offset":743},{"uri":"Ape","surface_form":"ape","offset":752},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"me","offset":762}]}
