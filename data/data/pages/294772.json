It was designed as an eight-seat \"commuter\" plane for businessmen in the Long Island area. The Goose was Grumman\u2019s first monoplane to fly. It was also Grumman's first twin-engined aircraft as well as their first aircraft to provide commercial service. During World War II, the Goose was used to transport the US military (including the Coast Guard). It served with many other air forces. During battles, the Goose took on an increasing number of combat and training roles. It was also used after the war.\nDesign and development.\nIn 1936, some rich residents of Long Island, such as E. Roland Harriman, asked Grumman to build them an aircraft. They would use this aircraft to fly to New York City. The G-21 was designed after this. It was an all-metal, high-winged monoplane powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Jr. nine-cylinder, air-cooled radial engines mounted on the leading edge of high-set wings. The deep fuselage served also as a hull and had hand-cranked retractable landing gear. First flight of the prototype took place on May 29, 1937.\nThe fuselage was very versatile. It had a lot of interior space. So it could be used as luxury or transport airliner. There were plans to market the G-21 as an amphibian airliner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amphibious_aircraft","surface_form":"amphibious aircraft","offset":29},{"uri":"Long_Island","surface_form":"Long Island","offset":170},{"uri":"Grumman","surface_form":"Grumman","offset":202},{"uri":"Monoplane","surface_form":"monoplane","offset":218},{"uri":"Commercial","surface_form":"commercial","offset":329},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":356},{"uri":"E._Roland_Harriman","surface_form":"E.
