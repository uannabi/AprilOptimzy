{"id":29497,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor","text":"A \u201CHeldentenor\u201D (German for \u201Chero tenor\u201D) is someone with a big tenor voice. This is suitable for heroic parts like the heroes in most of Wagner's operas. Lauritz Melchior, Max Lorenz and Jonas Kaufmann are famous heroic tenors.\nThe Mozart tenor with characteristics including all of the previous mentioned must be able to perform within the strict borders which are laid out by the Mozart style. Anton Dermota, Fritz Wunderlich and Francisco Araiza are the three leading people as Mozart tenor.\nWhen writing four-part choir music the tenor line will be the third line down, between alto and bass. It is usually written in the treble clef, but will sound an octave lower than written. Sometimes, it is written in the \"C-clef\", which is also called a tenor clef.\nIn barbershop singing, the tenor part is a harmony part sung predominantly higher than the melody.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Wagner's","offset":138},{"uri":"Lauritz_Melchior","surface_form":"Lauritz Melchior","offset":155},{"uri":"Max_Lorenz_(singer)","surface_form":"Max Lorenz","offset":173},{"uri":"Jonas_Kaufmann","surface_form":"Jonas Kaufmann","offset":188},{"uri":"Anton_Dermota","surface_form":"Anton Dermota","offset":397},{"uri":"Fritz_Wunderlich","surface_form":"Fritz Wunderlich","offset":412},{"uri":"Francisco_Araiza","surface_form":"Francisco Araiza","offset":433},{"uri":"Alto","surface_form":"alto","offset":583},{"uri":"Bass_(vocal_range)","surface_form":"bass","offset":592},{"uri":"Octave","surface_form":"octave","offset":658}]}
