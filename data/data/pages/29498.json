{"id":29498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_(sound)","text":"=\"preserve\">:\"This article is about the musical term. For other uses, see Bass.\"\nBass is a low or deep tone (low end frequency) in music. Low or deep tones are also called \"low-pitched\" tones, because the pitch is low. It is usually made by a bass guitar or an acoustic bass (a double bass). It can also be a deep, rumbling electronic sound made by a synthesizer, a deep singing voice, a baritone sax, or a deep bass drum. Bass gives the well-rounded depth to music. Bass almost always is used with treble sounds made by instruments such as a guitar, piano, a high singing voice, trumpet, or harmonica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bass","surface_form":"Bass","offset":74},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":117},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":131},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":243},{"uri":"Double_bass","surface_form":"double bass","offset":278},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic","offset":324},{"uri":"Synthesizer","surface_form":"synthesizer","offset":351},{"uri":"Voice","surface_form":"voice","offset":379},{"uri":"Saxophone","surface_form":"sax","offset":397},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":417},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":551}]}
