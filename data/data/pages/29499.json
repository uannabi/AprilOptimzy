{"id":29499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone","text":"=\"preserve\">A baritone is a man with a voice range between that of a tenor (high male voice) and bass (low male voice), typically ranging from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C. It is the most common male voice type.\nFamous baritone roles in opera include: Papageno in Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" and Figaro in Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\".\nDietrich Fischer-Dieskau is often thought of as the greatest baritone of the later 20th century. He was famous as a Lieder singer as well as on the concert stage and in opera.\nSome musical instruments are also called \"baritone\" because they create similar frequencies to a baritone singer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tenor","surface_form":"tenor","offset":69},{"uri":"Bass_(singer)","surface_form":"bass","offset":97},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":260},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart's","offset":287},{"uri":"The_Magic_Flute","surface_form":"The Magic Flute","offset":297},{"uri":"Gioacchino_Rossini","surface_form":"Rossini's","offset":328},{"uri":"The_Barber_of_Seville","surface_form":"The Barber of Seville","offset":339},{"uri":"Dietrich_Fischer-Dieskau","surface_form":"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau","offset":363},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":446},{"uri":"Lied","surface_form":"Lied","offset":479},{"uri":"Musical_instruments","surface_form":"musical instruments","offset":544}]}
