Tucker played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Montreal Canadiens, Tampa Bay Lightning, Toronto Maple Leafs and Colorado Avalanche.\nHe was drafted 151st overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1993 NHL Entry draft. He became known in Long Island during the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs after Tucker delivered a hip check to New York Islanders' captain Michael Peca during game five of the first round. The hit blew out Peca's MCL and ACL on his left knee which ended his season and delayed his entry into the 2002\u201303 season.
