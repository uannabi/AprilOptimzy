Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, this is when the word \"yuppie\" was used to describe \"young urban professionals\" \u2013 young adults who lived in cities and started to get good jobs. This was also the rise of a more conservative period in these countries \u2013 Ronald Reagan was president for most of this time in the United States, Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister of Canada.\nThis decade also saw the Soviet Union fight a war that seemed endless in Afghanistan, civil war in Ethiopia, and the fall of the Berlin Wall which started the end of the Cold War and of Communism in Eastern Europe.\nThe \"eighties\" are also well known for their extreme fashions, such as \"big hair\", New Wave, punk rock, funk, or preppies. Rap music first started to get big in the 80s, and often went with breakdancing in what is now called the \"old school\" days. Many developments were also made in computer technology during these years, and video games became popular.\nIn sports, Italy and Argentina won the FIFA World Cup. The Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals, New York Mets, Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics won the World Series. The Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins, Los Angeles Raiders, Chicago Bears and New York Giants won the Super Bowl. Finally, the Los Angeles Lakers dominated the NBA, with only the Houston Rockets winning a title.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clockwise","surface_form":"clockwise","offset":60},{"uri":"Space_Shuttle","surface_form":"Space
