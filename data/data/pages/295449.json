{"id":295449,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_des_Hashischins","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Club des Hashischins, the Hashish Club, (sometimes also spelled Club des Hashishins or Club des Hachichins'\"), was a Parisian group who explored using drugs, mainly hashish, to get creative ideas.\nIt was active from about 1844 to 1849. Some of the most important literary and intellectual people in Paris were members. They including Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau, Th\u00E9ophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, Victor Hugo, Honor\u00E9 de Balzac G\u00E9rard de Nerval, Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix and Alexandre Dumas, p\u00E8re. Monthly \"s\u00E9ances\" were held at the H\u00F4tel de Lauzun (at that time: H\u00F4tel Pimodan) on the \u00CEle Saint-Louis.\nGautier wrote about the club in an article called the \"Le Club des Hachichin\" published in the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" in February 1846. While he is often said to have started the club, in the article he says he was attending their s\u00E9ances for the first time that evening.\nThe group dressed up in Arab clothing. They drank coffee and added hashish, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, pistachio, sugar, orange juice, butter and cantharides. It was a thick, green mixture, like a jam.\nDr. Moreau wrote a book in 1846 about the cannabis and the drug taking experiments of the club. The 439 page book was called \"Hashish and Mental Illness - Psychological Studies\". Baudelaire wrote that while the drug did give people ideas, it quickly affected their personality. They felt they could only create while under the influence of the drug.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":134},{"uri":"Hashish","surface_form":"hashish","offset":182},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectual","offset":293},{"uri":"Jacques-Joseph_Moreau","surface_form":"Jacques-Joseph Moreau","offset":355},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9ophile_Gautier","surface_form":"Th\u00E9ophile Gautier","offset":378},{"uri":"Charles_Baudelaire","surface_form":"Charles Baudelaire","offset":397},{"uri":"Victor_Hugo","surface_form":"Victor Hugo","offset":417},{"uri":"Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac","surface_form":"Honor\u00E9 de Balzac","offset":430},{"uri":"G%C3%A9rard_de_Nerval","surface_form":"G\u00E9rard de Nerval","offset":447},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix","surface_form":"Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix","offset":465},{"uri":"Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Alexandre Dumas, p\u00E8re","offset":486},{"uri":"S%C3%A9ance","surface_form":"s\u00E9ance","offset":518},{"uri":"H%C3%B4tel_de_Lauzun","surface_form":"H\u00F4tel de Lauzun","offset":544},{"uri":"%C3%8Ele_Saint-Louis","surface_form":"\u00CEle Saint-Louis","offset":597},{"uri":"Revue_des_Deux_Mondes","surface_form":"Revue des Deux Mondes","offset":710},{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":911},{"uri":"Cinnamon","surface_form":"cinnamon","offset":963},{"uri":"Cloves","surface_form":"cloves","offset":973},{"uri":"Nutmeg","surface_form":"nutmeg","offset":981},{"uri":"Pistachio","surface_form":"pistachio","offset":989},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":1000},{"uri":"Orange_juice","surface_form":"orange juice","offset":1007},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":1021},{"uri":"Cantharides","surface_form":"cantharides","offset":1032}]}
