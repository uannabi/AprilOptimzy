{"id":295552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism","text":"=\"preserve\">A mechanism is a mechanical device for doing something. It includes the idea of tools and machines, but is used for a wider range of objects, processes and ideas.\nPalaeolithic hand axes were one of the first tools used. Simple modern mechanisms would be rope pulleys or levers. The internal combustion engine is a mechanism for turning oil into motion. A complicated example would be computers and the web.\nThe word \"mechanism\" is also used as a metaphor. The celestial mechanics of Kepler and Newton is a way of predicting and explaining planetary motions in the Solar System. Darwin's natural selection is his proposed mechanism as to how evolution took place.\nIn that way, a mechanism in science or technology is an explanation of how something works or might work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":92},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":102},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":145},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":154},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":168},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"Palaeolithic","offset":175},{"uri":"Hand_axe","surface_form":"hand axe","offset":188},{"uri":"Pulley","surface_form":"pulleys","offset":271},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"levers","offset":282},{"uri":"Internal_combustion_engine","surface_form":"internal combustion engine","offset":294},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":348},{"uri":"Motion","surface_form":"motion","offset":357},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":396},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web","surface_form":"web","offset":414},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":458},{"uri":"Celestial","surface_form":"celestial","offset":472},{"uri":"Kepler","surface_form":"Kepler","offset":495},{"uri":"Newton","surface_form":"Newton","offset":506},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planetary","offset":551},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":576},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Darwin's","offset":590},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":599},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":653},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":703},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":714},{"uri":"Explanation","surface_form":"explanation","offset":731}]}
