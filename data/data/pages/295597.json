{"id":295597,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomis","text":"Bomis was a Internet company created in 1996 by Jimmy Wales, Tim Shell, and Michael Davis. Bomis is best known for having supported the creation of the projects Nupedia and Wikipedia.\nBomis was popular for hosting entertainment-, sports- and adult-themed sites. When Nupedia started, Larry Sanger was hired to be the editor-in-chief for the project. But Nupedia resulted too slow to grow and too expensive to maintain, and Wikipedia was started as a side project to help Nupedia grow. In the end, Wikipedia became more popular than Nupedia; it closed in 2003 and Wikipedia was transferred to the newly created Wikimedia Foundation in 2003. Bomis closed in 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":12},{"uri":"Jimmy_Wales","surface_form":"Jimmy Wales","offset":48},{"uri":"Former_Board_of_Trustees_members","surface_form":"Tim Shell","offset":61},{"uri":"Former_Board_of_Trustees_members","surface_form":"Michael Davis","offset":76},{"uri":"Nupedia","surface_form":"Nupedia","offset":161},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":173},{"uri":"Larry_Sanger","surface_form":"Larry Sanger","offset":284},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Foundation","surface_form":"Wikimedia Foundation","offset":610}]}
