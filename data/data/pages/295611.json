In 1996, he started an engagement at the G\u00E4rtnerplatztheater in Munich. Since the year 2000 van Rensburg has been working regularly with the Lautten Compagney Berlin (director: Wolfgang Katschner). With this ensemble he staged Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" and published three recordings. Since 2011 van Rensburg collaborates with a different emsemble for Ancient and New Music, called \"cos\u00EC facciamo\". With them he staged Handel\u2019s \"Ariodante\".\nHe sung his first name part as and in Mozart\u2019s Idomeneo in 2006 for the New York City Metropolitan Opera. Van Rensburg\u2018s repertoire focuses on Baroque music.\nHowever, he has also made his mark in song and Lied interpretation, focusing on English Baroque composers (i.e. Dowland, Byrd, Purcell), as well as German composers Beethoven, Schumann and Schubert, to name only a few.\nOpera stage direction.\nAt the Munich G\u00E4rtnerplatztheater van Rensburg staged, together with the librettist Peer Boysen the pasticcio \"Ein Theater nach der Mode\" in 2002, featuring compositions by Handel and other Baroque composers. In 2006 he gave his directorial debut in the Opernhaus Halle with Monteverdi\u2018s \"L'Orfeo, in which he also sang the name part. Handel\u2018s first oratorio \"Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno\" was staged in 2009 in Passau by van Rensburg. His latest directorial work includes Handel\u2019s opera Ariodante, premiered in February 2011 at the Munich Cuvilli\u00E9s-Theater. Just like in his former own production \"Il Pianto d'Orfeo\" van Rensburg links the expressiveness of dancing with the music of the composition. The dancer serves as an Alter ego to the singer and thereby illustrates the emotions of the character he or she impersonates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Johannesburg","surface_form":"Johannesburg","offset":40},{"uri":"Tenor","surface_form":"tenor","offset":73},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart's","offset":354},{"uri":"Die_Entf%C3%BChrung_aus_dem_Serail","surface_form":"Die Entf\u00FChrung aus dem Serail","offset":364},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":489},{"uri":"Lautten_Compagney","surface_form":"Lautten Compagney","offset":566},{"uri":"Claudio_Monteverdi","surface_form":"Monteverdi's","offset":652},{"uri":"L%27Orfeo","surface_form":"L'Orfeo","offset":666},{"uri":"George_Frideric_Handel","surface_form":"Handel\u2019s","offset":841},{"uri":"Ariodante","surface_form":"Ariodante","offset":851},{"uri":"Idomeneo","surface_form":"Idomeneo","offset":910},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Opera","surface_form":"Metropolitan Opera","offset":949},{"uri":"Baroque_music","surface_form":"Baroque music","offset":1006},{"uri":"Lied","surface_form":"Lied","offset":1068},{"uri":"John_Dowland","surface_form":"Dowland","offset":1133},{"uri":"William_Byrd","surface_form":"Byrd","offset":1142},{"uri":"Henry_Purcell","surface_form":"Purcell","offset":1148},{"uri":"Ludwig_van_Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":1186},{"uri":"Robert_Schumann","surface_form":"Schumann","offset":1197},{"uri":"Franz_Schubert","surface_form":"Schubert","offset":1210},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"librettist","offset":1336},{"uri":"Peer_Boysen","surface_form":"Peer Boysen","offset":1347},{"uri":"Pasticcio","surface_form":"pasticcio","offset":1363},{"uri":"Oratorio","surface_form":"oratorio","offset":1613},{"uri":"Il_Trionfo_del_Tempo_e_del_Disinganno","surface_form":"Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno","offset":1623},{"uri":"Passau","surface_form":"Passau","offset":1684},{"uri":"Alter_ego","surface_form":"Alter ego","offset":1998}]}
