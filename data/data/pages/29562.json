{"id":29562,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimos_(moon)","text":"Deimos (or Mars II) comes from the Greek word for terror. It is the smaller moon of Mars. Its orbital period is 30.3 hours, which is 1.263 days.\nDeimos is only 15 kilometers in diameter. It is covered with craters, as Earth's moon and other bodies without an atmosphere are.\nDiscovery and naming.\nDeimos was discovered by Asaph Hall at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. on 12 August 1877.\nIt is named after the god Deimos in Greek mythology, who was one of Mars' sons, and means Panic.\nPhysical characteristics.\nDeimos is not spherical with triaxial dimensions of 15 \u00D7 12.2 \u00D7 11 km. Deimos is made up of rock rich in carbonaceous material. It is has lots of craters. Escape velocity from Deimos is 5.6 m/s. The apparent magnitude of Deimos is 12.45.\nExploration.\nThe Soviet Phobos program sent two probes to Phobos. In case \"Phobos 1\" succeeded, \"Phobos 2\" could have been sent to Deimos. Both probes launched successfully in July 1988.\nIn 1997 and 1998, the proposed \"Aladdin\" mission was selected. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch projectiles at the satellites. The probe would collect the dust kicked into space as it made a slow flyby. These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later.\nAlso, the sample-return mission called \"Gulliver\" to Deimos, in bringing 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of material from Deimos to Earth.\nAnother concept of sample-return mission from Phobos and Deimos is \"OSIRIS-REx 2\", which would use heritage from the first \"OSIRIS-REx\".\nIn March 2014, a mission was proposed to place an orbiter on Mars orbit by 2021 and study Phobos and Deimos. It is called \"Phobos And Deimos & Mars Environment\" (PADME).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":76},{"uri":"Mars_(planet)","surface_form":"Mars","offset":84},{"uri":"Orbital_period","surface_form":"orbital period","offset":94},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":177},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":206},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":218},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":259},{"uri":"Asaph_Hall","surface_form":"Asaph Hall","offset":322},{"uri":"United_States_Naval_Observatory","surface_form":"United States Naval Observatory","offset":340},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":375},{"uri":"Deimos_(mythology)","surface_form":"Deimos","offset":437},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":447},{"uri":"Rock","surface_form":"rock","offset":626},{"uri":"Carbonaceous_chondrite","surface_form":"carbonaceous","offset":639},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":652},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"craters","offset":680},{"uri":"Escape_velocity","surface_form":"Escape velocity","offset":689},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":733},{"uri":"Phobos_program","surface_form":"Phobos program","offset":796},{"uri":"Phobos_1","surface_form":"Phobos 1","offset":847},{"uri":"Phobos_2","surface_form":"Phobos 2","offset":869},{"uri":"Projectile","surface_form":"projectiles","offset":1079},{"uri":"Natural_satellite","surface_form":"satellites","offset":1098},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"space","offset":1155},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":1380},{"uri":"Phobos_(moon)","surface_form":"Phobos","offset":1433},{"uri":"OSIRIS-REx","surface_form":"OSIRIS-REx","offset":1511},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":1585},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":1590}]}
