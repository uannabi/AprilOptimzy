{"id":29563,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)","text":"Phobos (or Mars I) is one of Mars' moons. The other is Deimos.\nPhobos is the larger of the two moons, and is only 27 kilometers in diameter. This is about as far as a car can travel on the highway in 15 minutes. It is covered with craters, as Earth's moon is.\nIt is named after the god Phobos in Greek mythology. Its name means \"fear\".\nPhobos is trapped in tidal drag, with its orbit lowering roughly 1.8 meters per century. In about 50 million years, Phobos will reach the Roche limit, where it is likely to be torn apart. Some fragments will fall on Mars and some will form a planetary ring or rings around Mars.\nThe other moon, Deimos, is the smaller of the two.\nSpacecraft.\nThe Soviet Union sent at least two space craft to this moon, Phobos 1 and Phobos 2. Both failed or lost contact with Earth, but Phobos 2 managed to take some pictures of the moon in 1989 before dying.\nFeatures.\nThere is one large crater on Phobos called Stickney. It is formula_1 the size of the moon itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mars_(planet)","surface_form":"Mars","offset":29},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moons","offset":35},{"uri":"Deimos_(moon)","surface_form":"Deimos","offset":55},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometers","offset":117},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":131},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":231},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":243},{"uri":"Phobos","surface_form":"Phobos","offset":286},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":296},{"uri":"Roche_limit","surface_form":"Roche limit","offset":474},{"uri":"Planetary_ring","surface_form":"planetary ring","offset":578},{"uri":"Deimos_(moon)","surface_form":"Deimos","offset":631},{"uri":"Stickney_(crater)","surface_form":"Stickney","offset":932}]}
