{"id":295695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood","text":"The redwoods are a subfamily of conifers, the Sequoideae. They are in the Cypress family Cupressaceae. It is most common in the coastal forests of Northern California and is possibly the largest tree in the world. There are three living genera in the subfamily. There were once more species of redwood trees, but most have become extinct.\nThese trees are pyrophytes: they have adapted to survive forest fires. Because fire is common in the regions where they grow, redwood trees have developed thick, fire-resistant bark. Their cones open only after a fire. Because fire control is better these days, the trees are endangered because they do not reproduce so well.\nRedwood trees can grow to be very large. The largest species, \"Sequoiadendron giganteum,\" can reach up to 94.8 m tall and 17\u00A0m across. The tallest tree in the world is claimed to be a \"Sequoia sempervirens\" named Hyperion. The largest tree in the world by volume is claimed to be a \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" named the General Sherman Tree, after William Tecumseh Sherman.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conifers","surface_form":"conifers","offset":32},{"uri":"Cypress","surface_form":"Cypress","offset":74},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":82},{"uri":"Cupressaceae","surface_form":"Cupressaceae","offset":89},{"uri":"Northern_California","surface_form":"Northern California","offset":147},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":237},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":330},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapted","offset":377},{"uri":"Forest_fire","surface_form":"forest fire","offset":396},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":921},{"uri":"William_Tecumseh_Sherman","surface_form":"William Tecumseh Sherman","offset":1012}]}
