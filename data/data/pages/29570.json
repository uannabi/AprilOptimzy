{"id":29570,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros","text":"Eros is the god of love, lust, and sex in Greek mythology.\nAccording to Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Eros came from the Chaos. Later it was said that he was the son of Ares and Aphrodite.\nHis lover is Psyche.\nEros has a bow and golden arrows with whom he can shoot at people so they will fall in love, but he has also leaden arrows which make people hate others.\nThere is a famous statue which many people think is to Eros, but is actually to Anteros in London in Piccadilly Circus.\nFrom the name Eros we get the word erotic, meaning: to do with sexual love (passionate and physical). There is also a noun: eroticism.\nEros is the son of Aphrodite.\nEros' main myth is: \"the myth of Eros and Psyche\" in which Eros and Psyche fall in love after psyche is put through tasks by Aphrodite.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":19},{"uri":"Lust","surface_form":"lust","offset":25},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":35},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":42},{"uri":"Hesiod","surface_form":"Hesiod","offset":72},{"uri":"Theogony","surface_form":"Theogony","offset":82},{"uri":"Chaos_(mythology)","surface_form":"Chaos","offset":112},{"uri":"Ares","surface_form":"Ares","offset":160},{"uri":"Aphrodite","surface_form":"Aphrodite","offset":169},{"uri":"Psyche_(mythology)","surface_form":"Psyche","offset":193},{"uri":"Bow_(weapon)","surface_form":"bow","offset":212},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":220},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrow","offset":227},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":310},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":446}]}
