{"id":295810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS","text":"BRICS is used to talk about the countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Many economists think that all these countries are at a similar stage of economic development. When people write about these countries, they usually write \"BRICS\" or the \"BRICS countries\".\nThe acronym was invented by Jim O'Neill, an economist who worked for Goldman Sachs. In 2001, he wrote an article that he called \"Building Better Global Economic BRICs\".\nMexico and South Korea were the only other countries with economies that are like the BRICs. But O'Neill did not include these countries because they were considered already more developed, as they were already members of the OECD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":32},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":45},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":53},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":61},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"China","offset":68},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":78},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economists","offset":97},{"uri":"Economic_development","surface_form":"economic development","offset":165},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":285},{"uri":"Goldman_Sachs","surface_form":"Goldman Sachs","offset":350},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":368},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":450},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":461},{"uri":"OECD","surface_form":"OECD","offset":676}]}
