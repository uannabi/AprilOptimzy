In 2018, the movement had 125 members and 25 observer countries.\nThe group was started in Belgrade in 1961. It was created by Yugoslavia's President, Josip Broz Tito, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, Egypt's second President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah, and Indonesia's first President, Sukarno. All five leaders believed that developing countries should not help either the Western or Eastern blocs in the Cold War. They also believed that developing countries should not be capitalist or communist, but should try to find a different way to help their people.\nThe \"Havana Declaration of 1979\" said that the purpose of the organization is to help countries keep their \"the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries\" in their \"struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics.\" This means that they wanted to govern their countries without the main capitalist powers nor the major socialist states telling them how.\nThe countries of the non-aligned movement are nearly two-thirds of the United Nations's members and 55% of the world population.\nSecretaries-General.\nBetween summits, the Non-Aligned Movement is run by the secretary-general elected at last summit meeting. As a considerable part of the movement's work is undertaken at the United Nations in New York, the chair country's ambassador to the UN is expected to devote time and effort to matters concerning the Non-Aligned Movement. The Coordinating Bureau, also based at the UN, is the main instrument for directing the work of the movement's task forces, committees and working groups.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_organization","surface_form":"international organization","offset":37},{"uri":"Power_bloc","surface_form":"power bloc","offset":152},{"uri":"Observer_status","surface_form":"observer","offset":230},{"uri":"Belgrade","surface_form":"Belgrade","offset":275},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia's","offset":311},{"uri":"Josip_Broz_Tito","surface_form":"Josip Broz Tito","offset":335},{"uri":"Jawaharlal_Nehru","surface_form":"Jawaharlal Nehru","offset":382},{"uri":"Gamal_Abdel_Nasser","surface_form":"Gamal Abdel Nasser","offset":426},{"uri":"Kwame_Nkrumah","surface_form":"Kwame Nkrumah","offset":470},{"uri":"Sukarno","surface_form":"Sukarno","offset":518},{"uri":"Developing_countries","surface_form":"developing countries","offset":558},{"uri":"Western_bloc","surface_form":"Western","offset":606},{"uri":"Eastern_bloc","surface_form":"Eastern bloc","offset":617},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":638},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"capitalist","offset":707},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":721},{"uri":"Third_Way_(economics)","surface_form":"different way","offset":757},{"uri":"Imperialism","surface_form":"imperialism","offset":1029},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonialism","offset":1042},{"uri":"Neocolonialism","surface_form":"neocolonialism","offset":1055},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":1071},{"uri":"Military_occupation","surface_form":"occupation","offset":1116},{"uri":"Hegemony","surface_form":"hegemony","offset":1156},{"uri":"Great_power","surface_form":"great power","offset":1184},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1425},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1677}]}
