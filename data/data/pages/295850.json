When the local \"quality of life\" is improved, there is more economic development.\nWhen social scientists study economic development, they look at a lot of things. They want to know about the way economic development is discussed by historians. They also want to know how development is happening today. They may want to know why people \"invest\" more money in some places than in others. They also want to know why people are better at making things to sell in some countries rather than others.\nMeasuring Economic Development.\nfor people with color blindness.\nOne way to measure economic development is \"human development.\n\"Human development\" is very important, and includes the health of the people and their education. This usually goes together with \"economic growth.\" As people in a country become healthier and get better education, they also usually get richer, because healthy, educated workers are more \"productive\" (better at making things), and richer workers can afford health and education.\nThe Human Development Index looks at how long people live, how well people read, how many people go to school, and how much money people make.\nEconomists also look at the \"rate of growth\", which is how fast a country gets richer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Standard_of_living","surface_form":"standard of living","offset":56},{"uri":"Social_science","surface_form":"social scientists","offset":253},{"uri":"Investment","surface_form":"invest","offset":503},{"uri":"Color_blindness","surface_form":"color blindness","offset":709},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":845},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":876},{"uri":"Human_Development_Index","surface_form":"Human Development Index","offset":1173},{"uri":"Life_expectancy","surface_form":"how long people live","offset":1206},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"how well people read","offset":1228}]}
