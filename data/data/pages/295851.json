{"id":295851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newly_industrialized_country","text":"The term newly industrialized country (NIC) is a socioeconomic classification used by political scientists and economists to talk about several countries around the world.\nNICs are countries who still are not developed countries but are doing better than other developing countries. NICs have fast growing economies, and export a lot. In NICs many things in the country change quickly as people from the country move to the cities to take jobs in factories.\nNICs often receive support from international organizations such as the WTO and other internationl support bodies. However, as environmental, labor and social standards tend to be significantly weaker in NICs, many fair trade supporters have advocated standards for importing their products and criticized the outsourcing of jobs to NICs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":63},{"uri":"Political_science","surface_form":"political scientists","offset":86},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economists","offset":111},{"uri":"Developed_country","surface_form":"developed countries","offset":209},{"uri":"Developing_countries","surface_form":"developing countries","offset":261},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":321},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"move","offset":412},{"uri":"Factories","surface_form":"factories","offset":447},{"uri":"International_organization","surface_form":"international organization","offset":490},{"uri":"World_Trade_Organization","surface_form":"WTO","offset":530},{"uri":"Fair_trade","surface_form":"fair trade","offset":673},{"uri":"Outsourcing","surface_form":"outsourcing","offset":768}]}
