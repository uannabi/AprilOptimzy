{"id":296,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography","text":"Geography (from Greek:, \"geographia\", literally \"earth description\") is the study of earth and its people. Its features are things like continents, seas, rivers and mountains. Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides, winds, and earthquakes.\nA person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed.\nGeography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography. Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country, how a country's economy is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography.\nMaps are a main tool of geography, so geographers spend much time making and studying them. Making maps is called cartography, and people who specialize in making maps are cartographers.\nPhysical geography.\nPhysical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an Earth science. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, pedosphere, and global flora and fauna patterns (biosphere).\nHistory.\nThe oldest known world map dates back to ancient Babylon from the 9th century BC. The best known Babylonian world map is the \"Imago Mundi\" of 600 BC. Star chart<nowiki/>s (maps of the sky) are of similar age.\nDuring the Middle Ages, people in Europe made fewer maps. People in the Islamic world made more. Ab\u016B Zayd al-Balkh\u012B created the \"Balkh\u012B school\" of mapping in Baghdad.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":16},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":136},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":148},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":154},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":165},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":215},{"uri":"Tide","surface_form":"tide","offset":286},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":293},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":304},{"uri":"Physical_geography","surface_form":"physical geography","offset":539},{"uri":"Human_geography","surface_form":"human geography","offset":562},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":746},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":787},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"Map","offset":854},{"uri":"Cartography","surface_form":"cartography","offset":968},{"uri":"Earth_science","surface_form":"Earth science","offset":1125},{"uri":"Lithosphere","surface_form":"lithosphere","offset":1202},{"uri":"Hydrosphere","surface_form":"hydrosphere","offset":1215},{"uri":"Earth%27s_atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":1228},{"uri":"Pedosphere","surface_form":"pedosphere","offset":1240},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":1263},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":1273},{"uri":"Biosphere","surface_form":"biosphere","offset":1289},{"uri":"World_map","surface_form":"world map","offset":1327},{"uri":"Ancient_Babylon","surface_form":"ancient Babylon","offset":1351},{"uri":"Babylonia","surface_form":"Babylonia","offset":1407},{"uri":"Babylonian_Map_of_the_World","surface_form":"Imago Mundi","offset":1436},{"uri":"Star_chart","surface_form":"Star chart","offset":1460},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":1530},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1553},{"uri":"Muslim_world","surface_form":"Islamic world","offset":1591},{"uri":"Ahmed_ibn_Sahl_al-Balkhi","surface_form":"Ab\u016B Zayd al-Balkh\u012B","offset":1616},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":1677}]}
