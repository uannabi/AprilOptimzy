{"id":296030,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossopteris","text":"\"Glossopteris\" is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct seed ferns. They were typical plants of the coal forests or coal swamps which lasted from the Pennsylvanian (later Carboniferous) to the end of the Permian.\nThe coal swamps were world-wide because, for that long time, the continents were close together in Gondwana. Therefore they had similar wet, tropical climates.\nHistory.\nThe Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian (~300 milliom years ago). Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent \u2013 Gondwana.\nThese plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya).\nThe only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur, India. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur.\nSome textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic. These are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves, such as those of \"Gontriglossa\", \"Sagenopteris\", or \"Mexiglossa\".\nGlossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass-extinction event.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":45},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":58},{"uri":"Seed_fern","surface_form":"seed fern","offset":66},{"uri":"Coal_forest","surface_form":"coal forest","offset":110},{"uri":"Coal_swamp","surface_form":"coal swamp","offset":126},{"uri":"Pennsylvanian","surface_form":"Pennsylvanian","offset":160},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":181},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":214},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":322},{"uri":"Tropical_climate","surface_form":"tropical climate","offset":364},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":474},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":542},{"uri":"Eduard_Suess","surface_form":"Eduard Suess","offset":557},{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":636},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":653},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":864},{"uri":"Nidpur","surface_form":"Nidpur","offset":920},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":928},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":1051},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":1184},{"uri":"Permian/Triassic_extinction_event","surface_form":"end-Permian mass-extinction event","offset":1386}]}
