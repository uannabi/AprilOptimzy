There are other smaller towns, some by the sea, like Weymouth, Swanage, West Bay, the Isle of Portland, Dorchester, Wareham, Lyme Regis, Blandford and Wool.\nDorset is next to Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.\nThere is a lot of countryside in Dorset, so there are quite a few farmers. Other people work in offices, shops or the holiday business. There are not many factories or industry in Dorset.\nPeople come on holiday to Dorset because the countryside and sea is peaceful and pretty, and there are not many big towns and no cities at all. Bournemouth, Poole, Weymouth, Swanage and Lyme Regis are quite famous seaside towns, where most holidaymakers go when they come to Dorset.\nThe Dorset coast is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Jurassic Coast. This includes famous fossil sites where Mary Anning collected, and famous landforms such as Chesil Beach.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":28},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":52},{"uri":"Bournemouth","surface_form":"Bournemouth","offset":85},{"uri":"Poole","surface_form":"Poole","offset":101},{"uri":"Weymouth","surface_form":"Weymouth","offset":161},{"uri":"Swanage","surface_form":"Swanage","offset":171},{"uri":"Isle_of_Portland","surface_form":"Isle of Portland","offset":194},{"uri":"Lyme_Regis","surface_form":"Lyme Regis","offset":233},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":283},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":290},{"uri":"Wiltshire","surface_form":"Wiltshire","offset":300},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":314},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":828},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":835},{"uri":"Jurassic_Coast","surface_form":"Jurassic Coast","offset":855},{"uri":"Mary_Anning","surface_form":"Mary Anning","offset":911},{"uri":"Chesil_Beach","surface_form":"Chesil Beach","offset":963}]}
