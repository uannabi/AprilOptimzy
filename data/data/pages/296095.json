{"id":296095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial_mole","text":"Description.\nThe two species of marsupial moles are rare and poorly understood burrowing mammals of the deserts of Western Australia.\nMarsupial moles spend most of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, probably mostly after rains. They are blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin, and they have no external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under thick hair. They do not dig permanent burrows, filling the tunnel in behind them as they move.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":89},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":104},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":115},{"uri":"Vestigial_organ","surface_form":"vestigial","offset":310}]}
