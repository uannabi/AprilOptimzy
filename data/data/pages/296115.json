{"id":296115,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garret_FitzGerald","text":"Garret Desmond FitzGerald (9 February 1926 \u2013 19 May 2011) was an Irish politician who served twice as Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland, from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1982 to 1987. Elected to Seanad \u00C9ireann in 1965, and in 1969 to D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann as a Teachta D\u00E1la (TD), he served as Ireland's foreign minister from 1973 to 1977 and as leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987.\nEarly life.\nFitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, His mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent.\nHe was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD). A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer), a fellow student whom FitzGerald would marry in 1947.\nHe later qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.\nEarly political life.\nFitzGerald was eager to enter politics and, although it was suggested by several members of Fianna F\u00E1il (including Charles Haughey) that he should join them, he made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He was elected to Seanad \u00C9ireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South-East constituency.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs.\nAfter the 1973 general election, Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party, with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, however the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs.\nIreland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, with his innovative views, energy and fluency in the French language, won Ireland a status in European affairs far beyond the country's size and ensured that the first Irish presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success.\nLeader of Fine Gael.\nIn 1977, the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen by acclamation to succeed him.\nUnder FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna F\u00E1il (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna F\u00E1il was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas than Fianna F\u00E1il, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years.\nTaoiseach 1981\u201382.\nBy the time of the 1981 general election, Fine Gael won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, on 30 June 1981.\nTwo key problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the H-Block hunger strikers, two of Thomas McElwee's sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting; Mary said to the media outside that \"he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions\". FitzGerald then ordered Garda\u00ED to remove the families from the meeting.\nIn the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months, in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael\u2013Labour coalition with a working majority.\nConstitutional reform.\nAs Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society. His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws.\nA controversial Pro-Life Amendment (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the \"Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother\", was added to the Irish constitution\u2014against FitzGerald's advice\u2014in a 1983 national referendum.\nNorthern Ireland.\nFitzGerald set up the New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from Northern Ireland. It provided the incentive for the reopening of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which resulted in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.\nWhile the Agreement was rejected and criticised by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the Irish and British governments which, in time, would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and, subsequently, the republican and loyalist cease-fires.\nInfighting and declining support.\nIn January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna F\u00E1il returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election, and Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach.\nPost-Taoiseach period.\nFitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, and retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, died before him in 1999; after that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in \"The Irish Times\", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs.\nIn 2009, FitzGerald had received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to have been bought by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008.\nDeath.\nOn 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, sent his regards and called him an \"institution\". He was put on a ventilator. On 19 May he died aged 85, from pneumonia, at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":71},{"uri":"Taoiseach","surface_form":"Taoiseach","offset":102},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime
