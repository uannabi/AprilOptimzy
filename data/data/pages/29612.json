{"id":29612,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penlight","text":"A penlight is a small flashlight in the shape of a pen. A penlight usually uses a small light known as an \"LED\" (Light Emitting Diode) but it can also use a small lightbulb made just for small flashlights.\nThe LED lights up when power is run through it. Making the penlight light up is as simple as pressing a button, or screwing the end on tighter so it makes contact with the batteries.\nMost of the time, penlights use two or three AAA or AAAA batteries. AAAA are a newer, thinner type of battery, most commonly found in small electronics.\nPenlights can be made out of plastic or metal, and can be any color. They most often have a little clip, to hold it on your shirt or something.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flashlight","surface_form":"flashlight","offset":22},{"uri":"Pen","surface_form":"pen","offset":51},{"uri":"LED","surface_form":"LED","offset":107},{"uri":"Lightbulb","surface_form":"lightbulb","offset":163},{"uri":"Battery","surface_form":"batteries","offset":446},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronics","offset":529},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":571},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":582},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":604},{"uri":"Shirt","surface_form":"shirt","offset":666}]}
