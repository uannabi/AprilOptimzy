It was founded 1914 and is the oldest football club in Salzburg.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed by pupils from a nearby school. In 1914 the club was officially formed and played their first match against FC Traunstein. The first match was lost by 1:4. Nevertheless before the Second World War the SAK 1914 was the most successful football club in Salzburg. 1934, 1935 and 1937 they reached the final of the Austrian amateur championship but could not win. Edi Kainberger, Karl Kainberger, Ernst Bacher and Adolf Laudon, players of SAK, were part of the 1936 Olympic squad, where Austria reached the second place. At all they reached 3o Championships in Salzburg.\nAfter the war other clubs like SV Austria Salzburg (now Red Bull Salzburg) or SK Bischofshofen were more successful but the SAK was the first team from Salzburg which reached the highest class (1952-Staatsliga A). Also in the 1961/62 and 1980/81 season they played in the highest division. All together the SAK played nine seasons in the professional leagues. But 1988 they were relegated from the 2.Division and playing ever since that time in amateur leagues.\nThe 2007/08 season was the last in their venue, the SAK Sportanlage Nonntal. It was renovated and was now called Sportzentrum Mitte. The SAK must play together with the UFC Salzburg at this pitch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salzburg","surface_form":"Salzburg","offset":47}]}
