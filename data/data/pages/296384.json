{"id":296384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominina","text":"Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus \"Homo\".\nIf used, the group includes \"Sahelanthropus\" six to eight million years ago.\nTaxonomy.\nEven today, the genus \"Homo\" has not been properly defined.\nBecause there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define \"Homo\" when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthals brought the first addition.\nThe genus \"Homo\" was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human.\nOver the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tribe_(biology)","surface_form":"sub-tribe","offset":14},{"uri":"Hominidae","surface_form":"hominid","offset":31},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":39},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":68},{"uri":"Bipedalism","surface_form":"biped","offset":107},{"uri":"Ape","surface_form":"ape","offset":113},{"uri":"Homo","surface_form":"Homo","offset":140},{"uri":"Sahelanthropus","surface_form":"Sahelanthropus","offset":176},{"uri":"Carl_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Carl Linnaeus","offset":374},{"uri":"Neanderthals","surface_form":"Neanderthals","offset":499},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":758},{"uri":"Pliocene","surface_form":"Pliocene","offset":776}]}
