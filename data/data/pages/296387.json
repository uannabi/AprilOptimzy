During the Second Opium War (1856-60) the garden and its buildings were destroyed by the allied forces. Between 1886 and 1895 it was reconstructed by Emperor Guangxu and renamed the Summer Palace, for use by Empress Dowager Cixi. It was damaged in 1900 by the international expeditionary force during the suppression of the Boxer Rising and 24 years later, it became a public park in 1924.\nThere are many buildings in the Summer Palace including The Cloud-Dispelling Hall, the Temple of Buddhist Virtue and the Sea of Wisdom Temple.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":46},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":55},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":239},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":246}]}
