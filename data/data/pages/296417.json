Cyrus described it as a \"total dance track\" with a cool idea. Cyrus' \"Who Owns My Heart\" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, \"Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?\" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of \"Who Owns My Heart\" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hots pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing ontop of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up.\n\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988.
