{"id":296433,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Turner_(artist)","text":"George Turner (2 April 1841 \u2013 29 Mar 1910) was an English landscape artist and farmer. He was also called \"Derbyshire's John Constable\".\nLife and work.\nTurner was born in Cromford, Derbyshire in England, then moved to Derby with his family. His father Thomas Turner was a tailer and favoured art works, so he adviced his son to learn art and music. Turner made progress mainly by himself, and became a professional painter and art teacher.\nTurner lived in Derbyshire all his life. In 1865 he married Eliza Lakin (1837 - 1900), and worked as a part-time farmer raising four children at Walnut farm in Barrow upon Trent.\nAfter Eliza's death in 1900, he moved to Kirk Ireton and later married fellow artist Kate Stevens Smith (1871-1964) - they set up home in Idridgehay, and he died there in 1910. His son William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) also became a famous landscape oil painter.\nMost of Turner's paintings are of Derbyshire where he lived. They show old English countryside before the coming of modernization. His work was exhibited in Nottingham and Birmingham. Turner was a member of the Art Committee of Derby Art Gallery and the city has both his and his son's paintings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":50},{"uri":"Landscape_painting","surface_form":"landscape artist","offset":58},{"uri":"John_Constable","surface_form":"John Constable","offset":120},{"uri":"Cromford","surface_form":"Cromford","offset":171},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":181},{"uri":"Derby","surface_form":"Derby","offset":218},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":456},{"uri":"Barrow_upon_Trent","surface_form":"Barrow upon Trent","offset":600},{"uri":"Kirk_Ireton","surface_form":"Kirk Ireton","offset":660},{"uri":"Idridgehay","surface_form":"Idridgehay","offset":757},{"uri":"William_Lakin_Turner","surface_form":"William Lakin Turner","offset":804},{"uri":"Nottingham","surface_form":"Nottingham","offset":1038},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":1053},{"uri":"Derby_Museum_and_Art_Gallery","surface_form":"Derby Art Gallery","offset":1109}]}
