Its coastline is long and highest altitude is.\nWildlife and its protection.\nBecause of its isolation from mainland Australia, foxes and rabbits are not there. People are forbidden to bring them into the island. Registration and microchipping of cats is complulsory.\nThe Kangaroo Island kangaroo, Rosenberg's sand goanna, southern brown bandicoot, Tammar wallaby, common brushtail possum, short-beaked Echidna and New Zealand fur seal are native to the island, as well as six bat and frog species. The sole endemic (found nowhere else) vertebrate species is a small marsupial carnivore called the Kangaroo Island dunnart. The koala, common ringtail possum and \"Platypus\" have been introduced and still survive there. Kangaroo Island had a native species of emu, the Kangaroo Island emu which became extinct between 1802 and official European settlement in 1836. Perhaps this was caused by bushfires or hunting by sealers or whalers.\nThe introduced koalas have flourished so well on the island that their preferred food source, the manna gum tree, is at risk of local extinction. Koalas have recently been forced to turn to other, less tasty, plants. Park Management has been searching for a solution.\nTourism.\nThe island is a major tourist attraction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":19},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":45},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":58},{"uri":"Melville_Island%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Melville Island","offset":71},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":107},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":132},{"uri":"Cape_Jervis%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Cape Jervis","offset":207},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":406},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":416},{"uri":"Forbidden","surface_form":"forbidden","offset":450},{"uri":"Western_grey_kangaroo","surface_form":"Kangaroo Island kangaroo","offset":550},{"uri":"Rosenberg%27s_sand_goanna","surface_form":"Rosenberg's sand goanna","offset":576},{"uri":"Southern_brown_bandicoot","surface_form":"southern brown bandicoot","offset":601},{"uri":"Tammar_wallaby","surface_form":"Tammar wallaby","offset":627},{"uri":"Common_brushtail_possum","surface_form":"common brushtail possum","offset":643},{"uri":"Short-beaked_Echidna","surface_form":"short-beaked Echidna","offset":668},{"uri":"New_Zealand_fur_seal","surface_form":"New Zealand fur seal","offset":693},{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":755},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":763},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":786},{"uri":"Kangaroo_Island_dunnart","surface_form":"Kangaroo Island dunnart","offset":876},{"uri":"Koala","surface_form":"koala","offset":905},{"uri":"Common_ringtail_possum","surface_form":"common ringtail possum","offset":912},{"uri":"Platypus","surface_form":"Platypus","offset":940},{"uri":"Emu","surface_form":"emu","offset":1036},{"uri":"Kangaroo_Island_emu","surface_form":"Kangaroo Island emu","offset":1045},{"uri":"Bushfire","surface_form":"bushfire","offset":1168},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":1181},{"uri":"Koalas","surface_form":"koalas","offset":1227},{"uri":"Manna_gum","surface_form":"manna gum","offset":1310}]}
