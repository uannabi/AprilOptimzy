{"id":29668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek","text":"e=\"preserve\"> Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek (born Hukvaldy, Moravia, July 3 1854; died Moravsk\u00E1 Ostrava, August 12 1928) was a Czech composer who lived at the end of the Romantic period and the beginning of the 20th century. He wanted his music to sound typical of his country. The rhythm of Jan\u00E1\u010Dek\u2019s music sounds like the rhythm of the dialect he spoke. This was quite close to Polish. Jan\u00E1\u010Dek is famous for his operas which are all based on Czech stories. \"The Cunning Little Vixen\" is especially charming. It is about animals in a forest (a \u201Cvixen\u201D is a female fox).\nMost of his greatest works were written towards the end of his life. At this time he was in love with a young woman called Kamila. She was the inspiration for many of his last compositions.\nHis youth.\nJan\u00E1\u010Dek\u2019s family were poor people who lived in the countryside in Moravia. His grandfather and his father were both musicians and school teachers. Leo\u0161 was the fifth of nine children. As the tiny house was so crowded he was sent to Brno when he was eleven. There he went to a choir school, but soon the choir had to stop. He continued his music education there. After his final exams he had an unpaid job as teacher for two years. He became conductor of a monastery choir as well as a male-voice choir called Svatopluk. He made them a better choir and wrote music for them. He studied at the Prague Organ School for a year, but he was very poor and could not afford to go to concerts. He continued to conduct choirs and became friends with Dvo\u0159\u00E1k. He spent a short time in Leipzig and Vienna.\nEarly career.\nWhen he returned to Brno he became engaged to his piano pupil Zdenka Schulzov\u00E1 who was only 14. She was still under 16 when they married. Jan\u00E1\u010Dek founded (started) an organ school in Brno. He was the director of this school. He also taught music at the Old Brno Gymnasium. His marriage was unhappy and, although they remained married all his life, they spent a lot of time separated. He went on a journey to northern Moravia to collect folk songs which he used in some of his dances for orchestra.\nJan\u00E1\u010Dek\u2019s spent several years writing his opera \"Jen\u016Ffa\". By the time he was finishing it his daughter had died. Some of his sadness can be felt in the opera. He also worked on a system of speech-melody (making his melodies sound like the rhythm of his language) which was to influence his operas for the rest of his life. \"Jen\u016Ffa\" was very successful when it was first performed in 1904. By this time Jan\u00E1\u010Dek was already 50.\nMiddle career.\nJan\u00E1\u010Dek was now doing less teaching and concentrating on organizing the Brno Organ School which had moved into a new building because it now had 70 students. His next opera was called \"Osud\" (\"Fate\"), but it was not performed during his lifetime. The music is very good but the libretto (words) were poor. This is also true of his next opera: \"Mr Brou\u010Dek\u2019s excursion to the moon\". He wrote chamber music during this period, as well as some very good choral music.\nWhen World War I broke out Jan\u00E1\u010Dek was 60. He was well known in Moravia, but hardly known in other countries. His compositions from the war years include \"Taras Bulba\" which is a work for orchestra which describes a story by the Russian writer Gogol. He wrote a short, patriotic opera to follow Mr Brou\u010Dek\u2019s adventures. It was about a landlord from Prague who finds himself in the middle of the 15th century Hussite wars.\nHis final years (1916-1928).\nIn his final years Jan\u00E1\u010Dek wrote most of the great works for which he is world-famous. His opera \"Jen\u016Ffa\" was performed in Prague. This made him internationally famous. He was very proud when his country became independent after the war. He was also very happy because he was in love with Kamila St\u00F6sslov\u00E1, who was 38 years younger than himself. He wrote three of his finest operas: \"Katya Kabanov\u00E1\", \"The Cunning Little Vixen\" and \"The Makropulos Affair\". These operas were performed in Brno and then in Prague, and they were also published. He wrote two string quartets and a wind sextet: \"Ml\u00E1di\" (\"Youth\"). By the time he was 70 he had retired from the Brno Organ School. In 1926 he wrote an orchestral work: \"Sinfonietta\", followed by a piano concerto for the left hand (pianist just playing with the left hand) and chamber ensemble, and the \"Glagolitic Mass\". All these works had enormous success in Czechoslovakia as well as abroad, even as far away as New York.\nIn 1921 he had bought a cottage in his birthplace, Hukvaldy. He spent a lot of time composing there, away from the busy life in Brno. In the summer of 1928 he went there and was joined, for the first time in Hukvaldy, by Kamila, her 11-year-old boy and her husband. He was working on the third act of his last opera \"From the House of the Dead\". One day Kamila\u2019s son got lost in the forest. They spent some time looking for him. Jan\u00E1\u010Dek got cold, he caught pneumonia and died. His funeral in Brno was a large public event, at which some music from his opera \"The Cunning Little Vixen\" was performed.\nHis musical style.\nJan\u00E1\u010Dek grew up in the middle of the Romantic period, but most of his best music was written in 1920s, by which time musical styles had changed. Although he never wrote music which sounded as modern as that of Stravinsky or Schoenberg his music is Romantic, combined with Moravian folksong and sometimes with ideas from French impressionist composers such as Debussy. The music he wrote for choirs often continued in his operas. His music for instruments often started as programmatic, although a lot of it can be enjoyed without knowing the story it tells. He learned to write operas by learning from the operas of Smetana, but he made many changes such as shortening the duets and ensembles and using folksong in his melodies.\nJan\u00E1\u010Dek was not just important as a composer, but is remembered for his studies of folk music, and as a music theorist and teacher.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moravia","surface_form":"Moravia","offset":43},{"uri":"July_3","surface_form":"July 3","offset":52},{"uri":"1854","surface_form":"1854","offset":59},{"uri":"August_12","surface_form":"August 12","offset":88},{"uri":"1928","surface_form":"1928","offset":98},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":110},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":116},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":153},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":194},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":265},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":321},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":363},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":397},{"uri":"The_Cunning_Little_Vixen","surface_form":"The Cunning Little Vixen","offset":443},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":505},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":518},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":548},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":871},{"uri":"Brno","surface_form":"Brno","offset":987},{"uri":"Conductor_(music)","surface_form":"conductor","offset":1196},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":1211},{"uri":"Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k","surface_form":"Dvo\u0159\u00E1k","offset":1495},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":1528},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":1540},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":1839},{"uri":"Jen%C5%AFfa","surface_form":"Jen\u016Ffa","offset":2109},{"uri":"1904","surface_form":"1904","offset":2443},{"uri":"Fate_(opera)","surface_form":"Osud","offset":2686},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":2779},{"uri":"Mr_Brou%C4%8Dek%E2%80%99s_excursion_to_the_moon","surface_form":"Mr Brou\u010Dek\u2019s excursion to the moon","offset":2845},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber music","offset":2891},{"uri":"Choral","surface_form":"choral","offset":2951},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":2970},{"uri":"Moravia","surface_form":"Moravia","offset":3029},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":3194},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":3202},{"uri":"Gogol","surface_form":"Gogol","offset":3209},{"uri":"Patriotic","surface_form":"patriotic","offset":3234},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th century","offset":3360},{"uri":"Jan_Hus","surface_form":"Hussite","offset":3373},{"uri":"Jen%C5%AFfa","surface_form":"Jen\u016Ffa","offset":3514},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":3539},{"uri":"String_quartet","surface_form":"string quartet","offset":3972},{"uri":"Wind_instrument","surface_form":"wind","offset":3994},{"uri":"Musical_groups","surface_form":"sextet","offset":3999},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":4094},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":4157},{"uri":"Concerto","surface_form":"concerto","offset":4163},{"uri":"Chamber_ensemble","surface_form":"chamber ensemble","offset":4236},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":4321},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":4375},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":4388},{"uri":"Cottage","surface_form":"cottage","offset":4409},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":4842},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":5041},{"uri":"1920s","surface_form":"1920s","offset":5100},{"uri":"Stravinsky","surface_form":"Stravinsky","offset":5214},{"uri":"Schoenberg","surface_form":"Schoenberg","offset":5228},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":5324},{"uri":"Impressionist","surface_form":"impressionist","offset":5331},{"uri":"Debussy","surface_form":"Debussy","offset":5363},{"uri":"Programme_music","surface_form":"programmatic","offset":5476},{"uri":"Smetana","surface_form":"Smetana","offset":5620},{"uri":"Music_theorist","surface_form":"music theorist","offset":5837}]}
