{"id":296712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption","text":"=\"preserve\">Absorption is a condition in which something takes in another substance. It is a physical or chemical phenomenon or process, in which atoms, molecules, or ions enter in the inner part (called \"bulk\") of a gas, liquid, or solid material.\nThis is a different process from adsorption. Molecules undergoing absorption are going deep into the volume of the material, instead in the case of adsorption molecules stop at the surface of the material. A more general term is \"sorption\", which covers absorption, adsorption, and ion exchange.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":114},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":128},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":146},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":153},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":167},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":217},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":222},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":233},{"uri":"Adsorption","surface_form":"adsorption","offset":282},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":350},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":430},{"uri":"Sorption","surface_form":"sorption","offset":479},{"uri":"Adsorption","surface_form":"adsorption","offset":515},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":531}]}
