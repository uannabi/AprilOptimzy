Married to the then King of Naples, at the death of her brother in law Ferdinand VI of Spain, she became the queen of Spain.

She was also one of the shortest reigning queen consorts in Spanish history.\nBiography.\nShe was born at Dresden Castle in Dresden and was the eldest surviving the daughter of Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and Maria Josepha of Austria. She was one of 15 children and was baptised with the names Maria Amalia Christina Franziska Xaveria Flora Walburga.\nMarriage.\nIn 1737 Maria Amalia became engaged to the King of Naples and Sicily, the future Charles III of Spain. The marriage was confirmed on 31 October 1737. The following year, 1738, at the age of 14, Maria Amalia married King Charles, on 19 June at Gaeta, a proxy wedding having taken place in May the same year with her brother, Frederick Christian of Saxony representing Charles.\nQueen of Naples.\nThe couple resided in Naples and were very content. This marriage was looked upon favourably by the Holy See and effectively meant the conclusion of the diplomatic disagreement Charles and the See had had. Festivities lasted till 3 July. Maria Amalia was a very cultivated woman and played an important role in the construction of the Caserta Palace as well as the Palace of Portici, Teatro di San Carlo, Palace of Capodimonte as well as the Royal Palace of Naples.

He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Od\u00F3n where he died on 10 August 1759. Charles was thus proclaimed the King of Spain under the name of Charles III and adicated as King of Naples as he could not join the three kingdoms of Spain, Naples and Sicily.\nThat same year they left Naples for Madrid, leaving two of their children behind in Caserta. Her third son became Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, while his elder brother Infante Charles was groomed in Spain to inherit the Spanish crown.
