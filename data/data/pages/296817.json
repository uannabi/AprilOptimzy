{"id":296817,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range","text":"In statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) is a number that indicates how spread out the data are, and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores.\nThat is, it is calculated as the range of the middle half of the scores. The scores are divided into four equal parts, separated by the quartiles formula_1 and formula_1, after the scores have been arranged in ascending order (becoming bigger as one goes further). The second quartile formula_1 is also known as the median.\nThe interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers (scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores). In fact, it eliminates them.\nExample.\nIf the observation 29 has accidentally been written down as 92 instead, then this number is an outlier. Notice that the interquartile range is not affected in that case.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":3},{"uri":"Quartile","surface_form":"quartile","offset":302},{"uri":"Median","surface_form":"median","offset":482}]}
