That program is run by the Social Security Administration. The original Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. The current version of the Act, as amended, involves many social welfare and social insurance programs.\nSocial Security gets its money through payroll taxes. Those taxes are called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Almost all salaried income, up to an certain amount set by law (see tax rate table below), is taxed by the Social Security payroll tax. All income over the set amount is not taxed. In 2019, the maximum amount of taxable money is $132,900.\nIn 2017, Social Security spent $806.7 billion for OASDI and $145.8 billion for DI.\nHistory.\nA limited form of the Social Security program started during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term. It started using \"social insurance\" to help during the Great Depression of the 1930s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":21},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"federal","offset":72},{"uri":"Social_Security_Administration","surface_form":"Social Security Administration","offset":169},{"uri":"Social_Security_Act","surface_form":"Social Security Act","offset":214},{"uri":"President_Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"President Franklin D.
