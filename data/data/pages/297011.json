{"id":297011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula","text":"Eyre Peninsula is a triangle shaped peninsula in South Australia. On the east is Spencer Gulf, and on the west is the Great Australian Bight. Its north boundary is the Gawler Ranges. It is named after explorer Edward John Eyre who explored some of it in 1839-1841. The coastline was first explored by Matthew Flinders in 1801-1802. The west coast was also visited by Nicolas Baudin at around the same time.\nOverview.\nThe peninsula was explored by John Charles Darke in 1844, who was killed by local Aborigines on his return to Port Lincoln.\nThe main towns are Port Lincoln on the southern point, Whyalla and Port Augusta at the north east, and Ceduna at the northwest. They are joined by the Eyre Highway across the inland edge, and the Flinders Highway and Lincoln Highway along the west and east coasts.\nThe major industry is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the dry north area. More water-intensive farming such as dairy farming and growing wine industry happen in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing. Port Lincoln had a large tuna fishing fleet, which is now changing to fish farming in bays along the coast. The Eyre Peninsula has a growing population of around 55,390 people.\nThere is a commercial nephrite jade mine near Cowell. Iron ore is mined in the hills near Iron Knob and taken by rail to Whyalla for smelting.\nNational Parks located on the Eyre Peninsula include Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park, Gawler Ranges National Park, and several conservation parks and reserves like Acraman Creek Conservation Park.\nIn January 2005, bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula killed nine people.\nTransport.\nThe peninsular is served by the isolated narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":36},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":49},{"uri":"Spencer_Gulf","surface_form":"Spencer Gulf","offset":81},{"uri":"Great_Australian_Bight","surface_form":"Great Australian Bight","offset":118},{"uri":"Gawler_Ranges","surface_form":"Gawler Ranges","offset":168},{"uri":"Edward_John_Eyre","surface_form":"Edward John Eyre","offset":210},{"uri":"Matthew_Flinders","surface_form":"Matthew Flinders","offset":301},{"uri":"Nicolas_Baudin","surface_form":"Nicolas Baudin","offset":367},{"uri":"John_Charles_Darke","surface_form":"John Charles Darke","offset":447},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australian","surface_form":"Aborigines","offset":499},{"uri":"Port_Lincoln%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Port Lincoln","offset":560},{"uri":"Whyalla%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Whyalla","offset":596},{"uri":"Port_Augusta%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Port Augusta","offset":608},{"uri":"Ceduna%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Ceduna","offset":644},{"uri":"Eyre_Highway","surface_form":"Eyre Highway","offset":692},{"uri":"Flinders_Highway%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Flinders Highway","offset":737},{"uri":"Lincoln_Highway_(Australia)","surface_form":"Lincoln Highway","offset":758},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":828},{"uri":"Cereal_crops","surface_form":"cereal crops","offset":838},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":852},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":863},{"uri":"Dairy_farming","surface_form":"dairy farming","offset":930},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":956},{"uri":"Tuna","surface_form":"tuna","offset":1060},{"uri":"Fish_farming","surface_form":"fish farming","offset":1105},{"uri":"Nephrite","surface_form":"nephrite","offset":1234},{"uri":"Jade","surface_form":"jade","offset":1243},{"uri":"Cowell%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Cowell","offset":1258},{"uri":"Iron_ore","surface_form":"Iron ore","offset":1266},{"uri":"Iron_Knob","surface_form":"Iron Knob","offset":1302},{"uri":"Smelting","surface_form":"smelting","offset":1345},{"uri":"Lincoln_National_Park","surface_form":"Lincoln National Park","offset":1408},{"uri":"Coffin_Bay_National_Park","surface_form":"Coffin Bay National Park","offset":1431},{"uri":"Gawler_Ranges_National_Park","surface_form":"Gawler Ranges National Park","offset":1457},{"uri":"Acraman_Creek_Conservation_Park","surface_form":"Acraman Creek Conservation Park","offset":1535},{"uri":"Bushfire","surface_form":"bushfire","offset":1585},{"uri":"Narrow_gauge","surface_form":"narrow gauge","offset":1689},{"uri":"Eyre_Peninsula_Railway","surface_form":"Eyre Peninsula Railway","offset":1702}]}
