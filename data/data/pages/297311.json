It is the earliest animal found with fur.\n\"Castorocauda\" is one of the near-mammals in a group called the Docodonta.\nAlthough \"Castorocauda\" was not a crown group mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a \"small nocturnal insectivore\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":21},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":56},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":83},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":133},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":153},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":161},{"uri":"Daohugou_Beds","surface_form":"Daohugou Beds","offset":178},{"uri":"Inner_Mongolia","surface_form":"Inner Mongolia","offset":195},{"uri":"Adaptations","surface_form":"adaptations","offset":255},{"uri":"Beaver","surface_form":"beaver","offset":317},{"uri":"Otter","surface_form":"otter","offset":326},{"uri":"Platypus","surface_form":"platypus","offset":342},{"uri":"Convergent_evolution","surface_form":"convergent evolution","offset":352},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":412},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":451},{"uri":"Docodonta","surface_form":"Docodonta","offset":481},{"uri":"Crown_group","surface_form":"crown group","offset":526}]}
