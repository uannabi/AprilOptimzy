{"id":297364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethou","text":"Jethou is a small island that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is privately leased, and not open to the public.\nIt is immediately south of Herm and has an area of approximately 44\u00A0acres (18 ha).\nHistory.\nIt is said that in AD 709 a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Herm.\nThe island's name contains the \"-hou\" suffix, which means \"a small island\".\nIn 1416, it became part of Henry V of England's estate. It is still a Crown lease, and is owned by the States of Guernsey.\nModern history.\nFrom 1920 to 1923 it was leased by Compton MacKenzie along with Herm and remained part of that estate for years, although it is currently part of a different one.\nThe British 1957 musical \"Free as Air\" by Dorothy Reynolds & Julian Slade was set on the fictitious island of 'Terhou', which was based on Jethou.\nOn the top is a marker. It is said that in earlier times, pirates were hanged on it with chains, like nearby Crevichon.\nFrom September 1964 until December 1971 the island was occupied by the Faed family consisting of Mr Angus Faed, his wife Susan Faed and their four children, Colin, Erik, Colette and Amanda. Mrs. Susan Faed was the 22nd tenant of Jethou.\nIt is flanked by two islets, Crevichon to the north and Fauconniere to the south. There is one house on the island and two cottages as well as a large garage where vehicles such as quad bikes and tractors are stored.\nIt is now leased by Sir Peter Ogden of IT company Computacenter.\nPolitics.\nUnlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick, Jethou cannot pass its own laws. It is administered by the States of Guernsey, and elects members to the States of Deliberation as part of the St. Peter Port South electoral district.\nWildlife.\nAt the east of Jethou, puffins can be seen swimming off the rocks.\nThey also nest there in the east clifftop.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bailiwick_of_Guernsey","surface_form":"Bailiwick of Guernsey","offset":45},{"uri":"Channel_Islands","surface_form":"Channel Islands","offset":74},{"uri":"Lease","surface_form":"lease","offset":107},{"uri":"Herm","surface_form":"Herm","offset":170},{"uri":"-hou","surface_form":"-hou","offset":369},{"uri":"Henry_V_of_England","surface_form":"Henry V of England","offset":440},{"uri":"Guernsey","surface_form":"Guernsey","offset":526},{"uri":"Compton_MacKenzie","surface_form":"Compton MacKenzie","offset":587},{"uri":"Herm","surface_form":"Herm","offset":616},{"uri":"Free_as_Air","surface_form":"Free as Air","offset":741},{"uri":"Dorothy_Reynolds","surface_form":"Dorothy Reynolds","offset":757},{"uri":"Julian_Slade","surface_form":"Julian Slade","offset":776},{"uri":"Crevichon","surface_form":"Crevichon","offset":971},{"uri":"Islet","surface_form":"islet","offset":1240},{"uri":"Crevichon","surface_form":"Crevichon","offset":1248},{"uri":"Fauconniere","surface_form":"Fauconniere","offset":1275},{"uri":"Quad_bike","surface_form":"quad bike","offset":1400},{"uri":"Tractor","surface_form":"tractor","offset":1415},{"uri":"Peter_Ogden","surface_form":"Peter Ogden","offset":1460},{"uri":"Computacenter","surface_form":"Computacenter","offset":1486},{"uri":"Sark","surface_form":"Sark","offset":1552},{"uri":"Alderney","surface_form":"Alderney","offset":1561},{"uri":"States_of_Deliberation","surface_form":"States of Deliberation","offset":1697},{"uri":"Atlantic_Puffin","surface_form":"puffins","offset":1809}]}
