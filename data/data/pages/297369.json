{"id":297369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-hou","text":"-hou is a suffix (part added to the end of a word) found in many Channel Islands and Norman names. It is the Norman language version of the Old Norse \"holmr\", meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as \"holm\". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm.\nThe Norman \"hommet/houmet\" also comes from this suffix.\nIn Parisian French, the equivalent is \"\u00EElot\", which is the same as the English \"islet\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Channel_Islands","surface_form":"Channel Islands","offset":65},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Norman","offset":85},{"uri":"Norman_language","surface_form":"Norman language","offset":109},{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":140},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"Parisian French","offset":362}]}
