It is not an SI unit. The SI unit of area is the square metre.\nThe term derives from Latin \"virga\" (rod). Compare French \"verge\" (yard).\nIn the Channel Islands, it is a standard measure of land, but the statutory definition differs between the bailiwicks.\nIn France a verg\u00E9e was 12,100 square Paris feet (1,276.8 m\u00B2). It was 25 (square) perches.
