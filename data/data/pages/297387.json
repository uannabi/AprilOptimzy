A herd of wild Fallow deer have lived in the park since the seventeenth century. The English name (\"Phoenix\") comes from the Irish \"fionn uisce\" meaning \"clear water\".\nHistory.\nA Royal Hunting Park was created in 1662 by the English Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time, Lord Ormonde. The park contained pheasants and wild deer, and a wall was built around the whole area to stop them escaping. The Park originally included more land which was to the south of the River Liffey. But when they started to build the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham in 1680, the Park was made smaller to the size it is today. It was opened to the people of Dublin by Lord Chesterfield in 1745.\nTwo people were killed in the park on 6 May 1882. This became known as the Phoenix Park Murders.\n\u00C1ras an Uachtar\u00E1in.\n\"\u00C1ras an Uachtar\u00E1in\" is Irish for \"the house of the President\". The President of Ireland lives here.

Lord Chesterfield had it made in 1747.\nThe \"Papal Cross\" is a large cross that was placed in the park for the visit of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979.
