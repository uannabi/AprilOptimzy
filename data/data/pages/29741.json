{"id":29741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language","text":"Turkish (\"T\u00FCrk\u00E7e\") is a language spoken in Turkey, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Greece and other countries of the former Ottoman Empire as well as by several million ethnic Turkish immigrants in Europe.\nTurkish is a Turkic language and is believed to be an Altaic language. Like Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian, Turkish uses vowel harmony. Word order is usually subject-object-verb.\nTurkish used to be written with the Arabic alphabet from about 900 to 1928. However, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00FCrk changed it to the Latin alphabet. The Turkish government justified the move as making it much easier to learn to increasing literacy. The literacy rate indeed increased greatly after the reform, from around 10.5% (in 1927) to over 90% (today). However, some say that the move was also to distance the country from the Ottoman Empire, whose documents can no longer be read except by a few scholars.\nTurkish is a majority language in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but it has a distinct dialect. It can be known as Cypriot Turkish.\nThe Latin alphabet was made to reflect the actual sounds of spoken Turkish, rather than simply transcribing the old Ottoman script into a new form. The Turkish alphabet has 29 letters, seven of which (\u00C7, \u011E, I, \u0130, \u00D6, \u015E, and \u00DC) have been modified from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language. It represents modern Turkish pronunciation with a high degree of accuracy and specificity. It is the current official alphabet and the latest in a series of distinct alphabets used in different eras.\nTurkish is most closely related to other Turkic languages, including Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Uzbek and Kazakh. Another theory is that it is one of the many Altaic languages, which also include Japanese, Mongolian, and Korean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":24},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":43},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":51},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":59},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":69},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":110},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":184},{"uri":"Turkic_language","surface_form":"Turkic language","offset":205},{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic language","offset":246},{"uri":"Finnish_language","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":268},{"uri":"Estonian_language","surface_form":"Estonian","offset":277},{"uri":"Hungarian_language","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":290},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic alphabet","offset":408},{"uri":"Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk","surface_form":"Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00FCrk","offset":457},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":497},{"uri":"Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus","surface_form":"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus","offset":915},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic languages","offset":1578},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_language","surface_form":"Azerbaijani","offset":1606},{"uri":"Turkmen_language","surface_form":"Turkmen","offset":1619},{"uri":"Uzbek_language","surface_form":"Uzbek","offset":1628},{"uri":"Kazakh_language","surface_form":"Kazakh","offset":1638},{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic languages","offset":1691},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1728},{"uri":"Mongolian_language","surface_form":"Mongolian","offset":1738},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":1753}]}
