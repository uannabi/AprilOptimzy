{"id":29752,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_X_of_Sweden","text":"Eric X of Sweden (Erik Knutsson, c. 1180 - April 10, 1216) was the King of Sweden between 1208 and 1216.\nErik was the son of King Knut Eriksson of Sweden, but his mother is now unknown. In 1205 he escaped from the Battle of \u00C4lgar\u00E5s, where his three brothers were killed. He stayed for three years with family in Norway. He returned to Sweden in 1208 and defeated Sverker II of Sweden in the battle of Lena. He was married in 1210 to Rikissa of Denmark, the daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark and Sophia of Novgorod.\nEric was elected king, but the coronation took place only in November 1210, after the Battle of Gestilren where he again defeated and killed Sverker II. Sverker had attempted to regain the throne. King Erik's coronation is the earliest known coronation in Sweden. It was carried out by the bishop Valerius, a former supporter of King Sverker II.\nIn 1216, Pope Innocent III agreed that King Erik was King of Sweden, and also any other pagan lands he captured, probably Finland. Previously, Innocent III had supported Sverker II. Very little is known about King Erik's reign, but it is said that the crops were good while he was king.\nErik died of a fever in 1216 at Nas Castle in Visings\u00F6. He is buried in the Varnhems Church.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1180","surface_form":"1180","offset":36},{"uri":"1216","surface_form":"1216","offset":53},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":67},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":75},{"uri":"1208","surface_form":"1208","offset":90},{"uri":"1216","surface_form":"1216","offset":99},{"uri":"Knut_Eriksson","surface_form":"Knut Eriksson","offset":130},{"uri":"Battle_of_%C3%84lgar%C3%A5s","surface_form":"Battle of \u00C4lgar\u00E5s","offset":214},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":312},{"uri":"Sverker_II_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Sverker II of Sweden","offset":363},{"uri":"Battle_of_Lena","surface_form":"battle of Lena","offset":391},{"uri":"Rikissa_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Rikissa of Denmark","offset":433},{"uri":"Valdemar_I_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Valdemar I of Denmark","offset":469},{"uri":"Sophia_of_Novgorod","surface_form":"Sophia of Novgorod","offset":495},{"uri":"Battle_of_Gestilren","surface_form":"Battle of Gestilren","offset":601},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":805},{"uri":"Valerius","surface_form":"Valerius","offset":812},{"uri":"Innocent_III","surface_form":"Innocent III","offset":875},{"uri":"Pagan","surface_form":"pagan","offset":949},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":983},{"uri":"Innocent_III","surface_form":"Innocent III","offset":1004},{"uri":"1216","surface_form":"1216","offset":1172},{"uri":"Nas_Castle","surface_form":"Nas Castle","offset":1180},{"uri":"Visings%C3%B6","surface_form":"Visings\u00F6","offset":1194},{"uri":"Varnhems_Church","surface_form":"Varnhems Church","offset":1224}]}
