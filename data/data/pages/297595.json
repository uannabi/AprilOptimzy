{"id":297595,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hospital_Kilmainham","text":"The Royal Hospital Kilmainham is a 17th-century building in Kilmainham, Dublin, Ireland. It was built to be a home for retired soldiers. It was used as a home for over 250 years.\nThe hospital was built between 1680 and 1684 by architect Sir William Robinson. He was the official State Surveyor General for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to King Charles II.\nThe style is based on Les Invalides in Paris. The Royal Hospital Chelsea in Chelsea, London was completed two years later and looks alike in style.\nThe Tudor Gothic gateway at the end of the road leading to the Royal Hospital was designed by Francis Johnston. He was one of the leading architects of the day. This gateway originally stood beside the River Liffey at Bloody Bridge (now Rory O'More Bridge). It was moved after the arrival of the railway in 1844.\nWhen the Irish Free State was formed, they thought about using the building for the Oireachtas \u00C9ireann, the new Irish national parliament. This did not happen. After the soldiers were all gone, the buildings were used for different things like offices for the Garda S\u00EDoch\u00E1na (the Irish police force) and as storage for the National Museum of Ireland.\nThe Government of Ireland restored the buildings in different stages from 1957, and opened in 1985 as the National Centre for Culture and the Arts. In 1991 the Irish Museum of Modern Art was opened here.\nEvery year on the National Day of Commemoration the President of Ireland lays a wreath in the courtyard in memory of all Irishmen and Irishwomen who have died in past wars and on service with the United Nations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kilmainham","surface_form":"Kilmainham","offset":60},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":72},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":80},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":227},{"uri":"William_Robinson_(architect)","surface_form":"Sir William Robinson","offset":237},{"uri":"Surveyor_General","surface_form":"Surveyor General","offset":285},{"uri":"James_Butler%2C_1st_Duke_of_Ormonde","surface_form":"James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde","offset":306},{"uri":"Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Lord Lieutenant of Ireland","offset":344},{"uri":"Charles_II_of_England","surface_form":"King Charles II","offset":374},{"uri":"Les_Invalides","surface_form":"Les Invalides","offset":413},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":430},{"uri":"Royal_Hospital_Chelsea","surface_form":"Royal Hospital Chelsea","offset":441},{"uri":"Chelsea%2C_London","surface_form":"Chelsea, London","offset":467},{"uri":"Francis_Johnston_(architect)","surface_form":"Francis Johnston","offset":633},{"uri":"River_Liffey","surface_form":"River Liffey","offset":741},{"uri":"Rory_O%27More_Bridge","surface_form":"Rory O'More Bridge","offset":776},{"uri":"Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"Irish Free State","offset":861},{"uri":"Oireachtas","surface_form":"Oireachtas \u00C9ireann","offset":936},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":979},{"uri":"Garda_S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na","surface_form":"Garda S\u00EDoch\u00E1na","offset":1112},{"uri":"National_Museum_of_Ireland","surface_form":"National Museum of Ireland","offset":1175},{"uri":"Government_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Government of Ireland","offset":1207},{"uri":"Irish_Museum_of_Modern_Art","surface_form":"Irish Museum of Modern Art","offset":1363},{"uri":"National_Day_of_Commemoration","surface_form":"National Day of Commemoration","offset":1425},{"uri":"President_of_Ireland","surface_form":"President of Ireland","offset":1459},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1603}]}
