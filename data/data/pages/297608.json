He got his schooling at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. After that, he went on the Grand Tour of the continent. He became gentleman of the bedchamber to the Prince of Wales.\nCareer in government.\nIn 1715 he entered the House of Commons as Lord Stanhope of Shelford and member for St Germans. He left for Paris and sent the government valuable information about the Jacobite plot. In 1716 he returned to Britain and sat in the House of Commons. He liked to take part in the debates.\nHe took his seat in the House of Lords. In 1728 he was sent to the Hague as ambassador. He did a good job, and got the Order of the Garter in 1730, and the position of Lord Steward. After he did not support Walpole's Excise Bill, he was dismissed from his stewardship. He spent years opposing the ruling party in the House of Lords. First against Robert Walpole and then against King George II of England. In 1744, the \"Broad Bottom\" party, led by Chesterfield and Pitt, came into office. They ruled together with the Pelhams.\nHe was then sent to the Hague as ambassador a second time. The object of his mission was to persuade the Dutch to join in the War of the Austrian Succession. His mission was successful. When he got back to London, he was made Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland. This was a position he wanted for a long time.\nHe took the his role seriously. He established schools and manufacturing in Ireland. In politics, he found a way to work with both Protestant and Roman Catholic parties.\nHe also still took his seat in the Upper House. In 1751 he helped in making the Gregorian calendar a fact. That Act of Parliament is sometimes known as Chesterfield's Act. After he slowly became deaf, he had to stop his work in the parliament.\nHe lived for some years at the Ranger's House, Chesterfield Walk, Greenwich, London.\nHow he is remembered.\nIn politics, he is best known for the time he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. As a writer, he is best known for his \"Letters to his Son\". Those letters were not really written to be read by the general public. His widow Eugenia Stanhope first published them in 1774. \"Letters to his Godson\" was published in 1890. Both sets of letters are written with great style and knowledge.\nChesterfield County, Virginia and Chesterfield County, South Carolina in the United States were named in his honour. He also plays a role in the 1757-1758 novel \"The Virginians\" by William Makepeace Thackery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Privy_Council_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"PC","offset":49},{"uri":"Knight_of_the_Garter","surface_form":"KG","offset":52},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":97},{"uri":"Statesman","surface_form":"statesman","offset":105},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectual","offset":119},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":154},{"uri":"Trinity_Hall%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Trinity Hall, Cambridge","offset":186},{"uri":"Grand_Tour","surface_form":"Grand Tour","offset":238},{"uri":"Lord_of_the_Bedchamber","surface_form":"gentleman of the bedchamber","offset":277},{"uri":"George_II_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Prince of Wales","offset":312},{"uri":"British_House_of_Commons","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":374},{"uri":"St_Germans_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"St Germans","offset":435},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":459},{"uri":"Jacobitism","surface_form":"Jacobite","offset":520},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":661},{"uri":"The_Hague","surface_form":"the Hague","offset":700},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"ambassador","offset":713},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Garter","surface_form":"Order of the Garter","offset":756},{"uri":"Lord_Steward","surface_form":"Lord Steward","offset":805},{"uri":"Excise_Bill","surface_form":"Excise Bill","offset":854},{"uri":"Robert_Walpole","surface_form":"Robert Walpole","offset":984},{"uri":"George_II_of_England","surface_form":"George II of England","offset":1021},{"uri":"Broad_bottom_government","surface_form":"\"Broad Bottom\" party","offset":1056},{"uri":"William_Pitt%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chatham","surface_form":"Pitt","offset":1102},{"uri":"Henry_Pelham","surface_form":"Pelhams","offset":1155},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":1269},{"uri":"War_of_the_Austrian_Succession","surface_form":"War of the Austrian Succession","offset":1290},{"uri":"Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland","offset":1390},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":1597},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1612},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":1716},{"uri":"Chesterfield%27s_Act","surface_form":"Chesterfield's Act","offset":1788},{"uri":"Ranger%27s_House","surface_form":"Ranger's House","offset":1911},{"uri":"Greenwich%2C_London","surface_form":"Greenwich, London","offset":1946},{"uri":"Eugenia_Stanhope","surface_form":"Eugenia Stanhope","offset":2207},{"uri":"Chesterfield_County%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Chesterfield County, Virginia","offset":2366},{"uri":"Chesterfield_County%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Chesterfield County, South Carolina","offset":2400},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2443},{"uri":"The_Virginians","surface_form":"The Virginians","offset":2528},{"uri":"William_Makepeace_Thackery","surface_form":"William Makepeace Thackery","offset":2547}]}
