It was done to learn about European society and art. The idea was that what they learned on their travels could be used to help those that stayed at home. Italy was often the final country to visit. They would mostly travel with servants and a teacher called a \"bear-leader\".\nExample Grand Tour.\nWhich places the Grand Tour would visit changed through the years. An example would be a British tourist would go from Dover, England and crossed the English Channel to Ostend, in the Spanish Netherlands/Belgium, or Calais, or Le Havre in France.\nThere they could rent or buy a carriage and travel to Paris. Or they could make the trip by boat, traveling up the Seine to Paris, or up the Rhine to Basel.\nIn Paris, the traveler could take lessons in French, dancing, fencing, and horse riding. Paris was popular because of the language and fashion of French high society.\nFrom Paris he would go to Switzerland for a while, often to Geneva. From there the traveler would make a difficult crossing over the Alps into northern Italy.\nOnce in Italy the tourist would visit Turin, then might spend a few months in Florence. Other Grand Tourists would be in Florence to welcome him. A trip to Pisa then on to Padua, Bologna, and Venice.\nVenice was seen as the most important place for Italian architecture, and was very important place to visit.\nFrom Venice the traveler went to Rome to study the ruins of ancient Rome. Some travelers also visited Naples to study music. Naples was often the final destination before turning back.\nFrom here the traveler went north through the Alps to the German-speaking parts of Europe. From there travelers visited Holland and Flanders before returning across the Channel to England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":46},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":61},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":283},{"uri":"Bear-leader","surface_form":"bear-leader","offset":390},{"uri":"Dover%2C_Kent","surface_form":"Dover","offset":543},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":550},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":574},{"uri":"Ostend","surface_form":"Ostend","offset":593},{"uri":"Spanish_Netherlands","surface_form":"Spanish Netherlands","offset":608},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":628},{"uri":"Calais","surface_form":"Calais","offset":640},{"uri":"Le_Havre","surface_form":"Le Havre","offset":651},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":663},{"uri":"Carriage","surface_form":"carriage","offset":702},{"uri":"Seine","surface_form":"Seine","offset":786},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":812},{"uri":"Basel","surface_form":"Basel","offset":821},{"uri":"Dancing","surface_form":"dancing","offset":881},{"uri":"Fencing","surface_form":"fencing","offset":890},{"uri":"Horse_riding","surface_form":"horse riding","offset":903},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1021},{"uri":"Geneva","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":1055},{"uri":"Northern_Italy","surface_form":"northern Italy","offset":1138},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":1192},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":1232},{"uri":"Pisa","surface_form":"Pisa","offset":1310},{"uri":"Padua","surface_form":"Padua","offset":1326},{"uri":"Bologna","surface_form":"Bologna","offset":1333},{"uri":"Venice","surface_form":"Venice","offset":1346},{"uri":"Italian_architecture","surface_form":"Italian architecture","offset":1402},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1496},{"uri":"Ruins","surface_form":"ruins","offset":1514},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Rome","offset":1523},{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":1565},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German-speaking","offset":1706},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":1768},{"uri":"Flanders","surface_form":"Flanders","offset":1780}]}
