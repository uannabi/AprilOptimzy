{"id":297627,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland","text":"The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (plural: Lords Lieutenant'\") is the name of a political office (\"job\"). It was the representative of the King and head of the Irish executive (government) between 1171 and 1922. The term is always pronounced as 'Lord \"Lef\"-tenant of Ireland'.\nOther words used for this office were Judiciar in the early mediaeval period and Lord Deputy as late as the 17th century. The people in this job were often also called viceroy, from the French \"vice roi\" or deputy king.\nIn the Middle Ages some Lord Lieutenants had been Irish noblemen. After that only noblemen from Great Britain worked in this job.\nRole.\nThe King's representative had a number of different roles. He was\nThe structure of the government.\nThe Lord Lieutenant was helped to govern by the Irish Privy Council. This was a group of people chosen to be on the Council. Some inherited their seat. They usually met in the Council Chamber in Dublin Castle.\nLords Lieutenant stayed in power until the British Government/the King wanted them to leave.\nImportance of the post.\nTwo Lords Lieutenant, Lord Hartington and the Duke of Portland, went from Dublin Castle to 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain, in 1756 and 1783 respectively. At other times, the post was used to move politicians that were no longer wanted in London out of the way.\nBy the mid-to-late 19th century the post was no longer very important. The Chief Secretary for Ireland had become more important in ruling the country than the Lord Lieutenant.\nHousing.\nThe official house of the Lord Lieutenant was the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle. This was also where the Viceregal Court was based. When the Lord Lieutenant had to live in Ireland full time, this had to change. In 1781 the British government bought the former ranger's house in Phoenix Park. It was named the Viceregal Lodge. It is now known as \u00C1ras an Uachtar\u00E1in. It is the residence of the President of Ireland.\nThe Lords Lieutenant then only lived in the Castle during the Social Season (early January to St. Patrick's Day, 17 March).\nIrish attitudes.\nThe office of Lord Lieutenant, like the British government in Ireland, was generally unpopular.\nFrom the early 19th century, calls were made frequently to get rid of the office. However, the office survived right down until the end of British rule in most of Ireland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":32},{"uri":"Executive_(government)","surface_form":"executive (government)","offset":163},{"uri":"Mediaeval","surface_form":"mediaeval","offset":334},{"uri":"Lord_Deputy_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Lord Deputy","offset":355},{"uri":"Viceroy","surface_form":"viceroy","offset":442},{"uri":"Irish_Privy_Council","surface_form":"Irish Privy Council","offset":777},{"uri":"Dublin_Castle","surface_form":"Dublin Castle","offset":924},{"uri":"William_Cavendish%2C_4th_Duke_of_Devonshire","surface_form":"Lord Hartington","offset":1078},{"uri":"William_Cavendish-Bentinck%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Portland","surface_form":"Duke of Portland","offset":1102},{"uri":"Dublin_Castle","surface_form":"Dublin Castle","offset":1130},{"uri":"10_Downing_Street","surface_form":"10 Downing Street","offset":1147},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Great Britain","offset":1168},{"uri":"Dublin_Castle","surface_form":"Dublin Castle","offset":1599},{"uri":"%C3%81ras_an_Uachtar%C3%A1in","surface_form":"\u00C1ras an Uachtar\u00E1in","offset":1878},{"uri":"President_of_Ireland","surface_form":"President of Ireland","offset":1925},{"uri":"Out_of_season_(Ireland)","surface_form":"Social Season","offset":2009},{"uri":"St._Patrick%27s_Day","surface_form":"St. Patrick's Day","offset":2041}]}
