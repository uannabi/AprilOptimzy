It also has a number of Branch Registries in 4-5 major cities where cases are heard. It has a number of de jure powers which are outlined in the Constitution. Through several periods of military rule and constitutional suspensions, the court has also established itself as a \"de facto\" check on military power.\nIn addition, it has also been active as a 'watchdog' in checking political corruption and abuse of power in recent times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supreme_Court","surface_form":"Supreme Court","offset":4},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":67},{"uri":"Islamabad","surface_form":"Islamabad","offset":196},{"uri":"De_jure","surface_form":"de jure","offset":311},{"uri":"1973_Constitution_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":352}]}
