In 2003, about 17,000 people lived in K\u00F6nigslutter. K\u00F6nigslutter is twinned with Taunton in Somerset, in the southwest of England.\nK\u00F6nigslutter is on the tourist route called the German Half-Timbered House Road (\"Deutsche Fachwerkstra\u00DFe\").\nK\u00F6nigslutter proper is on the Lutter stream and developed from the village of Lutter which was first mentioned in 1150. It became a market town around 1300, then a city around 1400. In early modern times, beer brewing and Elm limestone mining and cutting have been its main industries. Tourism is also important, because of the German Half-Timbered House Road and the Dom - the monastery church built by Emperor Lothar II.\nIn 1924, the village of Oberlutter and the monastery church of K\u00F6nigslutter were incorporated as a city. The Benedictine monastery was founded near the village of Lutter in 1135 by Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II. The monastery church is known for its sculptural art and the tomb of the emperor.\nK\u00F6nigslutter is also the site for a large psychiatric hospital. The hospital, run by AWO can treat over 500 people plus outpatients and day-care therapy in the clinics in Wolfsburg and Peine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Helmstedt_(district)","surface_form":"Helmstedt","offset":49},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":60},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":74},{"uri":"Elm_(hills)","surface_form":"Elm","offset":92},{"uri":"Taunton","surface_form":"Taunton","offset":184},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":195},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":225},{"uri":"German_Half-Timbered_House_Road","surface_form":"German Half-Timbered House Road","offset":282},{"uri":"Lutter_River","surface_form":"Lutter","offset":373},{"uri":"Market_town","surface_form":"market town","offset":475},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":507},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":548},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":569},{"uri":"German_Half-Timbered_House_Road","surface_form":"German Half-Timbered House Road","offset":671},{"uri":"Benedictine","surface_form":"Benedictine","offset":875},{"uri":"Lothar_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II","offset":947},{"uri":"AWO","surface_form":"AWO","offset":1144}]}
