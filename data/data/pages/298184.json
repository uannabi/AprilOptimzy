It is at the western edge of a conurbation consisting of Camborne, Pool and Redruth.\nThe population of Camborne was 20,010 at the 2001 census. The population of the whole conurbation was 39,937, making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall.\nIt is no longer an industrial town but the Camborne and Redruth district was formerly one of the richest tin mining areas in the world. The Camborne School of Mines was founded here in the 19th century to train engineers to work in the tin mines and is still in the town. Two of the famous mines of Camborne were Dolcoath, the 'Queen of Cornish Mines' (closed 1921), once the deepest mine in the world, and South Crofty, the last working tin mine in Europe, which closed in 1998.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":27},{"uri":"Conurbation","surface_form":"conurbation","offset":93},{"uri":"Redruth","surface_form":"Redruth","offset":138},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":197}]}
