{"id":298192,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Agnes_(Cornwall)","text":"St Agnes is a large village on the north coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom, and a popular tourist destination. St Agnes is about five miles (8\u00A0km) north of Redruth and ten miles (16\u00A0km) southwest of Newquay.\nSt Agnes and the surrounding area were once reliant on the industries of fishing, farming and mining for copper and tin. Mining came to an end in the 1920s and many of these mines are still on view for any tourists.\nThe coastal area is part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and St Agnes Beacon is a local landmark.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":50},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":60},{"uri":"Redruth","surface_form":"Redruth","offset":156},{"uri":"Newquay","surface_form":"Newquay","offset":199},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":281},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":290},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":313},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":324}]}
