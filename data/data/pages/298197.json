{"id":298197,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca","text":"=\"preserve\">The cloaca is a common rear opening in land vertebrates. Through this opening, the animals expel urine and faeces, and carry out reproduction.\nThe cloaca is a primitive or 'basal' feature of tetrapods. All amphibia, all sauropsids (reptiles and birds) and even monotreme mammals possess a cloaca.\nA different method is used by therian mammals, such as marsupials and placentals. They have an anus for defecation, and another opening for urine and sexual reproduction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":56},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":109},{"uri":"Faeces","surface_form":"faeces","offset":119},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproduction","offset":141},{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"tetrapod","offset":203},{"uri":"Amphibia","surface_form":"amphibia","offset":218},{"uri":"Sauropsid","surface_form":"sauropsid","offset":232},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":244},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":257},{"uri":"Monotreme","surface_form":"monotreme","offset":273},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":283},{"uri":"Theria","surface_form":"theria","offset":339},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":364},{"uri":"Placental","surface_form":"placental","offset":379},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":404},{"uri":"Defecation","surface_form":"defecation","offset":413}]}
