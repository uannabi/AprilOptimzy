{"id":298210,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney","text":"A chimney is a structure used to ventilate hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Most chimneys are vertical, or almost vertical, to make sure that the gases flow easily, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a \"flue\". Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack is also used when talking about locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, the word funnel can be used too.\nThe Height of a chimney is really important, when higher, chimney's dispersion of pollutants will not cause too much influence on surrounding areas. Tall chimneys also allow chemicals to self-neutralize in the air before they reach the ground.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flue_gas","surface_form":"flue gas","offset":47},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoke","offset":61},{"uri":"Boiler","surface_form":"boiler","offset":74},{"uri":"Stove","surface_form":"stove","offset":82},{"uri":"Furnace","surface_form":"furnace","offset":89},{"uri":"Fireplace","surface_form":"fireplace","offset":100},{"uri":"Earth%27s_atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":125},{"uri":"Combustion","surface_form":"combustion","offset":247},{"uri":"Stack_effect","surface_form":"stack, or chimney, effect","offset":282},{"uri":"Flue","surface_form":"flue","offset":349},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":428},{"uri":"Chimney_(locomotive)","surface_form":"locomotive chimneys","offset":495},{"uri":"Funnel_(ship)","surface_form":"ship chimneys","offset":518},{"uri":"Height","surface_form":"Height","offset":570},{"uri":"Pollutants","surface_form":"pollutants","offset":648},{"uri":"Chemicals","surface_form":"chemicals","offset":740}]}
