{"id":29827,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award","text":"e=\"preserve\">An award is something given to a person or group of people to recognize that they have done something very good. Usual awards are medal, trophy, ribbon, certificate, or plaque for example. Sometimes awards are called prizes, such as the Nobel Prize.\nAwards can be given by any person or institution. Governments and militaries often give awards to their citizens for contributions they have made to the nation. This recognition can be given during the person's lifetime or even after they have died. In the United States if a military member receives a posthumous award it is generally presented to their family members or next of kin. This can include medals like the Medal of Honor; promotions to the next higher grade or naming a building or ship after them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"medal","offset":143},{"uri":"Trophy","surface_form":"trophy","offset":150},{"uri":"Ribbon","surface_form":"ribbon","offset":158},{"uri":"Certificate","surface_form":"certificate","offset":166},{"uri":"Plaque","surface_form":"plaque","offset":182},{"uri":"Prize","surface_form":"prize","offset":230},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":250},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"Government","offset":313},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"militaries","offset":329},{"uri":"Posthumous","surface_form":"posthumous","offset":566},{"uri":"Medal_of_Honor","surface_form":"Medal of Honor","offset":682}]}
