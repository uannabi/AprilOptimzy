It gets its name from Bourbon, Kentucky where most bourbon is produced. Many bourbons are made using a method called \"sour mash\" where fermentation of each new batch contains a little of the batch before to achieve a consistent quality.\nDrinks made from bourbon include Lynchburg Lemonade, Manhattan, and Old Fashioned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Whiskey","surface_form":"whiskey","offset":13},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distilled","offset":29},{"uri":"Bourbon%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Bourbon, Kentucky","offset":139},{"uri":"Lynchburg_Lemonade","surface_form":"Lynchburg Lemonade","offset":387},{"uri":"Manhattan_(cocktail)","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":407},{"uri":"Old_Fashioned","surface_form":"Old Fashioned","offset":422}]}
