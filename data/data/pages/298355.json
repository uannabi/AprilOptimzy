It is usually a blend of malt and grain whiskies, and aged in barrels ('casks') for at least three years (four years for exports).\nSingle malt scotch is made only from malted barley and no other grain, sugar, or fermentable material. They are made at the same distillery and not blended with any other scotch. Most single malt scotches are aged an average of 8 to 12 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Whisky","surface_form":"Whisky","offset":0},{"uri":"Whisky","surface_form":"whisky","offset":117},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distilled","offset":127},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":140},{"uri":"Malt","surface_form":"malt","offset":175},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":184},{"uri":"Barrel","surface_form":"barrel","offset":212},{"uri":"Barley","surface_form":"barley","offset":325},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentable","offset":362}]}
