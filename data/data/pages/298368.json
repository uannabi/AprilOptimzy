He currently plays for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played in the WHL for a combined 8 seasons with the Saskatoon Blades, Kootenay Ice, Swift Current Broncos and the Moose Jaw Warriors. He formerly played in the NHL for the Columbus Blue Jackets, Anaheim Ducks and the Vancouver Canucks. He was on the Anaheim Ducks when they won the Stanley Cup in 2007 but he did not qualify to have his name engraved on the cup. He did however get a Stanley Cup ring and a day to spend with the cup in the off-season.\nOn June 6, 2011, Rome was given a four-game suspension because of a late hit that he did on Boston's Nathan Horton during game three of the 2011 Stanley Cup finals. The hit gave Horton a concussion and he was sent to the hospital.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_27","surface_form":"September 27","offset":17},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":31},{"uri":"Nesbitt%2C_Manitoba","surface_form":"Nesbitt","offset":39},{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":48},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":63},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":72},{"uri":"Dallas_Stars","surface_form":"Dallas Stars","offset":122},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":142},{"uri":"Western_Hockey_League","surface_form":"WHL","offset":198},{"uri":"Saskatoon_Blades","surface_form":"Saskatoon Blades","offset":236},{"uri":"Kootenay_Ice","surface_form":"Kootenay Ice","offset":254},{"uri":"Swift_Current_Broncos","surface_form":"Swift Current Broncos","offset":268},{"uri":"Moose_Jaw_Warriors","surface_form":"Moose Jaw Warriors","offset":298},{"uri":"Columbus_Blue_Jackets","surface_form":"Columbus Blue Jackets","offset":356},{"uri":"Anaheim_Ducks","surface_form":"Anaheim Ducks","offset":379},{"uri":"Vancouver_Canucks","surface_form":"Vancouver Canucks","offset":401},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":466},{"uri":"Nathan_Horton","surface_form":"Nathan Horton","offset":737}]}
