{"id":298439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelford","text":"Camelford is a small town in north Cornwall, United Kingdom, in the River Camel valley northwest of Bodmin Moor. The town is about ten miles (16\u00A0km) north of Bodmin and is governed by a town council.\nLanteglos-by-Camelford is the ecclesiastical parish which includes the town. The A39 road goes through the town centre. Camelford railway station on the line to Padstow was some distance from the town and closed in 1966.\nIn July 1988, the water supply to the town and the surrounding area was contaminated when 20 tons of aluminium sulphate was poured into the wrong tank at the nearby Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor. An independent inquiry into the incident (the worst of its kind in British history) was started in 2002, and a draft report issued in January 2005, but there is still concern about long-term effects on the health of local people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":35},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":45},{"uri":"River_Camel","surface_form":"River Camel","offset":68},{"uri":"Bodmin_Moor","surface_form":"Bodmin Moor","offset":100},{"uri":"Bodmin","surface_form":"Bodmin","offset":158},{"uri":"A39_road","surface_form":"A39 road","offset":281},{"uri":"Padstow","surface_form":"Padstow","offset":361}]}
