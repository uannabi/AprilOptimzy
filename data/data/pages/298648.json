{"id":298648,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodmin_Moor","text":"Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is in size, and originally dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history.\nBodmin Moor is one of five granite plutons (underground masses of igneous rock) in Cornwall.\nThe name 'Bodmin Moor' is fairly recent, invented in 1813. It was formerly known as Fowey Moor after the River Fowey which rises within it. Since the mid 18th century Bodmin Moor has been crossed by the trunk road now known as the A30.\nGeography.\nDramatic granite tors rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall at, and Rough Tor at. Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.\nThe Moor contains about 500 farm holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies. Most of the moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and has been officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as part of Cornwall AONB.\nRivers and inland waters.\nBodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south.\nInland waters on the moor include Dozmary Pool (Cornwall's only natural inland lake) and\nthree reservoirs, Colliford Lake, Siblyback Lake and Crowdy reservoir which supply water for a large part of the county's population.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":17},{"uri":"Moorland","surface_form":"moorland","offset":25},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":50},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":192},{"uri":"River_Fowey","surface_form":"River Fowey","offset":363},{"uri":"Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest","surface_form":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","offset":987},{"uri":"Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty","surface_form":"Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty","offset":1068}]}
