{"id":298701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Blazey","text":"e=\"preserve\">St Blazey is a small town in Cornwall, United Kingdom, in the civil parish of St Blaise. The name St Blaise is also used by the town council. The population in the 2001 census was 6632.\nSt Blazey is east of St Austell. Once an important engineering centre for the local mine and railway industries, the parish is now dominated by the Eden Project.\nHistorically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish, whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined. The port of Par Harbour, which is in the parish, was built to make transporting these minerals easier. The Cornwall Minerals Railway, which had a depot and station in the town, was also used to move them.\nThe Eden Project is within the civil parish, and about from the centre of the town. The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":42},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":52},{"uri":"St_Austell","surface_form":"St Austell","offset":220},{"uri":"Eden_Project","surface_form":"Eden Project","offset":347},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":374},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":385},{"uri":"Kaolinite","surface_form":"china clay","offset":447},{"uri":"Eden_Project","surface_form":"Eden Project","offset":707},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":860}]}
