{"id":298738,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakefly","text":"The Snakeflies (Raphidioptera) are a small order of Endopterygote insects. They are closely related to the Megaloptera and Neuroptera.\nThere are about 210 living species. They are easily recognized by their small head and long 'neck', which is actually the elongated prothorax.\nThe snakefly, about 15\u00A0mm (0.6\u00A0inch) long, has two pairs of similar, net-veined wings, long antennae, and chewing mouthparts. The female lays eggs with a long ovipositor.\nLife cycle.\nThe life cycle includes egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The active and carnivorous larvae live beneath loose tree bark. The snakefly is found on every continent except Australia and may be beneficial to humans because it destroys the larvae and pupae of other insects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":43},{"uri":"Endopterygote","surface_form":"Endopterygote","offset":52},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":66},{"uri":"Megaloptera","surface_form":"Megaloptera","offset":107},{"uri":"Neuroptera","surface_form":"Neuroptera","offset":123},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":162},{"uri":"Prothorax","surface_form":"prothorax","offset":267},{"uri":"Antenna","surface_form":"antenna","offset":370},{"uri":"Ovipositor","surface_form":"ovipositor","offset":437},{"uri":"Life_cycle","surface_form":"life cycle","offset":465},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":485},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":490},{"uri":"Pupa","surface_form":"pupa","offset":497},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":529},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":609},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":626}]}
