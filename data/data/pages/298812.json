The village is beside the River Camel immediately southeast of Wadebridge. The civil parish includes Washaway and Sladesbridge.\nHistory.\nEgloshayle was a medieval river port, rivalling Padstow five miles downriver. Egloshayle is now a residential suburb of Wadebridge. The town of Wadebridge developed in the parishes of Egloshayle and St Breock. A Vicar of Egloshayle named Thomas Lovibond was responsible for the building of the first bridge across the River Camel to replace a dangerous ford which was begun in 1468 and completed in 1485.\nChurches.\nThe parish church, named after St Petroc, is built almost entirely in the Perpendicular style. It has a Norman font, a stone pulpit dating from the 15th century, and a peal of eight bells. The Anglican chapel at Washaway, dating from 1882, has a font which is one of the earliest in the county.\nForts and houses.\nPencarrow House, seat of the Molesworths (18th century), and Croan House (17th century) are fine examples of smaller country houses.\nKelly Rounds (or Castle Killibury) is an Iron Age fort on the border of the parish and has been associated with the legend of King Arthur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":44},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":54},{"uri":"River_Camel","surface_form":"River Camel","offset":96},{"uri":"Wadebridge","surface_form":"Wadebridge","offset":133},{"uri":"Padstow","surface_form":"Padstow","offset":255},{"uri":"St_Breock","surface_form":"St Breock","offset":406},{"uri":"St_Petroc","surface_form":"St Petroc","offset":653},{"uri":"Perpendicular","surface_form":"Perpendicular","offset":696},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":1109},{"uri":"King_Arthur","surface_form":"King Arthur","offset":1194}]}
