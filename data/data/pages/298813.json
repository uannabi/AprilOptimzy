The river issues into the Atlantic Ocean having covered a distance of approximately 30 miles. The river is tidal as far upstream as Egloshayle and is popular for sailing, birdwatching and fishing.\nGeology.\nThe River Camel rises on the edge of Bodmin Moor, an area which forms part of the granite spine of Cornwall. The river's course is then through upper and middle Devonian rocks, predominantly slates. The only active quarry in the River Camel catchment area is Delabole Quarry. There are some disused mines for a variety of metals in the area. The catchment area of the River Camel covers a total of 413\u00A0km\u00B2 on the western side of Bodmin Moor, and is mainly Devonian slates and granite, with some shales and sandstones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":30},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":40},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":150},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":186},{"uri":"Tide","surface_form":"tidal","offset":267},{"uri":"Egloshayle","surface_form":"Egloshayle","offset":292},{"uri":"Sailing","surface_form":"sailing","offset":322},{"uri":"Birdwatching","surface_form":"birdwatching","offset":331},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":348},{"uri":"Bodmin_Moor","surface_form":"Bodmin Moor","offset":403},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":448},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":527},{"uri":"Delabole","surface_form":"Delabole","offset":625},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":842}]}
