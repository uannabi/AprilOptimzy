{"id":298886,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C4%8Devski_Rog_massacre","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ko\u010Devski Rog massacre was a series of massacres in Slovenia in late May 1945. This was shortly after World War II. It happened near Ko\u010Devski Rog. Thousands of members of the Slovene Home Guard and their families were executed by special units of the Yugoslav Partisans.\nHistory.\nThey were thrown into various pits and caves, which were then sealed with explosives. Several thousand (between 10,000 and 12,000, according to certain sources) war prisoners died in these executions. They had been repatriated by the British military authorities from Austria, where they had fled.\nThe Russian British author Nikolai Tolstoy wrote an account of the events in his book \"The Minister and the Massacres\". British author John Corsellis, who served in Austria with the British Army, has written a historic book of these events, called \"Slovenia 1945: Memories of Death and Survival after World War II\".\nBoris Karapandzic writes that there were 12,000 Slovenian \"home guards\", 3,000 Serbian volunteer troops, 1,000 Montenegrin \"chetniks\", and 2,500 Croatian \"home guards\". Karapandzic's report is confirmed in a subsequent book by a group of scholars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Massacre","surface_form":"massacre","offset":51},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":64},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":114},{"uri":"Ko%C4%8Devski_Rog","surface_form":"Ko\u010Devski Rog","offset":145},{"uri":"Slovene_Home_Guard","surface_form":"Slovene Home Guard","offset":187},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"executed","offset":230},{"uri":"Yugoslav_Partisans","surface_form":"Yugoslav Partisans","offset":263},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"explosives","offset":366},{"uri":"Prisoner_of_war","surface_form":"war prisoners","offset":453},{"uri":"Repatriation","surface_form":"repatriated","offset":507},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":560},{"uri":"Russian_British","surface_form":"Russian British","offset":594},{"uri":"Nikolai_Tolstoy","surface_form":"Nikolai Tolstoy","offset":617},{"uri":"Boris_Karapandzic","surface_form":"Boris Karapandzic","offset":906}]}
