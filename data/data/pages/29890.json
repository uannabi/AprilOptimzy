{"id":29890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatos","text":"Thanatos is the god of death in Greek mythology. He is the son of Nyx and the twin brother of Hypnos, the god of sleep.\nSigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, used the word in one of his theories. THANATOS was the god or personified spirit (\"daimon\") of non-violent death. His touch was gentle, likened to that of his twin brother Hypnos(Sleep). Violent death was the domain of Thanatos' blood-craving sisters, the Keres, spirits of slaughter and disease. He is often confused with Hades, who is the god of the dead and underworld, not death itself.\nThanatos plays a prominent role in two myths. Once when he was sent to fetch Alkestis (Alcestis) to the underworld, he was driven off by Herakles in a fight. Another time he was captured by the criminal Sisyphos (Sisyphus) who trapped him in a sack so as to avoid death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Death_(personification)","surface_form":"god of death","offset":16},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":32},{"uri":"Nyx","surface_form":"Nyx","offset":66},{"uri":"Hypnos","surface_form":"Hypnos","offset":94},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":113},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":120},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":144},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theories","offset":186},{"uri":"Daimon","surface_form":"daimon","offset":241},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":481},{"uri":"Sisyphus","surface_form":"Sisyphus","offset":762}]}
