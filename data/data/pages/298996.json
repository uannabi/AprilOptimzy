{"id":298996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifford","text":"=\"preserve\">Lifford (Irish: Leifear) is the county town of County Donegal, part of the Province of Ulster in Ireland. It is the administrative capital of the County and the seat of Donegal County Council. Lifford is in the Finn Valley area of East Donegal where the River Finn meets the River Mourne to create the River Foyle.\nThe town grew up around a castle established there by Manus O'Donnell in the 16th century, and later became a British Army garrison town until most of Ireland won independence as a dominion in 1922. It is opposite Strabane in Northern Ireland on the other bank of the Foyle and is connected to that town by Lifford Bridge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_town","surface_form":"county town","offset":44},{"uri":"County_Donegal","surface_form":"County Donegal","offset":59},{"uri":"Ulster","surface_form":"Ulster","offset":99},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":109},{"uri":"River_Foyle","surface_form":"River Foyle","offset":314},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":437},{"uri":"Strabane","surface_form":"Strabane","offset":541}]}
