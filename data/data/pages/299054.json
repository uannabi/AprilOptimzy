{"id":299054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanhydrock","text":"Lanhydrock is a parish centred on a country estate and mansion in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The parish lies south of the town of Bodmin and is bounded to the north by Bodmin parish, to the south by Lanlivery parish and to the west by Lanivet parish. The population was 171 in the 2001 census.\nThe parish is in the Diocese of Truro. The parish church is dedicated to St Hydrock and stands in the grounds of Lanhydrock House. Parts date back to the late 15th century and the church has a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and three-stage battlemented tower with one bell.\nLanhydrock House.\nThe great house stands in extensive grounds above the River Fowey and is has been owned and managed by the National Trust since 1953. Much of the present house dates back to Victorian times but some sections date from the 1620s. It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees.\nIn 1620 the rich merchant Sir Richard Robartes acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four-sided layout around a central courtyard. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor. During the 18th century the east wing of the house was demolished leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused much damage to the central section. Of the main house only the north wing, with its 29 metre Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, though the original gatehouse also dates back to the mid 17th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":66},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":76},{"uri":"Bodmin","surface_form":"Bodmin","offset":129},{"uri":"Lanlivery","surface_form":"Lanlivery","offset":198},{"uri":"Lanivet","surface_form":"Lanivet","offset":234},{"uri":"Diocese_of_Truro","surface_form":"Diocese of Truro","offset":314},{"uri":"River_Fowey","surface_form":"River Fowey","offset":646},{"uri":"National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty","surface_form":"National Trust","offset":699}]}
