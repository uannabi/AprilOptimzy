He moved to England because of the Franco-Prussian War.\nHoltzendorff worked for the Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company. He sketched the landscape of Derbyshire and these were used as designs for porcelain.\nHis main work was the decoration of the \"Gladstone Dessert Service\", presented by the Liberal Working Men of Derby to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1883. Watercolour by Holtzendorff, with a view of Becket Street, Derby, with the Derby Museum and Art Gallery in the background, is the only remaining study on paper linked to the \"Gladstone service\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":38},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":45},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":55},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":68},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":88},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":111},{"uri":"Royal_Crown_Derby","surface_form":"Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company","offset":160},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":226},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":272},{"uri":"Working_Men%27s_Club_and_Institute_Union","surface_form":"Liberal Working Men","offset":369},{"uri":"Derby","surface_form":"Derby","offset":392},{"uri":"William_Ewart_Gladstone","surface_form":"William Ewart Gladstone","offset":416},{"uri":"Watercolour","surface_form":"Watercolour","offset":449},{"uri":"Derby_Museum_and_Art_Gallery","surface_form":"Derby Museum and Art Gallery","offset":524}]}
