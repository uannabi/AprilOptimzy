Pickford had a number of notable customers. One of them was a painter Joseph Wright, whose works can be found in local Derby Museum. The Pickford's museum that was set up in 1988 shows the housing of a late Georgian professional person. The ground floor is furnished as it might have been in Pickford's time together with displays of eighteenth and nineteenth century costume. It is owned and run by the Derby City Council.\n\"Pickford's House\" was intended to showcase his work, with the intention of securing new contacts. It was also his residence.
