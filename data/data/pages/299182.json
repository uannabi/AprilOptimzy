{"id":299182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Timbers","text":"The Portland Timbers are a soccer team in Portland, Oregon, United States. In 1975, the team took the name \"Timbers\" because Oregon is known for logging and forestry. The team colors are green and gold (yellow). At every Timbers game in Portland, the Timbers Army are a large group of the loudest and proudest Timbers fans.\nToday, the team plays in Major League Soccer. The team played in the USL First Division before they joined Major League Soccer in 2011.\nThe team's name may also be inspired by a club of the same name based in the same city that competed in the original NASL in the 70's and early 80's.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland","offset":42},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":52},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":60},{"uri":"Logging","surface_form":"logging","offset":145},{"uri":"Forestry","surface_form":"forestry","offset":157},{"uri":"Timbers_Army","surface_form":"Timbers Army","offset":251},{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"Major League Soccer","offset":349},{"uri":"USL_First_Division","surface_form":"USL First Division","offset":393},{"uri":"North_American_Soccer_League_(1968-84)","surface_form":"NASL","offset":577}]}
