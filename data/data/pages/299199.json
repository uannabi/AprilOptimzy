{"id":299199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language","text":"Zulu or isiZulu (\"isiZulu\") is the language of the Zulu people. 10 million people speak Zulu, and most of them (95%) live in South Africa. It is the most common home language in South Africa, where 24% of people speak it at home. Over 50% of the population also speak and understand the language.\nIn 1994, it became one of South Africa's 11 official languages. Like other Bantu languages, Zulu is written using the Latin alphabet.\nWhere it is spoken.\nZulu belongs to the Nguni group of Bantu languages. Zulu migrants (people who move from place to place) have taken the language to other regions. There are now Zulu speakers in Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, and Swaziland.\nZulu speakers in Zimbabwe speak a dialect called \"Northern Ndebele language.\"\nPeople who speak Xhosa can understand most Zulu. The opposite is also true: Zulu speakers can understand Xhosa. Xhosa language is the most common language spoken in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.\nHistory.\nThe Zulu, Xhosa, and other Nguni people have lived in South Africa for a long time. The Zulu language has a lot of click sounds common in Southern African languages. These click sounds are not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have lived together with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.\nZulu and all other native Southern African languages was at first an oral language. It was not written down until missionaries came from Europe. These missionaries used the Latin alphabet to write the Zulu language. The first Zulu grammar book was published in Norway in 1850 by Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder.\nThe oldest document written in Zulu is a Bible from 1883. John Dube, a Zulu from Natal, wrote the first Zulu novel, \"Insila kaShaka\", in 1933. Another important Zulu author was Reginald Dhlomo. Dhlomo wrote \"U-Dingane\" (1936), \"U-Shaka\" (1937), \"U-Mpande\" (1938), \"U-Cetshwayo\" (1952) and \"U-Dinizulu\" (1968). Other important Zulu writers are Benedict Wallet Vilakazi and Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali.\nBefore 1994, the Zulu language was controlled by the Zulu Language Board in KwaZulu-Natal. Today, the Pan South African Language Board supports the use of all 11 official languages of South Africa.\nUse today.\nBefore 1994, the official languages of South Africa were English, Dutch, and Afrikaans. During Apartheid, Zulu was spoken commonly in the Kwazulu bantustan. All education, however, at the high school level was in English or Afrikaans.\nAfter Apartheid ended in 1994, Zulu became one of the official languages in South Africa. The SABC first started showing Zulu-language television and news programs in the 1980s. There are many Zulu radio stations and newspapers available, mostly in the Kwazulu-Natal province and Johannesburg. The first full-length feature film in Zulu was \"Yesterday\". It was made in 2004 and nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar).\nOther \"Lion King\" songs also had Zulu phrases in them.\nStandard and urban Zulu.\nThere are two main types of Zulu. One type is called standard Zulu, and it is taught in schools. Standard Zulu is also called \"deep Zulu\" (). Standard Zulu is a purist language. This means that new ideas are described using words that are derived from other Zulu words.\nThe other type of Zulu is called urban Zulu (). Urban Zulu is the kind of Zulu spoken by people who live in cities. Urban Zulu uses loan words borrowed from other languages to describe new ideas. Most of these loan words come from English.\nThese two different types of Zulu language make problems in learning and education. Young people speak urban Zulu and do not often understand standard Zulu.\nPhrases.\nThis is a list of phrases in Zulu.\nCommon place names in Zulu.\nZulu place names occur in the \"locative\" form most of the time. A place name is both a preposition and a name. Changing the prefix of the place name changes the preposition.\nFor example, the Zulu name for Johannesburg is \"iGoli.\" The word \"eGoli\" means to/at/in/from Johannesburg. The root word \"Goli\" means \"Johannesburg,\" but doesn't mean anything by itself in Zulu.\nMost of the time, changing the \"i-\" or \"u-\" prefix to the \"e-\" prefix changes the meaning like this. In some cases, like with Durban, the name changes too.\n'Zulu' or 'isiZulu'?\nThe Zulu name for the language is \"isiZulu\". The \"isi-\" prefix means \"language.\" (It also means other things, but here it means language.) For example, \"isiNgisi\" means English, \"isiXhosa\" means Xhosa, \"isiBhunu\" means Afrikaans, and \"isiJalimane\" means German.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":35},{"uri":"Zulu_people","surface_form":"Zulu people","offset":51},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":125},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":246},{"uri":"Languages_of_South_Africa","surface_form":"official languages","offset":341},{"uri":"Bantu_languages","surface_form":"Bantu languages","offset":372},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":415},{"uri":"Nguni_languages","surface_form":"Nguni","offset":471},{"uri":"Bantu_languages","surface_form":"Bantu languages","offset":486},{"uri":"Migrant","surface_form":"migrant","offset":508},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":628},{"uri":"Lesotho","surface_form":"Lesotho","offset":638},{"uri":"Mozambique","surface_form":"Mozambique","offset":647},{"uri":"Malawi","surface_form":"Malawi","offset":659},{"uri":"Swaziland","surface_form":"Swaziland","offset":671},{"uri":"Northern_Ndebele_language","surface_form":"Northern Ndebele language","offset":732},{"uri":"Xhosa_language","surface_form":"Xhosa","offset":777},{"uri":"Xhosa_language","surface_form":"Xhosa language","offset":872},{"uri":"Eastern_Cape","surface_form":"Eastern Cape","offset":929},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":945},{"uri":"Xhosa_people","surface_form":"Xhosa","offset":978},{"uri":"San","surface_form":"San","offset":1263},{"uri":"Khoi","surface_form":"Khoi","offset":1271},{"uri":"Southern_Africa","surface_form":"Southern Africa","offset":1303},{"uri":"Oral_language","surface_form":"oral language","offset":1346},{"uri":"Missionary","surface_form":"missionaries","offset":1391},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1414},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":1450},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":1508},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1538},{"uri":"Hans_Paludan_Smith_Schreuder","surface_form":"Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder","offset":1556},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":1627},{"uri":"John_Dube","surface_form":"John Dube","offset":1644},{"uri":"Natal","surface_form":"Natal","offset":1667},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":1752},{"uri":"Rolfes_Robert_Reginald_Dhlomo","surface_form":"Reginald Dhlomo","offset":1763},{"uri":"Benedict_Wallet_Vilakazi","surface_form":"Benedict Wallet Vilakazi","offset":1929},{"uri":"Oswald_Mbuyiseni_Mtshali","surface_form":"Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali","offset":1958},{"uri":"Zulu_Language_Board","surface_form":"Zulu Language Board","offset":2037},{"uri":"KwaZulu-Natal","surface_form":"KwaZulu-Natal","offset":2060},{"uri":"Pan_South_African_Language_Board","surface_form":"Pan South African Language Board","offset":2086},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":2259},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":2270},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"Apartheid","offset":2288},{"uri":"Kwazulu","surface_form":"Kwazulu","offset":2331},{"uri":"Bantustan","surface_form":"bantustan","offset":2339},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":2381},{"uri":"SABC","surface_form":"SABC","offset":2522},{"uri":"Kwazulu-Natal","surface_form":"Kwazulu-Natal","offset":2681},{"uri":"Johannesburg","surface_form":"Johannesburg","offset":2708},{"uri":"Feature_film","surface_form":"feature film","offset":2744},{"uri":"Yesterday_(2004_film)","surface_form":"Yesterday","offset":2770},{"uri":"Nomination","surface_form":"nominated","offset":2806},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":2823},{"uri":"Standard_language","surface_form":"standard","offset":2979},{"uri":"Linguistic_purism","surface_form":"purist","offset":3087},{"uri":"Derivative","surface_form":"derived","offset":3165},{"uri":"Loan_words","surface_form":"loan words","offset":3328},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":3509},{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"phrase","offset":3620},{"uri":"Locative","surface_form":"locative","offset":3696},{"uri":"Preposition","surface_form":"preposition","offset":3752},{"uri":"Prefix","surface_form":"prefix","offset":3789},{"uri":"Johannesburg","surface_form":"Johannesburg","offset":3870},{"uri":"Root_word","surface_form":"root word","offset":3950},{"uri":"Durban","surface_form":"Durban","offset":4160},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":4430},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":4465}]}
