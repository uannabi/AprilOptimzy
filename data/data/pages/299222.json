He was the millionaire owner of the \"New York Herald\". The award was first given in 1900 in France. It was an car-racing event between teams from different countries.\nHistory.\nIn 1900, the Automobile Club de France (ACF) was given the trophy (\"prize\"). The trophy could be won in a race between automobile clubs from different countries. The trophy was given out every year until 1905. After that, the ACF held the first Grand Prix motor racing event at the Circuit de la Sarthe, in Le Mans.\nThe British Racing Green was first used in the 1903 Gordon Bennet Cup in Ireland.\nThe Gordon Bennett Cup auto races included racing drivers from across Europe. There were also drivers from the United States like Alexander Winton, who drove his Winton automobile.\nThe rules were that the races were done in the country of the winner of the year before. The races were between national teams. Because of this, the national racing colours had to be set for each country. Great Britain had to choose a different colour to red, white or blue (the colours of the flag) because they had been taken by Italy, Germany and France. They choose shamrock green because the race that year was run in Ireland. This became known as the British racing green.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"James_Gordon_Bennett%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"James Gordon Bennett, Jr.","offset":53},{"uri":"New_York_Herald","surface_form":"New York Herald","offset":117},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":172},{"uri":"Automobile_Club_de_France","surface_form":"Automobile Club de France","offset":269},{"uri":"Grand_Prix_motor_racing","surface_form":"Grand Prix motor racing","offset":501},{"uri":"Circuit_de_la_Sarthe","surface_form":"Circuit de la Sarthe","offset":538},{"uri":"Le_Mans","surface_form":"Le Mans","offset":563},{"uri":"British_Racing_Green","surface_form":"British Racing Green","offset":576},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":645},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":724},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":765},{"uri":"Alexander_Winton","surface_form":"Alexander Winton","offset":784},{"uri":"Winton_automobile","surface_form":"Winton automobile","offset":816},{"uri":"List_of_international_auto_racing_colors","surface_form":"national racing colours","offset":984},{"uri":"Shamrock","surface_form":"shamrock","offset":1205},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":1258},{"uri":"British_racing_green","surface_form":"British racing green","offset":1292}]}
