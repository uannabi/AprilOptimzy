They were also at the 1960 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Olympics. The country always competed as a British territory. It was unable to be in the 1968 Games in Mexico.\nFollowing Ian Smith's declaration of an independent Rhodesian republic in 1970, they never competed again. In 1972 Rhodesia was expelled by the International Olympic Committee four days before the opening ceremony. This was due to pressure from other African countries, which did not recognise the legitimacy of the Rhodesian state. The country's successor state, Zimbabwe, made its Olympic d\u00E9but in 1980.\nRhodesia was never in the Winter Olympics. No Rhodesian athlete ever won an Olympic medal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":63},{"uri":"Rhodesia","surface_form":"Rhodesia","offset":123},{"uri":"List_of_IOC_country_codes","surface_form":"RHO","offset":135},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":187},{"uri":"1960_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1960 Summer Olympics","offset":232},{"uri":"1964_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1964 Summer Olympics","offset":257},{"uri":"Compete","surface_form":"competed","offset":298},{"uri":"1968_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1968 Games","offset":358},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":372},{"uri":"Ian_Smith","surface_form":"Ian Smith","offset":390},{"uri":"Wikt","surface_form":"expel","offset":508},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":524},{"uri":"Recognise","surface_form":"recognise","offset":664},{"uri":"Legitimacy","surface_form":"legitimacy","offset":678},{"uri":"Successor_state","surface_form":"successor state","offset":727},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":744},{"uri":"Wikt","surface_form":"d\u00E9but","offset":771},{"uri":"Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"Winter Olympics","offset":812},{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"medal","offset":870}]}
