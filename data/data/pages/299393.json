{"id":299393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_language","text":"The Herero language (Herero: \"Otjiherero\") is a Bantu language of the Niger-Congo group. It is spoken by the Herero people in Namibia and Botswana. There are about 237,000 Herero speakers in both countries, 206,000 in Namibia and the rest in Botswana.\nThe language is spoken in an area called \"Hereroland\". This area includes the regions of Omaheke, Otjozondjupa, and Kunene. The Himba people, who are related to the Herero people, speak a dialect that is very close to Herero. A large minority of people in Windhoek (the capital of Namibia) speak Herero.\nThe Herero language is written in the Latin alphabet. The first written work in Herero was a translation of the Bible by missionary Gottlieb Viehe (1839-1901). Father Peter Heinrich Brincker (1836-1904), another missionary, translated several religious works and songs into Herero.\nHerero is taught in Namibian schools and at the University of Namibia. It is one of the six minority languages used in broadcasts by the Namibian State Radio (NBC). Gamsberg Macmillan, has published the only dictionary in Herero.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bantu_languages","surface_form":"Bantu language","offset":48},{"uri":"Niger-Congo_languages","surface_form":"Niger-Congo","offset":70},{"uri":"Herero_people","surface_form":"Herero people","offset":109},{"uri":"Namibia","surface_form":"Namibia","offset":126},{"uri":"Botswana","surface_form":"Botswana","offset":138},{"uri":"Omaheke","surface_form":"Omaheke","offset":341},{"uri":"Otjozondjupa","surface_form":"Otjozondjupa","offset":350},{"uri":"Kunene","surface_form":"Kunene","offset":368},{"uri":"Himba","surface_form":"Himba","offset":380},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":440},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":486},{"uri":"Windhoek","surface_form":"Windhoek","offset":508},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":594},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":668},{"uri":"Missionary","surface_form":"missionary","offset":677},{"uri":"University_of_Namibia","surface_form":"University of Namibia","offset":886},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":957},{"uri":"Namibian_State_Radio","surface_form":"Namibian State Radio","offset":975}]}
