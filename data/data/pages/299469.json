{"id":299469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au%C3%B0r","text":"=\"preserve\">Au\u00F0r (Old Norse \"prosperity\") or Aud is in the Norse mythology a son of Naglfari and N\u00F3tt, and half-brother of J\u00F6r\u00F0 (Earth) and Dagr (Day). He is an uncle of Thor. J\u00F6r\u00F0 is called \"Au\u00F0r's splendid sister\".\nScholar Rudolf Simek theorizes that Au\u00F0r is the invention of Snorri Sturluson. Simek notes that Au\u00F0r is a female name in other Icelandic sources.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":18},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":59},{"uri":"Naglfari","surface_form":"Naglfari","offset":84},{"uri":"N%C3%B3tt","surface_form":"N\u00F3tt","offset":97},{"uri":"J%C3%B6r%C3%B0","surface_form":"J\u00F6r\u00F0","offset":123},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":129},{"uri":"Dagr","surface_form":"Dagr","offset":140},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":170},{"uri":"Rudolf_Simek","surface_form":"Rudolf Simek","offset":225},{"uri":"Snorri_Sturluson","surface_form":"Snorri Sturluson","offset":278}]}
