{"id":299620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteridae","text":"Asteridae is a Linnaean term with the rank of subclass. By definition it always includes the family Asteraceae (Compositae). However, in the modern APG III system of classification, asterid and euasterid are names for clades. Their member families are similar to those of the Asteridae.\nMost of the above orders as defined by Cronquist have been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent molecular systematic studies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linnaean_taxonomy","surface_form":"Linnaean","offset":15},{"uri":"Subclass_(biology)","surface_form":"subclass","offset":46},{"uri":"Asteraceae","surface_form":"Asteraceae","offset":100},{"uri":"APG_III_system","surface_form":"APG III system","offset":148},{"uri":"Asterid","surface_form":"asterid","offset":182},{"uri":"Euasterid","surface_form":"euasterid","offset":194},{"uri":"Clades","surface_form":"clades","offset":218},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"molecular systematic studies","offset":392}]}
