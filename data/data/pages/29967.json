Holi is the festival of colors. The festival is celebrated for two to three days.Holi is celebrated in the spring season. [https://www.thehinduopinion.com/2020/03/happy-holi.html Hindus] believe that spring is full of colors so they throw colored water on each other.\nHoli is based on a legend about King Hiranyakaship. `Hiranyakashyap had a son, Prahlad. Prahlad was the greatest devotee of Lord Vishnu. Hiranyakashyap wanted to kill his son, so he called his sister, Holika. She had a magic robe. This robe had the power to save the wearer from burning in fire. Hiranyakashyap ordered his sister to sit on a burning fire along with Prahlad. He thought that his sister would not be harmed by the fire because of the magic robe and Prahlad would be burnt to death. But the result was the opposite to what the evil demon king planned.\n. Thus Prahlad came out of the burning fire safely and Holika was burnt to death. It is celebrated with colors to mark the victory of virtue and goodness over evil.\nThe festival is celebrated for five days. The 5th day, Rang Panchami, marks the closing day of the Holi festival.\nPeople are seen with different varieties of colors on Holi. They put colors on each other, sing, dance. They worship Lord Krishna and put colors on his idol.\nFamilies gather together and party the whole day. They distribute sweets and enjoy to the fullest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":25},{"uri":"Hindus","surface_form":"Hindus","offset":38}]}
