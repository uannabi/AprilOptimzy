{"id":299705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn","text":"Citro\u00EBn is automobile manufacturer based in France. Andr\u00E9-Gustave Citro\u00EBn started the company in 1919 and it became the first mass-production automobile company outside the USA. Citro\u00EBn was the first to create a sales and services network that goes with the automobile.\nInnovations.\nCitro\u00EBn were innovators in automobile design. Their \"Traction Avant\" (pictured) had the first mass production of three revolutionary features that are still in use today. They are: a unitary body with no separate frame, four-wheel independent suspension, and front-wheel drive.\nLater on, in the 1950s, Citro\u00EBn developed a remarkable type of suspension. A high-pressure hydraulic system was used in over 9 million Citro\u00EBn cars. They included the DS, SM, GS, CX, BX, XM, Xantia, C5, and C6. Self-levelling is the principal benefit \u2013 the car kept a constant ride height above the road. It adjusted to the passenger and cargo load, and gave a very soft suspension. This type of suspension smooths out road irregularities without disturbing the occupants. It is often compared to riding on a 'magic carpet' for this reason.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":44},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Citro%C3%ABn","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9-Gustave Citro\u00EBn","offset":52},{"uri":"1919","surface_form":"1919","offset":97},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":173},{"uri":"Independent_suspension","surface_form":"independent suspension","offset":514},{"uri":"Front-wheel_drive","surface_form":"front-wheel drive","offset":542},{"uri":"Suspension_(vehicle)","surface_form":"suspension","offset":624},{"uri":"Hydraulic","surface_form":"hydraulic","offset":652},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_DS","surface_form":"DS","offset":728},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_SM","surface_form":"SM","offset":732},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_GS","surface_form":"GS","offset":736},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_CX","surface_form":"CX","offset":740},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_BX","surface_form":"BX","offset":744},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_XM","surface_form":"XM","offset":748},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_Xantia","surface_form":"Xantia","offset":752},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_C5","surface_form":"C5","offset":760},{"uri":"Citro%C3%ABn_C6","surface_form":"C6","offset":768},{"uri":"Magic_carpet","surface_form":"magic carpet","offset":1071}]}
