{"id":299809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxis","text":"A taxis (plural taxes) is an innate behavioral response by an organism to a directional stimulus. This means the organism automatically moves towards or away from the stimulus.\nA taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often plant growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and shows movement towards or away from the stimulus source.\nEven single-celled organisms can show taxis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"innate","offset":29},{"uri":"Behavior","surface_form":"behavior","offset":36},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":62},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimulus","offset":88},{"uri":"Tropism","surface_form":"tropism","offset":200},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":233},{"uri":"Motility","surface_form":"motility","offset":304}]}
