{"id":30005,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae","text":"Reggae is a music genre that began in Jamaica in the late 1960s. Most music from Jamaica comes from the reggae style.\nThe music has regular chops on the back beat (off-beat). These are called \u201Cskank\u201D, and are played by a rhythm guitarist. The bass drum hits on the second and fourth beat of each measure (each bar). These are called the \u201Cdrop\u201D. Reggae bands also use a bass, a keyboard or organ, and horns.\nReggae music is often used by Rastafarian groups. They are usually songs about religion, love and social problems. Bob Marley (1945-1981) was a famous reggae artist.\nFamous instruments in reggae music are drums, guitar, saxophone, trumpet and trombone.\nReggae was started in 1960 but became famous in the 1970s.\nReggae songs often have lots of backing singers.\nRapper Snoop Dogg released an album of reggae music in 2013.\nSome recent songs, like Cheerleader and Rude are reggae.\nReggae is related to ska and dancehall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_genre","surface_form":"music genre","offset":12},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":38},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":228},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":248},{"uri":"Rastafarian","surface_form":"Rastafarian","offset":437},{"uri":"Bob_Marley","surface_form":"Bob Marley","offset":522},{"uri":"Saxophone","surface_form":"saxophone","offset":627},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":638},{"uri":"Trombone","surface_form":"trombone","offset":650},{"uri":"Snoop_Dogg","surface_form":"Snoop Dogg","offset":775},{"uri":"Ska","surface_form":"ska","offset":907},{"uri":"Dancehall","surface_form":"dancehall","offset":915}]}
