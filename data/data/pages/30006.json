{"id":30006,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop","text":"=\"preserve\">Bebop or bop is a kind of jazz that became popular near the beginning of the Second World War, in the mid-1940s. Bebop is often fast. The musicians improvise using a small group of chords which are repeated again and again. Charlie Parker (1920-1955), who was famous for his saxophone playing, was a bebop artist. The famous trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993) was also a renowned artist of this genre.\nThe term \"bebop\" originates from a group of syllables used in scat singing, where random strings of sound were used in place of words.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":38},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":89},{"uri":"1940","surface_form":"1940","offset":118},{"uri":"Improvisation","surface_form":"improvise","offset":160},{"uri":"Charlie_Parker","surface_form":"Charlie Parker","offset":236},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":252},{"uri":"1955","surface_form":"1955","offset":257},{"uri":"Saxophone","surface_form":"saxophone","offset":287},{"uri":"Dizzy_Gillespie","surface_form":"Dizzy Gillespie","offset":352},{"uri":"1917","surface_form":"1917","offset":369},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":374}]}
