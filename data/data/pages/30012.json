{"id":30012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument","text":"An argument is an attempt to persuade someone of something. Reasons are given to accept the conclusion. The general structure of an argument in a natural language is that premises (propositions or statements) support the claim or conclusion.\nReason.\nAn argument is a reason to support an opinion.\nThere can be a \"strong argument\" or a \"convincing argument\" (for example, a good reason for why something should be done). Argumentation is the process of conducting an argument.\nThe opposite is a \"weak argument\" or an \"unconvincing argument\". An argument can be valid or invalid or a combination of both. Some arguments may appear reasonable, but they turn out to be misleading or wrong.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_language","surface_form":"natural language","offset":146},{"uri":"Premise","surface_form":"premise","offset":171},{"uri":"Proposition","surface_form":"proposition","offset":181},{"uri":"Statement","surface_form":"statement","offset":197},{"uri":"Reason","surface_form":"reason","offset":267},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":441},{"uri":"Opposite","surface_form":"opposite","offset":480},{"uri":"Valid","surface_form":"valid","offset":560},{"uri":"Invalid","surface_form":"invalid","offset":569},{"uri":"Combination","surface_form":"combination","offset":582}]}
