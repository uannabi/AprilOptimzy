{"id":30017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse_Memorial","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Crazy Horse Memorial is the world's largest mountain sculpture in progress. It is in the Black Hills of South Dakota, USA. The statue depicts Crazy Horse, a famous Lakota warrior. Korczak Ziolkowski started the project in 1948 at the request of Chief Henry Standing Bear and other Native American elders. The statue is meant to be a memorial to the spirit of Crazy Horse as well as the Native American people.\nZiolkowski believed in individual initiative and private enterprise, and as such, never accepted government funding. He continued to work on the memorial until his death in 1982.\nToday.\nZiolkowski's wife and family have continued to work the Crazy Horse Memorial. Completion of the project is currently unknown because of several factors including weather, the availability of financing and the challenges of the mountain engineering.\nThe face of Crazy Horse was completed and dedicated in 1998. Work on the memorial continues today and current plans include blocking out the face of the horse itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Dakota","surface_form":"South Dakota","offset":121},{"uri":"Crazy_Horse","surface_form":"Crazy Horse","offset":159},{"uri":"Lakota","surface_form":"Lakota","offset":181},{"uri":"Korczak_Ziolkowski","surface_form":"Korczak Ziolkowski","offset":197},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":298}]}
