It is one of the two most important ancient epics of India, the first one being the ancient Mahabharata. The epic was originally written by sage (rishi) Valmiki of Ancient India. The book has about 96,000 verses and is divided into seven parts.\nThe story of the Ramayana is about Prince Rama who has been exiled from his kingdom of Ayodhya. He goes on to kill king Ravana of Lanka in a long battle to get back his wife Sita.\n7 Different versions of the book are available. It has been translated into all the major languages of the world.\nThere are different views about the time the Ramayana was written. Some people believe that it was written 2,500 years ago. Others think that it was written around 1,800 years ago. All agree that the book is very old and was written before the Mahabharata.\nThe Ramayana is still very popular today. Every autumn the \"Ramlila\" (\"Rama play\") is performed at the festival of Dassehra. A huge model of Ravana is set alight. This symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness. It is also believed that he turned in to Krishna and also many more things are believed.\nA Tamil version of the book was written between the 9th and 10th centuries. The writer of this book was Kamban. This version is known as Iramavataram, which means coming of Rama. In the 16th century, Tulasidas wrote a Hindi version of Ramayana. This was named Ramacharitmanasa. Over many centuries, the story of Rama reached places in other countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The Ramayana has been translated into most of the major languages of the world.\nThe Ramayana was used in Ancient India for the teaching of young children. It was mainly used for acting out their religious beliefs so that their children knew that they were to worship the main Hindu beliefs that were: Brahman, Multiples Gods, Dharma, Samsara, and Karma.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":27},{"uri":"Epic_poetry","surface_form":"epic","offset":36},{"uri":"Rama","surface_form":"Rama","offset":47},{"uri":"Sita","surface_form":"Sita","offset":56},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":115},{"uri":"Mahabharata","surface_form":"Mahabharata","offset":154},{"uri":"Rishi","surface_form":"rishi","offset":208},{"uri":"Valmiki","surface_form":"Valmiki","offset":215},{"uri":"Ancient_India","surface_form":"Ancient India","offset":226},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":367},{"uri":"Ayodhya","surface_form":"Ayodhya","offset":394},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":422},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":577},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":594},{"uri":"Tamil_people","surface_form":"Tamil","offset":1164}]}
