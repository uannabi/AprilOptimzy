{"id":300509,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry","text":"The Bayeux Tapestry is a long embroidered cloth\u00A0\u2013 not an actual tapestry\u00A0\u2013 which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England as well as the events of the invasion itself. The tapestry is annotated in Latin. It is exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux, Normandy called \"Mus\u00E9e de la Tapisserie de Bayeux\".\nThe tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England. The two combatants are the Anglo-Saxon English, led by Harold Godwinson, recently crowned as King of England, and the Normans, led by William the Conqueror.\nThe tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of Anglo-Saxon art, because, though ordered by a Norman, it was made by English (Anglo-Saxon) artisans. It is also extremely important as a historical document.\nIn common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a \"tapestry\", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.\nThe Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures. The linen is assembled in panels and has been patched in numerous places.\nThe main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Embroidery","surface_form":"embroidered","offset":30},{"uri":"Tapestry","surface_form":"tapestry","offset":64},{"uri":"Norman_conquest_of_England","surface_form":"Norman conquest of England","offset":118},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":220},{"uri":"Bayeux","surface_form":"Bayeux","offset":266},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":274},{"uri":"Norman_conquest_of_England","surface_form":"Norman conquest of England","offset":362},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":417},{"uri":"Harold_Godwinson","surface_form":"Harold Godwinson","offset":445},{"uri":"King_of_England","surface_form":"King of England","offset":483},{"uri":"Normans","surface_form":"Normans","offset":508},{"uri":"William_the_Conqueror","surface_form":"William the Conqueror","offset":524},{"uri":"Early_Middle_Ages","surface_form":"early medieval period","offset":814},{"uri":"Tapestry","surface_form":"tapestry","offset":921},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"woven","offset":953},{"uri":"Embroidery","surface_form":"embroidery","offset":992},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":1042},{"uri":"Yarn","surface_form":"yarn","offset":1047},{"uri":"Plain_weave","surface_form":"tabby-woven","offset":1057},{"uri":"Linen","surface_form":"linen","offset":1069},{"uri":"Backstitch","surface_form":"outline or stem stitch","offset":1114},{"uri":"Couching_(embroidery)","surface_form":"couching or laid work","offset":1184}]}
