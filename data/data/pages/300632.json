{"id":300632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia","text":"\"Borrelia\" is a spirochaete bacterium which causes Lyme disease.\nToday, 36 species of \"Borrelia\" are known. 12 of these cause borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks or lice. The vector of transmission is dependent on the species of \"Borrelia\". Borreliosis is also known as Lyme disease. \"Borrelia burgdorferi\" and \"Borrelia afzelii\" are among the species that cause Lyme disease. Other species such as \"Borrelia hermsii\" or \"Borrelia parkeri\" cause relapsing fever. In this case, the vector are ticks, which are spread by rodents.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spirochaetaceae","surface_form":"spirochaete","offset":16},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":28},{"uri":"Lyme_disease","surface_form":"Lyme disease","offset":51},{"uri":"Borreliosis","surface_form":"borreliosis","offset":126},{"uri":"Zoonosis","surface_form":"zoonotic","offset":141},{"uri":"Vector_(biology)","surface_form":"vector","offset":151},{"uri":"Tick","surface_form":"tick","offset":197},{"uri":"Louse","surface_form":"lice","offset":206},{"uri":"Borrelia_burgdorferi","surface_form":"Borrelia burgdorferi","offset":326},{"uri":"Borrelia_afzelii","surface_form":"Borrelia afzelii","offset":353},{"uri":"Borrelia_hermsii","surface_form":"Borrelia hermsii","offset":441},{"uri":"Borrelia_parkeri","surface_form":"Borrelia parkeri","offset":463},{"uri":"Relapsing_fever","surface_form":"relapsing fever","offset":487},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":560}]}
