Barq's is a brand of root beer and is notable for being the first major North American root beer which contained caffeine. Barq's is manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. Barq's is pronounced \"Barks\".\nHistory.\nBarq's was invented by Edward Charles Edmond Barq and his younger brother, Gaston who worked for \"The Barq's Brothers Bottling Company\" which was founded in 1890 in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. However, Barq's was not actually bottled and sold until 1898 in Biloxi, Mississippi. Early on in their brand they created a popular creation called \"Orangine\", which was an orange-flavored soda. Orangine won a gold medal at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition World's Fair.<ref name=\"http://www.overcaffeinated.org/database/soda-pop/barqs-root-beer.php\">Caffeine Database | Caffeine and Ingredients in Barqs Rootbeer, [http://www.overcaffeinated.org/database/soda-pop/barqs-root-beer.php OverCaffeinated.org's Report on the Ingredients in Barq's Rootbeer]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":64},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soda","offset":76},{"uri":"Root_beer","surface_form":"root beer","offset":136},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":228},{"uri":"The_Coca-Cola_Company","surface_form":"The Coca-Cola Company","offset":264},{"uri":"New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"New Orleans, Louisiana","offset":513},{"uri":"Biloxi%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Biloxi, Mississippi","offset":601}]}
