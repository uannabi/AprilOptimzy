{"id":300778,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone","text":"Silverstone is a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, England. It is about from Towcester on the former A43 main road, from the M1 motorway junction 15A and about from the M40 motorway junction 10, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Banbury. The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village, between the village and the race circuit.\nHistory.\nThe village is listed in the Domesday Book.\nIn the Middle Ages the village trade was primarily in timber from the surrounding Whittlewood forest, through the use of coppicing. Coppicing is a method of managing a forest. It allows trees to regrow after they have been cut down.\nParish church.\nThe first chapel in Silverstone was built by 1200 AD. In about 1780 the mediaeval building was replaced by a Georgian building. That building was enlarged in 1841 and 1852. The entire church was demolished (torn down) in the 1880's and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of Saint Michael. The building is a Gothic Revival designed by JP St Aubyn. It was finished in 1884.\nFacilities.\nThe village has a public house, the White Horse Inn.\nAbout south of the village is the Silverstone Circuit. It was a Royal Air Force bomber base during World War II. Now it is the home of the British Grand Prix, a Formula One race. The race track attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UK place"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civil_parishes_in_England","surface_form":"civil parish","offset":29},{"uri":"Northamptonshire","surface_form":"Northamptonshire","offset":45},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":63},{"uri":"Towcester","surface_form":"Towcester","offset":89},{"uri":"M1_motorway","surface_form":"M1 motorway","offset":137},{"uri":"M40_motorway","surface_form":"M40 motorway","offset":181},{"uri":"Northampton","surface_form":"Northampton","offset":207},{"uri":"Milton_Keynes","surface_form":"Milton Keynes","offset":220},{"uri":"Banbury","surface_form":"Banbury","offset":238},{"uri":"Domesday_Book","surface_form":"Domesday Book","offset":382},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":404},{"uri":"Lumber","surface_form":"timber","offset":451},{"uri":"Whittlewood_Forest","surface_form":"Whittlewood forest","offset":479},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":583},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"mediaeval","offset":717},{"uri":"Georgian_architecture","surface_form":"Georgian","offset":754},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Church of England","offset":905},{"uri":"Michael_(archangel)","surface_form":"Saint Michael","offset":940},{"uri":"Gothic_Revival_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic Revival","offset":973},{"uri":"James_Piers_St_Aubyn","surface_form":"JP St Aubyn","offset":1000},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"public house","offset":1068},{"uri":"Silverstone_Circuit","surface_form":"Silverstone Circuit","offset":1137},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":1167},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1202},{"uri":"British_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"British Grand Prix","offset":1242},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":1264}]}
