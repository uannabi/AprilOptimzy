Google+ was opened to people with an invitation on April 28, 2008 for testing. The next day the July 3, 2015, people with accounts were allowed to invite friends to the service. This was stopped within a day after there was \"insane demand\" for accounts.\nGoogle+ is made to work with different Google social services such as Google Profiles and Google Buzz. It also has features including Circles, Hangouts, Sparks and Huddles. It has been said that this is Google's biggest attempt to rival the social network Facebook.\nOn October 8, 2018, Google said they were going to shut down Google+ by the end of August 2019. This is because a software bug in Google+ let people see the data of hundreds of thousands of users. They later moved the shut down date to April 2, 2019 after discovering yet another bug.\nGrowth.\nOn 14 July 2011, Google said that Google+ had 10 million users two weeks after it was opened to people with invitations. After three weeks, Google+ had 20 million users. The Google+ iPhone app was the most popular free application in the Apple App Store less than a day after it was added to the store.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Social_network_service","surface_form":"social networking","offset":14},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":32},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":62},{"uri":"Google_Account","surface_form":"Google Profiles","offset":394},{"uri":"Google_Buzz","surface_form":"Google Buzz","offset":414},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":580},{"uri":"Software_bug","surface_form":"software bug","offset":704},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":932},{"uri":"Week","surface_form":"week","offset":950},{"uri":"IPhone","surface_form":"iPhone","offset":1065},{"uri":"Application_software","surface_form":"application","offset":1102},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple","offset":1121},{"uri":"App_Store_(iOS)","surface_form":"App Store","offset":1127}]}
