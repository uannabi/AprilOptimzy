{"id":300888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xpress","text":"Xpress is a steel launched roller coaster at Walibi Holland in The Netherlands. It opened in 2000 under the name \"Superman the Ride\". However, Six Flags was planning to open it under the name \"Riddlers Revenge\" and the ride was painted green at the factory. Shortly before the coaster was built, the name was changed to \"Superman the Ride\" and was painted red and blue. Since 2005 the coaster is called \"Xpress\". It is the first LSM coaster in Europe.\nThe coaster had been standing but not operating for the whole season in 2011. The reason for this was because important parts of the launch mechanism were broken, which can cause that the train does not have enough speed at the end of the launch, or doesn't launch at all. These parts are ordered and are only made on request, as there are only 3 coasters of this type worldwide (2 of which are in Disney parks). Therefore, Walibi Holland decided to paint the track. As of 2012, the coaster operates again.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roller_coaster","surface_form":"launched roller coaster","offset":18},{"uri":"Walibi_Holland","surface_form":"Walibi Holland","offset":45},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":63},{"uri":"Six_Flags","surface_form":"Six Flags","offset":143},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":444},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":850}]}
