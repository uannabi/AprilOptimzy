Vela was a keyboardist for Selena y Los Dinos. He had fallen in love with the drummer of the group, Suzette Quintanilla. Suzette is Selena and A.B. Quintanilla III's sister. After finding out she was married, Vela wrote about his feelings on paper. He was going to send it to Suzette. However, Selena needed more songs on what was going to be her next album. Selena's brother and music producer, A.B., decided to ask Vela if he had written anything. Vela had written songs before and some of his works were recorded by Selena. Vela told A.B. about his feelings for her sister Suzette. He showed him the paper where he wrote about how hurt he was. A.B., liked the idea of turning it into a song. They then worked together and turned it into a ballad.\nSelena recorded the song at her father and manager's record studio Q-Productions. It was produced by A.B.
