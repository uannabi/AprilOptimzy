It was built by Zierer\nInformation.\nRattle Snake was built in 1994 by Walibi Flevo as \"Keverbaan\". When Six Flags took over the park in 2000, the name was changed to \"Road Runner\". Six Flags decided to paint the track brown instead of red, but later they decided to paint it back to red in 2004. After the park name was changed to Walibi World, \"Road Runner\" was renamed to \"Woks Waanzin\", but due to the name change in 2011 to Walibi Holland, the mascotte \"Wok\" disappeared and the coaster was renamed to Rattle Snake. It moved to another section of the park, replacing \"Flying Dutchman Gold Mine\". The coaster has a capacity of 1000 people per hour.\nOther websites.\n[http://www.walibi.com/holland/nl-nl/attracties/kids/rattle-snake Rattle Snake on the Walibi Holland website]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roller_coaster","surface_form":"roller coaster","offset":87},{"uri":"Walibi_Holland","surface_form":"Walibi Holland","offset":105},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"the Netherlands","offset":123},{"uri":"Zierer","surface_form":"Zierer","offset":156},{"uri":"Six_Flags","surface_form":"Six Flags","offset":244}]}
