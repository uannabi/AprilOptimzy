{"id":300969,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate","text":"=\"preserve\">Bit rate (also called bitrate, data rate, or \"R\") is how fast bits move from one place to another. It is measured in bits per second (bit/s).\nIt is different from symbol rate and bandwidth, but part of the same group.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":74},{"uri":"Symbol_rate","surface_form":"symbol rate","offset":175},{"uri":"Bandwidth_(computing)","surface_form":"bandwidth","offset":191}]}
