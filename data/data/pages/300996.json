{"id":300996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_South_Africa","text":"South Africa has eleven official languages. They are Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sotho, Swazi, Tswana, Tsonga, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu. Most South Africans (over 99%) speak one of these languages as a first language. Most South Africans can speak more than one language. Prior to 1994, South Africa had only two official languages, English and Afrikaans.\nThe English version of the South African constitution calls each of these languages by its name in that language. Zulu is called \"isiZulu\", Xhosa language is called \"isiXhosa\", and so on. The languages listed in the constitution are: isiZulu (Zulu), isiXhosa (Xhosa), Afrikaans (Afrikaans), Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Setswana (Tswana), English (English), Sesotho (Southern Sotho), Xitsonga (Tsonga), Siswati (Swati), Tshivenda (Venda), and isiNdebele (Southern Ndebele).\nIn South Africa, Southern Ndebele is known simply as \"Ndebele\", since most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe. The 1993 version of the Constitution referred to Northern Sotho as \"Sesotho sa Leboa\", but the 1996 version called it \"Sepedi\". Different government departments and official organizations use different names for Northern Sotho.\nThe main language of government is English. Afrikaans and English are both important languages used in commerce. Most rich South Africans speak Afrikaans and English.\nTwo of the official languages are West Germanic languages (English and Afrikaans). The other nine languages are Bantu languages. Four of the Bantu languages are part of the Nguni family (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati, Ndebele). Three of the Bantu languages are Sotho-Tswana languages (Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, Tswana). Tsonga is a Tswa-Ronga language. South Africa also has a national sign languae, South African Sign Language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":0},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":24},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":53},{"uri":"South_African_English","surface_form":"English","offset":64},{"uri":"Southern_Ndebele_language","surface_form":"Ndebele","offset":73},{"uri":"Northern_Sotho","surface_form":"Northern Sotho","offset":82},{"uri":"Sotho_language","surface_form":"Sotho","offset":98},{"uri":"Swazi_language","surface_form":"Swazi","offset":105},{"uri":"Tswana_language","surface_form":"Tswana","offset":112},{"uri":"Tsonga_language","surface_form":"Tsonga","offset":120},{"uri":"Venda_language","surface_form":"Venda","offset":128},{"uri":"Xhosa_language","surface_form":"Xhosa","offset":135},{"uri":"Zulu_language","surface_form":"Zulu","offset":145},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":216},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":411},{"uri":"Zulu_language","surface_form":"Zulu","offset":484},{"uri":"Xhosa_language","surface_form":"Xhosa language","offset":510},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commerce","offset":1293},{"uri":"West_Germanic_languages","surface_form":"West Germanic languages","offset":1391},{"uri":"Bantu_languages","surface_form":"Bantu languages","offset":1469},{"uri":"Nguni_languages","surface_form":"Nguni family","offset":1530},{"uri":"Sotho-Tswana_languages","surface_form":"Sotho-Tswana languages","offset":1607},{"uri":"Tswa-Ronga","surface_form":"Tswa-Ronga","offset":1684},{"uri":"South_African_Sign_Language","surface_form":"South African Sign Language","offset":1752}]}
