{"id":301056,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguni_languages","text":"The Nguni languages are a group of Bantu languages spoken by the Nguni people. These languages are spoken in Southern Africa, mostly in South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. Nguni languages include Xhosa, Zulu, Swati, Hlubi, Phuthi and Ndebele (both Southern Ndebele and Northern Ndebele).\nThe name \"Nguni\" comes from the cow breed called \"Nguni cattle\". The word \"Nguni\" is sometimes used to mean all speakers of Nguni languages as a group. This is an incorrect use of the word, since many different tribes speak these languages.\nLanguage organization.\nThe Nguni languages are a sub-group of the Southern Bantu languages. These languages exist in a relatively small geographic area. The languages are closely related and sound very much alike. Many times the different languages are mutually intelligible -- that is, someone who speaks one Nguni language can understand someone speaking a different Nguni language.\nLinguists and other researchers split the Nguni languages into two smaller groups: \"Zunda Nguni\" and \"Tekela Nguni\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bantu_languages","surface_form":"Bantu languages","offset":35},{"uri":"Nguni_people","surface_form":"Nguni people","offset":65},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":118},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":136},{"uri":"Swaziland","surface_form":"Swaziland","offset":150},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":165},{"uri":"Xhosa_language","surface_form":"Xhosa","offset":199},{"uri":"Zulu_language","surface_form":"Zulu","offset":206},{"uri":"Swati_language","surface_form":"Swati","offset":212},{"uri":"AmaHlubi","surface_form":"Hlubi","offset":219},{"uri":"Phuthi_language","surface_form":"Phuthi","offset":226},{"uri":"Ndebele_language","surface_form":"Ndebele","offset":237},{"uri":"Southern_Ndebele_language","surface_form":"Southern Ndebele","offset":251},{"uri":"Northern_Ndebele_language","surface_form":"Northern Ndebele","offset":272},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":323},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":327},{"uri":"Nguni_cattle","surface_form":"Nguni cattle","offset":341},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":502},{"uri":"Southern_Bantu_languages","surface_form":"Southern Bantu languages","offset":598},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographic","offset":668},{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"Linguist","offset":917},{"uri":"Researcher","surface_form":"researcher","offset":937},{"uri":"Zunda_language","surface_form":"Zunda Nguni","offset":1001},{"uri":"Tekela_languages","surface_form":"Tekela Nguni","offset":1019}]}
