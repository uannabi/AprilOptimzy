{"id":30119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan","text":"The toucan is a South American bird in the family Ramphastidae. This social bird lives in small flocks in lowland rainforests in countries such as Costa Rica. It flies short distances between trees. Toucans rest in holes in trees. They mostly eat fruit, but sometimes they also eat insects and small lizards.\nThey are brightly marked and have large, often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and over forty different species.\nToucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists think is to find out who is the top bird amongst them.\nBeak.\nToucans are known for their huge beaks, which can grow larger than their bodies. They use their beaks for reaching over and plucking fruit from branches of trees. The bright colors (usually orange) on the beak may help the toucans to recognize each other, and to scare off other birds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":16},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":114},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":147},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":224},{"uri":"Migrate","surface_form":"migrate","offset":479},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":802},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":948}]}
