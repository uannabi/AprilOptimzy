{"id":301311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_training","text":"=\"preserve\">Horse training describes what people do to get horses to do particular tasks. This includes training them to let people ride on their backs, or to pull carts and wagons. Horses have to be trained to accept a bridle or a saddle. Historically, horses were trained for transport, farm work, warfare and sport. In modern times, sport and recreation are the main reason horses are trained.\nThere is a lot of argument about horse training. Some ways are now thought to be cruel, and terms like horse breaking are also out of favour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":59}]}
