{"id":301348,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian","text":"Aurelian (who lived between 214/215 - 275 AD) was an Emperor of Rome between 270 and 275 AD.\nAurelian came from Illyria (in the Balkans). He had been a soldier all his life when the Emperor Claudius Gothicus promoted him to high rank. When Claudius died, the army chose Aurelian as the next Emperor. He suppressed a revolt of Roman mint workers and reformed the coinage to try to avoid the problem of inflation that the Romans had had for a while.\nHis notable achievements were to defeat several groups of barbarians - most importantly the Alamanni - but also the Goths, Vandals, Juthungi, Sarmatians, and Carpi. He recovered Egypt for the empire. He also tried to make the Roman god Sol Invictus the main god. He was murdered by some of his generals and Tacitus (not the historian) was the next emperor.\nDomitianus II (usurper) revolted against Aurelian's rule.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":89},{"uri":"Illyria","surface_form":"Illyria","offset":112},{"uri":"Claudius_Gothicus","surface_form":"Claudius Gothicus","offset":190},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":401},{"uri":"Alamanni","surface_form":"Alamanni","offset":540},{"uri":"Goths","surface_form":"Goths","offset":564},{"uri":"Vandals","surface_form":"Vandals","offset":571},{"uri":"Juthungi","surface_form":"Juthungi","offset":580},{"uri":"Sarmatians","surface_form":"Sarmatians","offset":590},{"uri":"Carpi","surface_form":"Carpi","offset":606},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":626},{"uri":"Sol_Invictus","surface_form":"Sol Invictus","offset":684},{"uri":"Marcus_Claudius_Tacitus","surface_form":"Tacitus","offset":755},{"uri":"Domitianus_II_(usurper)","surface_form":"Domitianus II (usurper)","offset":805}]}
