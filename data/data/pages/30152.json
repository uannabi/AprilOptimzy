{"id":30152,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mew_(Pok%C3%A9mon)","text":"Mew (\u30DF\u30E5\u30A6, Myuu) is a fictional character from the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" franchise. In the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" video games, it is a Psychic-type secret Pok\u00E9mon that was discovered in the first group of Pok\u00E9mon games: \"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue\", \"Green\", and \"Yellow\". Mew is the \"Red/Blue/Green/Yellow\" counterpart to the \"Gold/Silver/Crystal\" Celebi and the \"Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald\" Jirachi.\nThe name \"Mew\" refers to the sound made by a cat. Mew was secretly put in the game by one of the lead programmers, Shigeki Morimoto. When the Game Freak president, Satoshi Tajiri, found out about it, he told about it being in the game.\nMew is #151 in the Pok\u00E9dex and could only be obtained through special events or by using a cheating device like Gameshark, or a game-enhancing device. Mew can also be obtained in the original issues of the Pok\u00E9mon yellow and blue (US) by \u201Ccheat\u201D. If you get a Pok\u00E9mon early on (before going to Misty\u2019s gym or defeating man to the left of the nugget bridge) that has growl (charmander has it from the start) and an Abra or a Pok\u00E9mon that can fly but you can\u2019t fly this early in game (you can get an abra in the grass next to the nugget bridge but be careful not to battle the man standing above that grass he\u2019s needed later. After this go to the health center and heal, then go to the top of the nugget bridge and save. Head down to Misty\u2019s gym, go straight and take a right and challenge hit the guy trainer in a pool to the right use growl 6 times on his shelder then defeat him. Go back to the top of the nugget bridge and take a left to engage in battle with that man but press start right when you do and he should have a \u2757\uFE0F Over his head when you hit teleport (restart if you start the fight) and teleport back to the health center. Then run up the nugget bridge making sure to have a load of poke balls and the last Pok\u00E9mon you fought was that shelder after using growl on him 6 times, and you should have a random encounter with Mew. Also if you fight a Pok\u00E9mon that\u2019s low enough in level not to level your Mew up to level 2, it will automatically level up to 100.\nMewtwo.\nMewtwo is a \"Genetic\" species of Pok\u00E9mon that is number 150 in the Pok\u00E9dex. Mewtwo was cloned from Mew by scientists. It is a Psychic type Pok\u00E9mon. Mewtwo appeared in two movies: ' and '.\nIn \"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue\" the player first learns of Mewtwo by research papers left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island. Mewtwo is told to be a mutant child of Mew made after years of work by one scientist. Mewtwo is obtainable in the Cerulean Cave, which opens after defeating the Elite Four. In the remakes \"Pok\u00E9mon FireRed and LeafGreen\" the player now has to get 60 Pok\u00E9dex entries before they can go in the cave.\nIn Pok\u00E9mon X and Y, Mewtwo can be found in the Unknown Dungeon after entering the Hall of Fame. It can Mega Evolve into two different forms: Mega Mewtwo X using Mewtwonite X and Mega Mewtwo Y using Mewtwonite Y.\nMewtwo is a character in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", and is one of eleven playable characters that can be unlocked in the game. It uses the moves Shadow Ball, Confusion, Teleport, and Disable","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Pok\u00E9mon character"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":21},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":51},{"uri":"Video_games","surface_form":"video games","offset":88},{"uri":"Psychic","surface_form":"Psychic","offset":109},{"uri":"Celebi","surface_form":"Celebi","offset":317},{"uri":"Jirachi","surface_form":"Jirachi","offset":356},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":410},{"uri":"Satoshi_Tajiri","surface_form":"Satoshi Tajiri","offset":529},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9dex","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9dex","offset":620},{"uri":"Gameshark","surface_form":"Gameshark","offset":713},{"uri":"Game-enhancing_device","surface_form":"game-enhancing device","offset":729},{"uri":"Fly","surface_form":"fly","offset":1042},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":2114},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9dex","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9dex","offset":2148},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue","offset":2273},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":2365},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon FireRed and LeafGreen","offset":2585},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9dex","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9dex","offset":2645},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon X and Y","offset":2696},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Melee","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.
