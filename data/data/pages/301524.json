{"id":301524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenny","text":"A blenny is a member of a large suborder of teleost fish called the Blennioidei. The suborder has about 833 species in 130 genera.\nBlennies are generally small fish. They have long bodies (some almost eel-like), and relatively large eyes and mouths. Their dorsal fins are continuous and long. The pelvic fins have a single embedded spine, and are short and slender. The tail fin is rounded.\nThe blunt heads of blennies often have whisker-like structures called \"cirri\". As generally benthic fish, blennioids spend much of their time on or near the sea floor.\nThey are quite similar in form to some gobies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suborder","surface_form":"suborder","offset":32},{"uri":"Teleost","surface_form":"teleost","offset":44},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":52},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":108},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":123},{"uri":"Eel","surface_form":"eel","offset":201},{"uri":"Benthic","surface_form":"benthic","offset":483},{"uri":"Goby","surface_form":"gobies","offset":598}]}
