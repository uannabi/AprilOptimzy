{"id":30154,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille","text":"Marseille is a city in the south of France in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne department. About 1.7 million people live in the metropolitan area, and about 850,000 in the city itself. This makes it the second largest city in France by number of people. Its commercial port is the biggest in France and one of the most important in the Mediterranean sea.\nAlthough part of the region of Provence, Marseilles has its own history. This city is the oldest in France and probably the most complex. The city was started around 600 BC by Greek sailors from Phocaea (modern day Fo\u00E7a, near \u0130zmir). This was a Greek colony in Asia Minor that is in what is now Turkey.\nMarseille has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\" in the Koeppen climate classification).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":36},{"uri":"Bouches-du-Rh%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Bouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne","offset":50},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":160},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":257},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":280},{"uri":"Mediterranean_sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean sea","offset":324},{"uri":"Provence","surface_form":"Provence","offset":374},{"uri":"600_BC","surface_form":"600 BC","offset":509},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":519},{"uri":"Phocaea","surface_form":"Phocaea","offset":538},{"uri":"%C4%B0zmir","surface_form":"\u0130zmir","offset":569},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":594},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":604},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":638},{"uri":"Mediterranean_climate","surface_form":"Mediterranean climate","offset":673},{"uri":"Koeppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koeppen climate classification","offset":709}]}
