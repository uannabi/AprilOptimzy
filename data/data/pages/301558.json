These flowering plants are tall and leafy (herbaceous). They are biennial plants and are native to (come from) Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. They can grow to be tall.\nThese plants have a prickly stem and leaves. Its flowers are purple, dark pink, or lavender and grow directly on the end of the stem. After flowering, the head of the plant dries out and holds small seeds. These seeds are important food in the winter for birds, especially the European Goldfinch. Teasels are grown in gardens and nature reserves to attract these goldfinches.\nIn the United States, teasel is an invasive species. It is not native to the continent and takes over the land of native plant species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":12},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":25},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":72},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":97},{"uri":"Herbaceous","surface_form":"herbaceous","offset":134},{"uri":"Biennial_plant","surface_form":"biennial plant","offset":156},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":202},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":210},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":229},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":291},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":300},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":312},{"uri":"Purple","surface_form":"purple","offset":324},{"uri":"Pink","surface_form":"pink","offset":337},{"uri":"Lavender","surface_form":"lavender","offset":346},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":391},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":462},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":495},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":507},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":518},{"uri":"European_Goldfinch","surface_form":"European Goldfinch","offset":540},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":581},{"uri":"Nature_reserve","surface_form":"nature reserve","offset":593},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":646},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive species","offset":674},{"uri":"Native","surface_form":"native","offset":702},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":716}]}
