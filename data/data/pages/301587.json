{"id":301587,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing","text":"Free writing or stream-of-consciousness writing is a genre of writing. In free writing, a person writes continuously for a certain period of time. The writer does not need to pay attention to spelling or grammar and writes whatever comes to mind. In the writing process, free writing takes place during prewriting.\nThe writing that is created by free writing is raw and unusable. The process is sometimes used by writers to overcome writer's block, apathy, and self-criticism. It is mostly used by writing teachers and people who write prose (not poetry.)\nIt is sometimes thought to be a kind of brainstorming. In brainstorming, the writer lists ideas and possibilities. In free writing, the writer writes sentences to make paragraphs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":53},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":141},{"uri":"Writing_process","surface_form":"writing process","offset":254},{"uri":"Prewriting","surface_form":"prewriting","offset":303},{"uri":"Writer%27s_block","surface_form":"writer's block","offset":433},{"uri":"Apathy","surface_form":"apathy","offset":449},{"uri":"Self-criticism","surface_form":"self-criticism","offset":461},{"uri":"Prose","surface_form":"prose","offset":536},{"uri":"Brainstorming","surface_form":"brainstorming","offset":596},{"uri":"Write","surface_form":"write","offset":699},{"uri":"Paragraph","surface_form":"paragraph","offset":724}]}
