{"id":301607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan","text":"=\"preserve\">Kubla Khan is a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He wrote it in 1797, and it was published in 1816. It is a poem from the Romantic era, a time when people often made art about nature and emotions. Coleridge said that he wrote the poem after a dream he had, while on opium. He said that he was interrupted by a person from Porlock while he was writing it, and never got to finish it. Some people say that this is not completely true.\nThe first stanza of the poem describes a pleasure dome and a river called Alph, and the second stanza talks about an Abyssinian maid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","surface_form":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge","offset":36},{"uri":"Opium","surface_form":"opium","offset":278},{"uri":"Stanza","surface_form":"stanza","offset":455}]}
