{"id":301615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_shrimp","text":"Cleaner shrimp is a generic term for any swimming decapod crustacean that cleans other organisms of parasites. This is an example of symbiosis: Both parties benefit. The fish benefit because they have parasites removed, and the shrimp gain the nutritional value of the parasites. In many coral reefs, there are cleaning stations, with many cleaning shrimps.\nThis behaviour is similar to that of cleaner fish. Sometimes, cleaer shrimp join cleaner wrasse and other cleaner fish.\nCleaner shrimp are often included in salt water aquaria to keep the tank clean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Generic_term","surface_form":"generic term","offset":20},{"uri":"Swimming","surface_form":"swimming","offset":41},{"uri":"Decapoda","surface_form":"decapod","offset":50},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":58},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":100},{"uri":"Symbiosis","surface_form":"symbiosis","offset":133},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":288},{"uri":"Cleaning_station","surface_form":"cleaning station","offset":311},{"uri":"Cleaner_fish","surface_form":"cleaner fish","offset":395},{"uri":"Wrasse","surface_form":"cleaner wrasse","offset":439},{"uri":"Seawater","surface_form":"salt water","offset":515},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"aquaria","offset":526}]}
