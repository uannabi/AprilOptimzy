{"id":30164,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus","text":"e=\"preserve\">A thesaurus is a dictionary of synonyms (words that have the same or similar meaning). Thesauruses (or thesauri) often include related words that mean almost the same thing. Some thesauruses also include antonyms (words that have the opposite meaning).\nFor example, by looking up the word \"big\" in a thesaurus, someone would find a list of other similar words such as \"huge\" and \"massive\". If the thesaurus also has a list of antonyms, the user could also find words which mean the opposite, like \"small\" and \"tiny\".\nMany students and writers use a thesaurus to help them find words when they are writing. Using a thesaurus can help a person to improve their vocabulary (the number of words that they know).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionary","offset":30},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":44},{"uri":"Words","surface_form":"words","offset":148},{"uri":"Antonym","surface_form":"antonym","offset":217},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":535},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":548},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":610},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":672}]}
