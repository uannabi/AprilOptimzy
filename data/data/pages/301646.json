{"id":301646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Denke","text":"Karl Denke (August 12, 1870 \u2013 December 22, 1924) was a serial killer from Germany. He is one of the most well-known serial killers in Germany in the 1920s.\nDenke was born in M\u00FCnsterberg, Silesia in the Kingdom of Prussia (now Zi\u0119bice in Poland.) There is not a great deal of information about his early life. As an adult he was well liked in his community. He worked as an organ player at the local church.\nOn December 20, 1924, Denke was arrested after attacking a man at his house with an axe. Police searched Denke's home and found human flesh in huge jars of curing salts. A ledger (record book) contained the details of 30 people Denke had murdered and cannibalized (eaten) over the years. Police thought he sold the flesh of his victims at the Breslau (today's Wroc\u0142aw) market.\nThe day after his arrest, Denke hanged himself in his cell. His exact motives are unknown and can only be guessed at.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":55},{"uri":"Zi%C4%99bice","surface_form":"M\u00FCnsterberg","offset":174},{"uri":"Silesia","surface_form":"Silesia","offset":187},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Prussia","offset":202},{"uri":"Zi%C4%99bice","surface_form":"Zi\u0119bice","offset":226},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":237},{"uri":"Organ_(music)","surface_form":"organ","offset":373},{"uri":"Flesh","surface_form":"flesh","offset":541},{"uri":"Curing_(food_preservation)","surface_form":"curing","offset":563},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":570},{"uri":"Cannibalism","surface_form":"cannibalized","offset":658},{"uri":"Breslau","surface_form":"Breslau","offset":750},{"uri":"Wroc%C5%82aw","surface_form":"Wroc\u0142aw","offset":767},{"uri":"Motive","surface_form":"motive","offset":854}]}
