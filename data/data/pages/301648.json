{"id":301648,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taglish_and_Englog","text":"Taglish and Englog are the names of the mixed language family that developed in Manila from the of English and Tagalog languages, the common languages of the Philippines. There are several versions of it, including Co\u00F1o English, Jejenese and Swardspeak. There are attempts to differentiate the usage of Taglish and Englog where Taglish refers to the usage of English words in Tagalog syntax while Englog refers to the usage of Tagalog words in English syntax.\nTaglish and Englog are used by Filipinos in countries like Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It used in text messages to write more quickly.\nCharacteristics.\nEnglish action words, and even some naming words, can be Tagalog action words. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the action or naming word.\nThe English action word \"drive\" can be changed to the Tagalog word \"magda-drive\" meaning \"will drive\" (used in place of the Tagalog word \"magmamaneho\"). The English naming word \"Internet\" can also be changed to the Tagalog word \"nag-Internet\" meaning \"have used the Internet\".\nBecause its informal nature, experts of English and Tagalog discourage its use.\nJejenese.\nJejenese is the kind of speech used by people called \"Jejemons\". This is a subculture in the Philippines, made up of people who try to change the English language to better suit Spanish and Filipino. Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on Leet. Words are created by mixing letters in a word, mixed large and small letters, using the letters H, X or Z many times, and mixing of numbers in words. The spelling is the same as in Leet.\nSwardspeak.\nSwardspeak is a kind of Taglish and Englog used by gay people. It is a form of slang. Swardspeak uses words from Tagalog, English, Spanish, Cebuano, Japanese, Sanskrit, and other languages. Names of Celebrities and trademark brands are also used.\nCo\u00F1o English.\nCo\u00F1o English (tl: \"Konyo\") or Colegiala English (es:) is a creole of Taglish and Englog that originated from the children in rich families of Manila. The word \"co\u00F1o\" itself came from the Spanish word \"co\u00F1o\". It is a form of Philippine English that has Spanish and Tagalog words. Unlike other forms of Taglish and Englog, Co\u00F1o English sounds more gentle and feminine.\nSometimes, Tagalog interjections such as \"ano\", \"naman\", \"pa\", \"na\" (or \"nah\"), \"no\" (or \"noh\"), \"a\" (or \"ha\"), \"e\" (or \"eh\"), and \"o\" (or \"oh\") are placed to add emphasis.\n\"No\" and \"a\" (from the Tagalog word \"ano\") are used for questions and are added to the end of a sentence only. \"Ano\" (meaning \"what\") is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end.\n\"E\" (added to answers to questions) and \"o\" (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. \"Pa\" (meaning \"not yet\", \"not yet done\", \"to continue\", or \"still\") and \"na\" (meaning \"now\", \"already\", or \"already done\") can be placed in the middle or end. \"Naman\" (same as \"na\" but mostly for emphasis only) is placed anywhere.\nThe interjection \"no?\" (equal to the Spanish \"\u00BFno?\" and the German \"nicht?\") is pronounced as or (with a pure vowel instead of the English glide), which shows influence from Spanish.\nEnglish description words are often replaced with Tagalog action words. The language also has many Spanish words or Spanish words like \"ba\u00F1o\" (\"bathroom\"),","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Code-switching","surface_form":"mixed language","offset":40},{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"family","offset":55},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":80},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":99},{"uri":"Tagalog_language","surface_form":"Tagalog language","offset":111},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":158},{"uri":"Jejemon","surface_form":"Jejenese","offset":229},{"uri":"Swardspeak","surface_form":"Swardspeak","offset":242},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":519},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":530},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":542},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":563},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":580},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":603},{"uri":"Cellphone","surface_form":"text messages","offset":630},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"action words","offset":692},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"naming words","offset":720},{"uri":"Tagalog_language","surface_form":"Tagalog","offset":741},{"uri":"Prefix","surface_form":"prefix","offset":807},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":1095},{"uri":"Jejemon","surface_form":"Jejemon","offset":1338},{"uri":"Subculture","surface_form":"subculture","offset":1359},{"uri":"Leet","surface_form":"Leet","offset":1521},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":1777},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":1805},{"uri":"Tagalog_language","surface_form":"Tagalog","offset":1839},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1848},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1857},{"uri":"Cebuano_language","surface_form":"Cebuano","offset":1866},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1875},{"uri":"Sanskrit_language","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":1885},{"uri":"Tagalog_language","surface_form":"tl","offset":2001},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"es","offset":2036},{"uri":"Creole","surface_form":"creole","offset":2046},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":2129},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":2174},{"uri":"Co%C3%B1o","surface_form":"co\u00F1o","offset":2188},{"uri":"Feminine","surface_form":"feminine","offset":2344},{"uri":"Interjection","surface_form":"interjection","offset":2373},{"uri":"Question","surface_form":"question","offset":2583},{"uri":"Exclamation_point","surface_form":"exclamations","offset":2801},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":3138},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"description words","offset":3269},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"words","offset":3385}]}
