He rebelled against Nero's high taxes. In order to become more powerful, he allied with the governor of Hispania (modern-day Spain), Galba (who would become ruler during the \"year of the four emperors\").\nVindex was killed in battle by Rufus, the governor of Germania (modern-day Germany), however, when Nero killed himself and Galba became emperor (June 68AD), Galba made coins dedicated to Vindex.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":38},{"uri":"Nero","surface_form":"Nero","offset":112},{"uri":"Gaul","surface_form":"Gaul","offset":159},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":176},{"uri":"Hispania","surface_form":"Hispania","offset":289},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":310},{"uri":"Galba","surface_form":"Galba","offset":318},{"uri":"Year_of_the_four_emperors","surface_form":"year of the four emperors","offset":360},{"uri":"Germania","surface_form":"Germania","offset":443},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":464},{"uri":"Galba","surface_form":"Galba","offset":512},{"uri":"Galba","surface_form":"Galba","offset":546}]}
