{"id":301997,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_at_the_Olympics","text":"The People's Republic of China (PRC) was first at the 1952 Summer Olympics. That year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) let both the PRC and the Republic of China (which recently moved to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War) compete. The Republic of China withdrew in protest. Because of the political status of China, the PRC was not in the Olympics again until 1980.\nThe Chinese Olympic Committee was formed in 1910 and recognized in 1979. Before the Chinese Civil War, athletes competed as the Republic of China (ROC) at the Olympics. In 1979, the International Olympic Committee passed a resolution for the ROC team to be called \"Chinese Taipei\", and this opened the door for the PRC to finally join the Olympic movement.\nHong Kong has had a distinct National Olympic Committee since 1950 and has been at the Games since 1952. After the territory returned to the PRC this has continued, with Hong Kong separate from the rest of the nation under the name \"Hong Kong, China\".\nThe People's Republic of China hosted the Games one time: the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nSummer Games.\nAs of 2012, China has a total of 473 medals in the Summer Games.\nWinter Games.\nAs of 2012, China has a total of 44 medals in the Winter Games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":4},{"uri":"1952_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1952 Summer Olympics","offset":54},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":91},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":154},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":197},{"uri":"Chinese_Civil_War","surface_form":"Chinese Civil War","offset":214},{"uri":"Compete","surface_form":"compete","offset":233},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":276},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":300},{"uri":"1980_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"1980","offset":371},{"uri":"Recognize","surface_form":"recognized","offset":430},{"uri":"Chinese_Civil_War","surface_form":"Chinese Civil War","offset":461},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":559},{"uri":"Chinese_Taipei_at_the_Olympics","surface_form":"Chinese Taipei","offset":642},{"uri":"Hong_Kong_at_the_Olympics","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":734},{"uri":"National_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"National Olympic Committee","offset":763},{"uri":"2008_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2008 Summer Olympics","offset":1048},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":1072}]}
