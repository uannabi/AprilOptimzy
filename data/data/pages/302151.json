The smallest pair of twin primes is 3 and 5. Next comes 5 and 7. Then comes 11 and 13, and then 17 and 19.\nIsolated prime.\nAn isolated prime is a prime number \"p\" where neither \"p\" - 2 nor \"p\" + 2 is prime. In other words, \"p\" is not part of a twin prime pair. For example, 23 is an isolated prime since 21 and 25 are both not prime numbers.\nThe first few isolated primes are","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":38}]}
