His father, Charles, was the Emperor of Austria and the King of Hungary. The murder of his great uncle, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was the event that led to the start of World War I. His family fled Austria in 1919 after the war.\nDuring World War II he opposed the Nazis and Nazi Germany's takeover over Austria. Adolf Hitler ordered him to be put to death, but Habsburg left France and spent the war in the USA. Habsburg gave up his claim to the throne in 1961, and was allowed to return to Austria five years later. He was a member of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria and became a member of the European Parliament and pushed to get the former communist countries of Eastern Europe allowed into the European Union.\nHe was buried in the Imperial Tomb in Vienna, but his heart was buried at an abbey near Budapest, Hungary, as part of a tradition that goes back to medieval times.\nDuring his lifetime he was also known as Achduke Otto of Austria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crown_Prince","surface_form":"Crown Prince","offset":197},{"uri":"Austro-Hungarian_Empire","surface_form":"Austro-Hungarian Empire","offset":217},{"uri":"Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria","surface_form":"Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria","offset":346},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":421},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":450},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":488},{"uri":"Nazi_Party","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":516},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":526},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":564},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":627},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":659},{"uri":"Christian_Social_Union_of_Bavaria","surface_form":"Christian Social Union of Bavaria","offset":792},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":853},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":902},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":957},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":1011},{"uri":"Abbey","surface_form":"abbey","offset":1050},{"uri":"Budapest","surface_form":"Budapest","offset":1061},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":1071},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":1121}]}
