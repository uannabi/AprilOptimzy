His family was a Saryupareen Brahmin family of Vasishtha \"Gotra\". His birth time was 10:34\u00A0pm and he was born on the Makar Sankranti day of Saturday, January\u00A014,\u00A01950 (Magha Krishna Ekadashi). His mother was Shachidevi and his father was Pandit Rajdev Mishra. His name \"Giridhara\" was named by his father's aunt, a cousin of his grandfather Pandit Suryabali Mishra. His father's aunt was an admirer of Mirabai, a female saint of the Bhakti age in middle India, who used the name Giridhara for Krishna in her compositions.\nBlindness.\nGiridhara became blind in March 1950 when he was aged two months. When he got the eye disease trachoma, there was no medical care in his village. He was taken to a local woman who was known to cure Trachoma. She dropped a hot medicine into his eyes to break the Trachoma lumps, but his eyes started bleeding and he became blind. His family took him to many Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic and medical doctors in Sitapur, Lucknow and Mumbai, but there was no help. He cannot read or write, as he does not use the Braille system, but learns by listening and composes by dictating to secretaries.\nFirst musical work.\nAs Giridhara's father used to work in Bombay, his early learning was at home from his grandfather. During afternoons, his grandfather used to tell him various parts of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and other books like \"Vishramsagar\", \"Sukhsagar\", \"Premsagar\", and \"Brajvilas\", etc. When he was of 3 years, Giridhara made his first poem in Hindi (Avadhi), which was the following \"pada\". He spoke it to his grandfather. In this poem, Yashoda is fighting with a Gopi for causing pain to Krishna.\n\"\u092E\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u093F\u0930\u093F\u0927\u093E\u0930\u0940 \u091C\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093E\u0939\u0947 \u0932\u0930\u0940 \u0964\"\n\"\u0924\u0941\u092E \u0924\u0930\u0941\u0923\u0940 \u092E\u0947\u0930\u094B \u0917\u093F\u0930\u093F\u0927\u0930 \u092C\u093E\u0932\u0915 \u0915\u093E\u0939\u0947 \u092D\u0941\u091C\u093E \u092A\u0915\u0930\u0940 \u0965\"\n\"\u0938\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0915\u093F \u0938\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0915\u093F \u092E\u0947\u0930\u094B \u0917\u093F\u0930\u093F\u0927\u0930 \u0930\u094B\u0935\u0924 \u0924\u0942 \u092E\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0915\u093E\u0924 \u0916\u0930\u0940 \u0965\"\n\"\u0924\u0942 \u0905\u0939\u093F\u0930\u093F\u0928 \u0905\u0924\u093F\u0938\u092F \u091D\u0917\u0930\u093E\u090A \u092C\u0930\u092C\u0938 \u0906\u092F \u0916\u0930\u0940 \u0965\"\n\"\u0917\u093F\u0930\u093F\u0927\u0930 \u0915\u0930 \u0917\u0939\u093F \u0915\u0939\u0924 \u091C\u0938\u094B\u0926\u093E \u0906\u0901\u091A\u0930 \u0913\u091F \u0915\u0930\u0940 \u0965\"\nmere giridh\u0101r\u012B j\u012B se k\u0101he lar\u012B \u0964\ntuma taru\u1E47\u012B mero giridhara b\u0101laka k\u0101he bhuj\u0101 pakar\u012B \u0965\nsusuki susuki mero giridhara rovata t\u016B musuk\u0101ta khar\u012B \u0965\nt\u016B ahirina atisaya jhagar\u0101\u016B barabasa \u0101ya khar\u012B \u0965\ngiridhara kara gahi kahata jasod\u0101 \u0101\u0149cara o\u1E6Da kar\u012B \u0965\nLearning Gita and Ramcharitmanas.\nHaving a great memory, Giridhar learnt all 700\u00A0verses of Bhagavad Gita at in 15 days when he was 5 years old. His neighbour, Pandit Murlidhar Mishra, helped him. On the Janmashtami day in 1955, he read out the whole Bhagavad Gita. By accident, 52\u00A0years after the day he learnt the Gita, he released the first ever Braille form of Gita at New Delhi on November\u00A030,\u00A02007, with the real Sanskrit text and a Hindi series of comments. When Giridhara was seven years old, he learned the whole Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (close to 10,900\u00A0verses) in 60\u00A0days. His grandfather helped him. On Ram Navmi day of 1957, he spoke the whole book while not eating food because of religious reasons. After that, Giridhara went on to learn the Vedas, Upanishads, books on Sanskrit grammar, the Bhagavata Puran, all books of Tulasidas and many other books.\nHis \"Upanayana\" (A sacred thread ceremony) was done on the Nirjala Ekadashi day of June\u00A024,\u00A01961. On this day, he got the Gayatri Mantra, and he was given Diksha into the Mantra of R\u0101ma by Pandit Ishvardas Maharaj of Ayodhya. After learning Gita and Ramcharitmanas to high level of skills at a very young age, Giridhara started visiting the Katha programmes held one time in 3 years (in the Purushottama month) near his village. When he went to the third event, he showed a Katha on Ramcharitmanas which was highly respected by many famous representers of the Katha art.\nSchooling.\nOn 7\u00A0July,\u00A01967, Giridhara Mi\u015Bra joined the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College in Jaunpur to study Sanskrit Grammar as well Hindi, English, Maths, History and Geography. As he has the ability to memorize everything by just listening it one time, he never used Braille or other help to learn. In three months, he had learned the whole Laghusiddh\u0101ntakaumud\u012B of Varadar\u0101ja to a high level. He was the best student and got most marks in tests in his class for four years, passing the primary to secondary tests in Sanskrit with best grades and a thing which makes him better than others.\nFirst composition in Sanskrit.\nWhen Girihara was in Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College, he learnt the eight Ga\u1E47as while learning \"Chandaprabh\u0101\", a book on Sanskrit poetic metre. On the next day, he made his first Sanskrit poetic form, in the \"Bhuja\u1E45gapray\u0101ta\" metre.\nHigher Learning.\nIn 1971, Giridhara Mi\u015Bra entered at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi for higher learning of Vy\u0101kara\u1E47a. He got most marks in the final test for the \"\u015A\u0101str\u012B\" (three years' first degree) in 1974. He then registered for a Master's degree at the same university. While trying to get the master's degree, he went New Delhi to take part in many national contests at the \"Akhila Bh\u0101rat\u012Bya Sanskrit Adhive\u015Bana\" (All-India Sanskrit Conference). There he won five gold medals in Vy\u0101kara\u1E47a, S\u0101\u1E45khya, Ny\u0101ya, Ved\u0101nta and Sanskrit Anty\u0101k\u1E63ar\u012B out of eight. Then the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, gave the five gold medals with the \"Calavaijayant\u012B\" prize for Uttar Pradesh to Giridhara. Surprised by his abilities, Indira Gandhi gave him the offer to send him to the United States of America for medical care of his eyes, but Giridhara Mi\u015Bra did not accepted this offer. In 1976, he got most marks in the final \"\u0100c\u0101rya\" (two years' Master's degree) tests in Vy\u0101kara\u1E47a, he also won seven gold awards and the \"Chancellor's gold award\". In an uncommon achievement, though he had registered for a master's degree in Vy\u0101kara\u1E47a only, he was made \"\u0100c\u0101rya\" of all subjects which were taught at the university for his all-round qualities on April\u00A030,\u00A01976.\nHighest degree and post-doctorate.\nGiridhara began studying for a PhD also at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. Pandit Ramprasad Tripathi supervised his studies. Giridhara got a scholarship from the \"University Grants Commission\" (UGC) by passing an examination. However, he had money problem for several years. He completed his PhD in Sanskrit grammar on October\u00A014,\u00A01981. He wrote about the language of the poet P\u0101\u1E47in\u012B in the Ramayana. UGC then offered him a job as head of the Vy\u0101kara\u1E47a department of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. However, Giridhara Mi\u015Bra did not take the job. He decided to give his life to the service of his religion, the world, and the disabled.\nIn 1997 he was awarded the post-doctorate V\u0101caspati (DLitt) degree by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University for his lecture called \"Search into spoken knowledge of every S\u016Btra of the A\u1E63\u1E6D\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012B\" in English (Original title: \"A\u1E63\u1E6D\u0101dhy\u0101yy\u0101\u1E25 Pratis\u016Btra\u1E43 \u015A\u0101bdabodhasam\u012Bk\u1E63a\u1E47am\"). He described each phrase of the sutra carefully. He told about P\u0101\u1E47in\u012B's grammar and use of Sanskrit poetic forms.\nVirakta Diksha.\nIn 1976, Giridhara Mi\u015Bra said aloud a Kath\u0101 on R\u0101mcaritam\u0101nasa to Sv\u0101m\u012B Karap\u0101tr\u012B. Sv\u0101m\u012B Karap\u0101tr\u012B advised him not to marry, to live a lifelong Brahmac\u0101rin, and to take start in a Vai\u1E63\u1E47ava Samprad\u0101ya. Giridhara Mi\u015Bra took Vairagi start (Virakta D\u012Bk\u1E63\u0101) in the R\u0101m\u0101nanda Samprad\u0101ya (monastic order) on the K\u0101rtika full-moon day of November\u00A019,\u00A01983 from \u015Ar\u012B \u015Ar\u012B 1008 \u015Ar\u012B R\u0101macara\u1E47ad\u0101sa Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ph\u0101l\u0101h\u0101r\u012B. He now came to be known as R\u0101mabhadrad\u0101sa.\nRambhadradas had a six month \"Payovrata\", which is a diet only of milk and fruits, at Chitrakoot in 1979 per the following fifth verse of the \"Dohavali\" made by Tulsidas.\nIn 1987 Rambhadradas established a religious and social service institution in Chitrakoot, where, as per the Ramayana, Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile. Its name is Tulsi Peeth (the seat of Tulsi). As he is the founder of the institution, Sadhus gave him the title of \"\u015Ar\u012Bcitrak\u016B\u1E6Datulas\u012Bp\u012B\u1E6Dh\u0101dh\u012B\u015Bvara\" (which means the God of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot). In the Tulsi Peeth, there a temple of Rama and Sita, and its name is Kanch Mandir (\"glass temple\").\nTitle of Jagadguru Ramanandacharya.\nRambhadradas was made Jagadguru Ramanandacharya seated at the Tulsi Peeth by the Kashi Vidwat Parishad in Varanasi on 24 June 1988, and this order was supported by the \"Mahants\" of three \"Akharas\", the four sub-\"Sampradayas\", the \"Khalsas\" and saints of the Ramananda Sampradaya on 3\u00A0February\u00A01989, at the \"Kumbh Mela\" in Allahabad. On 1\u00A0August\u00A01995 he was anointed as the \"Jagadguru Ramanandacharya\" in a ritual manner in Ayodhya by the \"Digambar Akhara\". After that he is known as \"Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya\".\nInstitutes for the disabled.\nSwami Rambhadracharya started the Tulsi School for the Blind in Chitrakoot on 23\u00A0August\u00A01996. He also started the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University in Chitrakoot on 27\u00A0September\u00A02001. This is the first university in the world entirely for disabled students. It was created by a local law of the Uttar Pradesh Government, which was afterwards accepted as the Uttar Pradesh State Act 32 (2001) by the Uttar Pradesh legislature. This act assigned Jagadguru Rambhadracharya as the chancellor of this university for his entire life. The university offers graduate, post-graduate and doctorate degrees in many arts and sciences.
