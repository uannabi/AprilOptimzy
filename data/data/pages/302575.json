{"id":302575,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)","text":"Juno is an unmanned NASA New Frontiers spacecraft. It studies the planet Jupiter from orbit. It is the first mission to an outer planet to use solar panel<nowiki/>s for power instead of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The spacecraft was launched on August 5, 2011 from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016. Scott Bolton is leading the mission.\nJuno's main goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Juno will also study the planet's atmospheric composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/Instruments"],"annotations":[{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":20},{"uri":"New_Frontiers","surface_form":"New Frontiers","offset":25},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":39},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":73},{"uri":"Outer_planet","surface_form":"outer planet","offset":123},{"uri":"Solar_panel","surface_form":"solar panel","offset":143},{"uri":"Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator","surface_form":"radioisotope thermoelectric generator","offset":188},{"uri":"Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","surface_form":"Cape Canaveral Air Force Station","offset":282},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity field","offset":536},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":551},{"uri":"Magnetosphere","surface_form":"magnetosphere","offset":577}]}
