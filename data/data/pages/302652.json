It passes between Bali and Lombok, which are separated by a passage of water which is both deep and fast. On the one side are Australasian species, and on the other side Asian species. The natural history of the area was investigated by Alfred Russel Wallace, who spent eight years in the Spice Islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":36},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeastern Asia","offset":65},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":87},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian","offset":253},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":264},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":306},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":392},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":411},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":426},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":439},{"uri":"Brunei","surface_form":"Brunei","offset":450},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":463},{"uri":"East_Timor","surface_form":"East Timor","offset":476},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":502},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":527},{"uri":"Moluccas","surface_form":"Moluccas","offset":624},{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":734},{"uri":"Orogeny","surface_form":"orogeny","offset":777},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":801},{"uri":"Wallace_Line","surface_form":"Wallace Line","offset":827},{"uri":"Biogeography","surface_form":"biogeography","offset":857},{"uri":"Bali","surface_form":"Bali","offset":889},{"uri":"Lombok","surface_form":"Lombok","offset":898},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":997},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1010},{"uri":"Asian","surface_form":"Asian","offset":1041},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1047},{"uri":"Alfred_Russel_Wallace","surface_form":"Alfred Russel Wallace","offset":1108},{"uri":"Spice_Islands","surface_form":"Spice Islands","offset":1160}]}
