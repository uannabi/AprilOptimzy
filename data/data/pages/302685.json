{"id":302685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque","text":"The macaques are a genus (\"Macaca\") of Old World monkeys of the subfamily Cercopithecinae. The 22 species of macaques live in sub-Saharan Africa, and more widely in Asia. One species is the well-known Gibraltar 'ape'. Macaques are of some interest to human researchers for their social structures, and their usefulness in animal testing, particularly regarding eyesight.\nSocial behavior.\nMacaques have a very intricate social structure and hierarchy. If a macaque of a lower level in the social chain has eaten berries and none are left for a higher-level macaque, then the one higher in status can, within this social organization, remove the berries from the other monkey's mouth.\nCopyright test case.\nIn 2014 selfies taken by a crested black macaque seemed to establish a legal precedent, after the Wikimedia Foundation rejected a copyright claim.\nThe photos had been sold widely by David Slater, a professional nature photographer, whose camera was temporarily carried away by a group of macaques. After the photos were uploaded to Wikipedia, the organisation refused to delete them, claiming \"This file is in the public domain, because as the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":19},{"uri":"Old_World_monkey","surface_form":"Old World monkey","offset":39},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":98},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":138},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":165},{"uri":"Gibraltar","surface_form":"Gibraltar","offset":201},{"uri":"Eyesight","surface_form":"eyesight","offset":361},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchy","offset":440},{"uri":"Selfie","surface_form":"selfie","offset":712},{"uri":"Precedent","surface_form":"precedent","offset":781},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Foundation","surface_form":"Wikimedia Foundation","offset":802},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":834},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":922},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":942},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":1036}]}
