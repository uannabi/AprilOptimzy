{"id":302729,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocyclic_reaction","text":"The torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction that the substituents rotate. For example, the substituents in a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions. It produces a mixture of two products that are the mirror image of each other (enantiomeric products). A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess (where one stereoisomer is produced much more than the other).\nChemists are interested in electrocyclic reactions because the geometry of the molecules confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists. They confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry.\nThe Nazarov cyclization reaction is an electrocyclic reaction that closes a ring. It converts divinylketones to cyclopentenones. (It was discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906\u20131957).)\nThe stereospecificity of the result depends on whether the reaction proceeds through a conrotatory or disrotatory process.\nWoodward-Hoffman rules.\nThe Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules address the conservation of orbital symmetry in electrocylic reactions.\nCorrelation diagrams connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to those of the product having the same symmetry. Correlation diagrams can be drawn for the two processes.\nThese correlation diagrams indicate that only a conrotatory ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene is \"symmetry allowed\" whereas only a disrotatory ring opening of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene is \"symmetry allowed\". This is because only in these cases would maximum orbital overlap occur in the transition state. Also, the formed product would be in a ground state rather than an excited state.\nFrontier molecular orbital theory.\nThe Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory predicts that the sigma bond in the ring will open in a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product.\nThe above diagram shows two examples. For the 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene (top row of diagram), only a disrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of hexatriene. The two p-orbitals rotate in opposite directions. For the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene (bottom row of diagram), only a conrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of butadiene. The p-oribtals rotate in the same direction.\nExcited state electrocyclizations.\nOnly a disrotatory mode, in which symmetry about a reflection plane is maintained throughout the reaction, would result in maximum orbital overlap in the transition state. Also, once again, this would result in the formation of a product that is in an excited state of comparable stability to the excited state of the reactant compound.\nElectrocyclic reactions in biological systems.\nElectrocyclic reactions occur frequently in nature. One of the most common such reactions in nature is the biosynthesis of vitamin D3.\nThe first step involves light opening the ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol to form pre vitamin D3. This is a photochemically induced conrotatory electrocyclic reaction. The second step is a [1,7]-hydride shift to make vitamin D3.\nAnother example is in the proposed biosynthesis of aranotin, an oxepine found in nature, and its related compounds.\nPhenylalanine is used to make diketopiperazine (not shown). Then enzymes epoxidate diketopiperazine to make the arene oxide. This undergoes a 6\u03C0 disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization reaction to produce the uncyclized oxepine. After a second epoxidation of the ring, the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon, forming a five membered ring. The resulting ring system is a common ring system found in aranotin and its related compounds.\nScope.\nAn example of an electrocyclic reaction is the conrotatory thermal ring-opening of benzocyclobutane. The reaction product is a very unstable ortho-quinodimethane. This molecule can be trapped in an endo addition with a strong dienophile such as maleic anhydride to the Diels-Alder adduct. The chemical yield for the ring opening of the benzocyclobutane depicted in \"scheme 2\" is found to depend on the nature of the substituent R. With a reaction solvent such as toluene and a reaction temperature of 110\u00A0\u00B0C, the yield increases going from methyl to isobutylmethyl to trimethylsilylmethyl. The increased reaction rate for the trimethylsilyl compound can be explained by silicon hyperconjugation as the \u03B2C-Si bond weakens the cyclobutane C-C bond by donating electrons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Torquoselectivity","surface_form":"torquoselectivity","offset":4},{"uri":"Substituent","surface_form":"substituent","offset":84},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotate","offset":97},{"uri":"Enantiomeric","surface_form":"enantiomeric","offset":284},{"uri":"Product_(chemistry)","surface_form":"product","offset":428},{"uri":"Enantiomeric_excess","surface_form":"enantiomeric excess","offset":439},{"uri":"Stereoisomer","surface_form":"stereoisomer","offset":470},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"Chemist","offset":522},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":585},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":601},{"uri":"Theoretical_chemistry","surface_form":"theoretical chemists","offset":651},{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":690},{"uri":"Nazarov_cyclization_reaction","surface_form":"Nazarov cyclization reaction","offset":738},{"uri":"Divinylketone","surface_form":"divinylketone","offset":828},{"uri":"Cyclopentenone","surface_form":"cyclopentenone","offset":846},{"uri":"Stereospecificity","surface_form":"stereospecificity","offset":928},{"uri":"Woodward%E2%80%93Hoffmann_rules","surface_form":"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules","offset":1075},{"uri":"Molecular_symmetry","surface_form":"orbital symmetry","offset":1127},{"uri":"Correlation","surface_form":"Correlation","offset":1171},{"uri":"Diagram","surface_form":"diagram","offset":1183},{"uri":"Orbital_overlap","surface_form":"orbital overlap","offset":1616},{"uri":"Occur","surface_form":"occur","offset":1632},{"uri":"Ground_state","surface_form":"ground state","offset":1702},{"uri":"Excited_state","surface_form":"excited state","offset":1730},{"uri":"Frontier_Molecular_Orbital_Theory","surface_form":"Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory","offset":1784},{"uri":"Predicts","surface_form":"predicts","offset":1818},{"uri":"Reflection_plane","surface_form":"reflection plane","offset":2507},{"uri":"Stability","surface_form":"stability","offset":2736},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":2884},{"uri":"Biosynthesis","surface_form":"biosynthesis","offset":2947},{"uri":"Vitamin_D3","surface_form":"vitamin D3","offset":2963},{"uri":"Photochemistry","surface_form":"photochemically","offset":3080},{"uri":"Aranotin","surface_form":"aranotin","offset":3252},{"uri":"Oxepine","surface_form":"oxepine","offset":3265},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compound","offset":3306},{"uri":"Diketopiperazine","surface_form":"diketopiperazine","offset":3347},{"uri":"Nucleophile","surface_form":"nucleophilic","offset":3601},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":3614},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attacks","offset":3623},{"uri":"Electrophile","surface_form":"electrophilic","offset":3635},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":3649},{"uri":"Endo_isomer","surface_form":"endo addition","offset":3987},{"uri":"Dienophile","surface_form":"dienophile","offset":4015},{"uri":"Maleic_anhydride","surface_form":"maleic anhydride","offset":4034},{"uri":"Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction","surface_form":"Diels-Alder","offset":4058},{"uri":"Adduct","surface_form":"adduct","offset":4070},{"uri":"Yield_(chemistry)","surface_form":"chemical yield","offset":4082},{"uri":"Substituent","surface_form":"substituent","offset":4205},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":4236},{"uri":"Toluene","surface_form":"toluene","offset":4252},{"uri":"Methyl","surface_form":"methyl","offset":4329},{"uri":"Reaction_rate","surface_form":"reaction rate","offset":4393},{"uri":"Trimethylsilyl","surface_form":"trimethylsilyl","offset":4415},{"uri":"Silicon_hyperconjugation","surface_form":"silicon hyperconjugation","offset":4459},{"uri":"Donate","surface_form":"donating","offset":4538}]}
