The family is typical of the nettle order.\nDescription.\nMany species, especially the nettles (\"Urtica\") and Australian nettle trees (\"Laportea\"), have stinging hairs on the stems and leaves. The leaves are varied and the sap is usually watery.\nThe small, greenish flowers often form clusters in the leaf axils. Both male and female flowers may be borne on the same plant. The curled stamens of the male flowers straighten quickly as the flowers open, releasing the pollen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urticales","surface_form":"nettle order","offset":176},{"uri":"Nettle","surface_form":"nettle","offset":232}]}
