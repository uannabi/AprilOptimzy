{"id":302808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericyclic_reaction","text":"In general, pericyclic reactions are equilibrium processes. However, it is possible to push the reaction in one direction if the product is at a significantly lower energy level. This is applying Le Chatelier's principle to a reaction involving a single molecule.\nMany pericyclic reactions have similar stepwise radical processes connected with them. Chemists disagree whether some reactions are pericyclic reactions. For example, it is not definitively known whether the [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism is concerted (or may depend on the reactive system). Many pericyclic reactions have similar reactions that are metal-catalyzed. But these metal-catalyzed reactions are also not really pericyclic. The metal catalysts stabilize the reaction intermediates. So the reaction is not concerted, but rather metal-stabilized.\nA large photoinduced hydrogen sigmatropic shift was utilized in a corrin synthesis performed by Albert Eschenmoser containing a 16\u03C0 system.\nDue to the principle of microscopic reversibility, there is a parallel set of \"retro\" pericyclic reactions, which perform the reverse reaction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_equilibrium","surface_form":"equilibrium processes","offset":37},{"uri":"Le_Chatelier%27s_principle","surface_form":"Le Chatelier's principle","offset":196},{"uri":"Radical_(chemistry)","surface_form":"radical","offset":312},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":708},{"uri":"Corrin","surface_form":"corrin","offset":885},{"uri":"Albert_Eschenmoser","surface_form":"Albert Eschenmoser","offset":915},{"uri":"Microscopic_reversibility","surface_form":"microscopic reversibility","offset":983}]}
