{"id":302815,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloaddition","text":"A cycloaddition is a chemical reaction between reactants with double bonds that get replaced by a ring structure. It is a pericyclic chemical reaction where \"two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity.\" It is a cyclization reaction: it makes new ring of atoms.\nCycloadditions are named by the basic size of the molecules that are being brought together. This would make the Diels\u2013Alder reaction a [4 + 2]cycloaddition, and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition a [3 + 2]cycloaddition. This type of reaction is a non-polar addition reaction.\nReaction mechanism.\nHeat can cause the double bonds to form a ring. Thermal cycloadditions usually have (4n + 2) \u03C0 electrons participating in the starting material, for some whole number \"n\". Because of orbital symmetry, most cycloadditions are suprafacial-suprafacial. Rarely, they are antarafacial-antarafacial. There are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n \u03C0 electrons (for example the [2 + 2] cycloaddition). These proceed in a suprafacial-antarafacial sense. For example, the dimerisation of ketene has a orthogonal set of p orbitals. Those p orbitals allow the reaction to proceed using a crossed transition state.\nLight can also cause the double bonds to form a ring. Cycloadditions in which 4n \u03C0 electrons participate can also occur as a result of photochemical activation. Here, one component makes an electron move from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (\u03C0 bonding) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (\u03C0* antibonding). After the electron is promoted to the higher orbital, orbital symmetry allows the reaction to proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. An example is the DeMayo reaction. Another example is shown below, the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid.\nNote that not all photochemical (2+2) cyclizations are cycloadditions; some are known to operate by radical mechanisms.\nIn the (i+j+...) cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atoms involved in the cycloaddition. In this notation a Diels-Alder reaction is a (4+2)cycloaddition and a 1,3-dipolar addition such as the first step in ozonolysis is a (3+2)cycloaddition. This notation uses parenthesis. The IUPAC preferred notation however, with [i+j+...] counts electrons and not atoms. It uses square brackets. In this notation, the Diels\u2013Alder reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a [4+2]cycloaddition. The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne is a [2+2+2]cycloaddition.\nDiels-Alder reactions.\nThe Diels\u2013Alder reaction is a [4+2]cycloaddition reaction.\nHuisgen cycloadditions.\nThe Huisgen cycloaddition reaction is a [2+3]cycloaddition.\nNitrone-olefin cycloaddition.\nThe Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition is a [3+2]cycloaddition.\nFormal cycloadditions.\nCycloadditions often have metal-catalyzed and stepwise radical analogs, however these are not strictly speaking pericyclic reactions. When charged or radical intermediates are involved in a cycloaddition, or when the cycloaddition result is found in a series of reaction steps, they are sometimes called formal cycloadditions to make a difference from true pericyclic cycloadditions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":21},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":103},{"uri":"Pericyclic_reaction","surface_form":"pericyclic","offset":122},{"uri":"Cyclization","surface_form":"cyclization","offset":339},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":439},{"uri":"Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction","surface_form":"Diels\u2013Alder reaction","offset":502},{"uri":"1%2C3-dipolar_cycloaddition","surface_form":"1,3-dipolar cycloaddition","offset":555},{"uri":"Addition_reaction","surface_form":"addition reaction","offset":642},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"Heat","offset":681},{"uri":"Orbital_symmetry","surface_form":"orbital symmetry","offset":864},{"uri":"Suprafacial","surface_form":"suprafacial","offset":906},{"uri":"Antarafacial","surface_form":"antarafacial","offset":948},{"uri":"Dimer","surface_form":"dimer","offset":1161},{"uri":"Ketene","surface_form":"ketene","offset":1177},{"uri":"Orthogonal","surface_form":"orthogonal","offset":1190},{"uri":"P_orbital","surface_form":"p orbital","offset":1208},{"uri":"Transition_state","surface_form":"transition state","offset":1283},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"Light","offset":1301},{"uri":"Photochemistry","surface_form":"photochemical","offset":1436},{"uri":"HOMO","surface_form":"HOMO","offset":1550},{"uri":"LUMO","surface_form":"LUMO","offset":1612},{"uri":"Antibonding","surface_form":"antibonding","offset":1622},{"uri":"DeMayo_reaction","surface_form":"DeMayo reaction","offset":1793},{"uri":"Cinnamic_acid","surface_form":"cinnamic acid","offset":1876},{"uri":"Ozonolysis","surface_form":"ozonolysis","offset":2236},{"uri":"IUPAC","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":2308},{"uri":"Norbornadiene","surface_form":"norbornadiene","offset":2537},{"uri":"Alkyne","surface_form":"alkyne","offset":2568},{"uri":"Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction","surface_form":"Diels\u2013Alder reaction","offset":2629},{"uri":"Huisgen_cycloaddition","surface_form":"Huisgen cycloaddition","offset":2712},{"uri":"Nitrone-olefin_3%2B2_cycloaddition","surface_form":"Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition","offset":2802},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":2905},{"uri":"Radical_(chemistry)","surface_form":"radical","offset":2934}]}
