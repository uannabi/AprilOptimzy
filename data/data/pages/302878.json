{"id":302878,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_breakdown","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mental breakdown (also known as a nervous breakdown) is a non-medical term used to describe an acute, temporary, short phase of a disorder with features of depression or anxiety.\nDefinition.\nThe terms 'nervous breakdown' and 'mental breakdown' are not formally defined in a diagnostic system such as the DSM-IV or ICD-10. The terms are not often used in the scientific literature on mental illness.\nSpecific cases are sometimes described as a 'breakdown' only after a person cannot function in day-to-day life. It is a temporary condition.\nCauses.\nDifferent things can cause a mental breakdown. A study found that problems with intimate relationships, such as divorce or separation, contributed to 24% of nervous breakdowns. Problems at work and school accounted for 17% of cases, and financial problems for 11%. Surveys suggest that in the United States, health problems have decreased in importance as a contributor to nervous breakdowns, as these accounted for 28% of nervous breakdowns in 1957, 12% in 1976, and only 5.6% in 1996.\nIn themselves, nervous breakdowns are considered a 'health problem' by most professionals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":75},{"uri":"Clinical_depression","surface_form":"depression","offset":169},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":183},{"uri":"DSM-IV","surface_form":"DSM-IV","offset":317},{"uri":"ICD-10","surface_form":"ICD-10","offset":327},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":673},{"uri":"Separate","surface_form":"separation","offset":684},{"uri":"Financial","surface_form":"financial","offset":798},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":854}]}
