{"id":302890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Defense_Department_firefighters","text":"e=\"preserve\">The United States Department of Defense employs civilian firefighters. They are stationed at military bases to work as firefighters. These workers have their own uniforms and equipment. They are not a part of any military unit. They will work alongside military units if needed. Many times, they are the only firefighters at a military facility. The civilian firefighters wear special uniforms, usually a dark blue suit with a badge and with a shoulder patch indicating their firefighting organization.\nFirefighters go to special classes to learn firefighting skills. They earn certificates after taking the classes. One major class is called \"DoD Fire & Emergency Services Training.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Defense","surface_form":"United States Department of Defense","offset":17},{"uri":"Firefighters","surface_form":"firefighters","offset":70}]}
