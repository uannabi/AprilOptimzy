It has two subspecies: the western or lowland bongo, and the eastern or mountain bongo. The western bongo is near threatened and the mountain bongo is critically endangered. Bongos eat plants. They live in forests in Africa. Kenya is the only place eastern bongos live in the wild. Like the west African giraffe, the eastern or mountain bongo is one of the most threatened animals in Africa. Bongos live in both captivity and the wild.\nAs bongos grow their horns appear. Both male and female bongos have horns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":39},{"uri":"Antelope","surface_form":"antelope","offset":49},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"eat plants","offset":240},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":276},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":284},{"uri":"Giraffe","surface_form":"giraffe","offset":363}]}
