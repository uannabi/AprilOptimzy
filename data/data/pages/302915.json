{"id":302915,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble","text":"A pebble is a piece of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres. They are often made of flint.\nPebbles are larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a conglomerate. Pebble tools are among the earliest known man-made artifacts, dating from the Palaeolithic period of human history.\nA beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a shingle beach. This type of beach resists wave erosion, and has ecological niches which can provide habitat for animals and plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clastic_rock","surface_form":"rock","offset":23},{"uri":"Particle_size","surface_form":"particle size","offset":35},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":96},{"uri":"Conglomerate_(geology)","surface_form":"conglomerate","offset":274},{"uri":"Artifact_(archaeology)","surface_form":"artifacts","offset":339},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"Palaeolithic","offset":366},{"uri":"Shingle_beach","surface_form":"shingle beach","offset":469},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":516},{"uri":"Ecological_niche","surface_form":"ecological niche","offset":533},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":569}]}
