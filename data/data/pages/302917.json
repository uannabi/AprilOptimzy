{"id":302917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER","text":"MESSENGER, MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, was an unmanned NASA and APL spacecraft. It was orbiting and studying the planet Mercury. Its mission lasted 10 years, 8 months and 28 days.\nIt was launched on August 3, 2004 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket. After launch, the probe did several fly-bys and deep space manoeuvres to gain the right trajectory and speed.\nIt completed 30% mapping of Mercury on January 14, 2008. MESSENGER made one more pass by Mercury in 2009, and on March 18, 2011 began to orbit Mercury. 100% mapping was completed in March 2013 and the probe continued its studies. On April 30, 2015, it crashed into Mercury. It crashed near the crater Jan\u00E1\u010Dek.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":89},{"uri":"APL","surface_form":"APL","offset":98},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":102},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":147},{"uri":"Mercury_(planet)","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":154},{"uri":"Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","surface_form":"Cape Canaveral Air Force Station","offset":251},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":301},{"uri":"Delta_II","surface_form":"Delta II","offset":308},{"uri":"Fly-by","surface_form":"fly-by","offset":361},{"uri":"Deep_space_manoeuvre","surface_form":"deep space manoeuvre","offset":373},{"uri":"Trajectory","surface_form":"trajectory","offset":413},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":428}]}
