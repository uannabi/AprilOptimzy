{"id":302919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_(psychology)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In psychology, compensation is a way people hide something that they cannot do well, by doing something else really well. They may not even be aware that they are doing it. Compensation can hide real or imagined problems and personal or physical inferiority. However it does not really solve the cause of the problem. Positive compensations may help a person overcome difficulties. But negative compensations do not, and can even make the problems worse.\nA well-known example of failing overcompensation, can be seen in people going through a mid life crisis. Approaching midlife many people (especially men) lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses, including their compensatory acts.\nOrigin.\nAlfred Adler, founder of individual psychology, used the word compensation in relation inferiority feelings. In his book \"Study of Organ Inferiority and Its Physical Compensation\" (1907) he wrote if a person feels inferior (weak) then they will (usually) try to compensate for it somewhere else.\nAdler's reason to explore this was from his own experience. He was shy and yet he pushed himself to give lectures.\nAdler also \"transferred\" this idea of compensation to psychic training.\nCultural implications.\nTherefore, it is \"fascinated\" with fame.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":16},{"uri":"Mid_life_crisis","surface_form":"mid life crisis","offset":556},{"uri":"Alfred_Adler","surface_form":"Alfred Adler","offset":723},{"uri":"Individual_psychology","surface_form":"individual psychology","offset":748},{"uri":"Psychic_training","surface_form":"psychic training","offset":1188}]}
