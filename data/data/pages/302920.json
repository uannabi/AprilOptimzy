{"id":302920,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingle_beach","text":"A shingle beach (or pebble beach) is a beach made of pebbles, not sand. The stones may be from diameter. These beaches strongly resist erosion by waves.\nThis beach landform is quite common in Western Europe, because the pebbles come from the lines of flint in the chalk. Chesil Bank is an example. When the chalk erodes, the tough flint stays as pebbles.\nOther examples are found in Bahrain, North America and in a number of other places. On the east coast of New Zealand's South Island, there are mixed shingle and sand fans in the braided rivers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":39},{"uri":"Pebble","surface_form":"pebble","offset":53},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":135},{"uri":"Landform","surface_form":"landform","offset":164},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":192},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":251},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":264},{"uri":"Chesil_Bank","surface_form":"Chesil Bank","offset":271},{"uri":"Bahrain","surface_form":"Bahrain","offset":383},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":392},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":460},{"uri":"South_Island","surface_form":"South Island","offset":474},{"uri":"Braided_river","surface_form":"braided river","offset":533}]}
