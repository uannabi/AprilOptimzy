{"id":302924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puddingstone","text":"Puddingstone is a kind of sedimentary rock. It is formed when pebbles, perhaps from a shingle beach, are cemented together by silica coming out of solution.\nThe rock which forms is extremely hard and resistant to wear. It is used for grindstones and building. The pebbles are usually made of flint, and both they and the matrix are made of silica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sedimentary_rock","surface_form":"sedimentary rock","offset":26},{"uri":"Shingle_beach","surface_form":"shingle beach","offset":86},{"uri":"Cement","surface_form":"cement","offset":105},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":126},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":147},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":292},{"uri":"Matrix_(geology)","surface_form":"matrix","offset":321}]}
