{"id":302929,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function","text":"In mathematics, a injective function is a function \"f\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" with the following property. For every element \"b\" in the codomain \"B\", there is at most one element \"a\" in the domain \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\", or equivalently, distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain.\nThe term \"injection\" and the related terms \"surjection\" and \"bijection\" were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.\nAn injective function is often called a 1-1 (read \"one-to-one\") function. However, this is to be distinguish from a 1-1 correspondence, which is a bijective function (both injective and surjective).\nBasic properties.\nThe element formula_1\u00A0is called a pre-image of the element\u00A0formula_1\u00A0if\u00A0formula_1\u00A0. Injections have one or none pre-images for every element \"b\" in \"B\".\nCardinality.\nCardinality is the \"number\" of elements in a set. The cardinality of \"A\"= is 4. This is written as #\"A\"=4.\nIf the cardinality of the codomain is less than the cardinality of the domain, then the function cannot be an injection. For example, there is no injection from 6 elements to 5 elements, since it is impossible to map 6 elements to 5 elements without a duplicate.\nElementary functions.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211D\u2192\u211D be a real-valued function \"y\"=\"f\"(\"x\") of a real-valued argument \"x\". (This means both the input and output are real numbers.)\nExample: The linear function of a slanted line is 1-1. That is, \"y\"=\"ax\"+\"b\" where \"a\"\u22600 is an injection. (It is also a surjection and thus a bijection.)\nExample: The polynomial function of third degree: \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"3 is an injection. However, the polynomial function of third degree: \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"3 \u20133x is not an injection.\nExample: The quadratic function \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\"2 is not an injection.\nNote: One can make a non-injective function into an injective function by eliminating part of the domain. We call this restricting the domain. For example, restrict the domain of \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"\u00B2 to non-negative numbers (positive numbers and zero). Define\nThis function is now an injection. (See also restriction of a function.)\nExample: The exponential function \"f\"(\"x\") = 10\"x\" is an injection. (However, it is not a surjection.)\nNote: The fact that an exponential function is injective can be used in calculations.\nOther examples.\nExample: The logarithmic function base 10 \"f\"(\"x\"):(0,+\u221E)\u2192\u211D defined by \"f\"(\"x\")=log(\"x\") or \"y\"=log10(\"x\") is an injection (and a surjection). (This is the inverse function of 10\"x\".)\nExample: The function \"f\":\u2115\u2192\u2115 that maps every natural number \"n\" to \"2n\" is an injection. Every even number has exactly one pre-image. Every odd number has no pre-image.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":42},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"codomain","offset":125},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"domain","offset":179},{"uri":"Surjective_function","surface_form":"\"surjection\"","offset":348},{"uri":"Bijective_function","surface_form":"\"bijection\"","offset":365},{"uri":"Cardinality","surface_form":"Cardinality","offset":911},{"uri":"Real_numbers","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":1432},{"uri":"Linear_function","surface_form":"linear function","offset":1460},{"uri":"Slant","surface_form":"slanted","offset":1481},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":1614},{"uri":"Quadratic_function","surface_form":"quadratic function","offset":1784},{"uri":"Eliminate","surface_form":"eliminating","offset":1914},{"uri":"Restrict","surface_form":"restricting","offset":1959},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"restriction of a function","offset":2138},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponential function","offset":2179},{"uri":"Logarithmic_function","surface_form":"logarithmic function","offset":2384},{"uri":"Inverse_function","surface_form":"inverse function","offset":2527},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":2601}]}
