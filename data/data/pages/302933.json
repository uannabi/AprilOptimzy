{"id":302933,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function","text":"In mathematics, a surjective or onto function is a function \"f\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" with the following property. For every element \"b\" in the codomain \"B\", there is at least one element \"a\" in the domain \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\". This means that no element in the codomain is unmapped, and that the range and codomain of \"f\" are the same set.\nThe term \"surjection\" and the related terms \"injection\" and \"bijection\" were introduced by the group of mathematicians that called itself Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, this group of mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics. The French prefix \"sur\" means \"above\" or \"onto\" and was chosen since a surjective function maps its domain on to its codomain.\nBasic properties.\nwhere the element formula_1 is called the image of the element formula_1, and the element formula_1 a pre-image of the element formula_1.\nA pre-image does \"not\" have to be unique. In the top image, both and are pre-images of the element. It is only important that there be at least one pre-image.\nElementary functions.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211D\u2192\u211D be a real-valued function \"y\"=\"f\"(\"x\") of a real-valued argument \"x\". (This means both the input and output are numbers.)\nIn mathematics, we can find exact (analytic) roots only of polynomials of first, second (and third) degree. We find roots of all other functions approximately (numerically). This means a formal proof of surjectivity is rarely direct. So the discussions below are informal.\nExample: The linear function of a slanted line is \"onto\". That is, \"y\"=\"ax\"+\"b\" where \"a\"\u22600 is a surjection. (It is also an injection and thus a bijection.)\nExample: The cubic polynomial (of third degree) \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"3-3\"x\" is a surjection.\nExample: The quadratic function \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\"2 is not a surjection. There is no \"x\" such that \"x\"2 = \u22121. The range of \"x\"\u00B2 is [0,+\u221E), that is, the set of non-negative numbers. (Also, this function is not an injection.)\nNote: One can make a non-surjective function into a surjection by \"restricting\" its codomain to elements of its range. For example, the \"new\" function, \"f\"N(\"x\"):\u211D \u2192 [0,+\u221E) where \"f\"N(\"x\") = \"x\"2 is a surjective function. (This is not the same as the restriction of a function which restricts the domain!)\nExample: The exponential function \"f\"(\"x\") = 10\"x\" is not a surjection. The range of \"10'x\" is (0,+\u221E), that is, the set of positive numbers. (This function is an injection.)\nOther examples with real-valued functions.\nExample: The logarithmic function base 10 \"f\"(\"x\"):(0,+\u221E)\u2192\u211D defined by \"f\"(\"x\")=log(\"x\") or \"y\"=log10(\"x\") is a surjection (and an injection). (This is the inverse function of 10\"x\".)\nExample: The function \"f\"((\"x\",\"y\")):\u211D\u00B2\u2192\u211D defined by \"z\"=\"y\" is a surjection. Its graph is a plane in 3-dimensional space. The pre-image of \"z\"o is the line y=\"z\"o in the \"x\"0\"y\" plane.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":51},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"codomain","offset":134},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"domain","offset":189},{"uri":"Range_(mathematics)","surface_form":"range","offset":293},{"uri":"Injective_function","surface_form":"\"injection\"","offset":381},{"uri":"Bijective_function","surface_form":"\"bijection\"","offset":397},{"uri":"Nicholas_Bourbaki","surface_form":"Nicholas Bourbaki","offset":475},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":1259},{"uri":"Approximate","surface_form":"approximately","offset":1345},{"uri":"Linear_function","surface_form":"linear function","offset":1486},{"uri":"Slant","surface_form":"slanted","offset":1507},{"uri":"Quadratic_function","surface_form":"quadratic function","offset":1727},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"restriction of a function","offset":2185},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponential function","offset":2253},{"uri":"Logarithmic_function","surface_form":"logarithmic function","offset":2470},{"uri":"Inverse_function","surface_form":"inverse function","offset":2613}]}
