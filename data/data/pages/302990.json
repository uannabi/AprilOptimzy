{"id":302990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diene","text":"In organic chemistry, a diene () or diolefin () is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon pi bonds.\nConjugated dienes are functional groups, with a general formula of CnH2n-2. Dienes and alkynes are functional isomers. Dienes occur occasionally in nature but are widely used in the polymer industry.\nClasses.\nCompounds that contain more than two double bonds are called polyenes. Polyenes and dienes, share many of their properties.\nCycloadditions.\nAn important reaction for conjugated dienes is the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of natural products, e.g. Danishefsky\u2019s diene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":3},{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":53},{"uri":"Pi_bond","surface_form":"pi bond","offset":90},{"uri":"Conjugated_system","surface_form":"Conjugated","offset":100},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"functional group","offset":122},{"uri":"Isomer","surface_form":"isomer","offset":210},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":282},{"uri":"Polyene","surface_form":"polyene","offset":370},{"uri":"Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction","surface_form":"Diels\u2013Alder reaction","offset":500},{"uri":"Natural_product","surface_form":"natural product","offset":614},{"uri":"Danishefsky%E2%80%99s_diene","surface_form":"Danishefsky\u2019s diene","offset":637}]}
