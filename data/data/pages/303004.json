{"id":303004,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_beetle","text":"The tiger beetles are a large group of beetles in the family Carabidae. About 2,600 species and subspecies are known, with the richest diversity in the Oriental (Indo-Malayan) region, followed by the Neotropics.\nAll tiger beetles are predators.\nThey are known for their aggressive predatory habits and running speed. The fastest species of tiger beetle can run at a speed of 9\u00A0km/h (5.6\u00A0mph), which, relative to its body length, is about 22 times the speed of an Olympic sprinter, the equivalent of a human running at.\nTiger beetles live everywhere in the world except the Antarctic and Tasmania. They have powerful jaws, called mandibles, which they use to hold and crush their prey. They have long legs, big eyes, and a wide head. All are colourful. Their elytra are usually bright and have bold markings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":39},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":54},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":84},{"uri":"Neotropic","surface_form":"Neotropic","offset":200},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predators","offset":234},{"uri":"Antarctic","surface_form":"Antarctic","offset":573},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":587},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":616},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"colourful","offset":741},{"uri":"Elytra","surface_form":"elytra","offset":758},{"uri":"Bold","surface_form":"bold","offset":793}]}
