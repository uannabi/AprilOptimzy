{"id":303022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_40","text":"U.S. Route 40 is a federal highway from Park City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey. It is 2,286 miles long and passes through twelve states. It used to go from Park City to Reno, Nevada and San Francisco, California, but that route is now part of Interstate 80. Much of the eastern part of U.S. Route 40, from Vandalia, Illinois to Cumberland, Maryland (or from St. Louis, Missouri to Baltimore) was part of the National Road. This part has been around since 1839. Part of U.S. Route 40 was also called the \"Lincoln Highway\".\nThe current capitals are Denver, Topeka, Indianapolis, and Columbus. Vandalia was a former capital of Illinois, Zanesville was a former capital of Ohio, and Wheeling was a former capital of West Virginia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Park_City%2C_Utah","surface_form":"Park City, Utah","offset":40},{"uri":"Atlantic_City%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Atlantic City, New Jersey","offset":59},{"uri":"Reno%2C_Nevada","surface_form":"Reno, Nevada","offset":175},{"uri":"San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"San Francisco, California","offset":192},{"uri":"Interstate_80","surface_form":"Interstate 80","offset":249},{"uri":"Vandalia%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Vandalia, Illinois","offset":312},{"uri":"Cumberland%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Cumberland, Maryland","offset":334},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis, Missouri","offset":364},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":387}]}
