It is in the Upper Rhine valley on the tourist routes of the \"Baden Asparagus Route\" () and the \"Bertha Benz Memorial Route\". The town is known for its motor racing circuit, the Hockenheimring.\nHockenheim is one of the six largest towns in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district. Since 1999, the population has exceeded the 20,000, and Hockenheim received the status of a regional central town () in 2001.\nLocation and environment.\nHockenheim is in the Upper Rhine valley. It is on an old trade route that ran from Frankfurt to Basel. The river Kraichbach flows through the town, and divides Hockenheim in an eastern and a western area. Hockenheim covers 34.84\u00A0km\u00B2. About 28.2\u00A0percent is used for settlement and transportation. About 47.5\u00A0percent is used for agriculture. About 2.3\u00A0percent of the area are waterways, and 21.1\u00A0percent are forests.\nThe town is divided into two large natural areas. The \"Rheinaue\" to the west and the \"Niederterrasse\" to the east. The \"Hockenheimer Rheinbogen\" is an area of the Rhine. 656\u00A0hectares of the area is a nature conservation.\nTown structure.\nThe central urban area forms one unit. It is divided into five districts for statistical reasons.\nHistory.\nIn 1984, an old brick kiln was found during an excavation in Hockenheim. The kiln had stamped bricks inside it from the Roman Empire. The Roman Legio XIV Gemina was near Mainz from 71\u00A0AD until 92\u00A0AD. The bricks indicate an early settlement in the Hockenheim area.\nHockenheim was first mentioned 769 as \"Ochinheim\" in a document of the Lorsch Codex (a list of early monastery gifts). The name \"Hockenheim\" was first used in official documents in 1238. During the Middle Ages, Hockenheim was owned by several local authorities.\nIn the 17th century, Hockenheim was severely destroyed twice by French troops. In 1644 during the Thirty Years' War, and in 1674 during the Franco-Dutch War. Tobacco was brought to the area by the French. During this time, the growing of hops started to be replaced with tobacco. In 1803 Hockenheim was merged into Baden. The tobacco crop grew well and prospered, and Hockenheim was awarded town rights on 22 July 1895.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, asparagus growing replaced most of the remaining hops growing. On 29 May 1932 the Hockenheimring opened with a motorcycle race. In January 1973, Hockenheim was assigned to the new Rhein-Neckar-Kreis (district).\nPolitics.\nThe town is led by the Lord Mayor ().

The lion is the animal of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to which Hockenheim belonged; the hooks are probably derived from the place name. The form of the symbols was changed several times, but has been specified in its current form by municipal law since 1895.\nSport.\nThe Hockenheimring, a motor racing course built in 1932. It has become on of the two home circuits of the Formula One German Grand Prix (the other is the N\u00FCrburgring).
