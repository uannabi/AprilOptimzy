{"id":303108,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiotaurus","text":"=\"preserve\">In Greek mythology, the Ophiotaurus was a creature that was part bull and part serpent. Ovid's poem, \"Fasti\" (3.793 \"ff\") is the only work where it is mentioned. There, it is said that when the creature's entrails were burnt, the person to do so could defeat the gods.\nThe Ophiotaurus appears in the third book in the \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\" series, The Titan's Curse. Percy Jackson first thinks it is a female and names it \"Bessie\". It reappears in Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":15},{"uri":"Bull_(mythology)","surface_form":"bull","offset":77},{"uri":"Serpent_(symbolism)","surface_form":"serpent","offset":91},{"uri":"Ovid","surface_form":"Ovid","offset":100},{"uri":"Fasti_(poem)","surface_form":"Fasti","offset":114},{"uri":"Percy_Jackson_%26amp%3B_the_Olympians","surface_form":"Percy Jackson & the Olympians","offset":331},{"uri":"The_Titan%27s_Curse","surface_form":"The Titan's Curse","offset":370},{"uri":"Perseus_Jackson","surface_form":"Percy Jackson","offset":389},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Labyrinth","surface_form":"Battle of the Labyrinth","offset":470},{"uri":"The_Last_Olympian","surface_form":"The Last Olympian","offset":498}]}
