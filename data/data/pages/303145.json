{"id":303145,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLafferty_rearrangement","text":"e=\"preserve\">The McLafferty rearrangement is an organic reaction seen in mass spectrometry. A mass spectrometer breaks apart the molecule being studied. The molecule breaks apart in consistent ways that chemists can predict. Most of the time, a carbon-carbon bond breaks and the atoms do not jump across the break between the fragments. The McLafferty rearrangement is an example of a hydrogen atom jumping to the other fragment as a part of the process of the bond breaking. It happens in an organic molecule containing a keto-group.\nThe reaction.\nThe American chemist Fred McLafferty was the first to describe the reaction in 1959.\nThe keto-group undergoes \u03B2-cleavage, with the gain of the \u03B3-hydrogen atom. This rearrangement may take place by a radical or ionic mechanism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_reaction","surface_form":"organic reaction","offset":48},{"uri":"Mass_spectrometry","surface_form":"mass spectrometry","offset":73},{"uri":"Fred_McLafferty","surface_form":"Fred McLafferty","offset":570}]}
