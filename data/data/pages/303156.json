{"id":303156,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaotingia","text":"\"Xiaotingia\" is an extinct genus of \"Archaeopteryx\"-like theropod dinosaur from early Upper Jurassic deposits of western Liaoning, China.\nThe Chinese team claims the fossils dated to 155 million years ago (mya), whereas the Solnhofen limestone where \"Archaeopteyx\" was found is 144 mya in age. The new fossil \"Xiaotingia\" cannot be dated so accurately, as they were originally been purchased from a dealer. Prof Xu first saw the specimen at the Shandong Tianyu Museum. The other question to be asked of all early dinobirds is: could they fly?\nA cladistic analysis by Xu and his team showed that \"Xiaotingia\" formed a clade with \"Archaeopteryx\", the Dromaeosauridae and the Troodontidae. This clade excludes other birds. They therefore (re)defined the concepts of Deinonychosauria and Avialae so \"Archaeopteryx\" and \"Xiaotingia\" belonged to the Deinonychosauria and \"Archaeopteryx\" no longer was an avian (bird). This led to popular reports that \"Archaeopteryx\" is no longer a bird\".\nHowever, the team explicitly allowed for a traditional Aves with \"Archaeopteryx\" as a specifier. Such a clade would in their opinion include the Deinonychosauria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":19},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":27},{"uri":"Archaeopteryx","surface_form":"Archaeopteryx","offset":37},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":57},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":66},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"Upper Jurassic","offset":86},{"uri":"Liaoning","surface_form":"Liaoning","offset":121},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":131},{"uri":"Solnhofen_limestone","surface_form":"Solnhofen limestone","offset":224},{"uri":"Dinobird","surface_form":"dinobird","offset":513},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"cladistic","offset":545},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":617},{"uri":"Archaeopteryx","surface_form":"Archaeopteryx","offset":629},{"uri":"Dromaeosauridae","surface_form":"Dromaeosauridae","offset":649},{"uri":"Troodontidae","surface_form":"Troodontidae","offset":673},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":692},{"uri":"Deinonychosauria","surface_form":"Deinonychosauria","offset":763},{"uri":"Avialae","surface_form":"Avialae","offset":784},{"uri":"Aves","surface_form":"Aves","offset":1038}]}
