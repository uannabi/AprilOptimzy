{"id":303191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry","text":"Mass spectrometry (MS) is a process that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles.\nYou can use it to find out the mass of particles, and to find the basic chemicals in a sample or molecule. It can also tell you the chemical structures of molecules, such as peptides and other chemical compounds.\nUsing the information which the method can collect, you can find the \"mass-to-charge ratio\" of the particles, and the \"relative abundance\" (how many atoms of each type were in the sample you put in).\nThe first mass spectroscope was invented by the British physicist J. J. Thomson in 1912. His student Francis Aston developed the mass spectroscope for practical use. They are now widely used for agriculture, brewing, food processing, geology, petroleum exploration, medical drugs measurements and space exploration. They are often used with a chromatography system which helps prepare the sample for mass spectrometry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measures","offset":41},{"uri":"Mass-to-charge_ratio","surface_form":"mass-to-charge ratio","offset":54},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"charged","offset":78},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":86},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":128},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical","offset":169},{"uri":"Sample","surface_form":"sample","offset":184},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":194},{"uri":"Peptide","surface_form":"peptide","offset":271},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":290},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":558},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":566},{"uri":"J._J._Thomson","surface_form":"J.
