{"id":303199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning","text":"=\"preserve\">A tornado warning is an alert that means that a tornado or funnel cloud has been spotted around the area, and that people should take cover. When tornadoes have been spotted, the tornado sirens make sound in that place, letting people know that they have been seen.\nTornado warnings are higher than the warning of a Tornado watch, but there is an even \"higher\" level, which is a tornado emergency.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":60},{"uri":"Funnel_cloud","surface_form":"funnel cloud","offset":71},{"uri":"Tornado_watch","surface_form":"Tornado watch","offset":328},{"uri":"Tornado_emergency","surface_form":"tornado emergency","offset":391}]}
