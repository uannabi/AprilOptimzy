{"id":3032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML","text":"Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating a webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly. HTML also adds meta information to a webpage. Meta information is usually not shown by web browsers and is data \"about\" the web page, e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style HTML elements while JavaScript is used for website behavior and also changing the HTML and CSS.\nHTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are several versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of HTML is dubbed HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.\nTags.\nHTML uses \"elements\" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements are shown as \"tags\" in the code, written with angle brackets:. Tags \"usually\" come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many different kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. See Basic HTML Tags below for tag examples.\nSome tags only work in certain browsers. For example, the codice_2 tag, which is used to make something appear when the person presses the right button of the mouse, only works on the Mozilla Firefox browser. Other browsers simply ignore this tag and display the writing normally. Many web page creators avoid using these \"non-standard\" tags because they want their pages to look the same with all browsers.\nExample.\nHere is an example page in HTML with \"Hello world!\".<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n</syntaxhighlight>The text between and describes the web page, and the text between and is the page content. defines the browser page title.\nMaking a web page.\nMaking a web page is easy.All you need to remember is the tags and the order to make a web page.\nFirst, you need to find a place to type in the HTML Tags (I recommend notepad) and type down the tags.\nHere is another example of a HTML Tag page.\nThis is a HTML Tag page.\nOnce your done, save in this in this format: helloworld.htm\nAnd you're done! Once you save it in your computer, if you press it, it will send you to your web page in google!","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Markup_language","surface_form":"markup language","offset":39},{"uri":"Webpage","surface_form":"webpage","offset":70},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":187},{"uri":"Cascading_Style_Sheets","surface_form":"Cascading Style Sheets","offset":491},{"uri":"JavaScript","surface_form":"JavaScript","offset":557},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web_Consortium","surface_form":"World Wide Web Consortium","offset":653},{"uri":"HTML5","surface_form":"HTML 5","offset":783},{"uri":"Bracket","surface_form":"brackets","offset":964},{"uri":"Click","surface_form":"presses","offset":1369},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":1401},{"uri":"Mozilla_Firefox","surface_form":"Mozilla Firefox","offset":1426},{"uri":"Hello_world_program","surface_form":"Hello world!","offset":1697}]}
