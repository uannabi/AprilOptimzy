{"id":303224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesil_Beach","text":"Chesil Beach, sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain. Its name is derived from the Old English \"ceosel\" or \"cisel\", meaning \"gravel\" or \"shingle\".\nIt is a kind of offshore barrier which has joined the mainland with Portland Bill. The lagoon between the chesil and the mainland is called The Fleet or The Fleet Lagoon.\nThe shingle beach is 18 miles long (29km), 220 yards wide (200m) and 50 feet high (15m). The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the location for a book, \"On Chesil Beach\" by Ian McEwan.\nAt the eastern end of the beach at the village of Chiswell, against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland, the beach curves round sharply to form Chesil Cove. This part of the beach protects the low-lying village from flooding. Westwards the shingle forms a straight line along the coast, enclosing the Fleet, a shallow tidal lagoon. The lagoon is 9\u00BD feet (3m) at its deepest.p99\nThe beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds (from the west) and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell, which would otherwise probably not exist\nVarying with the Bank's unbroken increase in height, to, above mean high water, the size of the flint and chert shingle varies from pea-sized at the north-west end (by West Bay) to orange-sized at the south-east end (by Portland). It is said that smugglers who landed on the beach in the middle of the night could judge \"exactly where they were\" by the size of the shingle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":47},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":64},{"uri":"Shingle_beach","surface_form":"shingle structures","offset":94},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":154},{"uri":"Portland_Bill","surface_form":"Portland Bill","offset":286},{"uri":"Lagoon","surface_form":"lagoon","offset":305},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":401},{"uri":"Yard","surface_form":"yard","offset":436},{"uri":"Jurassic_Coast","surface_form":"Jurassic Coast","offset":518},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":536},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":543},{"uri":"Ian_McEwan","surface_form":"Ian McEwan","offset":614},{"uri":"Isle_of_Portland","surface_form":"Isle of Portland","offset":712},{"uri":"Lagoon","surface_form":"lagoon","offset":949},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":1076},{"uri":"Weymouth%2C_Dorset","surface_form":"Weymouth","offset":1098},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":1273},{"uri":"Chert","surface_form":"chert","offset":1283}]}
