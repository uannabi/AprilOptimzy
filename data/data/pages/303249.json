{"id":303249,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvonko_Bu%C5%A1i%C4%87","text":"Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 (23 January 1946 \u2013 1 September 2013) is a terrorist, mastermind of the 1976 hijacking of TWA Flight 355 and a bombing at Grand Central Station in New York. For this crime he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. He spent 32 years in prison before being released on parole in July 2008.\nBackground.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 was born in Gorica, a village in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia, and finished high school in Imotski. At the age of 20, he emigrated to Vienna. In Vienna, three years later, in 1969, he met the American student, Julienne Eden Schultz, who was studying German there and who soon thereafter became involved in the activities of the Croatian emigration. In coordination with Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107, she and a friend traveled to Zagreb and threw anti-Yugoslav leaflets on Republic Square, after which they were arrested and imprisoned. After release, Julienne returned to Vienna and in 1972, Julienne and Zvonko married in Frankfurt. Later they moved to the U.S. where he became a member and leader of the Croatian terrorist group called Croatian National Resistance.\nHijacking and bombing.\nThe terrorists' first demand was that thousands of copies of a \"Declaration of the Croatian Liberation Forces\" be scattered from the air over New York, Chicago, Montreal, Paris, London, and the site of a popular festival in Croatia. This declaration was written for this purposes by a Croatia's dissident, Bruno Bu\u0161i\u0107.\nThe plane took refueling stop in Montreal, and flew to Paris, France. During the new refueling stop in Newfoundland, the terrorist agreed to release thirty passengers. Bu\u0161i\u0107 reminded Captain Carey that the aircraft could be blown up at any time if the demands were not met and that the passengers released at Newfoundland, if failed to distribute leaflets as ordered, the remaining passengers' fate would be on their consciences.\nIn Paris, the hijackers got information that their demands had been met. So they surrendered to the French police, which extradited them to the United States. During efforts to deactivate the explosives four hours later at the detonation site, American policeman Brian Murray died, and three other officers were wounded.\nTrial, imprisonment, and release.\nZvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 was charged with and convicted of air piracy resulting in death, which carried a mandatory life sentence. Three years after the trial, Judge John Bartels declared Bu\u0161i\u0107 eligible for parole after Dec. 31 1979.\nOn April 17, 1987 Bu\u0161i\u0107 escaped from the Otisville Correctional Institution, a medium-security Federal prison in Orange County, N.Y. Two days later, Bu\u0161i\u0107 was caught and surrendered peacefully.\nOn June 13, 1989, Bartels wrote a letter-opinion to the U.S. Parole Commission, in which he stated that the death of the police officer was partly due to the police's negligence and that he had no recommendation to the Commission nor objection to Bu\u0161i\u0107's release. However, the Commission rejected this parole.\nHis second request for parole was denied in 2006, after service of 30 years, although the others in the group had already been free for at least 17 years. After this parole denial, Croatian government along with the Croatian Helsinki Committee, launched a campaign to secure his release on humanitarian grounds, arguing that Bu\u0161i\u0107 had served out his sentence and therefore should be released.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 spent his last two years of imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, transferred there from Allenwood, Pennsylvania.\nCroatian National Resistance (Otpor) idealized Bu\u0161i\u0107es and their gang. Marin Sopta, the former North American Otpor leader, said: \"The Bu\u0161i\u0107es were our heroes. They did more to promote the Croatian cause than anyone else\". Sopta visited Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 regularly when he was serving time in Pennsylvania.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 was granted parole in July 2008 and turned over to immigration authorities for deportation proceedings. A condition of his parole was that he could not return to the U.S.\nReactions on Bu\u0161i\u0107\u2019s release.\nFreeing this terrorist from a life sentence and shipping him to his homeland caused the disgust of relatives of the city cop he murdered more than 30 years ago.\nLt. Terence McTigue, who was blinded in the blast that killed Murray, had spoken against the release of Bu\u0161i\u0107 and his crew at earlier parole hearings but, he said, he was never notified of the last, fateful one. McTigue saw this event as a political favor done for the Croatian government and said, \"It is like killing Brian Murray and injuring me all over again.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) protested Bu\u0161i\u0107's release without hearing from the victims, to Attorney General Michael Mukasey.\n\"Both bombs were in a public locker in a transportation facility, a few days after a holiday, and both were large and heavy,\" Mr. McTigue said. He noted that both devices utilized dynamite and \"a 9-volt battery, possibly for a lantern.\"\nDeath.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 died by suicide on 1 September 2013 with firearm in his apartment near Zadar, Croatia. He was discovered by his wife Julienne.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Life_imprisonment","surface_form":"life imprisonment","offset":234},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":274},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":378},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":402},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":485},{"uri":"Frankfurt","surface_form":"Frankfurt","offset":958},{"uri":"Croatian_National_Resistance","surface_form":"Croatian National Resistance","offset":1073},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1500},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1507},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1878},{"uri":"Extradited","surface_form":"extradited","offset":1996},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":4923},{"uri":"Zadar","surface_form":"Zadar","offset":4986}]}
