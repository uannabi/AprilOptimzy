{"id":3033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg","text":"A leg is something used to support things; to hold them up. Birds and humans have two legs. Some objects, for example tables and chairs, also have legs to hold them up.\nAnimals normally have 2 or 4 legs (vertebrates, which are animals with a backbone), or 6, 8, or 12 (arthropods, for example insects and spiders). Centipedes and millipedes have a lot more legs, but not exactly a hundred or a thousand as their names make people who do not know them think. Humans have 2 legs, complete with feet.\n\"Biped\" is an animal with two legs and \"quadruped\" is an animal with four legs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"Bird","offset":60},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":70},{"uri":"Table_(furniture)","surface_form":"tables","offset":118},{"uri":"Chair","surface_form":"chair","offset":129},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":204},{"uri":"Backbone","surface_form":"backbone","offset":242},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":269},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":293},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":305},{"uri":"Centipede","surface_form":"Centipede","offset":315},{"uri":"Millipede","surface_form":"millipede","offset":330},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"Human","offset":458},{"uri":"Feet","surface_form":"feet","offset":492}]}
