They are sometimes called the \u2018stone-cracker penguin\u2019 because of their squeaky and high pitched call. Chinstrap penguins are found in polar, shallow seas and coastal areas. Some penguins are born very pale and are called \u2018Blonde\u2019 penguins. There are more chinstrap penguins than any other penguins in the world.\nThey feed mainly on krill and fish. The chinstrap penguins make nests in round shapes made from small stones and take turns in sitting on the eggs, they can be left on the nest for 10 days.\nSize.\nThese little penguins are only about tall and weigh about.
