{"id":303389,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_penguin","text":"The Ad\u00E9lie penguin (\"Pygoscelis adeliae\") is a Antarctic penguin that has a black head and back with a white chest and belly, and a white ring around each of their eyes. There are about 2.5 million Ad\u00E9lie penguins in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. Ad\u00E9lie penguins travel the furthest to breed because they build their nests from stones and need to find stones. Ad\u00E9lies come ashore to breed in the summer. In the winter, they live on ice that floats off the Antarctic shore.\nChicks and eggs.\nAd\u00E9lie parents take turns keeping their chicks warm and fed. While one watches the nest, the other goes into the ocean to catch krill. The penguins carry the krill back to the nest in their stomachs. Then they regurgitate it to feed their chicks.\nMost Ad\u00E9lie penguins incubate two eggs at a time. The little chicks hatch out at about the same time. One is usually stronger than the other and has a better chance of surviving.\nWhen first born, the chicks are kept warm by their parents. But after two or three weeks, they grow a thick, woolly gray down. Then they join other chicks in creches, or nursery groups.\nSize.\nAd\u00E9lie penguins are the smallest penguins in Antarctica. They weigh only about, or the weight of a typical house cat. They are about.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Penguin","surface_form":"penguin","offset":57},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":164},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":243},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":404},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":419},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":440},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":581},{"uri":"Krill","surface_form":"krill","offset":626},{"uri":"Regurgitate","surface_form":"regurgitate","offset":708},{"uri":"Incubate","surface_form":"incubate","offset":766},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":779},{"uri":"Hatch","surface_form":"hatch","offset":813},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":1033},{"uri":"Gray","surface_form":"gray","offset":1040},{"uri":"House_cat","surface_form":"house cat","offset":1223}]}
