{"id":30339,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briefs","text":"Briefs are a type of short underwear for males or females. They provide a close fit, and come in either white, or in other colors like blue, pink, or red.\nFor male briefs, before 2000s, briefs often came with hard elastic waistband. This would cause stretch marks, and this was eventually replaced by the soft elastic waistband. However, hard elastic waistbands are still found on generic store brand underwear (that save consumer and manufacturing costs by not being fashion forward).\nFemale briefs are also called knickers or panties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Underwear","surface_form":"underwear","offset":27},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":104},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":135},{"uri":"Pink","surface_form":"pink","offset":141},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":150},{"uri":"Stretch_mark","surface_form":"stretch mark","offset":250},{"uri":"Fashion","surface_form":"fashion","offset":468},{"uri":"Knickers","surface_form":"knickers","offset":516},{"uri":"Panties","surface_form":"panties","offset":528}]}
