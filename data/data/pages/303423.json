{"id":303423,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_City","text":"Dodge City is the county seat of Ford County, Kansas, United States. Named after nearby Fort Dodge, the city is famous in American culture for its history as a wild frontier town of the Old West. The 2010 census showed the city population was 27,340.\nIn the 1880s Dodge City became a boomtown, with thousands of cattle passing annually through its stockyards. The peak years of the cattle trade in Dodge City were from 1883 to 1884. During that time the town grew tremendously. Dodge City had more famous (and infamous) gunfighters working at one time or another than any other town in the West, many of whom participated in the Dodge City War of 1883. It also boasted the usual array of saloons, gambling halls, and brothels: they were set up to separate a cowboy from his hard-earned cash. Famous were the Long Branch Saloon and the China Doll brothel.\nEconomy.\nMeat packing is the main industry in Dodge City. The city also has farm implement manufacturing, and is a supply center for area agriculture. Livestock-raising is a major activity while wheat and sorghum are the area's main crops.\nIn addition, a local tourism industry, including a casino resort, has developed to capitalize on Dodge City's history as an Old West cowtown. The service sector accounts for much of the rest of the local economy with local government, schools, retail stores, and health care providers as the city's other major employers.\nTransportation.\nFour U.S. Highways meet in Dodge City: U.S. Route 50, U.S. Route 56, U.S. Route 283, and U.S. Route 400. Dodge City was located on the National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, that was established in 1912.\nDodge City Regional Airport is about 2 miles (3\u00A0km) east of the city. Three railroads serve Dodge City.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":18},{"uri":"Ford_County%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Ford County","offset":33},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":46},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":54},{"uri":"Fort_Dodge_(US_Army_Post)","surface_form":"Fort Dodge","offset":88},{"uri":"Culture_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"American culture","offset":122},{"uri":"American_Old_West","surface_form":"Old West","offset":186},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":200},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":312},{"uri":"Stockyard","surface_form":"stockyard","offset":348},{"uri":"Gunfighter","surface_form":"gunfighter","offset":520},{"uri":"Western_saloon","surface_form":"saloon","offset":688},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"gambling","offset":697},{"uri":"Brothel","surface_form":"brothel","offset":717},{"uri":"Cowboy","surface_form":"cowboy","offset":758},{"uri":"Long_Branch_Saloon","surface_form":"Long Branch Saloon","offset":808},{"uri":"Farm_implement","surface_form":"farm implement","offset":931},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"Livestock","offset":1006},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":1050},{"uri":"Sorghum","surface_form":"sorghum","offset":1060},{"uri":"Casino","surface_form":"casino","offset":1146},{"uri":"Service_sector","surface_form":"service sector","offset":1241},{"uri":"United_States_Numbered_Highways","surface_form":"U.S. Highways","offset":1438},{"uri":"National_Old_Trails_Road","surface_form":"National Old Trails Road","offset":1568},{"uri":"Dodge_City_Regional_Airport","surface_form":"Dodge City Regional Airport","offset":1666}]}
