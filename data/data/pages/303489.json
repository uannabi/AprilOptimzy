{"id":303489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_admiral","text":"The red admiral (\"Vanessa atalanta\") is a well-known colourful butterfly, found in temperate Europe, Asia and North America. It has a wing span. The species is resident only in warmer areas, but migrates north in spring, and sometimes again in autumn.\nIn northern Europe, it is one of the last butterflies to be seen before winter sets in, often feeding on the flowers of ivy on sunny days. The red admiral is also known to hibernate, re-emerging individuals showing prominently darker colourings than first brood subjects. The butterfly also flies on sunny winter days, especially in southern Europe.\nIn North America, the red admiral generally has two broods from March through October. Most of North America must be recolonized each spring by southern migrants, but this species over-winters in south Texas.\nPainted ladies.\nThe painted ladies are a subgenus \"Cynthis\" of the red admirals. The topside of their wings is mostly orange in colour.\nMigration.\nThe painted lady in the UK migrates south in the winter. This has been proved by tracking them on radar. They fly at high altitude on a 9,000-mile migration. It could take up to six successive generations for the species to complete a 9000 mile (14,400\u00A0km) round trip from tropical Africa to Europe.\nHuge numbers migrate. The radar showed that 11 million painted ladies entered the UK at high altitude in spring 2009. Twenty six million were counted departing in the autumn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterfly","offset":63},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":83},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":93},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":101},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":110},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migrates","offset":195},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":244},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":264},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":324},{"uri":"Common_ivy","surface_form":"ivy","offset":372},{"uri":"Hibernation","surface_form":"hibernate","offset":424},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterfly","offset":528},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":594},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":605},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":697},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":804},{"uri":"Subgenus","surface_form":"subgenus","offset":852},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1240}]}
