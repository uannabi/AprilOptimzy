{"id":303671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenhousemuir_F.C.","text":"Stenhousemuir FC is a Scottish football club from Stenhousemuir. The club is a member of the Scottish Football League and currently plays in the Scottish Second Division.\nThrough much of its history the team has competed in the lower leagues of Scottish football, spending the 2006\u201307 season in the Third Division. In 2008\u201309, despite earning 4th place, the club won the promotion play-offs and returned to the Scottish Second Division.\nIn September 2009, Stenhousemuir Football Club, Ltd. was re-registered as a Community Interest Company.\n1884\u20131989.\nThe club was founded in 1884 following a break away from a local team called \"Heather Rangers\". In 1890, the Warriors moved to Ochilview Park following spells at Tryst Park and Goschen Park. In the early 20th century the club had a brief spell of success, winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup twice in 1901 and 1902. In 1902\u201303, the club reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, losing 1\u20134 at home to Rangers. The 1921\u201322 season saw Stenhousemuir compete for the first time in senior Scottish League Football.\nIn 1925\u201326, Stenhousemuir goalkeeper Joe Shortt was offered a \u00A350 bribe to throw a match against Broxburn, but he rejected the offer and the Warriors won the match 6\u20132. A bookmaker from Bainsford, a small village on the outskirts of Falkirk, was subsequently jailed for attempted match fixing.\nIn 1928, the wooden grandstand at Ochilview Park burnt down in a fire, which lead to a new stand being built in its place, although staircases had to be added later due to planning errors. During the 1936\u201337 season saw the club record a record victory \u2013 a 9\u20132 win against Dundee United. More than a decade later in 1949\u201350, a Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against East Fife drew a record crowd of 12,500 \u2013 the highest ever at Ochilview Park.. In November 1951, the first floodlit game between two Scottish senior teams occurred at Ochilview Park, between Stenhousemuir and Hibernian.\nIn the summer of 1964, Rangers FC revealed a plan to The Scottish Football League to remove the Warriors from the league, along with four other clubs, on the basis that they were poorest-supported clubs over the previous three seasons. Four years later, Stenhousemuir, along with Albion Rovers, Berwick Rangers, Brechin City and Stranraer, with support from a number of clubs, including Celtic F.C., Hamilton Academical F.C. and Airdrieonians F.C., successfully defeated this plan.\nIn 1972\u201373, the Warriors defeated Rangers 2\u20131 at Ibrox Stadium in the Scottish League Cup. Notably, Rangers were the holders of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup at the time.\n1990\u2013present.\nIn 1992\u201393, the team allowed their rivals Stirling Albion to share their stadium Ochilview Park. In the 1993\u201394 season, the Warriors moved out of the bottom league for the first time, due to the formation of the Scottish Third Division. The mid-90s was one of the club's most successful periods in its history; in 1994\u201395 they defeated St. Johnstone 4\u20130 and Aberdeen 2\u20130, both higher league opposition, en-route to the Scottish Cup quarter finals. In the 1995\u201396 season, Stenhousemuir won the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Dundee United 5\u20134 on penalties after a goalless 90 minutes and extra time. In the process, reaching their first national semi-final since 1902.\nStenhousemuir was relegated from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish Third Division for the first time in the history of the club. However, the next season winning promotion back to the Second Division, also a first in its history.\nIn 2006\u201307, the club announced a plan to lay 'fake' grass at Ochilview Park. It became the first in the UK to pass the FIFA 2 Star category accreditation.\nStenhousemuir were promoted to the Scottish Second Division after defeating Cowdenbeath 5\u20134 on penalties after drawing 0\u20130 on aggregate in the play-off final at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. The 2010\u201311 season saw the club narrowly avoid relegation after spending most of the season in the relegation zone. On the final day of the season the club defeated Peterhead 3\u20130 to move above Alloa Athletic and therefore avoided the relegation play-offs.\nFor the 2011/2012 Season, the Home Kit is sponsored by [http://www.figure11.co.uk Figure 11 Communications Ltd], the Away Kit is sponsored by [http://www.apexhotels.co.uk/ Apex Hotels], and the rear of kit sponsor is [http://www.wrightandmaclennan.co.uk/ Wright & MacLennan].\nSupporters.\nStenhousemuir Supporters' Club is the official supporters' club of Stenhousemuir FC.
