Days when the win flag is flown are known as \"White Flag Days\". The tradition of flying a win or loss flag over the stadium began soon after the scoreboard was built in 1937.\nThe flag has used two different colors with the letter \"W\" on a solid background. The flag used now is white with a blue \"W.\" There is a flag used for losses with a letter \"L\". This flag is blue with a white \"L\" on it. Additionally, lights are shone on the flags that show if it was a win or loss. A new flag is used for each win. Some stores sell versions of the flag that also have the Cubs logo at the bottom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":23},{"uri":"Wrigley_Field","surface_form":"Wrigley Field","offset":45},{"uri":"Chicago_Cubs","surface_form":"Chicago Cubs","offset":71},{"uri":"Home_(sports)","surface_form":"home","offset":84},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":320},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":474},{"uri":"Scoreboard","surface_form":"scoreboard","offset":625},{"uri":"Logo","surface_form":"logo","offset":1048}]}
