{"id":303707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group","text":"The Local Group is the group of galaxies that includes our galaxy, the Milky Way.\nThe group has more than 50 galaxies (including dwarf galaxies). Its center of mass is somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. The galaxies of the Local Group cover a 10 million light-year diameter and have a binary (dumbbell) shape. The group has a total mass of about (1.29 \u00B1 0.14)Ms.\nThe group itself is part of the Virgo Supercluster (also called the Local Supercluster).\nHistory.\nThe term \"Local Group\" was introduced by Edwin Hubble in 1936. He describes it as \"a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field\". He listed the galaxies, by decreasing luminosity, as the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way, Triangulum galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud and half-a-dozen others.\nBy 2003, the number of known Local Group members has increased from his initial twelve to thirty-six, because of the discovery of almost two dozen low-luminosity galaxies.\nMovement of the Local Group.\nThe Milky Way, Andromeda, and the whole Local Group are being pulled by the gravitational attraction of the most massive structure in the observable universe. They are being pulled by the Shapley attractor, which is a dense supercluster of galaxies some 750 million light years from the Milky Way.\nAt the same time, the Local Group is being pushed by an almost empty region of space called the \"dipole repeller\".\nMap.\nImage:Local_Group.svg|frame|center|Local Group (clickable map)\ncircle 180 27 20 Sextans B\ncircle 130 36 23 Sextans A\ncircle 318 239 20 Milky Way\ncircle 289 197 16 Leo I (dwarf galaxy)\ncircle 334 201 15 Canes Dwarf\nrect 303 185 318 215 Leo II (dwarf galaxy)\ncircle 357 289 28 NGC 6822\ncircle 288 323 24 Phoenix Dwarf\ncircle 248 391 35 Tucana Dwarf\ncircle 363 416 20 Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte\ncircle 363 383 17 Cetus Dwarf\ncircle 369 346 11 IC 1613\nrect 381 335 393 357 SagDIG\nrect 393 335 406 356 Aquarius Dwarf\ncircle 417 304 17 Triangulum Galaxy\ncircle 417 254 15 NGC 185\nrect 432 237 447 260 NGC 147\ncircle 461 229 17 IC 10\npoly 440 282 455 260 511 259 493 285 Andromeda Galaxy\npoly 450 264 434 265 431 280 442 280 M110\ncircle 295 110 20 Leo A\ncircle 84 128 20 NGC 3109\ncircle 109 149 14 Antlia Dwarf\ncircle 412 332 12 LGS 3\ncircle 460 361 21 Pegasus Dwarf\ncircle 394 272 14 Andromeda II\nrect 427 279 438 294 Andromeda III\nrect 438 282 450 294 Andromeda I","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxies","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":32},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":71},{"uri":"Dwarf_galaxy","surface_form":"dwarf galaxies","offset":129},{"uri":"Center_of_mass","surface_form":"center of mass","offset":150},{"uri":"Andromeda_galaxy","surface_form":"Andromeda galaxy","offset":208},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":277},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":288},{"uri":"Solar_mass","surface_form":"Ms","offset":382},{"uri":"Virgo_Supercluster","surface_form":"Virgo Supercluster","offset":418},{"uri":"Edwin_Hubble","surface_form":"Edwin Hubble","offset":525},{"uri":"Andromeda_galaxy","surface_form":"Andromeda galaxy","offset":698},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":720},{"uri":"Triangulum_galaxy","surface_form":"Triangulum galaxy","offset":731},{"uri":"Large_Magellanic_Cloud","surface_form":"Large Magellanic Cloud","offset":754},{"uri":"Small_Magellanic_Cloud","surface_form":"Small Magellanic Cloud","offset":782},{"uri":"Gravitational","surface_form":"gravitational","offset":1107},{"uri":"Shapley_Supercluster","surface_form":"Shapley attractor","offset":1219},{"uri":"Sextans_B","surface_form":"Sextans B","offset":1529},{"uri":"Sextans_A","surface_form":"Sextans A","offset":1556},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":1584},{"uri":"Leo_I_(dwarf_galaxy)","surface_form":"Leo I (dwarf galaxy)","offset":1612},{"uri":"Canes_Dwarf","surface_form":"Canes Dwarf","offset":1651},{"uri":"Leo_II_(dwarf_galaxy)","surface_form":"Leo II (dwarf galaxy)","offset":1684},{"uri":"NGC_6822","surface_form":"NGC 6822","offset":1724},{"uri":"Phoenix_Dwarf","surface_form":"Phoenix Dwarf","offset":1751},{"uri":"Tucana_Dwarf","surface_form":"Tucana Dwarf","offset":1783},{"uri":"Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte","surface_form":"Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte","offset":1814},{"uri":"Cetus_Dwarf","surface_form":"Cetus Dwarf","offset":1854},{"uri":"IC_1613","surface_form":"IC 1613","offset":1884},{"uri":"SagDIG","surface_form":"SagDIG","offset":1913},{"uri":"Aquarius_Dwarf","surface_form":"Aquarius Dwarf","offset":1941},{"uri":"Triangulum_Galaxy","surface_form":"Triangulum Galaxy","offset":1974},{"uri":"NGC_185","surface_form":"NGC 185","offset":2010},{"uri":"NGC_147","surface_form":"NGC 147","offset":2039},{"uri":"IC_10","surface_form":"IC 10","offset":2065},{"uri":"Andromeda_Galaxy","surface_form":"Andromeda Galaxy","offset":2108},{"uri":"Messier_110","surface_form":"M110","offset":2162},{"uri":"Leo_A","surface_form":"Leo A","offset":2185},{"uri":"NGC_3109","surface_form":"NGC 3109","offset":2208},{"uri":"Antlia_Dwarf","surface_form":"Antlia Dwarf","offset":2235},{"uri":"LGS_3","surface_form":"LGS 3","offset":2266},{"uri":"Pegasus_Dwarf_Spheroidal_Galaxy","surface_form":"Pegasus Dwarf","offset":2290},{"uri":"Andromeda_II","surface_form":"Andromeda II","offset":2322},{"uri":"Andromeda_III","surface_form":"Andromeda III","offset":2356},{"uri":"Andromeda_I","surface_form":"Andromeda I","offset":2391}]}
