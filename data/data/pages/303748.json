{"id":303748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eephus_pitch","text":"e=\"preserve\">An Eephus pitch is a kind of pitch in baseball. It is a kind of \"junk pitch\" (trick pitch). An Eephus pitch is very slow and is used to catch the batter off guard. The pitch was invented by Rip Sewell of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s. The name \"Eephus pitch\" comes from the Hebrew word ', which means \"nothing.\" Pirates manager Frankie Frisch claimed that the pitch was named by outfielder Maurice Van Robays. Van Robays explained that \"Eephus ain't nothing, and that's a nothing pitch.\"\nCommon features == .\nThe Eephus pitch is thrown overhand, like other pitches in baseball. It is unusually slow, and has a high arc trajectory (the ball travels along a high curve.) The trajectory (the path the ball travels) looks more like a pitch from slow-pitch softball than baseball.\nThe Eephus pitch is unusually slow. It appears to move in slow motion. The ball travels or less. Baseball pitches in Major League Baseball usually travel between. The Eephus pitch is considered a trick pitch because it is so slow.\nOther names.\nSome other nicknames are bloop curve and gravity curve. It is sometimes also called the Bugs Bunny curve. This name comes from a Bugs Bunny cartoon called \"Baseball Bugs.\" In the cartoon, batters swing three times at a very slow pitch before it reaches home plate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pitch_(baseball)","surface_form":"pitch","offset":42},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":51},{"uri":"Batting_(baseball)","surface_form":"batter","offset":159},{"uri":"Rip_Sewell","surface_form":"Rip Sewell","offset":203},{"uri":"Pittsburgh_Pirates","surface_form":"Pittsburgh Pirates","offset":221},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":293},{"uri":"Frankie_Frisch","surface_form":"Frankie Frisch","offset":347},{"uri":"Outfield","surface_form":"outfield","offset":398},{"uri":"Maurice_Van_Robays","surface_form":"Maurice Van Robays","offset":409},{"uri":"Arc","surface_form":"arc","offset":634},{"uri":"Trajectory","surface_form":"trajectory","offset":638},{"uri":"Softball","surface_form":"softball","offset":771},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":912},{"uri":"Bugs_Bunny","surface_form":"Bugs Bunny","offset":1168},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":1179},{"uri":"Baseball_Bugs","surface_form":"Baseball Bugs","offset":1195},{"uri":"Home_plate","surface_form":"home plate","offset":1292}]}
