{"id":30395,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A miscarriage is the natural death of an embryo or fetus in the womb, before it is old enough to live on its own, outside the mother. The medical words for a miscarriage are spontaneous abortion. (\"Spontaneous\" means something that a person did not expect to happen. An \"abortion\" is when a pregnancy ends early, before birth.)\nAmong women who know they are pregnant, about 15-20% have miscarriages. (This means that up to 1 in every 5 women who know they are pregnant miscarries.) It is the most common complication (serious problem) that happens in early pregnancy in humans.\nMiscarriage vs. Stillbirth.\nIn the United States, if a fetus dies after it is 20 weeks old, its death is no longer called a miscarriage. Its death is called a \"stillbirth\", a \"fetal demise\", or a \"fetal death\". (\"Demise\" means \"death.\")\nCauses of Miscarriage.\nThe most common causes of miscarriage change depending on what trimester the mother is in. (Each trimester lasts about three months.)\nFirst Trimester (Weeks 1-12).\nMost miscarriages happen during the first trimester. Some studies say that two-thirds (two out of three) to three-quarters (three out of four) of all miscarriages happen during this trimester. About 30% to 40% (3 to 4 in every 10) of all fertilized eggs miscarry, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.\nIn more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, the embryo has chromosomes that are not normal. These chromosomal problems may happen because of problems as the embryo grows and its cells make copies of themselves. It is also possible for chromosomal problems to happen because of a problem with a parent's genes. However, this is more likely to happen in women who has had other miscarriages, or if one of the parents has a child or other relatives with birth defects. Genetic problems are more likely to happen with older parents; this may be why miscarriages are more common in older women.\nAnother cause may be the mother not having enough progesterone. If a woman is diagnosed with low progesterone levels in the second half of her menstrual cycle (the luteal phase), she may be prescribed progesterone, to take during the first trimester of her pregnancy. However, when a woman might already be miscarrying, there is no evidence that first-trimester progesterone pills decrease the risk of having a miscarriage. Scientists have even questioned whether problems with the luteal phase really can cause miscarriages.\nSecond Trimester (Weeks 13-27).\nThese problems can also cause premature birth (when a baby is born earlier than expected).\nOne study found that 19% of second trimester miscarriages were caused by problems with the umbilical cord. The fetus gets blood and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive. If the baby cannot get enough oxygen because of a problem with the cord, it can die.\nProblems with the placenta may also cause second-trimester miscarriages. Nutrients and blood pass through the placenta in order to get from the mother to the umbilical cord. The placenta also helps filter out some things that could hurt the fetus. If there is a problem with the placenta, the fetus could die because it did not get enough nutrients and oxygen, or because the placenta did not filter out harmful things.\nHow is Miscarriage Diagnosed?\nMiscarriage is usually diagnosed when a pregnant woman notices that she is having certain symptoms and goes to see a doctor. The most common symptom of a coming miscarriage is bleeding during early pregnancy. The woman may not have any pain.\nUsually, if a pregnant woman is bleeding or having pain, an ultrasound should be done. The ultrasound can show that the fetus's heart is not beating, which means that the fetus has miscarried. If this happens, special tests should be done to make sure the woman does not have an ectopic pregnancy, which can kill a woman.\nNot all light bleeding during early pregnancy means a woman is having a miscarriage. But any woman having light bleeding during pregnancy should see her doctor. If the bleeding is heavy, the woman is having a lot of pain, or she has a fever, she should go to an Emergency Room or call an ambulance to take her to the hospital.\nIf a woman has bleeding during her pregnancy, she may be diagnosed with a \"threatened miscarriage.\" In the past, if a doctor thought a pregnancy might miscarry in the future, they would suggest bed rest for the mother (lying in bed for most of the time). Today, most doctors and scientists think that bed rest does not help.\nHow is Miscarriage Treated?\nThe treatment is different for each kind of miscarriage.\nComplete Miscarriage.\nIf a woman has a complete miscarriage, she usually does not need any medical treatment.\nIncomplete or Missed Miscarriage.\nWith no treatment (watchful waiting), most of these cases (65\u201380%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks. This path avoids the side effects and complications possible from medications and surgery, but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage.\nWhich Treatment Should Be Used?\nThe choice of which treatment to use depends on many things, including what the mother wants. However, there are guidelines that doctors use to suggest what treatment to use.\nThe most important things that help doctors decide what to do are the age and size of the embryo, and the size of the gestational sac (the fluid around the embryo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":55},{"uri":"Womb","surface_form":"womb","offset":78},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":285},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":571},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":584},{"uri":"Stillborn","surface_form":"\"stillbirth\"","offset":751},{"uri":"Fertilization","surface_form":"fertilized","offset":1254},{"uri":"Zygote","surface_form":"eggs","offset":1265},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":1345},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":1415},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":1534},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"make copies of themselves","offset":1540},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":1659},{"uri":"Birth_defect","surface_form":"birth defect","offset":1807},{"uri":"Progesterone","surface_form":"progesterone","offset":1996},{"uri":"Menstruation","surface_form":"menstrual cycle","offset":2089},{"uri":"Luteal_phase","surface_form":"luteal phase","offset":2110},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":2278},{"uri":"Premature_birth","surface_form":"premature birth","offset":2534},{"uri":"Umbilical_cord","surface_form":"umbilical cord","offset":2686},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":2717},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":2727},{"uri":"Hypoxia","surface_form":"cannot get enough oxygen","offset":2832},{"uri":"Placenta","surface_form":"placenta","offset":2923},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"Nutrient","offset":2978},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosed","offset":3378},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":3445},{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":3531},{"uri":"Ultrasound","surface_form":"ultrasound","offset":3657},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":3725},{"uri":"Ectopic_pregnancy","surface_form":"ectopic pregnancy","offset":3876},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":4154},{"uri":"Emergency_medicine","surface_form":"Emergency Room","offset":4181},{"uri":"Ambulance","surface_form":"ambulance","offset":4207},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":4236},{"uri":"Watchful_waiting","surface_form":"watchful waiting","offset":4819},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":5408},{"uri":"Gestational_sac","surface_form":"gestational sac","offset":5436}]}
