{"id":30469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinyes","text":"The Erinyes (or Eumenides) were the goddesses of revenge in Greek mythology. They are also known as the Furies. These three female divinities were named Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.\nDescription.\nThe Erinyes were born from Mother Earth and the blood of Uranos. They avenged family crimes such as matricide and patricide. They also tormented evil men in the \"Hell\" of the underworld, Tartarus.\nThe Erinyes forever followed a person who did a crime. They even could make the person go mad. They are often shown with snakes on their heads, blood coming out of their eyes, and looking horrific.\nIn stories.\nA well known story about the Erinyes is that of Orestes. Orestes' mother Klytaimnestra, and her lover Aegisthos, killed Orestes' father Agamemnon. The god Apollo told Orestes to kill the murderers of his father, which he did. Orestes was then pursued by the Erinyes for his crime. With the help of Athena and Apollo Orestes went to a court in Athens. It was decided that Orestes acted correctly and nobody should hurt him. Even the Erinyes accepted the decision, and from then on they were also called Eumenides, which means \"the kind ones\", because they could also let people go in peace if their crime was done for a good reason.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":36},{"uri":"Revenge","surface_form":"revenge","offset":49},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":60},{"uri":"Uranos","surface_form":"Uranos","offset":255},{"uri":"Matricide","surface_form":"matricide","offset":298},{"uri":"Patricide","surface_form":"patricide","offset":312},{"uri":"Greek_underworld","surface_form":"Tartarus","offset":385},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":443},{"uri":"Insanity","surface_form":"mad","offset":485},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":516},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":539},{"uri":"Orestes","surface_form":"Orestes","offset":653},{"uri":"Klytaimnestra","surface_form":"Klytaimnestra","offset":678},{"uri":"Aegisthos","surface_form":"Aegisthos","offset":707},{"uri":"Agamemnon","surface_form":"Agamemnon","offset":741},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":760},{"uri":"Murderer","surface_form":"murderer","offset":792},{"uri":"Athena","surface_form":"Athena","offset":903},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":914},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":939},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":948}]}
