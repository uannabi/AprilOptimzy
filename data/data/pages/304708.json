{"id":304708,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remora","text":"Remora sometimes called a suckerfish or sharksucker, is an elongated, brown fish in the order Perciformes and family Echeneidae. They are small fish that live on and around sharks. They eat stray bits of food left by the shark and tiny shrimp-like parasites that live on the shark's skin. They have sucker-like disks on their heads with which they attach to the shark.\nBoth the shark and the remora benefit from the pairing, but the remore benefits much more; this is commensalism. Remora are also known as sucker fish or shark sucker.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":76},{"uri":"Perciformes","surface_form":"Perciformes","offset":94},{"uri":"Shark","surface_form":"shark","offset":173},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":236},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":283},{"uri":"Sucker","surface_form":"sucker","offset":299},{"uri":"Commensalism","surface_form":"commensalism","offset":468}]}
