Since 1979, Oman has contributed to the growth of the \"Olympic Movement\".\nThe International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Qatar is QAT.\nHistory.\nThe Qatar Olympic Committee was formed in 1979 and recognized by the IOC in 1980.\nTeams from Qatar have taken part in the Summer Olympic Games but not the Winter Olympic Games.\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Qatar was, along with Saudi Arabia and Brunei, one of only three countries to never send a female athlete to the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee in 2010 said it would \"press\" these countries to have women's participate. Then the Qatar Olympic Committee said it \"hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and fencing\" to the 2012 Summer Games in London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oman","surface_form":"Oman","offset":104},{"uri":"Contribute","surface_form":"contributed","offset":113},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":170},{"uri":"Qatar","surface_form":"Qatar","offset":230},{"uri":"List_of_IOC_country_codes","surface_form":"QAT","offset":239},{"uri":"Recognize","surface_form":"recognized","offset":304},{"uri":"Summer_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Summer Olympic Games","offset":375},{"uri":"Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympic Games","offset":408},{"uri":"2008_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2008 Summer Olympics","offset":440},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia_at_the_Olympics","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":484},{"uri":"Brunei_at_the_Olympics","surface_form":"Brunei","offset":501},{"uri":"Athlete","surface_form":"athlete","offset":560},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":575},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":594},{"uri":"Shooting_at_the_Olympics","surface_form":"shooting","offset":787},{"uri":"Fencing_at_the_Olympics","surface_form":"fencing","offset":800},{"uri":"2012_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2012 Summer Games","offset":816}]}
