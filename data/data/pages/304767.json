They do not have the brown shadow stripes of the Chapman Zebra.\nSelous's Zebra lives in the northwest of Kenya, parts of Uganda, and the southeast of Sudan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":62},{"uri":"Zebra","surface_form":"plains zebra","offset":80},{"uri":"Critically_endangered_species","surface_form":"critically endangered species","offset":130},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":485},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":501},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":530}]}
