{"id":3048,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales","text":"Wales\u00A0(;\u00A0 [\u02C8k\u0259m.r\u0268] (come-ree) is a\u00A0country on the island of Great Britain. It is one of the four countries that make up the\u00A0United Kingdom. It is west of England, and east of the Irish Sea and Ireland.\nWales is one of the six\u00A0Celtic nations. The native people of Wales, the Welsh, have their own culture and traditions. They have their own Celtic language, Welsh. Although not all Welsh people can speak Welsh, it is a real living language for about 20% of Welsh people. Nearly all Welsh people can speak English. Some of them speak only English. The Welsh language has official status in Wales.\nThree million people live in Wales. Most of them live in the southern and eastern parts of the country. In this area is the capital and largest city of Wales, Cardiff, and the next largest city, Swansea.\nHistory.\nPeople have lived in Wales for at least 29,000 years. The Romans first entered Wales in 43 AD, and took it around 77 AD.\nThe word 'Wales'.\nThe English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" come from the old Germanic word\u00A0\"Walh\" (plural:\u00A0\"Walha\").\u00A0\"Walh\" itself came from a Celtic tribe, called the\u00A0\"Volcae\" by the\u00A0Romans. That was eventually used for the name of all Celts and later to all people who lived in the\u00A0Roman empire. The\u00A0Anglo-Saxons who lived in\u00A0England and who spoke\u00A0Old English called the people living in Wales\u00A0\"W\u00E6lisc\" and the land itself\u00A0\"W\u0113alas\". Other names that come from these origins\u00A0Wallonia,\u00A0Wallachia, and Vlachs.\nIn the past, the words\u00A0\"Wales\" and\u00A0\"Welsh\" were used to mean anything that the\u00A0Anglo-Saxons associated with the Celtic Britons. That included Cornwall, Walworth, and\u00A0Walton, as well as things associated with non-Germanic Europeans like\u00A0walnuts.\nThe modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry, and Cymru which is the Welsh name for Wales. These words are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning \"fellow-countrymen\"\nConquest by Edward I and brief independence under Owain Glynd\u0175r.\nAfter Llywelyn ap Gruffudd died in 1282, Edward I of\u00A0England\u00A0finished his conquest of Wales, which made it a part of England.\u00A0Owain Glynd\u0175r\u00A0was a Welsh leader who fought against English rule in the early 15th century. However, after he was defeated by the English, the whole of Wales was taken over by England, with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542.\nLaws in Wales Acts and annexation by England.\nIn the 16th century, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542 were passed in England while\u00A0Henry VIII\u00A0was king there. These added Wales to England. They also said that people who spoke Welsh instead of English could not hold public office.\nIndustrial Revolution.\nWales is on ancient rocks which were once in the roots of great mountain systems. In the last three centuries the products of those rocks have transformed what was once an agricultural landscape.\nRocks were smelted to release copper and iron, key products needed by the industrial revolution. Coal itself is moved by canals and later by rail to England.\nSocial justice was needed for the workers who came into Wales to do this work.\nAt the start of the\u00A0industrial revolution, the\u00A0mining\u00A0and\u00A0metal\u00A0industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial country. The new jobs in South Wales caused a quick rise in the number of people living in Wales. This is the reason why two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, mainly in the capital\u00A0Cardiff\u00A0(\"Caerdydd\"), as well as\u00A0Swansea\u00A0(\"Abertawe\"),\u00A0Newport\u00A0(\"Casnewydd\"), and in the nearby valleys. Now that the coal industry has become a lot smaller, Wales' economy depends mostly on the\u00A0public sector, light and service industries and\u00A0tourism. In 2010, the Gross Value Added of Wales was \u00A345.5 billion - \u00A315,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain.\nReturn of Welsh identity and devolution of Government.\nIt took until the 19th Century for Welsh-centric politics to return to Wales.\u00A0Liberalism in Wales, which was introduced in the early 20th century by Lloyd George, was overtaken by the growth of socialism and the\u00A0Labour Party. However, Welsh pride got stronger, and in 1925\u00A0Plaid Cymru was made, which was the first political party to campaign for Welsh independence. In 1962, the Welsh Language Society was made to encourage the\u00A0Welsh language, which had nearly disappeared during the take over by England. A big change was made in 1998, when the first Government of Wales for the country since its addition to the United Kingdom under the Government of Wales Act (1998). This created an Assembly for Wales, known in Welsh as the senedd. The Senedd has responsibility for a range of laws which have been\u00A0devolved from the main\u00A0UK government in\u00A0Westminster. This means the members of the Assembly can change certain laws in Wales to be different to the rest of the UK.\nGeography.\nWales has a coastline which is 1680 miles long, and the country itself is 20,779\u00A0km2\u00A0large. The highest mountains in Wales are in\u00A0Gwynedd, in the north-west, and include\u00A0Snowdon ('), which is the highest peak in Wales at 1085 m (3,560\u00A0ft). There are three National Parks in Wales:\u00A0Snowdonia (), Brecon Beacons (), and\u00A0Pembrokeshire Coast ().\nLocal government.\nWales is divided into 22 council areas. These areas are responsible for local government services, such as education, social work, environment and roads services.\n\"The list to the right of the map shows counties, unless they are marked *, meaning they are cities, or \u2020 for County Boroughs. Welsh-language forms are given in parentheses.\"\nWelsh identity.\nWelsh people are very proud of their country. The first people in Wales to call themselves 'Welsh' were the Celts. The Celts lived in Wales after the Romans left in the 5th century. The national emblems of Wales are\u00A0leeks and\u00A0daffodils.\nAlthough Wales is very close to the rest of Great Britain, and despite most people speaking\u00A0English, the country has always had a distinct\u00A0culture. It is officially\u00A0bilingual in English and Welsh. Over 560,000 people in Wales speak the\u00A0Welsh language. In some parts of the north and west of the country, particularly in small, rural communities, the majority of people speak\u00A0Welsh.\nFrom the late 19th century, Wales became famous as the \"land of song\", and for its\u00A0Eisteddfod culture festival. At many international sport events, for example the\u00A0FIFA World Cup, the\u00A0Rugby World Cup, and the\u00A0Commonwealth Games, Wales competes on its own, as a separate country. However, at most international events, such at the\u00A0Olympics, Wales competes with the rest of the Great Britain, and sometimes as the\u00A0United Kingdom with\u00A0Northern Ireland included.\u00A0Rugby Union is strongly associated with Wales as a national sport.\nRoads.\nThe main road on the coast of South Wales is the M4 motorway. It links Wales to southern England, and London. It also connects the Welsh cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. The A55 road is the main road along the north Wales coast, and connects Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to north-west England, including Chester. The main road between North and South Wales is the A470 road, which goes from the capital Cardiff to Llandudno.\nAirports.\nCardiff International Airport is the only large airport in Wales. It has flights to Europe, Africa and North America and is about southwest of Cardiff, in the Vale of Glamorgan. Flights between places in Wales run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and are operated by the Isle of Man airline called Manx2 Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nRailway.\nCardiff Central is Wales' busiest railway station. The area around Cardiff also has its own rail network. Trains from north to south Wales go through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury on the Welsh Marches Line. All trains in Wales are powered by diesel, as there are no electric rail lines. However, the South Wales Main Line which is used by trains going from London Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea, is currently being changed to electric.\nSea.\nWales has four ferry ports. Regular ferries to Ireland go from Holyhead, Pembroke and Fishguard. The Swansea to Cork ferry which was stopped in 2006, but then opened again in March 2010, and closed again in 2012.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":36},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":51},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great
