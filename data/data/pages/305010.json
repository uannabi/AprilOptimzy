{"id":305010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Medal","text":"The George Medal (GM) is the second highest civil award of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. It ranks below the George Cross. It is only awarded for non-combat acts of bravery.\nThe GM was created on 24 September 1940 by King George VI. At this time, during the height of The Blitz, there was a desire to reward acts of civilian courage. It was decided that the George Cross and the GM would recognise civilian bravery in the face of enemy action and brave deeds more widely.\nThe Warrant for the GM was published in the \"London Gazette\" on 31 January 1941. The medal is granted in recognition of \"acts of great bravery\". The GM was originally not issued posthumously, but the warrant was amended in 1977 to allow posthumous awards, several of which have been subsequently made.\nBars are awarded to the GM in recognition of the performance of further acts of bravery meriting the award. In undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to indicate each bar. Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters GM.\nThe details of all awards to British and Commonwealth recipients are published in the \"London Gazette\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civil","surface_form":"civil","offset":44},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":63},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":82},{"uri":"George_Cross","surface_form":"George Cross","offset":115},{"uri":"George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George VI","offset":223},{"uri":"The_Blitz","surface_form":"The Blitz","offset":274},{"uri":"Courage","surface_form":"courage","offset":331},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":404},{"uri":"London_Gazette","surface_form":"London Gazette","offset":523}]}
