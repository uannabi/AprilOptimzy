{"id":305024,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWOP","text":"QWOP is a Flash game created by Bennett Foddy and released on the Internet in 2008 to his website called \"Foddy.net\". Players play as an athlete named \"Qwop\", who is participating in a 100-meter sprint event at the Olympic Games. Using only the Q, W, O and P keys, players must control the movement of the legs to make the character move forward. When the player has successfully reached 50 meters they must jump a hurdle, and at 100 meters the player is encouraged to perform a long jump, although simply passing the finish line is sufficient to complete the game.\nThe game has been criticized for being too hard to get good at. In early December 2010, the game had a viral popularity outbreak after video blogger Ray William Johnson reviewed a YouTube video that annotates the game, becoming the subject of an Internet meme. Despite this, the game helped Foddy\u2019s site reach 30 million views.<ref name = \"https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain\"> After the success of the game, Foddy created another flash game called \"GIRP\", which was released on his site in 2011.<ref name = \"https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain\">","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Browser_game","surface_form":"Flash game","offset":10},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":66},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":215},{"uri":"Long_jump","surface_form":"long jump","offset":479},{"uri":"Internet_meme","surface_form":"Internet meme","offset":812}]}
