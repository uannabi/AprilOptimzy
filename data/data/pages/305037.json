{"id":305037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem","text":"e=\"preserve\">The structured program theorem is a theorem in programming and computer science. A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task. According to the structured program theorem, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done.\nThe theorem was first published in 1966 by Corrado B\u00F6hm and Guiseppe Jacopini. It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by Stephen Kleene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":49},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming","offset":60},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":76},{"uri":"Source_code","surface_form":"code","offset":141},{"uri":"Task","surface_form":"task","offset":164},{"uri":"Corrado_B%C3%B6hm","surface_form":"Corrado B\u00F6hm","offset":342},{"uri":"Guiseppe_Jacopini","surface_form":"Guiseppe Jacopini","offset":359},{"uri":"Von_Neumann_architecture","surface_form":"von Neumann architecture","offset":420},{"uri":"Normal_form_theorem","surface_form":"normal form theorem","offset":453},{"uri":"Stephen_Kleene","surface_form":"Stephen Kleene","offset":486}]}
