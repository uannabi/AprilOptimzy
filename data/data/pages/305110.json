{"id":305110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barebacking","text":"Barebacking is when people have sexual intercourse without using a condom. The term originated in the gay community, and was used to refer to unprotected anal sex. The word is related to \"bareback\", which means riding a horse without a saddle. Barebacking refers to a deliberate decision to not use a condom, forgetting to use a condom is not barebacking.\nBarebacking is dangerous, because there is a high risk of infection with sexually transmitted diseases, such as Syphilis, or HIV. Even if both partners are HIV positive, there is a risk of infection with other strains of HIV. This may mean that the disease becomes more difficult to treat, or that certain drugs stop working.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":32},{"uri":"Condom","surface_form":"condom","offset":67},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":102},{"uri":"Anal_sex","surface_form":"anal sex","offset":154},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":220},{"uri":"Saddle","surface_form":"saddle","offset":236},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":414},{"uri":"Sexually_transmitted_disease","surface_form":"sexually transmitted diseases","offset":429},{"uri":"Syphilis","surface_form":"Syphilis","offset":468},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":481},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":545},{"uri":"Strain_(biology)","surface_form":"strains","offset":566},{"uri":"Drugs","surface_form":"drugs","offset":662}]}
