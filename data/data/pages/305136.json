It also is the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial bodies.\nDawn was launched on September 27, 2007 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta 7925-H rocket. It then travelled to Mars for a gravity assist, making its closest approach to Mars in February 2009.\nNext, Dawn set off for Vesta. It went into orbit in July, 2011. On September 5, 2012, Dawn left Vesta and headed for Ceres. It began to orbit Ceres on March 6, 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":20},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"space probe","offset":25},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":69},{"uri":"4_Vesta","surface_form":"Vesta","offset":78},{"uri":"Dwarf_planet","surface_form":"dwarf planet","offset":118},{"uri":"Ceres_(dwarf_planet)","surface_form":"Ceres","offset":131},{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"asteroid belt","offset":170},{"uri":"Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","surface_form":"Cape Canaveral Air Force Station","offset":372},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":456},{"uri":"Gravity_assist","surface_form":"gravity assist","offset":467}]}
