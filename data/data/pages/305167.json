He was made a cardinal in 1515. Of humble origin, Thomas Wolsey became the principal figure in affairs of state for many years during the reign of King Henry VIII of England before falling into disgrace.\nCardinal Wolsey chiefly developed his talents in managing the foreign policy of the kingdom on behalf of Henry VIII. In spite of the many enemies who envied his ambition, he was able to acquire the confidence of the king until the latter decided to have his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled in order to marry Anne Boleyn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ipswich","surface_form":"Ipswich","offset":45},{"uri":"Suffolk","surface_form":"Suffolk","offset":54},{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII of England","offset":279},{"uri":"Catherine_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Catherine of Aragon","offset":601},{"uri":"Anne_Boleyn","surface_form":"Anne Boleyn","offset":648}]}
