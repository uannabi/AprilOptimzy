It is part of the London Borough of Camden. It is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for the large and hilly parkland Hampstead Heath. Some of the most expensive housing in the London area, or indeed anywhere in the world is in Hampstead, with large houses selling for up to \u00A350m (2008). The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the United Kingdom.\nHampstead has long been known as a residence of writers, composers, ballerinas, intellectuals, actors, artists and architects, many of whom created a bohemian community in the late 19th century. After 1917, and again in the 1930s, it became base to a community of avant garde artists and writers and was host to a number of \u00E9migr\u00E9s and exiles from the Russian Revolution and Nazi Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":40},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":48},{"uri":"Charing_Cross","surface_form":"Charing Cross","offset":77},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Camden","surface_form":"London Borough of Camden","offset":110},{"uri":"Hampstead_Heath","surface_form":"Hampstead Heath","offset":260},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":526},{"uri":"Russian_Revolution","surface_form":"Russian Revolution","offset":894},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":917}]}
