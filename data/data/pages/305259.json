{"id":305259,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing","text":"Saut\u00E9ing is a method of cooking food. It uses a small amount of fat in a shallow pan. The heat must be quite high. Ingredients are often cut into pieces or sliced thinly. It makes things cook faster.\nFood that is saut\u00E9ed is browned, but it keeps the same texture, moisture and flavor. If meat, or fish is saut\u00E9ed, the saut\u00E9 is sometimes finished by using the pan's remains to make a sauce.\nSaut\u00E9ing is different from pan-frying. People sometimes confuse the two. In pan-frying larger pieces of food (for example, chops or steaks) are cooked quickly. Saut\u00E9ing is also different from searing. Searing only browns the surface of the food. Olive oil or clarified butter are commonly used for saut\u00E9ing. Most others fats will work too. Regular butter will produce more flavor. However it burns at a lower temperature and more quickly than other fats. This is because of the milk solids in it. Therefore clarified butter is better for saut\u00E9ing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":24},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":32},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":64},{"uri":"Pan","surface_form":"pan","offset":81},{"uri":"Texture","surface_form":"texture","offset":255},{"uri":"Moisture","surface_form":"moisture","offset":264},{"uri":"Flavor","surface_form":"flavor","offset":277},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":288},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":297},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":383},{"uri":"Chop","surface_form":"chop","offset":513},{"uri":"Steak","surface_form":"steak","offset":522},{"uri":"Searing","surface_form":"searing","offset":582},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"Olive oil","offset":636},{"uri":"Clarified_butter","surface_form":"clarified butter","offset":649},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":738},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":799},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":868}]}
