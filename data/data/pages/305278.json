It goes around the first district in almost the shape of a circle. The street is 5.2 km long and is divided into nine sections. It is one of the main sights in Vienna.\nHistory.\nOn December 20th, 1857, emperor Franz Joseph I. ordered to destroy the old city walls and to build a street which should show the glory of the Habsburg Empire. The old walls were a traffic block because in 1850, the suburbs became part of the city as districts II. till IX. The order of the emperor outlined the exact size of the boulevard, as well as the geographical positions and functions of the new buildings. The only building which was erected by the city was the Town Hall.\nDuring the following years, a large number of important public and private buildings were erected. Nobility and bourgeoisie began to build mansions along the street. Most of them were built in the Ringstra\u00DFenstyle, which mainly quotes older styles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":84},{"uri":"Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria","surface_form":"Franz Joseph I.","offset":301},{"uri":"Habsburg_Empire","surface_form":"Habsburg Empire","offset":412}]}
