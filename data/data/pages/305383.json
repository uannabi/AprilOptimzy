{"id":305383,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight","text":"e=\"preserve\">Time period 00:00-00:00 is midnight. On computer clocks, the day changes to the next day the minute(s) after midnight.\nSolar midnight is the opposite of solar noon, which is when the sun is highest in the sky\nStart and end of day.\nIn the world, midnight is the start of one day and the end of the last day. It's the dividing point between two days.\nIn the United States and Canada, digital clocks and computers usually show 12\u00A0a.m. right at midnight. However, people have to remember that any time is actually an instant. The \"a.m.\" shown on clock displays means the 12-hour period after the instant of midnight. So when a clock says \"12:00 a.m.\", midnight has already passed and a new day has started. In other words, 11:59\u00A0p.m.\u00A0shows until midnight; at the instant of midnight, it changes to 12:00. At the same time, the p.m. changes to a.m., but a.m. does not mean the instant of midnight which separates p.m. and a.m.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Noon","surface_form":"solar noon","offset":166},{"uri":"Ante_meridiem","surface_form":"a.m","offset":440},{"uri":"Post_meridiem","surface_form":"p.m.","offset":738}]}
