{"id":305438,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostreidae","text":"Ostreidae are the true oysters. The family includes most species eaten under the name \"oyster\". Pearl oysters are not true oysters because they belong to a different order, the Pterioida.\nLike scallops, true oysters have a central adductor muscle. This causes a scar in the middle of the shell. It is the point of attachment. The shell is often irregular because oysters attach to substrates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":57},{"uri":"Oyster","surface_form":"oyster","offset":87},{"uri":"Pearl_oyster","surface_form":"Pearl oyster","offset":96},{"uri":"Pterioida","surface_form":"Pterioida","offset":177},{"uri":"Scallop","surface_form":"scallop","offset":193},{"uri":"Adductor_muscle","surface_form":"adductor muscle","offset":231},{"uri":"Scar","surface_form":"scar","offset":262},{"uri":"Animal_shell","surface_form":"shell","offset":288},{"uri":"Substrate","surface_form":"substrate","offset":381}]}
