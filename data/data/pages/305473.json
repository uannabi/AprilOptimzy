It is always freshly prepared. It is served warm with powdered sugar on it. The powdered sugar is said to represent the snow-covered peaks of the Gaisberg, Moenchsberg and Nonnberg.\nIn the operetta \"Saison in Salzburg\" (Season in Salzburg) by Fred Raymond, the dessert is praised in a song as \"\u201CSuess wie die Liebe und zart wie ein Kuss\u201D (meaning Sweet as love and tender as a kiss in German). A legend says that they were invented by Salome Alt, the concubine of Salzburg\u2032s Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in the early 17th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":30},{"uri":"Salzburg","surface_form":"Salzburg","offset":43},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":53},{"uri":"Egg_yolk","surface_form":"egg yolk","offset":85},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":95},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":102},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":109},{"uri":"Vanilla","surface_form":"vanilla","offset":115},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":128},{"uri":"Dough","surface_form":"dough","offset":151},{"uri":"Fred_Raymond","surface_form":"Fred Raymond","offset":401},{"uri":"Concubine","surface_form":"concubine","offset":609},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"Archbishop","offset":633},{"uri":"Wolf_Dietrich_von_Raitenau","surface_form":"Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau","offset":644}]}
