{"id":305478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochemistry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Thermochemistry is the study of the energy and heat to do with chemical reactions and physical transformations (physical changes). Physical transformations are when a state of matter (a solid or liquid, for example) changes to another state. Examples of transformations include melting (when a solid becomes a liquid) and boiling (when a liquid becomes a gas).\nA reaction gives out or takes in energy. A physical transformation also gives out or takes in energy. Thermochemistry looks at these energy changes, particularly on a system's energy exchange with its surroundings. Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities at all times during a given reaction. Thermochemists do this by using data, including entropy determinations. Thermochemists will tell if a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable.\nEndothermic reactions take in heat. Exothermic reactions give out heat. Thermochemistry combines the concepts of thermodynamics with the idea of energy in the form of chemical bonds. It includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of formation, enthalpy, entropy, free energy, and calories.\nHistory.\nThese discoveries came before the first law of thermodynamics (1845). They helped scientists understand this law.\nEdward Diaz and Hess investigated specific heat and latent heat. Joseph Black developed the concept of latent energy changes.\nGustav Kirchhoff showed in 1858 that change in the heat of reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants: formula_1. Integrating this equation allows the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.\nCalorimetry.\nThe measurement of heat changes is called calorimetry. It measures the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes. A calorimeter, a device for calorimetry, is usually a closed in chamber.\nCalorimetry has these steps: Chemists make the change happen inside the chamber. The temperature of the chamber is measured either using a thermometer or thermocouple. The temperature is plotted against time to give a graph. Chemists use the graph to calculate fundamental quantities.\nModern calorimeters have small computers that measure the temperature and give the calculated data quickly. One example is a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).\nProcesses.\nA system undergoes a \"process\" when one or more of its properties (characteristics) changes. A process relates (connects) to the change of state. An isothermal (same temperature) process happens when the temperature of the system stays the same. An isobaric (same pressure) process happens when the pressure of the system stays the same. An adiabatic (no heat exchange) process happens when no heat moves around.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":49},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":60},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":76},{"uri":"State_of_matter","surface_form":"state of matter","offset":180},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":199},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":208},{"uri":"Melting","surface_form":"melting","offset":291},{"uri":"Boiling","surface_form":"boiling","offset":335},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":368},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":541},{"uri":"Surroundings","surface_form":"surroundings","offset":575},{"uri":"Predict","surface_form":"predicting","offset":618},{"uri":"Entropy","surface_form":"entropy","offset":747},{"uri":"Spontaneity_(chemistry)","surface_form":"spontaneous or non-spontaneous","offset":813},{"uri":"Endothermic_reaction","surface_form":"Endothermic reaction","offset":871},{"uri":"Exothermic_reaction","surface_form":"Exothermic reaction","offset":907},{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamics","offset":984},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"chemical bond","offset":1038},{"uri":"Heat_capacity","surface_form":"heat capacity","offset":1101},{"uri":"Heat_of_combustion","surface_form":"heat of combustion","offset":1116},{"uri":"Heat_of_formation","surface_form":"heat of formation","offset":1136},{"uri":"Enthalpy","surface_form":"enthalpy","offset":1155},{"uri":"Entropy","surface_form":"entropy","offset":1165},{"uri":"Thermodynamic_potential","surface_form":"free energy","offset":1174},{"uri":"Calorie","surface_form":"calorie","offset":1191},{"uri":"First_law_of_thermodynamics","surface_form":"first law of thermodynamics","offset":1244},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":1292},{"uri":"Specific_heat","surface_form":"specific heat","offset":1358},{"uri":"Latent_heat","surface_form":"latent heat","offset":1376},{"uri":"Joseph_Black","surface_form":"Joseph Black","offset":1389},{"uri":"Gustav_Kirchhoff","surface_form":"Gustav Kirchhoff","offset":1450},{"uri":"Heat_capacity","surface_form":"heat capacity","offset":1548},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"Integrating","offset":1605},{"uri":"Evaluation","surface_form":"evaluation","offset":1642},{"uri":"Calorimetry","surface_form":"calorimetry","offset":1793},{"uri":"Calorimeter","surface_form":"calorimeter","offset":1872},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"Chemist","offset":1972},{"uri":"Thermometer","surface_form":"thermometer","offset":2082},{"uri":"Thermocouple","surface_form":"thermocouple","offset":2097},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":2115},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":2259},{"uri":"Differential_scanning_calorimeter","surface_form":"differential scanning calorimeter","offset":2353},{"uri":"State_of_matter","surface_form":"state","offset":2544},{"uri":"Isothermal_process","surface_form":"isothermal","offset":2554},{"uri":"Isobaric_process","surface_form":"isobaric","offset":2654},{"uri":"Adiabatic_process","surface_form":"adiabatic","offset":2746}]}
