{"id":305489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Doolittle_Walcott","text":"Charles Doolittle Walcott (March 31, 1850 \u2013 February 9, 1927) was an American geologist and invertebrate paleontologist. He became known for his discovery in 1909 of well-preserved fossils in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada.\nWalcott became Director of the U.S. Geological Survey 1894\u20131907, and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1907\u20131927. He discovered a number of important fossil sites. At the Walcott Quarry, the lowest (earliest) of the Burgess Shale deposits, Walcott collected 65,000 specimens between 1910 and 1924. The site dates to the Middle Cambrian, and is in the Canadian Rockies.\nThe Walcott-Rust quarry is near Russia, New York. This site has produced some of the best preserved trilobites ever found, including enrolled specimens with soft body parts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":69},{"uri":"Geologist","surface_form":"geologist","offset":78},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":92},{"uri":"Paleontologist","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":105},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":181},{"uri":"Burgess_Shale","surface_form":"Burgess Shale","offset":196},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":213},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":231},{"uri":"U.S._Geological_Survey","surface_form":"U.S. Geological Survey","offset":270},{"uri":"Smithsonian_Institution","surface_form":"Smithsonian Institution","offset":325},{"uri":"Cambrian","surface_form":"Cambrian","offset":574},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":598},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rockies","offset":607},{"uri":"Russia%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Russia, New York","offset":648},{"uri":"Trilobite","surface_form":"trilobite","offset":716}]}
