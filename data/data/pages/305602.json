{"id":305602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil","text":"Transitional fossils (or missing links) are the fossilised remains of lifeforms that show features typical of two distinct groups. It may be a rare fossil, such as \"Archaeopteryx\", which shows early features of a group which later becomes widespread.\nThe rarity of transitional forms is interesting. It suggests the new forms are not yet dominant in the ecology of their time, and their populations are relatively small. It follows that their fossils would be scarce. In the Solnhofen limestone where \"Archaeopteryx\" was found, there are more examples of pterosaurs of several genera than there are of the proto-bird. In the Jurassic, the pterosaurs were dominant in the air.\nBut in the Lower Cretaceous the situation is reversed. The pterosaurs are in decline, and large numbers of different bird species are found in the famous Chinese lagerstatten deposits such as the Jehol biota. The Lower Cretaceous birds are clearly more bird-like, and the features they developed enabled them to invade habitat niches which had been the preserve of pterosaurs, or maybe were not previously exploited at all.\nMosaic evolution.\nTypical of transitional fossils is that some features are clearly basal or primitive. Other features are advanced ('derived'). With \"Archaeopteryx\", the front legs are derived, and show clearly the capacity for flight. Also, the feathers had the rachus (stem) off-centre, a feature of all bird flight feathers. The rest of the skeleton was just like any other small carnivorous dinosaur.p35\nWhen transition takes place between one group and another, not all features change at the same time. This is called mosaic evolution.408 Transitions between higher groups would involve a series of transitional species, only a few of which may be found as fossils.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":48},{"uri":"Archaeopteryx","surface_form":"Archaeopteryx","offset":165},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":354},{"uri":"Solnhofen_limestone","surface_form":"Solnhofen limestone","offset":475},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":555},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":577},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":625},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":687},{"uri":"Lagerstatte","surface_form":"lagerstatte","offset":838},{"uri":"Jehol_biota","surface_form":"Jehol biota","offset":872},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":995},{"uri":"Niche","surface_form":"niche","offset":1003},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":1184},{"uri":"Derived","surface_form":"derived","offset":1234},{"uri":"Mosaic_evolution","surface_form":"mosaic evolution","offset":1625}]}
