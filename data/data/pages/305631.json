However, it was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer 293 seconds after launch. It was destroyed because the rocket moved off course and was a safety risk. Mariner 1 was followed by Mariner 2.\nWhy it was destroyed.\nBecause the smoothing function was missing, the rocket became sensitive at minor changes. Then, the rocket became out of control and destroyed by the Range Safety Officer. Few years later, Arthur C. Clarke wrote that Mariner 1 was \"wrecked by the most expensive hyphen in history\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":16},{"uri":"Mariner_program","surface_form":"Mariner program","offset":68},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus","offset":115},{"uri":"Range_Safety_Officer","surface_form":"Range Safety Officer","offset":162},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":187},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":238},{"uri":"Safety","surface_form":"safety","offset":272},{"uri":"Mariner_2","surface_form":"Mariner 2","offset":311},{"uri":"Sensitive","surface_form":"sensitive","offset":406},{"uri":"Range_Safety_Officer","surface_form":"Range Safety Officer","offset":494},{"uri":"Arthur_C._Clarke","surface_form":"Arthur C.
