{"id":305717,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsonella_ruddii","text":"\"Candidatus\" Carsonella ruddii is an endosymbiotic gamma proteobacterium. It has the smallest known genome of any bacterium.\nThe species is an endosymbiont that is present in all species of phloem sap-feeding insects known as psyllids. The endosymbionts occurs in a specialised structure known as the bacteriome.\nIn 2006 the genome of one strain of \"Ca.\" C. ruddi was sequenced at RIKEN in Japan and the University of Arizona. The genome is a circular chromosome of 159,662 base pairs and has a high coding density (97%) with many overlapping genes and reduced gene length. The number of predicted genes was 182, also the lowest on record ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=genome&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=20002 NCBI-Genome]). Numerous genes considered essential for life seem to be missing, suggesting that the species may have achieved organelle-like status.\nIn comparison, \"Mycoplasma genitalium\", which has the smallest genome of any free-living organism, has a genome of 521 genes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Candidatus","surface_form":"Candidatus","offset":1},{"uri":"Endosymbiosis","surface_form":"endosymbiotic","offset":37},{"uri":"Gammaproteobacteria","surface_form":"gamma proteobacterium","offset":51},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":100},{"uri":"Endosymbiont","surface_form":"endosymbiont","offset":143},{"uri":"Phloem","surface_form":"phloem","offset":190},{"uri":"Psyllid","surface_form":"psyllid","offset":226},{"uri":"Bacteriome","surface_form":"bacteriome","offset":301},{"uri":"RIKEN","surface_form":"RIKEN","offset":381},{"uri":"University_of_Arizona","surface_form":"University of Arizona","offset":404},{"uri":"Base_pair","surface_form":"base pair","offset":474},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":598},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":857},{"uri":"Mycoplasma_genitalium","surface_form":"Mycoplasma genitalium","offset":896}]}
