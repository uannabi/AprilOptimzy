It is renowned first Belgian Aviation School and then Sabena Air Training Center. The same year, it was decided to carry out practical training in flight to Phoenix in U.S.A because the weather in Arizona allows flights 365 days per year in a high and complex air traffic. Following that decisions, the school is created as a subsidiary of Sabena Flight Academy and under the name of Sabena Airline Training Center.\nIn 2008, following the absorption of the Belgian school by CAE, the US subsidiary is also purchased. The school becomes part of the CAE Global Academy network and is renamed CAE Global Academy Phoenix.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flight","surface_form":"flight","offset":82},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":105},{"uri":"Mesa%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Mesa, Arizona","offset":124},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":139},{"uri":"Sabena","surface_form":"Sabena airline","offset":469},{"uri":"Phoenix%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Phoenix","offset":642},{"uri":"U.S.A","surface_form":"U.S.A","offset":653},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":682},{"uri":"Sabena_Flight_Academy","surface_form":"Sabena Flight Academy","offset":825},{"uri":"Sabena_Flight_Academy","surface_form":"Belgian school","offset":942}]}
