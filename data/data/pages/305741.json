These students are considered to possess more advanced knowledge of the field that they study, as compared to those who only get a Master's degree.\nThe course takes one year to complete, including at least four months of practical internship.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Mast\u00E8re Sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9 starts in 1986. During the end of the 1980s, the \"Commission des titres d'ing\u00E9nieur\" required that a student spend two years in a school to graduate with the French Master's degree. But a lot of foreign students sometimes came one entirely year in the French schools and came back to their own country without a degree. Also, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System was not yet adopted by all the schools.\nOtherwise, companies in France was looking for graduated students with specialized skills, for jobs in key sectors.\nFor these two reasons, the French \"Conf\u00E9rence des Grandes \u00C9coles\" has created the Mast\u00E8re Sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":96},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"degree","offset":103},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"Master's degree","offset":166},{"uri":"Grande_%C3%89cole","surface_form":"Grande \u00C9cole","offset":216},{"uri":"Commission_des_titres_d%27ing%C3%A9nieur","surface_form":"Commission des titres d'ing\u00E9nieur","offset":593},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"Master's degree","offset":708},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"degree","offset":855},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":986},{"uri":"Conf%C3%A9rence_des_Grandes_%C3%89coles","surface_form":"Conf\u00E9rence des Grandes \u00C9coles","offset":1113}]}
