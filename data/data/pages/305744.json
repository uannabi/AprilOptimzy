In fact, experiencing a significant increase of their numbers, they begin to open new locations to alleviate their main campuses. Thus, an antenna of the Pierre and Marie Curie University is created in Versailles in 1987. Dedicated to Sciences, it joined in the Yvelines the law annex of Nanterre established two years earlier at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\nIn the mean time, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research program as part of French higher education modernization plan called \"Universit\u00E9 2000\" the creation of new universities.\nThe Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University is officially created the 22th of July 1991 from these two centers of delocalized of the Pierre and Marie Curie University and Paris West University Nanterre La D\u00E9fense.\n1991 - 2002.\nAt the end of 1996, the university changes its special status to join the regime of the law of 1984, as well as other French universities.
