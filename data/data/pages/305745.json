{"id":305745,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthbert","text":"e=\"preserve\">Saint Cuthbert (c. 634 \u2013 20 March 687) was an Anglo-Saxon monk, bishop and hermit associated with the monasteries of Melrose and Lindisfarne in the Kingdom of Northumbria, at that time including, in modern terms, northern England as well as south-eastern Scotland as far north as the Firth of Forth. Afterwards he became one of the most important medieval saints of England, his cult being centred at Durham Cathedral. Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of northern England. His feast day is 20 March.\nBiography.\nIn 676 he began the life of a hermit and retired to a cave on Lindisfarne. After a time he settled on one of the Farne Islands, south of Lindisfarne, and made his life more simple.\nIn 684, Cuthbert was chosen to be bishop of Lindisfarne, at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day Alnmouth), but was unwilling to leave his retirement and take up his charge. It was only after a visit from a large group, including King Ecgfrith, that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop. He was consecrated at York on 26 March 685. After Christmas, 686, however, he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, which was where he eventually died on 20 March 687 AD. He was buried at Lindisfarne, and his remains later moved to Durham Cathedral.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":59},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":71},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":77},{"uri":"Hermit","surface_form":"hermit","offset":88},{"uri":"Northumbria","surface_form":"Northumbria","offset":172},{"uri":"Firth_of_Forth","surface_form":"Firth of Forth","offset":297},{"uri":"Durham_Cathedral","surface_form":"Durham Cathedral","offset":414},{"uri":"Patron_saint","surface_form":"patron saint","offset":460},{"uri":"Northern_England","surface_form":"northern England","offset":476},{"uri":"Retire","surface_form":"retired","offset":573},{"uri":"Lindisfarne","surface_form":"Lindisfarne","offset":594},{"uri":"Alnmouth","surface_form":"Alnmouth","offset":820},{"uri":"Consecration","surface_form":"consecrated","offset":1034},{"uri":"York","surface_form":"York","offset":1049},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":1077}]}
