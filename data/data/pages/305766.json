{"id":305766,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox","text":"=\"preserve\">The black hole information paradox is a phenomenon in astrophysics. It is when quantum mechanics and general relativity are put together.\nThis phenomenon states that the information a physical system has can be lost when it enters a black hole. The object that falls into a black hole, only keeps information about its spin, mass and charge. However, the quantum mechanics says that information cannot be lost. This makes it a paradox.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":52},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysics","offset":66},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":91},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":113},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":182},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":245},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":331},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":337},{"uri":"Charge","surface_form":"charge","offset":346},{"uri":"Paradox","surface_form":"paradox","offset":439}]}
