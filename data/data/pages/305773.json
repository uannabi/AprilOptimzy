{"id":305773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Pacific_hurricane_season","text":"The 1988 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1988 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1988 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1988. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nDespite there being twenty-three tropical cyclones, there were very few notable storms this year. Only four storms came anywhere near to threatening land. Tropical Storm Aletta and Hurricane Kristy both caused minor flooding in Mexico. Elsewhere, Uleki was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the dateline and became a typhoon. In addition, Tropical Depression Seventeen-E and Tropical Storm Miriam both entered from the Atlantic Ocean, were they were called Hurricane Debby and Hurricane Joan, respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":53},{"uri":"1988","surface_form":"1988","offset":61},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":94},{"uri":"1988","surface_form":"1988","offset":102},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":148},{"uri":"1988","surface_form":"1988","offset":161},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":279},{"uri":"Hurricane_Joan-Miriam","surface_form":"Hurricane Joan","offset":784}]}
