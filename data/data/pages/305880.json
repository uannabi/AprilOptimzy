{"id":305880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93hydrogen_bond_activation","text":"Carbon\u2013hydrogen bond activation or C-H activation is a reaction that breaks a carbon\u2013hydrogen bond. Most times, the reaction involves organometallic complexes. The reaction path has coordination of a hydrocarbon to the inner-sphere of the metal atom (\u201CM\u201D). The reaction path includes either an intermediate \u201Calkane or arene complex\u201D or as a transition state leading to a \"M-C\" intermediate. The reaction path makes C-H activation different from other reactions. During the C-H breaking event the hydrocarbyl group remains linked in the inner-sphere and under the influence of the metal atom.\nChemists study C-H activation because for many years chemists believed that C-H bonds were unreactive. Both theoretical studies as well as experiments now show that C-H bonds can be broken. This is done by a nearby metal atom changing the electron distribution of the C-H bond (coordination). Much chemical research looks at the design and synthesis of new reagents and catalysts that can affect C-H activation. The goal of this research is the conversion of cheap and abundant alkanes into valuable functionalized organic compounds.\nHistorians say that Otto Dimroth discovered the first C-H activation reaction. In 1902, he reported that benzene reacted with mercury(II) acetate (See: organomercury), but some scholars do not view this reaction as being a C-H activation. Goldman & Goldberg later wrote, C-H activation looks like H-H activation: both can be achieved by electrophilic or oxidative addition. The first true C-H activation reaction was reported by Joseph Chatt in 1965 with insertion of a ruthenium atom ligated to dmpe in the C-H bond of naphthalene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":55},{"uri":"Carbon%E2%80%93hydrogen_bond","surface_form":"carbon\u2013hydrogen bond","offset":78},{"uri":"Involve","surface_form":"involves","offset":125},{"uri":"Organometallic_chemistry","surface_form":"organometallic","offset":134},{"uri":"Complex","surface_form":"complex","offset":149},{"uri":"Reaction_path","surface_form":"reaction path","offset":164},{"uri":"Coordination_chemistry","surface_form":"coordination","offset":182},{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":200},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":239},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":245},{"uri":"Arene_compound","surface_form":"arene","offset":318},{"uri":"Transition_state","surface_form":"transition state","offset":341},{"uri":"Intermediate","surface_form":"intermediate","offset":377},{"uri":"Activation","surface_form":"activation","offset":419},{"uri":"Hydrocarbyl","surface_form":"hydrocarbyl","offset":496},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":563},{"uri":"Bonds","surface_form":"bonds","offset":672},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"unreactive","offset":683},{"uri":"Theoretical","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":700},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":731},{"uri":"Chemical_synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":932},{"uri":"Reagent","surface_form":"reagent","offset":949},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":962},{"uri":"Abundant","surface_form":"abundant","offset":1061},{"uri":"Alkane","surface_form":"alkane","offset":1070},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"functionalized","offset":1092},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"Historian","offset":1126},{"uri":"Otto_Dimroth","surface_form":"Otto Dimroth","offset":1146},{"uri":"Benzene","surface_form":"benzene","offset":1231},{"uri":"Mercury(II)_acetate","surface_form":"mercury(II) acetate","offset":1252},{"uri":"Organomercury","surface_form":"organomercury","offset":1278},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":1303},{"uri":"Eletrophilic_addition","surface_form":"electrophilic","offset":1463},{"uri":"Oxidative_addition","surface_form":"oxidative addition","offset":1480},{"uri":"Joseph_Chatt","surface_form":"Joseph Chatt","offset":1555},{"uri":"Ruthenium","surface_form":"ruthenium","offset":1596},{"uri":"Ligand","surface_form":"ligated","offset":1611},{"uri":"1%2C2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane","surface_form":"dmpe","offset":1622},{"uri":"Naphthalene","surface_form":"naphthalene","offset":1646}]}
