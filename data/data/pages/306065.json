{"id":306065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization","text":"Physical urbanization has been observed for centuries. In developing countries this is the main form of urbanization. In developed countries, functional urbanization is the main form of urbanization. With functional urbanization, people living in the city center move to the countryside, next to the city; this is known as suburbanization.\nEnvironmental effects.\nEnvironmental scientists are studying the urban heat island. The urban heat island is made when industrial and urban areas are developed and heat becomes plentiful.\nEnvironmental impacts also include reducing soil moisture and intensification of carbon dioxide emissions.\nStewart Brand's book \"Whole Earth Discipline\" argues that urbanization helps the environment overall. First, the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate, and keeps falling. This can prevent overpopulation in the future. Secondly, it puts a stop to destructive subsistence farming methods, like slash and burn agriculture. Finally, it reduces land use by humans, leaving more for nature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Developing_countries","surface_form":"developing countries","offset":58},{"uri":"Suburbanization","surface_form":"suburbanization","offset":323},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":377},{"uri":"Urban_heat_island","surface_form":"urban heat island","offset":405},{"uri":"Stewart_Brand","surface_form":"Stewart Brand","offset":635},{"uri":"Whole_Earth_Discipline","surface_form":"Whole Earth Discipline","offset":657},{"uri":"Overpopulation","surface_form":"overpopulation","offset":856},{"uri":"Subsistence_farming","surface_form":"subsistence farming","offset":926},{"uri":"Slash_and_burn","surface_form":"slash and burn","offset":960}]}
