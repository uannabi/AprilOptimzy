{"id":306073,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Little_Pill","text":"\"Jagged Little Pill\" is the third studio album and the first to be released internationally by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. The album saw Morissette changing her style and genre. Morissette's sound in the album was rock, but her previous songs were dance pop. The title is a metaphor for lessons of life that are hard to accept. The album was Morissette's breakthrough album, and contained six hits, \"You Oughta Know\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Head over Feet\", and \"All I Really Want\". The album spent twelve weeks at number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. By 2009, the album had sold 33 million units worldwide. It was ranked by the \"Billboard\" 200 as the number one selling album of the 1990s.\nDuring the three consecutive years in the late 1990s of Grammy Awards, Morissette received five wins out of nine nominations from the album. In 1996, she won the Album of the Year & Best Rock Album. Her 1997 nominations such as \"Ironic\" for Record of the Year & Best Music Video in Short Form did not win her an award. But in 1998, she won again for Best Music Video in Long Form from her release of \"Jagged Little Pill, Live\". In October 2002, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 31 on its \"Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums\" list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album also holds a title in \"The Definitive 200 Albums\" list, in which it is placed at number 26.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":34},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":95},{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":104},{"uri":"Alanis_Morissette","surface_form":"Alanis Morissette","offset":122},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":292},{"uri":"Breakthrough_album","surface_form":"breakthrough album","offset":373},{"uri":"You_Oughta_Know","surface_form":"You Oughta Know","offset":418},{"uri":"Ironic_(song)","surface_form":"Ironic","offset":437},{"uri":"You_Learn","surface_form":"You Learn","offset":447},{"uri":"Hand_in_My_Pocket","surface_form":"Hand in My Pocket","offset":460},{"uri":"Head_over_Feet","surface_form":"Head over Feet","offset":481},{"uri":"All_I_Really_Want","surface_form":"All I Really Want","offset":503},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":573},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":578},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":685},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":803},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year","surface_form":"Album of the Year","offset":909},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rock_Album","surface_form":"Best Rock Album","offset":929},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year","surface_form":"Record of the Year","offset":988},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video","surface_form":"Best Music Video in Short Form","offset":1009},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Best_Long_Form_Music_Video","surface_form":"Best Music Video in Long Form","offset":1097},{"uri":"Rolling_Stone","surface_form":"Rolling Stone","offset":1193},{"uri":"The_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time","surface_form":"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time","offset":1345}]}
