{"id":306169,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontoceti","text":"The Odontoceti is a suborder of the cetaceans. They are the toothed whales.\nThe Odontoceti includes all the whales which eat prey larger than plankton. Examples are: sperm whales, beaked whales, dolphins, and others. As the name suggests, the suborder has teeth rather than the baleen of Mysticeti whales. This means they are predators of small to large sized prey.\nThe Sperm Whale \"Physeter\", the Killer Whale \"Orca\" and the Pilot Whale \"Globicephala\" all take large prey. By means of co-operation, Killer Whales can take prey larger than themselves, up to and including Blue Whale calves. Sperm Whales are specialist feeders on giant squid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suborder","surface_form":"suborder","offset":20},{"uri":"Cetacean","surface_form":"cetacean","offset":36},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":142},{"uri":"Sperm_whale","surface_form":"sperm whale","offset":166},{"uri":"Beaked_whale","surface_form":"beaked whale","offset":180},{"uri":"Dolphin","surface_form":"dolphin","offset":195},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":256},{"uri":"Baleen","surface_form":"baleen","offset":278},{"uri":"Mysticeti","surface_form":"Mysticeti","offset":288},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":326},{"uri":"Sperm_Whale","surface_form":"Sperm Whale","offset":370},{"uri":"Killer_Whale","surface_form":"Killer Whale","offset":398},{"uri":"Pilot_Whale","surface_form":"Pilot Whale","offset":426},{"uri":"Blue_Whale","surface_form":"Blue Whale","offset":572},{"uri":"Giant_squid","surface_form":"giant squid","offset":630}]}
