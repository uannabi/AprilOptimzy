{"id":306359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rearrangement_reaction","text":"Intermolecular rearrangements also take place.\nIn pericyclic reactions, the orbital interactions are important. The reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers. But, the curved arrows showing a sequence of discrete electron transfers can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction. Yet, the diagrams are not necessarily realistic. In allylic rearrangement, the reaction is ionic.\nThree important rearrangement reactions are 1,2-rearrangements, pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis.\nPericyclic reactions.\nA pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon-carbon bond making and breaking. The transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry. The reaction progresses in a concerted fashion. Examples are hydride shifts\nOlefin metathesis.\nOlefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes. It is a catalytic reaction with carbene. It has transition metal carbene complex intermediates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Intermolecular","surface_form":"Intermolecular","offset":0},{"uri":"Pericyclic_reaction","surface_form":"pericyclic reaction","offset":50},{"uri":"Molecular_orbital","surface_form":"orbital","offset":76},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrow","offset":214},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":231},{"uri":"Electron_transfer","surface_form":"electron transfer","offset":252},{"uri":"Realistic","surface_form":"realistic","offset":363},{"uri":"Allylic_rearrangement","surface_form":"allylic rearrangement","offset":377},{"uri":"Ionic","surface_form":"ionic","offset":416},{"uri":"1%2C2-rearrangement","surface_form":"1,2-rearrangement","offset":467},{"uri":"Pericyclic_reaction","surface_form":"pericyclic reaction","offset":487},{"uri":"Olefin_metathesis","surface_form":"olefin metathesis","offset":512},{"uri":"Transition_state","surface_form":"transition state","offset":655},{"uri":"Hydride_shift","surface_form":"hydride shift","offset":772},{"uri":"Olefin","surface_form":"Olefin","offset":806},{"uri":"Alkylidene","surface_form":"alkylidene","offset":852},{"uri":"Fragment","surface_form":"fragment","offset":863},{"uri":"Alkene","surface_form":"alkene","offset":880},{"uri":"Carbene","surface_form":"carbene","offset":921},{"uri":"Transition_metal_carbene_complex","surface_form":"transition metal carbene complex","offset":937}]}
