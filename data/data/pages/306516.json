{"id":306516,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(chemistry)","text":"In chemistry, yield (also called chemical yield or reaction yield) is the amount of product resulting from a chemical reaction. The \"absolute yield\" gives the weight in grams, and the \"molar yield\" gives the number of moles.\nformula_1\nTo get the \"percentage yield\", one must multiply the fractional yield by 100% (e.g., 0.673 \u00D7 100% = 67.3%).\nThe ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100%, but it cannot be achieved because measurements are never completely accurate. Yields around 100% are \"quantitative\", yields above 90% are \"excellent\", yields above 80% are \"very good\", yields above 70% are \"good\", yields above 50% are \"fair\", and yields below 40% are \"poor\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":3},{"uri":"Product_(chemistry)","surface_form":"product","offset":84},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":109},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":159},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":169},{"uri":"Mole_(unit)","surface_form":"moles","offset":218},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiply","offset":275},{"uri":"Ideal","surface_form":"ideal","offset":347},{"uri":"Achieve","surface_form":"achieve","offset":419}]}
