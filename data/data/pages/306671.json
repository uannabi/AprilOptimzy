{"id":306671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fobos-Grunt","text":"Fobos-Grunt (also spelled Phobos-Grunt, also called Phobos Sample Return Mission) was an unmanned Russian spacecraft. It was an attempted sample return mission to Phobos, a moon of the planet Mars. Scientists intended Phobos-Grunt to orbit and study Mars. It was meant to look at Mars' atmosphere and dust storms, plasma and radiation. Then, Phobos-Grunt should have landed on Phobos and returned a 200 g soil sample to Earth.\nThe spacecraft was the first Russian interplanetary mission since Mars 96. It was launched on 8 November 2011 (UTC), aboard a Zenit rocket, at Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was sent with the Chinese spacecraft Yinghuo-1 and with the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment.\nThe name \"Phobos-Grunt\" () is Russian for \"Phobos-Soil\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":98},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":106},{"uri":"Phobos_(moon)","surface_form":"Phobos","offset":163},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":173},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":185},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":192},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":286},{"uri":"Dust_storm","surface_form":"dust storm","offset":301},{"uri":"Plasma_(physics)","surface_form":"plasma","offset":314},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":325},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":405},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":420},{"uri":"Mars_96","surface_form":"Mars 96","offset":493},{"uri":"Zenit_(rocket)","surface_form":"Zenit rocket","offset":553},{"uri":"Baikonur_Cosmodrome","surface_form":"Baikonur Cosmodrome","offset":570},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":612},{"uri":"Yinghuo-1","surface_form":"Yinghuo-1","offset":631},{"uri":"Living_Interplanetary_Flight_Experiment","surface_form":"Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment","offset":654}]}
