He served over 50 years on the board of the Institute. He and his wife, Josephine Hancock Logan, administered the award consistent with their support of the Society for Sanity in Art. They founded that Society in 1936. Josephine Logan also wrote a book in 1937 called \"Sanity in Art\". The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art, including cubism, surrealism, and abstract expressionism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prize","surface_form":"prize","offset":40},{"uri":"Art_Institute_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Art Institute of Chicago","offset":63},{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"Medal","offset":166},{"uri":"Frank_Granger_Logan","surface_form":"Frank Granger Logan","offset":198},{"uri":"Society_for_Sanity_in_Art","surface_form":"Society for Sanity in Art","offset":428},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"cubism","offset":619},{"uri":"Surrealism","surface_form":"surrealism","offset":627},{"uri":"Abstract_expressionism","surface_form":"abstract expressionism","offset":643}]}
