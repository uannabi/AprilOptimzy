These men signed the Declaration of Independence, helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term was first applied to these people in 1916.\nThere were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison.\nMost of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. The majority owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":81},{"uri":"United_States_Declaration_of_Independence","surface_form":"Declaration of Independence","offset":134},{"uri":"Constitution_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Constitution of the United States","offset":180},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":233},{"uri":"Continental_Congress","surface_form":"Continental Congress","offset":299},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":504},{"uri":"John_Adams","surface_form":"John Adams","offset":523},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":535},{"uri":"Benjamin_Franklin","surface_form":"Benjamin Franklin","offset":553},{"uri":"Alexander_Hamilton","surface_form":"Alexander Hamilton","offset":572},{"uri":"John_Jay","surface_form":"John Jay","offset":592},{"uri":"James_Madison","surface_form":"James Madison","offset":606}]}
