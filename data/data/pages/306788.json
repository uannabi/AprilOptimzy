{"id":306788,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNDO/2","text":"CNDO builds a mathematical model of a molecule. CNDO starts with the position of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electron clouds surrounding them. Quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbitals. From this information, CNDO computes data about the resulting molecular orbitals.\nCNDO/2 is the main version of CNDO. John Pople and coworkers first wrote CNDO/2.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical_model","surface_form":"mathematical model","offset":14},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":38},{"uri":"Positive","surface_form":"positive","offset":85},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nuclei","offset":104},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":118},{"uri":"Negative","surface_form":"negative","offset":132},{"uri":"Electron_cloud","surface_form":"electron cloud","offset":151},{"uri":"Probability_distribution","surface_form":"probability distribution","offset":223},{"uri":"Atomic_orbital","surface_form":"atomic orbital","offset":279},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":306},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":333},{"uri":"Molecular_orbital","surface_form":"molecular orbital","offset":358},{"uri":"John_Pople","surface_form":"John Pople","offset":414}]}
