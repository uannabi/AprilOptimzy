He lives there with his wife named Indrani, and several other smaller gods. There are many apsaras in amravati.\nIndra was a very important God during the Vedic period. Later his importance became less. Gods like Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva became more important in Hinduism.\nIndra in current form of mythology is similar to that of Zeus in Greek mythology.
