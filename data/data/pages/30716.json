{"id":30716,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badrinath","text":"e=\"preserve\">Badrinatha is an important pilgrimage place for the Hindus. The place is in Uttarakhand state of India, and is located at a high altitude in the Himalayas. The Hindu scriptures say that the place is sacred to Vishnu, one of the gods of Hindus.\nBadrinath gets its name from a tree's name. The name of that tree is \"badri-tree\" or Indian Jujube tree. The botanical name of a badri-tree is \"Zizyphus jujba Lam\".\nThe modern Badrinath temple was established by Adi Shankaracharya in the ninth century after the old temple fell to ruin. The Badrinath area is referred to as Badarikaashram (\u092C\u0926\u0930\u093F\u0915\u093E\u0936\u094D\u0930\u092E) in Hindu scriptures.\nThe temple was renovated many times because of age or damage by avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was renovated by the kings of Garhwal. After the great 1803 Himalayan earthquake, it was rebuilt by the King of Jaipur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pilgrimage","surface_form":"pilgrimage","offset":40},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hindus","offset":65},{"uri":"Uttarakhand","surface_form":"Uttarakhand","offset":89},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":110},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":142},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":158},{"uri":"Hindu_scripture","surface_form":"Hindu scripture","offset":173},{"uri":"Vishnu","surface_form":"Vishnu","offset":222},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":241},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":288},{"uri":"Jujube","surface_form":"Jujube","offset":349},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botanical","offset":366}]}
