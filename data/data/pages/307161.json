{"id":307161,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiknock_agent","text":"=\"preserve\">An antiknock agent is added to gasoline. It reduces engine knocking and increase the fuel's octane rating.\nGasoline is a fuel mixture. High compression internal combustion engines place gasoline under great pressure. The pressure can cause the gasoline to ignite early (\"pre-ignition\" or \"detonation\") causing a damaging knocking sound, also called \"pinging\" or \"pinking\".\nOriginally, organic compounds with lead were added to petrol to prevent knocking: \"tetraethyllead\" (TEL). This is now banned because the lead affects people's health. Various alternatives have been tried. 2,2,4-\"trimethylpentane\", an isomer of octane, is one example.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"gasoline","offset":43},{"uri":"Engine_knocking","surface_form":"engine knocking","offset":64},{"uri":"Octane_rating","surface_form":"octane rating","offset":104},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"Gasoline","offset":119},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":133},{"uri":"Mixture","surface_form":"mixture","offset":138},{"uri":"Compression_(physical)","surface_form":"compression","offset":152},{"uri":"Internal_combustion_engine","surface_form":"internal combustion engine","offset":164},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":219},{"uri":"Combustion","surface_form":"ignite","offset":268},{"uri":"Organic_compounds","surface_form":"organic compounds","offset":397},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":420},{"uri":"Isomer","surface_form":"isomer","offset":619},{"uri":"Octane","surface_form":"octane","offset":629}]}
