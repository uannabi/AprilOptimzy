{"id":307243,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Andrew_Olah","text":"George Andrew Olah (May 22, 1927 \u2013 March 8, 2017) was an Hungarian-born American chemist. His research involves the generation and reactivity of carbocations using superacids. For this research, Olah was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994. The American Chemical Society gave him its highest honor, the Priestley Medal.\nLife.\nOlah was born in Budapest, Hungary, on May 22, 1927. He studied high school at Budapesti Piarista Gimnazium (Scolopi fathers). He studied, then taught, at what is now Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he and his family moved briefly to England, They then moved to Canada. He joined Dow Chemical in Sarnia, Ontario, with another Hungarian chemist, Stephen J. Kuhn. During Olah's eight years with Dow, he started to study carbocations. In 1965, he left Dow for Case Western Reserve University. He joined the University of Southern California faculty in 1977. In 1971, Olah became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\nOlah was a distinguished professor at the University of Southern California and the director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute. In 2005, Olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy.\nThe Olah family formed an endowment fund (the George A. Olah Endowment). It grants annual awards to outstanding chemists. The American Chemical Society selects and administers the awards.\nOlah died on March 8, 2017 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, aged 89.\nWork.\nThe search for stable carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane. (Protonated methane is a methane molecule (CH4) with an extra proton giving it a positive charge.) Protonated methane was stabilized by superacids, like FSO3H-SbF5 (\"Magic Acid\").\nOlah also studied how hydrocarbons are used as fuel.\nOlah also disagreed for many years with Herbert C. Brown of Purdue University over the existence of so-called \"nonclassical\" carbocations \u2013 such as the norbornyl cation. They can be shown as cationic character shared (delocalized) over several bonds.\nIn recent years, his research has shifted from hydrocarbons (including hydrocarbon fuel) to the methanol economy. He joined Robert Zubrin, Anne Korin, and James Woolsey in calling for a Flexible-fuel vehicle mandate initiative.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":81},{"uri":"Carbocation","surface_form":"carbocation","offset":145},{"uri":"Superacid","surface_form":"superacid","offset":164},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":214},{"uri":"American_Chemical_Society","surface_form":"American Chemical Society","offset":252},{"uri":"Priestley_Medal","surface_form":"Priestley Medal","offset":310},{"uri":"Piarists","surface_form":"Scolopi fathers","offset":442},{"uri":"Budapest_University_of_Technology_and_Economics","surface_form":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","offset":500},{"uri":"1956_Hungarian_Revolution","surface_form":"1956 Hungarian Revolution","offset":563},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":625},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":653},{"uri":"Dow_Chemical","surface_form":"Dow Chemical","offset":671},{"uri":"Sarnia","surface_form":"Sarnia","offset":687},{"uri":"Case_Western_Reserve_University","surface_form":"Case Western Reserve University","offset":848},{"uri":"University_of_Southern_California","surface_form":"University of Southern California","offset":895},{"uri":"Naturalized_citizen","surface_form":"naturalized citizen","offset":969},{"uri":"University_of_Southern_California","surface_form":"University of Southern California","offset":1053},{"uri":"Loker_Hydrocarbon_Research_Institute","surface_form":"Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute","offset":1111},{"uri":"Methanol_economy","surface_form":"methanol economy","offset":1192},{"uri":"Financial_endowment","surface_form":"endowment fund","offset":1236},{"uri":"American_Chemical_Society","surface_form":"American Chemical Society","offset":1336},{"uri":"Beverly_Hills%2C_California","surface_form":"Beverly Hills","offset":1440},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1455},{"uri":"Carbocation","surface_form":"carbocation","offset":1504},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":1541},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":1552},{"uri":"Positive","surface_form":"positive","offset":1642},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"charge","offset":1651},{"uri":"Stability","surface_form":"stabilized","offset":1683},{"uri":"Superacid","surface_form":"superacid","offset":1697},{"uri":"Magic_acid","surface_form":"Magic Acid","offset":1727},{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":1763},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":1788},{"uri":"Herbert_C._Brown","surface_form":"Herbert C.
