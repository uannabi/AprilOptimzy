{"id":307247,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors","text":"Linear algebra talks about types of functions called \"transformations\". In that context, an eigenvector is a vector\u2014different from the null vector\u2014which does not change direction after the transformation (except if the transformation turns the vector to the opposite direction). The vector may change its length, or become zero (\"null\"). The eigenvalue is the value of the vector's change in length, and is typically denoted by the symbol formula_1. The word \"eigen\" is a German word, which means \"own\" or \"typical\".\nBasics.\nIn other words, if matrix \"A\" times the vector v is equal to the scalar \"\u03BB\" times the vector v, then \"\u03BB\" is the eigenvalue of v, where v is the eigenvector.\nAn eigenspace of \"A\" is the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue together with the zero vector. However, the zero vector is not an eigenvector.\nThese ideas often are extended to more general situations, where scalars are elements of any field, vectors are elements of any vector space, and linear transformations may or may not be represented by matrix multiplication. For example, instead of real numbers, scalars may be complex numbers; instead of arrows, vectors may be functions or frequencies; instead of matrix multiplication, linear transformations may be operators such as the derivative from calculus. These are only a few of countless examples where eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important.\nIn cases like these, the idea of \"direction\" loses its ordinary meaning, and has a more abstract definition instead. But even in this case, if that abstract \"direction\" is unchanged by a given linear transformation, the prefix \"eigen\" is used, as in \"eigenfunction\", \"eigenmode\", \"eigenface\", \"eigenstate\", and \"eigenfrequency\".\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors have many applications in both pure and applied mathematics. They are used in matrix factorization, quantum mechanics, facial recognition systems, and many other areas.\nExample.\nOn the other hand the vector\nand this vector is not a multiple of the original vector x.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"Linear algebra","offset":0},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":36},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":109},{"uri":"Null_vector","surface_form":"null vector","offset":135},{"uri":"Zero_vector","surface_form":"zero vector","offset":777},{"uri":"Field_(mathematics)","surface_form":"field","offset":931},{"uri":"Linear_transformations","surface_form":"linear transformations","offset":984},{"uri":"Real_numbers","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":1087},{"uri":"Complex_numbers","surface_form":"complex numbers","offset":1116},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":1167},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequencies","offset":1180},{"uri":"Operator_(mathematics)","surface_form":"operators","offset":1257},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"derivative","offset":1279},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":1295},{"uri":"Eigenfunction","surface_form":"eigenfunction","offset":1649},{"uri":"Eigenmode","surface_form":"eigenmode","offset":1666},{"uri":"Eigenface","surface_form":"eigenface","offset":1679},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"pure","offset":1787},{"uri":"Applied_mathematics","surface_form":"applied mathematics","offset":1796},{"uri":"Matrix_factorization","surface_form":"matrix factorization","offset":1834},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":1856},{"uri":"Facial_recognition_system","surface_form":"facial recognition system","offset":1875}]}
