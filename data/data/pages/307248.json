{"id":307248,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superacid","text":"A superacid is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100% pure sulfuric acid. According to the modern definition, a superacid has a chemical potential of the proton higher than that of pure sulfuric acid.\nChemists use strong acids to break down other molecules. Some molecules are so strong (held together with strong chemical bonds) that they resist attack by common acids. Supercids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids.\nCommercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H), also known as triflic acid, and fluorosulfonic acid (FSO3H). Both acids are about a thousand times stronger (that is, have more negative \"H\"0 values) than sulfuric acid. The strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components, a strong Lewis acid and a strong Br\u00F8nsted acid. The strongest known superacid is fluoroantimonic acid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":18},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":70},{"uri":"Chemical_potential","surface_form":"chemical potential","offset":139},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":165},{"uri":"Trifluoromethanesulfonic_acid","surface_form":"trifluoromethanesulfonic acid","offset":494},{"uri":"Fluorosulfonic_acid","surface_form":"fluorosulfonic acid","offset":567},{"uri":"Lewis_acid","surface_form":"Lewis acid","offset":790},{"uri":"Br%C3%B8nsted_acid","surface_form":"Br\u00F8nsted acid","offset":814},{"uri":"Fluoroantimonic_acid","surface_form":"fluoroantimonic acid","offset":862}]}
