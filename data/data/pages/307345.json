{"id":307345,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDO","text":"INDO stands for Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap. It is a semi-empirical quantum chemistry method that is a development of the complete neglect of differential overlap (CNDO/2) method developed by John Pople. Like CNDO/2 it uses zero-differential overlap for the two-electron integrals. Integrals for over orbitals centered on the same atom are included in the INDO method.\nThe method is now rarely used in its original form. But it is the basis for several other methods, such as MINDO, ZINDO and SINDO.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semi-empirical_quantum_chemistry_method","surface_form":"semi-empirical quantum chemistry method","offset":70},{"uri":"CNDO/2","surface_form":"complete neglect of differential overlap","offset":139},{"uri":"John_Pople","surface_form":"John Pople","offset":209},{"uri":"Zero-differential_overlap","surface_form":"zero-differential overlap","offset":241},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":279},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integral","offset":288},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":348},{"uri":"MINDO","surface_form":"MINDO","offset":493},{"uri":"ZINDO","surface_form":"ZINDO","offset":500},{"uri":"SINDO","surface_form":"SINDO","offset":510}]}
