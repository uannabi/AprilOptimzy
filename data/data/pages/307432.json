{"id":307432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillopoda","text":"Maxillopoda is a diverse class of crustaceans which includes the barnacles, copepods and a number of related animals.\nIt does not appear to be a monophyletic group, and no single character unites all the members.\nDescription.\nWith the exception of some barnacles, maxillopodans are mostly small, including the smallest known arthropod, \"Stygotantulus stocki\". They often have short bodies, with the abdomen reduced in size, and generally lacking any appendages\u00A0 This may have arisen through paedomorphosis.\nApart from barnacles, which use their legs for filter feeding, most maxillopodans feed with their maxillae. Their bodyplan has 5 head segments, 6 thoracic segments and 4 abdominal segments, followed by a telson (tailpiece).\nFossil record.\nThe fossil record of the group extends back into the Cambrian, with fossils of barnacles and tongue worms known from that period.\nClassification.\nSix subclasses are generally recognised, although many works have included the ostracods among the Maxillopoda. Of the six groups, only Mystacocarida are entirely free-living; all the members of the Tantulocarida, Pentastomida and Branchiura are parasitic, and many of the Copepoda and Thecostraca are parasites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":25},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":34},{"uri":"Barnacle","surface_form":"barnacle","offset":65},{"uri":"Copepod","surface_form":"copepod","offset":76},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":145},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":399},{"uri":"Appendage","surface_form":"appendage","offset":450},{"uri":"Paedomorphosis","surface_form":"paedomorphosis","offset":491},{"uri":"Filter_feeding","surface_form":"filter feeding","offset":554},{"uri":"Maxilla","surface_form":"maxilla","offset":605},{"uri":"Thorax","surface_form":"thoracic","offset":653},{"uri":"Telson","surface_form":"telson","offset":711},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":750},{"uri":"Cambrian","surface_form":"Cambrian","offset":799},{"uri":"Barnacle","surface_form":"barnacle","offset":825},{"uri":"Pentastomida","surface_form":"tongue worms","offset":839},{"uri":"Ostracod","surface_form":"ostracod","offset":971},{"uri":"Mystacocarida","surface_form":"Mystacocarida","offset":1028},{"uri":"Tantulocarida","surface_form":"Tantulocarida","offset":1091},{"uri":"Pentastomida","surface_form":"Pentastomida","offset":1106},{"uri":"Branchiura","surface_form":"Branchiura","offset":1123},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":1138},{"uri":"Copepod","surface_form":"Copepod","offset":1165},{"uri":"Thecostraca","surface_form":"Thecostraca","offset":1178}]}
