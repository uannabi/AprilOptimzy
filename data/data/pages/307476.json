It was for Selena's fifth album \"Dreaming of You\" (1995). The song's lyrics are about a woman who loves a guy. She is scared of rejection so she decides not to tell him and keeps it to herself.\nIt was released in the United States on June 26, 1995 as a promotional recording and not as a CD single. Because of this, it was not eligible for the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.

In December 1994, Selena went back to Nashville by herself on a plane. She recorded \"I Could Fall in Love\" that day. Thomas later told \"Biography\", that \"all eyes were on her\". He also said that Selena had no \"ego\" problems and was \"down to-Earth\" (a person who keeps a positive attitude and always acts nice to everyone).\n\"I Could Fall in Love\" is a contemporary R&B, soul and a power ballad.
