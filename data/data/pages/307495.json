{"id":307495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_electrochemistry","text":"Isotope electrochemistry is a field within electrochemistry concerned with various topics like electrochemical separation of isotopes, electrochemical estimation of isotopic exchange equilibrium constants, electrochemical kinetic isotope effect, electrochemical isotope sensors, etc.\nChemists are actively working in this area. It overlaps with many other chemistry areas of both theoretical and practical importance like nuclear engineering, electrochemical technology, geochemistry, sensors and instrumentation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electrochemistry","surface_form":"electrochemistry","offset":43},{"uri":"Separation","surface_form":"separation","offset":111},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":125},{"uri":"Equilibrium_constant","surface_form":"equilibrium constant","offset":183},{"uri":"Kinetic_isotope_effect","surface_form":"kinetic isotope effect","offset":222},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":262},{"uri":"Sensor","surface_form":"sensor","offset":270},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":356},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":380},{"uri":"Nuclear_engineering","surface_form":"nuclear engineering","offset":422},{"uri":"Geochemistry","surface_form":"geochemistry","offset":471},{"uri":"Instrumentation","surface_form":"instrumentation","offset":497}]}
