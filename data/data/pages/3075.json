They played their first FA Cup final in 1914, losing 1\u20130 to Burnley. The last domestic trophy they won was the EFL Cup in February 2012, after beating Cardiff City. They have also won the Champions League six times, the most of any British side. Their 5th success was in Istanbul in 2005. The game was won after Liverpool tied 3\u20133 with A.C. Milan, after being down 3\u20130 at half-time. The Reds then won the penalty shootout, partly due to goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's saves. Their 6th and most recent success was in 2019 when they beat fellow Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in Madrid. Liverpool F.C. have won England's top football league 18 times. The club won the 2019-20 Premier League title, thirty years after their last first division title win in the 1989-90 season.\nLiverpool has had two tragedies in their history. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, which led to the death of 39 Juventus fans and the second was the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, which lead to the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans.\nClub captains.\nSince the establishment of the club in 1892, 45 players have been club captain of Liverpool F.C. Andrew Hannah became the first captain of the club after Liverpool separated from Everton and formed its own club.
