{"id":307502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysical_chemistry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Biophysical chemistry is the study of biological systems. It looks for explanations of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra-molecular structure of these systems.\nBiophysical chemists use various tools used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These tools include spectroscopic methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction. For example, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 was based on x-ray diffraction studies of ribosomes.\nBiophysical chemists study protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes. For example, enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion. Similarly, biophysical chemists study the structure and function of the biomembranes using model supramolecular structures. These include liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes.\nThe oldest well-known institute for biophysical chemistry is Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00F6ttingen. The Biophysics Department of King's College London is where the X-ray crystallography studies of DNA was done in the early 1950s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Systems","surface_form":"systems","offset":62},{"uri":"Explanation","surface_form":"explanation","offset":84},{"uri":"Phenomena","surface_form":"phenomena","offset":112},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":167},{"uri":"Supramolecular_chemistry","surface_form":"supra-molecular","offset":208},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":224},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical chemistry","offset":299},{"uri":"NMR_spectroscopy","surface_form":"nuclear magnetic resonance","offset":411},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray diffraction","offset":448},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":484},{"uri":"Ribosomes","surface_form":"ribosomes","offset":559},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":597},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":605},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":647},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":676},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":723},{"uri":"Pocket","surface_form":"pocket","offset":734},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":748},{"uri":"Substrate_(biochemistry)","surface_form":"substrate","offset":795},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":854},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":860},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":907},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":921},{"uri":"Biomembrane","surface_form":"biomembrane","offset":937},{"uri":"Liposome","surface_form":"liposome","offset":1003},{"uri":"Phospholipid","surface_form":"phospholipid","offset":1016},{"uri":"Vesicle_(biology)","surface_form":"vesicles","offset":1029},{"uri":"Max_Planck_Institute","surface_form":"Max Planck Institute","offset":1136},{"uri":"G%C3%B6ttingen","surface_form":"G\u00F6ttingen","offset":1186},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"Biophysics","offset":1201},{"uri":"King%27s_College_London","surface_form":"King's College London","offset":1226},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":1261},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":1294}]}
