{"id":307544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_(mathematics)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A term is a mathematical expression.\nDefinition.\nIn elementary mathematics, a \"term\" is either a single number or variable, or the product of several numbers or variables. Terms are separated by a + or - sign in an overall expression. For example, in\n3, 4\"x\", and 5\"yzw\" are three separate terms.\nIn the context of polynomials, \"term\" can mean a monomial with a coefficient. To combine like terms in a polynomial is to make it a linear combination of distinct monomials. For example,\nA series is often represented as the sum of a sequence of terms.\nIn general mathematical use, however, \"term\" is not limited to additive expressions. Individual factors in an expression representing a product are multiplicative terms. Indeed, individual elements of any mathematical expression may be referred to as \"terms\".\nIn logic, a term is a collection of symbols used to represent a mathematical object (rather than a mathematical statement). A basic term is either a constant or a variable, while more complex terms can also be built using operators (such as the term formula_1). To refer to a term, variables such as formula_1 and formula_1 are often used.\nIn informal logic, a term can also refer to the subject or predicate of a statement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical_expression","surface_form":"mathematical expression","offset":25},{"uri":"Primary_school","surface_form":"elementary","offset":65},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":76},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":328},{"uri":"Monomial","surface_form":"monomial","offset":359},{"uri":"Coefficient","surface_form":"coefficient","offset":375},{"uri":"Linear_combination","surface_form":"linear combination","offset":442},{"uri":"Distinct","surface_form":"distinct","offset":464},{"uri":"Series_(mathematics)","surface_form":"series","offset":499},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":543},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":825},{"uri":"Term_(logic)","surface_form":"term","offset":834},{"uri":"Constant","surface_form":"constant","offset":971},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":985},{"uri":"Operator_(mathematics)","surface_form":"operators","offset":1044},{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":1210},{"uri":"Predicate_(grammar)","surface_form":"predicate","offset":1221}]}
