{"id":30768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linga","text":"A linga or a lingam is a very complex symbol of Hinduism. It is associated with Shiva, supreme god in main gods of the Hindus. The Hindu scriptures say that a linga represents energy and strength. In almost all the temples of Shiva, Shiva is shown in the form of a linga.\nBeside above places, in almost all the towns and villages of India, Shiva\u2019s temples are found. In all such temples, lingas are worshipped.\nLINGA is also used to describe the rounded stones themselves. They can be found at sites as far west as Europe. For instance, a Linga was found on the grounds surrounding the Masoleum of Rumi in Turkey. As well as it's obvious shape, that of a 4ft capsule, it also has the same energy fields that are displayed by all Linga still undamaged or \"alive\" as Yogis refer to them. The Linga in Turkey is known to be 4,200+ years old. At one time it is believed that all across from Asia through Europe, consecrated sites with these Linga were built not for worship, but to sit with and to be able to gain from access to a quiet place consecrated to being a more spiritual being.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":48},{"uri":"Shiva","surface_form":"Shiva","offset":80},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":107},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":119},{"uri":"Hindu_scripture","surface_form":"Hindu scripture","offset":131},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":215}]}
