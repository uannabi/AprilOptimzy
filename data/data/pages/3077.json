{"id":3077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.","text":"Manchester United F.C. is a football club that plays in the Premier League. They play their home games at Old Trafford which is in Greater Manchester.\nMatt Busby led the club to lots of success by using the youth players until the Munich air disaster in 1958, where many United footballers and staff died. Sir Alex Ferguson led the club to many titles, including the treble (Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League), from 1986 to 2013, when he retired. The club has 3 UEFA Champions League titles, 20 league titles, 12 FA Cups, and a FIFA Club World Cup.\nHistory.\nManchester United are the most successful club in England and have won 20 league titles, which is more than any other team. They have also won 12 FA Cups and 3 European Cups.\nThe club started as Newton Heath L&YR F.C. in 1878. All of the team worked at Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath. After nearly closing in 1902, John Henry Davies took over and changed the club's name to Manchester United F.C.. Manchester United made Matt Busby their manager after World War II. Matt Busby used the youth team to get new players, and this was very successful. The club won the Football League in 1956 and 1957. The success was stopped by the Munich air disaster in 1958, when eight of the club's players died. It was thought that the club might close, but it did not. They won the Football League in 1965 and 1967, and the European Cup in 1968.\nSir Alex Ferguson era.\nIn 1986, manager Ron Atkinson was sacked by the club because they were in danger of being relegated. They brought in Sir Alex Ferguson. He did not win anything for the first couple of years.\nThe team won their first trophy under Ferguson, the 1990 FA Cup, against Crystal Palace in the replay after a 3-3 draw. The next season, United won the UEFA Cup Winners Cup. In 1993, Manchester United won the very first Premier League. In 1999, Manchester United won the treble, made of the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. Manchester United won the league 7 times again until Sir Alex Ferguson retired.\nRecent history.\nDavid Moyes was made manager in 2013. In April 2014, he was sacked by the club and club legend Ryan Giggs became player-manager (when a player is also the manager at the same time). They finished in 7th place. In 2014, Louis Van Gaal took over. He led United to a 4th-place finish. In 2015, after winning 3-0 against Sunderland, Man United reached 1st place for the first time in over two years. However, after losing 0-3 to Arsenal, they dropped to 3rd place. Van Gaal was sacked at the end of the season and Jos\u00E9 Mourinho replaced him. He then led the club to a League Cup and Europa League victory in the 2016-17 season. Mourinho was sacked in December 2018 because of poor results and replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nGrounds.\nThe Old Trafford became the club's home ground in 1909, and the stadium was constructed to a capacity of 77,000. In the Second World War, bombings damaged the stadium. While the stadium was being fixed, they played \"home\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road. The stadium was converted to an all-seater stadium in 1993 for safety reasons, but the capacity fell to 44,000. In 1995, expansions in the North Stand raised the capacity to 55,000. In the middle of 1999, the East and West Stands were expanded to give the stadium a capacity of 67,000. Then between 2005 and 2006 8,000 more seats were added to make a capacity of 75,000.\nRivalries.\nUnited has many rivalries including Liverpool, Manchester City, Leeds United and Arsenal. Their most intense rivalry is with \"The Citizens\" (Manchester City). This is because both clubs are from Manchester and each time they play against each other it is called the Manchester Derby.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["football club"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":28},{"uri":"Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":60},{"uri":"Old_Trafford","surface_form":"Old Trafford","offset":106},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Greater Manchester","offset":131},{"uri":"Matt_Busby","surface_form":"Matt Busby","offset":151},{"uri":"Munich_air_disaster","surface_form":"Munich air disaster","offset":231},{"uri":"Sir_Alex_Ferguson","surface_form":"Sir Alex Ferguson","offset":306},{"uri":"English_Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":375},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":391},{"uri":"UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"Champions League","offset":403},{"uri":"UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"UEFA Champions League","offset":473},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":524},{"uri":"FIFA_Club_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA Club World Cup","offset":539},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":619},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":715},{"uri":"European_cup","surface_form":"European Cups","offset":729},{"uri":"Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway","surface_form":"Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway","offset":822},{"uri":"Newton_Heath","surface_form":"Newton Heath","offset":864},{"uri":"John_Henry_Davies","surface_form":"John Henry Davies","offset":908},{"uri":"Matt_Busby","surface_form":"Matt Busby","offset":1014},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1045},{"uri":"Football_League","surface_form":"Football League","offset":1157},{"uri":"Munich_air_disaster","surface_form":"Munich air disaster","offset":1222},{"uri":"The_Football_League","surface_form":"the Football League","offset":1357},{"uri":"European_cup","surface_form":"European Cup","offset":1403},{"uri":"Ron_Atkinson","surface_form":"Ron Atkinson","offset":1465},{"uri":"Alex_Ferguson","surface_form":"Sir Alex Ferguson","offset":1565},{"uri":"Crystal_Palace_F.C.","surface_form":"Crystal Palace","offset":1712},{"uri":"UEFA_Cup_Winners_Cup","surface_form":"UEFA Cup Winners Cup","offset":1791},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":1946},{"uri":"UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"UEFA Champions League","offset":1958},{"uri":"David_Moyes","surface_form":"David Moyes","offset":2077},{"uri":"Ryan_Giggs","surface_form":"Ryan Giggs","offset":2172},{"uri":"Louis_van_Gaal","surface_form":"Louis Van Gaal","offset":2296},{"uri":"Sunderland_A.F.C.","surface_form":"Sunderland","offset":2394},{"uri":"Arsenal_F.C.","surface_form":"Arsenal","offset":2502},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Mourinho","offset":2587},{"uri":"League_Cup","surface_form":"League Cup","offset":2641},{"uri":"2016-17_UEFA_Europa_League","surface_form":"Europa League","offset":2656},{"uri":"Ole_Gunnar_Solskj%C3%A6r","surface_form":"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer","offset":2778},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":2929},{"uri":"Manchester_City","surface_form":"Manchester City","offset":3040},{"uri":"Maine_Road","surface_form":"Maine Road","offset":3058},{"uri":"Liverpool_F.C.","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":3488},{"uri":"Manchester_City_F.C.","surface_form":"Manchester City","offset":3499},{"uri":"Leeds_United_A.F.C.","surface_form":"Leeds United","offset":3516},{"uri":"Arsenal_F.C.","surface_form":"Arsenal","offset":3533},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":3647},{"uri":"Manchester_Derby","surface_form":"Manchester Derby","offset":3718}]}
