{"id":30773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard","text":"The United States National Guard is an organization of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are both branches of the United States military. The National Guard is a militia (an emergency army) for the United States. Each U.S. State has its own National Guard, usually under the control of that state's government. When needed, they are mobilized under control of the United States.\nThere are two parts of the United States National Guard, administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States Department of Defense. The Air National Guard is part of the United States Air Force; the Army National Guard is part of the United States Army. The two National Guard groups are identified by the kinds of jobs they do. The Air National Guard does mainly air defense jobs, while the Army National Guard does the jobs on the ground.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":39},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":59},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"United States Air Force","offset":86},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States military","offset":169},{"uri":"Militia","surface_form":"militia","offset":217},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":253},{"uri":"U.S._State","surface_form":"U.S. State","offset":273},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":419},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Defense","surface_form":"United States Department of Defense","offset":540},{"uri":"Anti-aircraft_warfare","surface_form":"air defense","offset":809}]}
