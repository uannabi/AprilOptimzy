The Normans built a small castle there but it was unused and broken by the time of the Tudors.\nThe town grew as an important centre for transport. After 1769, ships were able to use the river. It was a stagecoach stop for travel on the road between London and Cambridge. In 1842 the town got a railway station.\nIn 1901 there were 7,000 people living there, and by 1951 it was 13,000.\nThe town is popular for travellers to London because of the M11 motorway (an important road) and good train services to London. Stansted Airport has also caused development.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hertfordshire","surface_form":"Hertfordshire","offset":44},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":72},{"uri":"Saxons","surface_form":"Saxons","offset":244},{"uri":"Domesday_Book","surface_form":"Domesday Book","offset":256},{"uri":"Normans","surface_form":"Normans","offset":328},{"uri":"Tudors","surface_form":"Tudors","offset":411},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":573},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":584},{"uri":"Stansted_Airport","surface_form":"Stansted Airport","offset":836}]}
