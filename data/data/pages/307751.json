{"id":307751,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demersal","text":"e=\"preserve\">Demersal animals live on or near the bottom of the sea or lakes. The term is usually applied to fish.\nThey occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word \"demersal\" comes from the Latin \"demergere\", which means \"to sink\".\nDemersal fish are bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column. Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"sea","offset":64},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":71},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":109},{"uri":"Sea_floor","surface_form":"sea floor","offset":131},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":146},{"uri":"Mud","surface_form":"mud","offset":182},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":187},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":193},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rocks","offset":203},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":213},{"uri":"Continental_shelf","surface_form":"continental shelf","offset":258},{"uri":"Abyss","surface_form":"abyssal","offset":435},{"uri":"Abyssal_plain","surface_form":"abyssal plain","offset":460},{"uri":"Seamount","surface_form":"seamount","offset":504},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":562},{"uri":"Bottom_feeder","surface_form":"bottom feeder","offset":622},{"uri":"Pelagic","surface_form":"pelagic","offset":666},{"uri":"Fish_oil","surface_form":"fish oil","offset":783}]}
