Quintanilla III was interviewed for the \"Selena: 20 Years of Music\" series. This was recorded by Brian \"Red\" Moore, a family friend. Quintanilla III told Moore that EMI Latin did not want the family to be involved. He then said that they were already gambling on releasing a Latin division. Quintanilla III said that EMI Latin believed that the family could hurt the sales of the album.\nSelena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. tried to persuade EMI Latin to give Quintanilla III a chance.
