{"id":307908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings","text":"The FIFA World Rankings is a ranking of men's football teams selected by FIFA. Currently, the team ranked #1 is Belgium. The rankings were first made in 1993. The first team to receive first place was Germany.\nA points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognized full international matches.\nFIFA announced in June 2018 that the ranking system would be updated following the 2018 World Cup. The calculation method to be adopted will be closely modeled after the Elo rating system and rankings of its member associations will be updated on a game-by-game basis. The weighting designated for each confederation for ranking purposes was removed. However, the new method does not account for home or away games and margin of the victory, unlike the Elo rankings. This produced a more altered ranking table, with Germany falling to 15th and 2018 World Cup champions France moving to the top of the ranking.\nMen's rank leaders.\nWhen the system was created, Germany began as the top-ranked team following their dominant period in which they had reached the three previous FIFA World Cup finals, winning one of them. Brazil took the lead in the run up to the 1994 FIFA World Cup after winning eight and losing only one of nine qualification matches, while on the way scoring twenty goals and conceding just four. Italy then led for a short time on the back of their own equally successful World Cup qualifying campaign, after which the top place was re-claimed by Germany.\nBrazil's success in their 1993 qualifying campaign returned them to the lead for a brief period. Germany led again during the 1994 World Cup, until Brazil's victory in that competition gave them a large lead that would stand up for nearly seven years, until they were surpassed by a strong France team that captured both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2000 UEFA Euro.\nSuccess at the 2002 FIFA World Cup restored Brazil to the top position, where they remained until February 2007, when Italy returned to the top for the first time since 1993 following their 2006 FIFA World Cup win in Germany. Just one month later, Argentina replaced them, reaching the top for the first time, but Italy regained its place in April. After winning the Copa Am\u00E9rica 2007 in July, Brazil returned to the top, but were replaced by Italy in September and then Argentina in October.\nIn July 2008, Spain took over the lead for the first time, having won UEFA Euro 2008. Brazil began a sixth stint at the top of the rankings in July 2009 after winning the 2009 Confederations Cup, and Spain regained the title in November 2009 after winning every match in qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn April 2010, Brazil returned to the top of the table. After winning the 2010 World Cup, Spain regained the top position and held it until August 2011, when the Netherlands reached the top spot for the first time, only to drop it the following month.\nIn July 2014, Germany took over the lead once again, having won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In July 2015, Argentina reached the top spot for the first time since 2008, after reaching both the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, as well as the 2015 Copa America Final. In November 2015, Belgium became the leader in the FIFA rankings for the first time, after topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group. Belgium led the rankings until April 2016, when Argentina returned to the top. Brazil returned to the No. 1 spot in April 2017 for the first time since just prior to the 2010 World Cup, because they had already qualified for the 2018 World Cup as they were 1st in their qualification group with 4 match days still left to go. However, Germany regained the top spot in July after winning the Confederations Cup.\nIn the summer of 2018, FIFA updated their rating system by adopting the Elo rating system. The first ranking list with this system, in August 2018, saw France retake the top spot for the first time after nearly 16 years, having won the 2018 FIFA World Cup. One month later, for the first time, two teams were both leaders as Belgium reached the same ranking as France. This lasted only one month, and from September 2018 until now (), Belgium is leading the FIFA ranking.\nBest Mover of the Year.\nThe Best Mover of the Year was awarded to the team who made the best progress up the rankings over the course of the year. In the FIFA rankings, this is not simply the team that has risen the most places, but a calculation is performed in order to account for the fact that it becomes progressively harder to earn more points the higher up the rankings a team is.\nThe calculation used is the number of points the team has at the end of the year (\"z\") multiplied by the number of points it earned during the year (\"y\"). The team with the highest index on this calculation received the award. The table below shows the top three best movers from each year.\nThe award has not been an official part of the awards since 2006.\nWhile an official award has not been made for movements since 2006, FIFA has released a list of the 'Best Movers' in the rankings since 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":46},{"uri":"FIFA","surface_form":"FIFA","offset":73},{"uri":"Belgium_national_football_team","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":112},{"uri":"Germany_national_football_team","surface_form":"Germany","offset":201},{"uri":"2018_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2018 World Cup","offset":416},{"uri":"Elo_rating_system","surface_form":"Elo rating system","offset":503},{"uri":"Germany_national_football_team","surface_form":"Germany","offset":992},{"uri":"Brazil_national_football_team","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1150},{"uri":"1994_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"1994 FIFA World Cup","offset":1192},{"uri":"Italy_national_football_team","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1346},{"uri":"France_national_football_team","surface_form":"France","offset":1796},{"uri":"1998_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"1998 FIFA World Cup","offset":1831},{"uri":"2000_UEFA_Euro","surface_form":"2000 UEFA Euro","offset":1859},{"uri":"2002_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2002 FIFA World Cup","offset":1890},{"uri":"2006_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2006 FIFA World Cup","offset":2065},{"uri":"Argentina_national_football_team","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":2123},{"uri":"Copa_Am%C3%A9rica_2007","surface_form":"Copa Am\u00E9rica 2007","offset":2242},{"uri":"Spain_national_football_team","surface_form":"Spain","offset":2382},{"uri":"UEFA_Euro_2008","surface_form":"UEFA Euro 2008","offset":2438},{"uri":"2009_FIFA_Confederations_Cup","surface_form":"2009 Confederations Cup","offset":2539},{"uri":"2010_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2010 FIFA World Cup","offset":2661},{"uri":"2010_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2010 World Cup","offset":2756},{"uri":"Netherlands_national_football_team","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":2844},{"uri":"Germany_national_football_team","surface_form":"Germany","offset":2948},{"uri":"2014_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2014 FIFA World Cup","offset":3002},{"uri":"Argentina_national_football_team","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":3037},{"uri":"2014_FIFA_World_Cup_Final","surface_form":"2014 FIFA World Cup Final","offset":3123},{"uri":"2015_Copa_America","surface_form":"2015 Copa America","offset":3165},{"uri":"Belgium_national_football_team","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":3208},{"uri":"UEFA_Euro_2016_qualifying","surface_form":"Euro 2016","offset":3295},{"uri":"2017_FIFA_Confederations_Cup","surface_form":"Confederations Cup","offset":3714},{"uri":"France_national_football_team","surface_form":"France","offset":3886},{"uri":"2018_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2018 FIFA World Cup","offset":3970}]}
