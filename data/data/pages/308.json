Green paint can be made by mixing yellow paint and blue paint together.\nGreen light, like all light, is quanta\u2014composed of photons. The wavelength of green light is about 550 nanometers (one-billionth of a meter).\nMost leaves of growing plants, such as trees and bushes, are green. This is because there is a chemical in leaves, called chlorophyll, which is colored green.\nTones of green color comparison chart.\nGreen is a color, the perception of which is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by range with a wavelength of roughly 570-520 nm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":11},{"uri":"Rainbow","surface_form":"rainbow","offset":49},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":79},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":90},{"uri":"Paint","surface_form":"paint","offset":122},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":210},{"uri":"Quanta","surface_form":"quanta","offset":220},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"photon","offset":239},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":252},{"uri":"Nanometer","surface_form":"nanometer","offset":291},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":322},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":335},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":353},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":369},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"bush","offset":379},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":425},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":437},{"uri":"Chlorophyll","surface_form":"chlorophyll","offset":452},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":633},{"uri":"Nanometre","surface_form":"nm","offset":663}]}
