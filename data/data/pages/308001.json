{"id":308001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbase","text":"In chemistry, a superbase is an extremely strong base. It is a compound that has a high affinity for protons.\nHydroxide ion is the strongest base possible in water (aqueous) solutions, but superbases are much stronger than aqueous bases. Such bases are useful in organic synthesis and are fundamental to physical organic chemistry.\nSuperbases have been described and used since the 1850s. Reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the air. Inert atmosphere techniques and low temperatures minimize these side reactions.\nDefinitions.\nIUPAC defines superbases simply as a \"compound having a very high basicity, such as lithium diisopropylamide\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":3},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":49},{"uri":"Affinity","surface_form":"affinity","offset":88},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":101},{"uri":"Hydroxide","surface_form":"Hydroxide","offset":110},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":120},{"uri":"Organic_synthesis","surface_form":"organic synthesis","offset":263},{"uri":"Fundamental","surface_form":"fundamental","offset":289},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical organic chemistry","offset":304},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"Reactions","offset":389},{"uri":"Inert_atmosphere","surface_form":"Inert atmosphere","offset":527},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":563},{"uri":"Lithium_diisopropylamide","surface_form":"lithium diisopropylamide","offset":704}]}
