It focuses on the chemical systems made up of a discrete number of assembled molecular subunits or components. The study of non-covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function. Biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"5%5Duril","surface_form":"5","offset":157},{"uri":"10%5Duril","surface_form":"10","offset":203},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":251},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":303},{"uri":"Assembled","surface_form":"assembled","offset":401},{"uri":"Component","surface_form":"components","offset":433},{"uri":"Noncovalent_bonding","surface_form":"non-covalent interactions","offset":458},{"uri":"Cell_structure","surface_form":"cell structure","offset":543},{"uri":"Vision","surface_form":"vision","offset":561},{"uri":"Systems_biology","surface_form":"Biological systems","offset":622}]}
