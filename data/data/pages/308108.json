{"id":308108,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gilbert","text":"Walter Gilbert (born March 21, 1932) is an American physicist, biochemist, molecular biology pioneer, and Nobel laureate. He helped develop DNA sequence analysis.\nBiography.\nGilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932. Gilbert attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a first degree in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.\nGilbert's doctoral work was done at the University of Cambridge, where he earned his PhD in mathematics under the mentorship of Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.\nGilbert returned to Harvard in 1957 and promoted in 1968 to professor of biochemistry. In 1969, Gilbert was given Harvard's Ledlie Prize. In 1972, Gilbert was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.\nHe is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics. Gilbert is currently the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.\nResearch findings.\nTogether with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method in 1976. With George Church he developed the first direct genomic sequencing method in 1984.\nGilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 \"News and Views\" paper published in \"Nature\". In 1986, Gilbert used the phrase RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life. 'RNA World' was a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.\nAwards.\nGilbert was given the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.\nAmong many other awards, Gilbert was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1987.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":43},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":52},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":63},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":75},{"uri":"Nobel_laureate","surface_form":"Nobel laureate","offset":106},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":140},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"sequence analysis","offset":144},{"uri":"Boston%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Boston, Massachusetts","offset":194},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":253},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":338},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":352},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"master's degree","offset":374},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":450},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":502},{"uri":"Abdus_Salam","surface_form":"Abdus Salam","offset":553},{"uri":"American_Cancer_Society","surface_form":"American Cancer Society","offset":739},{"uri":"Biogen","surface_form":"Biogen","offset":848},{"uri":"Myriad_Genetics","surface_form":"Myriad Genetics","offset":859},{"uri":"Harvard_Society_of_Fellows","surface_form":"Harvard Society of Fellows","offset":917},{"uri":"Allan_Maxam","surface_form":"Allan Maxam","offset":978},{"uri":"George_Church","surface_form":"George Church","offset":1051},{"uri":"Intron","surface_form":"intron","offset":1170},{"uri":"Exon","surface_form":"exon","offset":1182},{"uri":"RNA_world_hypothesis","surface_form":"RNA world hypothesis","offset":1324},{"uri":"Origin_of_life","surface_form":"origin of life","offset":1353},{"uri":"Carl_Woese","surface_form":"Carl Woese","offset":1413},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":1468},{"uri":"Frederick_Sanger","surface_form":"Frederick Sanger","offset":1506},{"uri":"Paul_Berg","surface_form":"Paul Berg","offset":1527},{"uri":"Nucleotide","surface_form":"nucleotide","offset":1651},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":1668},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":1748}]}
