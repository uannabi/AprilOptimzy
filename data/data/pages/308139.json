{"id":308139,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasma","text":"The optic chiasma, or 'optic chiasm', is the part of the brain where the optic nerves (CN II) partially cross. The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.\nPathways.\nThe images on the nasal (inner) sides of each retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm. The temporal (outer) images, on the other hand, stay on the same side. This allows the images from either side of the visual field to go to the appropriate side of the brain, combining the sides together.\nBeyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, optic nerves become optic tracts.\nThe crossing over of optic nerve fibres at the optic chiasma allows the visual cortex to receive the same hemispheric visual field from both eyes.\nThe optic chiasma is found in all vertebrates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":57},{"uri":"Optic_nerve","surface_form":"optic nerve","offset":73},{"uri":"Hypothalamus","surface_form":"hypothalamus","offset":188},{"uri":"Retina","surface_form":"retina","offset":258},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":304},{"uri":"Optic_nerve","surface_form":"optic nerve","offset":318},{"uri":"Temporal","surface_form":"temporal","offset":355},{"uri":"Visual_field","surface_form":"visual field","offset":469},{"uri":"Optic_tract","surface_form":"optic tract","offset":636},{"uri":"Visual_cortex","surface_form":"visual cortex","offset":722},{"uri":"Vertebrates","surface_form":"vertebrates","offset":831}]}
