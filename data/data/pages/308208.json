{"id":308208,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheminformatics","text":"Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics and chemical informatics) is the study of large amounts of chemical information. It is done mostly with the help of computers. These tools are used by pharmaceutical companies to discovery new drugs.\nCheminformatics uses computer science and information technology to help solve chemistry problems. Cheminformatics deals with algorithms, databases and information systems, web technologies, artificial intelligence and soft computing, information and computation theory, software engineering, data mining, image processing, modeling and simulation, signal processing, discrete mathematics, control and system theory, circuit theory, and statistics, for generating new knowledge of chemistry.\nBasics.\nCheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry and computer science.\nCheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for the paper, pulp and dye industries.\nStorage and retrieval.\nThe primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as data mining and machine learning.\nFile formats.\nComputers represent chemical structures in specialized formats such as the XML-based Chemical Markup Language or SMILES. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.\nVirtual libraries.\nChemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules. Virtual compounds may be used to explore chemical space and predict new\nVirtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.\nVirtual screening.\nInstead og testing the actual chemicals, virtual screening involves\nscreening compounds by computer, to identify members likely to possess desired properties such as biological activity against a given target.\nQuantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR).\nThis is to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. These studies link cheminofrmatics to chemometrics. Chemical expert systems are also relevant. They represent parts of chemical knowledge in computers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Large","surface_form":"large","offset":90},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":164},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"pharmaceutical","offset":199},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":241},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":327},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":374},{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database","offset":386},{"uri":"Information_system","surface_form":"information system","offset":400},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web","surface_form":"web technologies","offset":421},{"uri":"Artificial_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial intelligence","offset":439},{"uri":"Soft_computing","surface_form":"soft computing","offset":467},{"uri":"Information_theory","surface_form":"information","offset":483},{"uri":"Computation_theory","surface_form":"computation theory","offset":499},{"uri":"Software_engineering","surface_form":"software engineering","offset":519},{"uri":"Data_mining","surface_form":"data mining","offset":541},{"uri":"Image_processing","surface_form":"image processing","offset":554},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"simulation","offset":585},{"uri":"Signal_processing","surface_form":"signal processing","offset":597},{"uri":"Discrete_mathematics","surface_form":"discrete mathematics","offset":616},{"uri":"System_theory","surface_form":"system theory","offset":650},{"uri":"Circuit_theory","surface_form":"circuit theory","offset":665},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":685},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":806},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":820},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":899},{"uri":"Pulp","surface_form":"pulp","offset":906},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":915},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compound","offset":1042},{"uri":"Efficiency","surface_form":"efficient","offset":1057},{"uri":"Data_mining","surface_form":"data mining","offset":1160},{"uri":"Machine_learning","surface_form":"machine learning","offset":1176},{"uri":"XML","surface_form":"XML","offset":1283},{"uri":"Chemical_Markup_Language","surface_form":"Chemical Markup Language","offset":1293},{"uri":"Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification","surface_form":"SMILES","offset":1321},{"uri":"Docking_(molecular)","surface_form":"docking","offset":1480},{"uri":"Chemical_space","surface_form":"chemical space","offset":1613},{"uri":"Chemometrics","surface_form":"chemometrics","offset":2216},{"uri":"Expert_system","surface_form":"expert system","offset":2239}]}
