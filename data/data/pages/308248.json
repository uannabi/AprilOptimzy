{"id":308248,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristolochiaceae","text":"The Aristolochiaceae, or Birthwort family, are a family of flowering plants with seven genera and about 400 species belonging to the order Piperales. The type genus is \"Aristolochia\" L.\nDescription.\nThey are mostly perennial, herbaceous plants, shrubs, woody vines or even lianas.\nThe membranous, cordate simple leaves are spread out, growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks. The margins are commonly entire. There are no stipules.\nThe bizarre flowers are large to medium-sized, growing in the leaf axils. They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical.\nClassification.\nThe Aristolochiaceae are magnoliids, a basal group of angiosperms which are not part of the large categories of monocots or eudicots.\nSome newer classification schemes place the family Aristolochiaceae in the order Piperales.\nPhytochemistry.\nMany members of \"Aristolochia\" and some of \"Asarum\" contain the toxin aristolochic acid, which defence against predators, in this case herbivores. It is known to be carcinogenic in rats. \"Aristolochia\" itself is carcinogenic to humans.\nEcology.\nPipevine swallowtail butterflies lay their eggs on pipevine (\"Aristolochia\" species), and the larvae dine on the plant but are not affected by the toxin, which then offers the adult butterfly protection against predators.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":59},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":87},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":108},{"uri":"Piperales","surface_form":"Piperales","offset":139},{"uri":"Aristolochia","surface_form":"Aristolochia","offset":169},{"uri":"Carl_Linnaeus","surface_form":"L.","offset":183},{"uri":"Perennial_plant","surface_form":"perennial","offset":215},{"uri":"Herbaceous_plant","surface_form":"herbaceous plant","offset":226},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":245},{"uri":"Vine","surface_form":"vine","offset":259},{"uri":"Liana","surface_form":"liana","offset":273},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":312},{"uri":"Stipule","surface_form":"stipule","offset":432},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":454},{"uri":"Magnoliid","surface_form":"magnoliid","offset":603},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"angiosperms","offset":632},{"uri":"Monocot","surface_form":"monocot","offset":690},{"uri":"Eudicot","surface_form":"eudicot","offset":702},{"uri":"Piperales","surface_form":"Piperales","offset":793},{"uri":"Asarum","surface_form":"Asarum","offset":864},{"uri":"Aristolochic_acid","surface_form":"aristolochic acid","offset":890},{"uri":"Defence_against_predators","surface_form":"defence against predators","offset":915},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":955},{"uri":"Carcinogen","surface_form":"carcinogen","offset":985},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":1001},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":1048},{"uri":"Swallowtail_butterfly","surface_form":"swallowtail butterflies","offset":1074},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":1108},{"uri":"Caterpillar","surface_form":"larvae","offset":1159},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":1212},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":1276}]}
