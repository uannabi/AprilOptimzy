{"id":308330,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_cake","text":"Sponge cake is a cake made of flour (usually wheat flour), sugar, and eggs.\nVictoria sponge.\nThe Victoria sponge cake was named after Queen Victoria, who ate a slice of sponge cake with her afternoon tea. It is usually called simply \"sponge cake\". A traditional Victoria sponge cake has raspberry jam and whipped double cream or vanilla cream. If there is only jam, it is called 'jam sponge' and not a Victoria sponge. The jam and cream are between two sponge cakes; the top of the cake is not iced or decorated.\nOther names for the Victoria sponge are Victoria Sandwich and Victorian Cake, although 'Victorian Cake' is not used often.\nBakers must be careful when it comes to cooking times and temperatures. Because of that, oven factories often use a Victoria sponge recipe to test their ovens.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":17},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":30},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":45},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":59},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":70},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":134},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":250},{"uri":"Raspberry","surface_form":"raspberry","offset":287},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":431},{"uri":"Decorate","surface_form":"decorated","offset":502},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":676},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperatures","offset":694},{"uri":"Oven","surface_form":"oven","offset":725}]}
