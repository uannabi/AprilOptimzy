{"id":30834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_cross","text":"The Christian cross is the main symbol of the Christian religion. These crosses are usually found on Christian churches.\nJesus, who many Christians believe is God the Son and their Messiah, was crucified (nailed to a large wooden cross). This was a commonly used method for killing people in Roman times.\nChristians believe that Jesus' death made the sins of all humans who trust in him, go away, and that they are forgiven. They also believe that Jesus was resurrected (came back to life) after three days. Because of this, the cross is a symbol for Jesus' sacrifice and suffering, but also a symbol of hope, forgiveness of sins, and victory over death.\nThere are several different Christian crosses that are symbols for different Christian groups or persons.\nA cross with the body of Jesus on it is called a Crucifix.\nThe empty cross is usually favoured by Protestants and Eastern Orthodox, and the symbol reminds them of the Resurrection of Jesus, though the Orthodox will add a slanted footbar, as well. The crucifix is favoured by Catholic churches and is a reminder of Christ's sacrifice. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus died on a simple upright pole, a \"torture stake\"; and only display it as a picture of an impaled Jesus in their literature.\nChristians remember the death of Jesus on the cross on Good Friday every year.\nLatin Cross.\nThe most common cross is the Latin Cross. The cross represents and memorializes Christ's death.\nThis cross is a symbol of hope over death, and of victory in returning to life.
