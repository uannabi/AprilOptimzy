{"id":308496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth","text":"The woolly mammoth (\"Mammuthus primigenius\"), is a species of mammoth. This animal is known from bones and frozen carcasses from northern North America and northern Eurasia. The best preserved carcasses in Siberia. They are perhaps the most well known species of mammoth.\nThis mammoth species was first recorded in deposits of a former glaciation in Eurasia, perhaps 150,000 years ago.\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who hunted them. Their bones and tusks were used as tools, and dwellings. Mammoths were also hunted for food. The species disappeared from most of its range at the end of the Pleistocene (10,000 years ago), with a dwarfed race still living on Wrangel Island until about 1700 BC.\nDescription.\nWoolly mammoths were large elephants that lived during the ice ages. Cave paintings of the woolly mammoth have been found in caves in France and Spain. Woolly mammoths are tightly related to the Asian Elephant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":51},{"uri":"Mammoth","surface_form":"mammoth","offset":62},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":138},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":165},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":206},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":350},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":609},{"uri":"Island_dwarfism","surface_form":"dwarfed race","offset":648},{"uri":"Wrangel_Island","surface_form":"Wrangel Island","offset":677},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":753},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":785},{"uri":"Cave_painting","surface_form":"Cave painting","offset":795},{"uri":"Asian_Elephant","surface_form":"Asian Elephant","offset":921}]}
