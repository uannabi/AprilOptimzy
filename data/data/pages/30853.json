{"id":30853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly","text":"Holly is a type of bush with recognisable leaves. The leaves have sharp edges, and are often used to decorate a house on Christmas Day. Some types of holly are used to make tea. The leaves of the Holly don't fall of in the winter because they're very thick and have a waxy layer on them.\nHolly bushes produce berries that birds often eat during the winter season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"bush","offset":19},{"uri":"Christmas_Day","surface_form":"Christmas Day","offset":121},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":173}]}
