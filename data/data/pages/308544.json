{"id":308544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare","text":"Welfare is an idea from economics and Social Security. The idea is that everyone should have a minimal living standard. People who cannot reach this standard will be supported, usually by the state. Using welfare, everyone has their basic needs covered. This idea is different from the idea of charity.\nWelfare money is given by the government, charities, and other groups of people to help homeless, old, illness, poor, and disabled people (people who cannot help themselves), and also helps children (child support).\nWelfare can also be called the well-being of someone or a group of people: their happiness, health, safety, and fortune.\nIn countries like Germany, Japan, United States, Sweden, and France, government welfare also is used to help the needy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":24},{"uri":"Social_Security","surface_form":"Social Security","offset":38},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":192},{"uri":"Charity_(practice)","surface_form":"charity","offset":294},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":333},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charities","offset":345},{"uri":"Homeless","surface_form":"homeless","offset":391},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"illness","offset":406},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poor","offset":415},{"uri":"Disabled","surface_form":"disabled","offset":425},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":493},{"uri":"Child_support","surface_form":"child support","offset":503},{"uri":"Happiness","surface_form":"happiness","offset":600},{"uri":"Fortune","surface_form":"fortune","offset":631},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":658},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":667},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":674},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":689},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":701}]}
