{"id":308638,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decagon","text":"A decagon is a shape with 10 sides and 10 corners.\nRegular decagon.\nAll sides of a regular decagon are the same length. Each corner is 144\u00B0. All corners added together equal 1440\u00B0.\nArea.\nThe amount of space a regular decagon takes up is\n\"a\" is the length of one of its sides.\nAn alternative formula is formula_1 where \"d\" is the distance between parallel sides, or the height when the decagon stands on one side as base.\nBy simple trigonometry formula_1.\nSides.\nThe side of a regular decagon inscribed in a unit circle is formula_1, where \"&#x03D5;\" is the golden ratio, formula_1.\nDissection of regular decagon.\nCoxeter states that every parallel-sided 2\"m\"-gon can be divided into \"m\"(\"m\"-1)/2 rhombs. For the \"regular decagon\", \"m\"=5, and it can be divided into 10 rhombs, with examples shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 10 of 80 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the 5-cube. A dissection is based on 10 of 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron. The list [http://oeis.org/A006245 A006245] defines the number of solutions as 62, with 2 orientations for the first symmetric form, and 10 orientations for the other 6.\nSkew decagon.\nA skew decagon is a skew polygon with 10 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an decagon is not generally defined. A \"skew zig-zag decagon\" has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew decagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew decagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a pentagonal antiprism, pentagrammic antiprism, and pentagrammic crossed-antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20.\nThese can also be seen in these 4 convex polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry. The polygons on the perimeter of these projections are regular skew decagons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"shape","offset":15},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"corner","offset":42},{"uri":"Golden_ratio","surface_form":"golden ratio","offset":557},{"uri":"Coxeter","surface_form":"Coxeter","offset":613},{"uri":"Petrie_polygon","surface_form":"Petrie polygon","offset":857},{"uri":"5-cube","surface_form":"5-cube","offset":896},{"uri":"Rhombic_triacontahedron","surface_form":"rhombic triacontahedron","offset":951},{"uri":"Skew_polygon","surface_form":"skew polygon","offset":1179},{"uri":"Regular_skew_decagon","surface_form":"regular skew decagon","offset":1394},{"uri":"Vertex-transitive","surface_form":"vertex-transitive","offset":1418},{"uri":"Pentagonal_antiprism","surface_form":"pentagonal antiprism","offset":1563},{"uri":"Pentagrammic_antiprism","surface_form":"pentagrammic antiprism","offset":1585},{"uri":"Pentagrammic_crossed-antiprism","surface_form":"pentagrammic crossed-antiprism","offset":1613},{"uri":"Icosahedral_symmetry","surface_form":"icosahedral symmetry","offset":1747}]}
