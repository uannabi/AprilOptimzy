{"id":308728,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase","text":"A lipase is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation or cleavage (hydrolysis) of fats (lipids).\nLipases are essential for the digestion, transport and processing of lipids in the diet. Fats, oils and triglycerides are present in most (perhaps all) living organisms. Genes coding for lipases are even present in certain viruses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":15},{"uri":"Catalyze","surface_form":"catalyze","offset":27},{"uri":"Hydrolysis","surface_form":"hydrolysis","offset":64},{"uri":"Lipid","surface_form":"lipid","offset":85},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digestion","offset":124},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":177},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"Fat","offset":183},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":189},{"uri":"Triglycerides","surface_form":"triglycerides","offset":198},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":253},{"uri":"Genes","surface_form":"Genes","offset":264},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":317}]}
