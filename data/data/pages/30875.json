{"id":30875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games","text":"The Paralympic Games are a major international sports event. People with physical disabilities compete in these games. They are called Paralympians. They include people with disabilities that affect movement, amputations, blindness, and cerebral palsy.\nThere are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games. They are held just after the Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).\nHistory.\nThe Paralympics started as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948. They became one of the largest international sport events by the early 21st century.\nParalympians.\nParalympians have many different kinds of disabilities, so there are several categories in which they compete. The disabilities are in six broad categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, wheelchair, visually impaired, and \"Les Autres\" (This means \"the others\" in French.) These categories are further broken down which vary from sport to sport.\nParalympians work for equal treatment with able-bodied Olympians. Olympians receive much more money than Paralympians. Some Paralympians have also participated in the Olympic Games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabilities","offset":82},{"uri":"Amputation","surface_form":"amputation","offset":209},{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blindness","offset":222},{"uri":"Cerebral_palsy","surface_form":"cerebral palsy","offset":237},{"uri":"Winter_Paralympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter","offset":263},{"uri":"Summer_Paralympic_Games","surface_form":"Summer Paralympic Games","offset":274},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":328},{"uri":"International_Paralympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Paralympic Committee","offset":384},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":491},{"uri":"Stoke_Mandeville_Games","surface_form":"1948","offset":516},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":904},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":1153}]}
