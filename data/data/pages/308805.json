She was convicted of Selena's murder in March 1995. Sald\u00EDvar is currently serving a life sentence in a Texas jail. She will be eligible for parole in 2025.\nSald\u00EDvar was a registered nurse who met with Selena after a concert in 1991. They became friends quickly and Selena offered her a job as her fan club's president and another job, at her boutique (Selena Etc.)\nOn March 31, 1995, Sald\u00EDvar and Selena met at a hotel room in Corpus Christi, Texas. Selena was there to get some missing documents that Sald\u00EDvar stole from her. Sald\u00EDvar claimed she was raped and needed Selena's help. Selena drove Sald\u00EDvar to the hospital where doctors told Selena that Sald\u00EDvar was \"not\" raped. They drove back to the hotel. Selena asked for the documents one last time. When Selena went to close the door, Saldivar took a gun from her purse and held Selena at gunpoint. In order to stop her from closing the door, she pulled the trigger and shot Selena in the back. Selena ran to the hotel lobby where she fell. Staff called 9-1-1.Selena was taken to a local hospital, but was declared dead. Saldivar went to her pickup truck and threatened suicide, but gave herself up after nine hours.\nSald\u00EDvar's trial for the murder of Selena was followed by the Hispanic community in the United States. She was convicted and sentenced to life in prison soon after. It is believed that Sald\u00EDvar will never leave prison in her lifetime because of the impact of her crime and the many death threats she has received if she were to ever make parole in 2025","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Selena","surface_form":"Selena","offset":89},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":114},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":171},{"uri":"Parole","surface_form":"parole","offset":208},{"uri":"Selena_Etc.","surface_form":"Selena Etc.","offset":420},{"uri":"Corpus_Christi%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Corpus Christi, Texas","offset":495},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":620},{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":1303},{"uri":"Conviction","surface_form":"convicted","offset":1352}]}
