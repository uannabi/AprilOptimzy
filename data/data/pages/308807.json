{"id":308807,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision","text":"Univisi\u00F3n is one of the largest Hispanic television channels in the United States.\nIt was founded by the largest media company in Mexico (now known as Grupo Televisa) as a means to spread Spanish programming in the United States. Univision has grown to be the largest Spanish-language media outlet in the U.S. Its daily news program \"Noticiero Univisi\u00F3n\", co-anchored by Jorge Ramos and Mar\u00EDa Elena Salinas, has in several occasions outdone (in number of ratings) major English-language network evening news programming such as CBS, NBC, and ABC's World News Tonight.\nUnivisi\u00F3n and Telemundo USA have been competing for the top spot among Hispanic viewers for many years, often imitating each other's programming.\nUnivisi\u00F3n headquarters are based in Los Angeles, although much of its programming is filmed in Miami. Among its shows are \"El Show De Cristina\" (talkshow hosted by Cristina Saralegui), Don Francisco's \"S\u00E1bado Gigante\", \"Despierta Am\u00E9rica\" (morning show), \"Primer Impacto\" (newsmagazine), \"Aqu\u00ED y Ahora\" (premier investigative nightly newsmagazine), and \"Noticiero Univisi\u00F3n\" (news program conducted by Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas).\nIn 2013, Univision and ABC News announced that they were to become partners and will form a new channel called Fusion. Fusion will show English news for Hispanic audiences. The channel began broadcasting on October 28, 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":32},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":41},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":68},{"uri":"Jorge_Ramos","surface_form":"Jorge Ramos","offset":371},{"uri":"Mar%C3%ADa_Elena_Salinas","surface_form":"Mar\u00EDa Elena Salinas","offset":387},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":528},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":533},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":542},{"uri":"Telemundo","surface_form":"Telemundo","offset":582},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":750},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami","offset":809},{"uri":"Cristina_Saralegui","surface_form":"Cristina Saralegui","offset":878},{"uri":"Don_Francisco","surface_form":"Don Francisco","offset":899},{"uri":"S%C3%A1bado_Gigante","surface_form":"S\u00E1bado Gigante","offset":916},{"uri":"Jorge_Ramos","surface_form":"Jorge Ramos","offset":1116},{"uri":"Maria_Elena_Salinas","surface_form":"Maria Elena Salinas","offset":1132},{"uri":"ABC_News","surface_form":"ABC News","offset":1177}]}
