{"id":308809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincea%C3%B1era","text":"The Quincea\u00F1era is a young Latina woman's celebration of her fifteenth birthday, which is celebrated in a specific and different way from her other birthdays. It is the same as the English version of a Sweet Sixteen.\nThe celebration begins with a Thanksgiving Mass, in which the quincea\u00F1era arrives in formal dress, accompanied by her parents, godparents, seven maids of honor and seven chamberlains. After the Mass, the younger sisters, female cousins and friends of the quincea\u00F1era pass out party favors, and the quincea\u00F1era leaves her bouquet in an altar to the Virgin Mary. The Mass is followed by a party at either the quincea\u00F1era's home or in a banquet hall rented for the occasion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"15_(number)","surface_form":"fifteenth","offset":61},{"uri":"Sweet_Sixteen","surface_form":"Sweet Sixteen","offset":202},{"uri":"Maids_of_honor","surface_form":"maids of honor","offset":362},{"uri":"Chamberlains","surface_form":"chamberlains","offset":387},{"uri":"Bouquet","surface_form":"bouquet","offset":538},{"uri":"Altar","surface_form":"altar","offset":552},{"uri":"Virgin_Mary","surface_form":"Virgin Mary","offset":565},{"uri":"Rent","surface_form":"rented","offset":664}]}
