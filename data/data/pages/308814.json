All exams in the more than 70 courses offered are hand graded by a qualified staff of full-time and part-time instructors. Additionally, the school works with thousands of public, private, and parochial schools throughout the United States to offer distance learning courses to students who have fallen behind in credits, or are working at a faster rate. The credits for these correspondence courses are then transferred to the student's high school.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Distance_education","surface_form":"distance education","offset":66},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":85},{"uri":"Lansing%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Lansing, Illinois","offset":100},{"uri":"High_school_diploma","surface_form":"high school diploma","offset":235},{"uri":"Hyde_Park%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Hyde Park, Chicago","offset":278},{"uri":"General_Educational_Development","surface_form":"GED","offset":473}]}
