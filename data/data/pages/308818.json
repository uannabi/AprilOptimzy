{"id":308818,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokesperson","text":"A spokesman (spokesperson or spokeswoman), or spokesmodel is a person who speaks on behalf of others, but is understood not to be necessarily part of the others (e.g. hired to represent the others).\nA spokesperson's job is to faithfully (with good intentions) represent and promote for how the organization will run, even if he/she doesn't agree with the organization's opinions. Because of this, spokespeople are normally people who are highly experienced employees, or people who have been supporting the organization's goals for a long time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
