{"id":308830,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Music%2C_Inc.","text":"e=\"preserve\">Broadcast Music Incorporated or BMI is an organization to protect music rights in the communications business. It was founded by ASCAP, who were boycotting radio at the time (1944). Both BMI and ASCAP, as well as other organizations like SESAC monitor performances of the music to which they control the rights. BMI has historically been more open to composers of rock and roll, jazz, folk music, blues, and country music who sing and play their own music.\nIn 2013, BMI made $944 million and gave $814 million to its songwriters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":79},{"uri":"ASCAP","surface_form":"ASCAP","offset":142},{"uri":"Boycott","surface_form":"boycott","offset":158},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":169},{"uri":"SESAC","surface_form":"SESAC","offset":251},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":377},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":392},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":398},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":410},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":421},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":530}]}
