{"id":308926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapodomorph","text":"Tetrapodomorpha is a clade of vertebrates. It is a clade of the Sarcopterygii which includes tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest relatives. Tetrapodomorpha is part of Rhipidistia.\nAdvanced transitional fossils between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, like \"Tiktaalik\", are informally called 'fishapods' by their discoverers. They are half-fish half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology.\nAmong the characters defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint).\nTetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include \"Eusthenopteron\", \"Osteolepis\", \"Panderichthys\", \"Tiktaalik\", \"Ventastega\" and \"Kenichthys\".\nThe fossils of the early Mississippian, \"Pederpes\" and \"Whatcheeria\" are regarded as early tetrapods whose relationships are not yet clear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":21},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":30},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":51},{"uri":"Sarcopterygii","surface_form":"Sarcopterygii","offset":64},{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"tetrapod","offset":93},{"uri":"Rhipidistia","surface_form":"Rhipidistia","offset":185},{"uri":"Transitional_fossil","surface_form":"transitional fossil","offset":207},{"uri":"Labyrinthodont","surface_form":"labyrinthodont","offset":255},{"uri":"Tiktaalik","surface_form":"Tiktaalik","offset":278},{"uri":"Informal","surface_form":"informally","offset":294},{"uri":"Fishapod","surface_form":"fishapod","offset":313},{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"tetrapod","offset":370},{"uri":"Humerus","surface_form":"humerus","offset":503},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":583},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":648},{"uri":"Eusthenopteron","surface_form":"Eusthenopteron","offset":679},{"uri":"Osteolepis","surface_form":"Osteolepis","offset":697},{"uri":"Panderichthys","surface_form":"Panderichthys","offset":711},{"uri":"Tiktaalik","surface_form":"Tiktaalik","offset":728},{"uri":"Ventastega","surface_form":"Ventastega","offset":741},{"uri":"Kenichthys","surface_form":"Kenichthys","offset":758},{"uri":"Mississippian","surface_form":"Mississippian","offset":796},{"uri":"Pederpes","surface_form":"Pederpes","offset":812},{"uri":"Whatcheeria","surface_form":"Whatcheeria","offset":827},{"uri":"Tetrapod","surface_form":"tetrapod","offset":862}]}
