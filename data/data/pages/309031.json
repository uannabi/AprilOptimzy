This is a taxon above the level of phylum, and is not part of the usual system of classification.\nCavalier-Smith included here the Platyhelminthes (flatworms), and a new phylum Acanthognatha, into which he gathered several previously described phyla of microscopic animals. Subsequent studies have supported Platyzoa as a viable clade, while differing on the phyla included and on relationships within Platyzoa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protostome","surface_form":"protostomes","offset":45},{"uri":"Taxon","surface_form":"taxon","offset":110},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":135},{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":182},{"uri":"Platyhelminthes","surface_form":"Platyhelminthes","offset":231},{"uri":"Flatworm","surface_form":"flatworm","offset":248},{"uri":"Acanthognatha","surface_form":"Acanthognatha","offset":277}]}
