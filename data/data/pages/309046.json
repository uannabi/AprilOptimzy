{"id":309046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sociolinguistics is the study of how language is related to society. It also studies how people affect language usage. Sociolinguistics studies how variety in language changes between groups of people because of things such as race, gender, status, age, etc.\nIndian and Japanese linguists first studied the social parts of language in the 1930s. Louis Gauchat in Switzerland also studied this in the early 1900s. However, none of them were known in the West until much later. The study of why language change<nowiki/>s started during the late 1900's in the wave model. Thomas Callan Hodson was the first person to us the word \"sociolinguistics\". It was in an article he wrote in 1939 called \"Sociolinguistics in India\". This was printed in a magazine called \"Man in India\". Sociolinguistics in the West first came in the 1960s. It was pushed forward by linguists such as William Labov (in the US) and Basil Bernstein (in the UK). In the 1960s, William Stewart and Heinz Kloss introduced the simple ideas for the concept of pluricentric languages. This explains how standard language varieties are different between countries (e.g. American/British/Canadian/Australian \"English\"; Austrian/German/Swiss \"German\"; Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian \"Serbo-Croatian\").\nApplications of sociolinguistics.\nFor example, a sociolinguist might research how a particular variety of language (vernacular) would not be considered correct in a business place. Sociolinguists might also study the grammar, phonetics, and vocabulary of this sociolect. Similarly, dialectologists would study the same things for a regional dialect.\nThe study of language variation focuses on how language changes with social pressure and when in a specific environment. Code-switching is a word used to explain the language changes in new environments.\nWilliam Labov is often thought of as the most important person who studies sociolinguistics. He is especially known for introducing a way to measure language variation and change. This made the study of language into a scientific area of study.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":50},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":73},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":240},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":246},{"uri":"Social_status","surface_form":"status","offset":254},{"uri":"Ageing","surface_form":"age","offset":262},{"uri":"Language_change","surface_form":"language change","offset":506},{"uri":"Thomas_Callan_Hodson","surface_form":"Thomas Callan Hodson","offset":582},{"uri":"William_Labov","surface_form":"William Labov","offset":884},{"uri":"Basil_Bernstein","surface_form":"Basil Bernstein","offset":914},{"uri":"William_Alexander_Stewart","surface_form":"William Stewart","offset":957},{"uri":"Heinz_Kloss","surface_form":"Heinz Kloss","offset":977},{"uri":"Pluricentric_language","surface_form":"pluricentric languages","offset":1036},{"uri":"Standard_language","surface_form":"standard language","offset":1078},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American","offset":1144},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British","offset":1153},{"uri":"Canadian_English","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":1161},{"uri":"Australian_English","surface_form":"Australian","offset":1170},{"uri":"Austrian_Standard_German","surface_form":"Austrian","offset":1192},{"uri":"Standard_German","surface_form":"German","offset":1201},{"uri":"Swiss_Standard_German","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":1208},{"uri":"Bosnian_language","surface_form":"Bosnian","offset":1224},{"uri":"Croatian_language","surface_form":"Croatian","offset":1232},{"uri":"Montenegrin_language","surface_form":"Montenegrin","offset":1241},{"uri":"Serbian_language","surface_form":"Serbian","offset":1253},{"uri":"Serbo-Croatian","surface_form":"Serbo-Croatian","offset":1262},{"uri":"Vernacular","surface_form":"vernacular","offset":1396},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":1497},{"uri":"Phonetics","surface_form":"phonetics","offset":1506},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":1521},{"uri":"Dialectology","surface_form":"dialectologists","offset":1562},{"uri":"Regional_dialect","surface_form":"regional dialect","offset":1612},{"uri":"Variation_(linguistics)","surface_form":"variation","offset":1652},{"uri":"Social_environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":1738},{"uri":"Code-switching","surface_form":"Code-switching","offset":1751}]}
