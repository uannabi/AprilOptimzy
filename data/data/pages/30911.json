{"id":30911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush","text":"The Klondike Gold Rush happened in the 1890s when many people went to the Klondike region of the Yukon, in Canada. They hoped to find gold there and become rich. Many of these prospectors came from the United States. Gold was first found in Klondike in a creek called Rabbit Creek. Prospectors named the creek \"Bonanza Creek\" because of the gold (\"bonanza \"means a lucky source of wealth).\nThe city that probably profited most from the Klondike Gold Rush was Dawson City, Yukon in Canada. Four million dollars worth of gold was found there.\nHowever, not that much gold was found in Klondike overall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Klondike","surface_form":"Klondike","offset":74},{"uri":"Yukon","surface_form":"Yukon","offset":97},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":107},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":134},{"uri":"Prospecting","surface_form":"prospectors","offset":176},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":202},{"uri":"Dawson_City%2C_Yukon","surface_form":"Dawson City, Yukon","offset":459}]}
