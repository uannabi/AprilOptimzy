It belongs to animals of several related phyla, in the superphylum Lophotrochozoa.\nThey have two or more bands of cilia. By moving their cilia rapidly, a water eddy is created. In this way they control the direction of their movement. Also, in this way they bring their food closer, to capture it more easily.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":27},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":42},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":49},{"uri":"Phyla","surface_form":"phyla","offset":100},{"uri":"Lophotrochozoa","surface_form":"Lophotrochozoa","offset":126},{"uri":"Cilia","surface_form":"cilia","offset":173}]}
