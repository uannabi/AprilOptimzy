The song peaked at number eight on the US Hot Latin Tracks. \"Baila Esta Cumbia\" () was the lead single from \"Ven Conmigo\" (1990). The song peaked at number 20 on the Hot Latin Tracks. The song \"Buenos Amigos\" () was a duet with Salvadoran singer Alvaro Torres. The song peaked at number-one on the Hot Latin Tracks. It became Selena's and Torres' first number-one single.

The song peaked at number seven on the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay chart. \"Como La Flor\" () became one of Selena's signature songs. The song peaked at number-one on the Hot Latin Tracks.
