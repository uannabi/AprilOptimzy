They join to form a kind of community based on a similar focus on an information-based project.\nThe community group can be made of people with a range of special interests.\nThe shared explanations for how the community functions includes \"the appalling silence of good people\", which encourages the growth of perverse incentives.\nAn example of a scientific epistemic community is the 1975 Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP). This is a marine pollution control regime for the Mediterranean Sea developed by the United Nations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":31},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":166},{"uri":"Perverse_incentive","surface_form":"perverse incentive","offset":577},{"uri":"Pollution_control","surface_form":"pollution control","offset":707},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":740},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":775}]}
