Two of the club's previous managers have gone on to manage the England national football team, and one has gone on to manage the Scotland national football team. A notable previous manager is Roy Keane, a legend for Ireland and Manchester United.\nHistory.\nIpswich Town F.C. was started as an amateur team in 1878 and was called \"Ipswich A.F.C.\" The club played a lot of games in the local area and won several cup competitions. In 1936, they became a professional club and joined a league called the \"Southern League\" which they won in their first season. In 1938, they were elected to join The Football League and played in \"Division Three (South)\" until the end of the 1954 season, when they were promoted to \"Division Two\".\nIn 1961, Ipswich Town won their division and were promoted to the highest level of English football, \"Division One\". The club went on to win this division the next season. This let them play in European football competition, The European Cup the following season. Two years later,they were sent back to \"Division Two\" where they stayed for four years before being promoted to \"Division One\" again, in 1968. Soon after, Bobby Robson became the manager of the club and led them to success in both English and European football. In 1978 Ipswich won the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium, beating Arsenal F.C. 1\u20130. Further success came in 1981 when Ipswich defeated Dutch team AZ Alkmaar.\nBobby Robson was asked to become manager of the England national football team in 1982 so he left the club. Ipswich did not do well in the following seasons and were relegated to \"Division Two\" in 1986. They remained here until 1993 when they won the division and promotion into the new English Premier League. Two poor seasons followed, including a 9\u20130 defeat by Manchester United, still the biggest defeat in Premier League history. In 1995 Ipswich were relegated once again and stayed in second division of English football until they were promoted in 2000 after they beat Barnsley in the play-offs at Wembley 4\u20132.\nIn their first season in the Premier League, Ipswich finished fifth; This meant they qualified to play in the UEFA Cup the next season. Although the club played well in the European competition, they were poor in the Premier League. They finished bottom and were relegated to Division One, now called Football League Championship. Ipswich were relegated to League 1 after the 18/19 season, finishing bottom of the championship.\nColours and crest.\nOne of Ipswich Town's nicknames is \"The Blues\". This is because the traditional kit the players wear is usually mostly blue. When Ipswich play against other teams who also wear blue, they change to an alternative kit, sometimes called an \"away\" kit. The \"away\" kit has been different colours including orange, white, red and black vertical stripes and, as of 2009, plain red.\nThe crest which is on the shirts and shorts of the kit shows a horse, with one hoof resting on a football. Underneath the horse is a river\u2014this represents the River Orwell which flows through the town.\nStadium.\nIpswich Town play their home games at a stadium called Portman Road. The club started playing games here in 1884. The stadium can hold over 30,000 people.

The stadium has also been used for events other than sports. It has been used for concerts by Elton John, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Rod Stewart.\nSupporters.\nLocal fans call the team \"Town\" because it is a shortened version of the team name. Some people also call Ipswich the \"Tractor Boys\". This nickname is used a lot by newspapers. Many Ipswich fans use this name as a joke rather than letting it be an insult.\nThe main rival of Ipswich Town is Norwich City who are based in Norfolk. When these two teams play, the game is called the \"East Anglian derby\". The derby is usually referred to as the 'Old Farm' derby, a take on the 'Old Firm' derby played in Scotland between Glasgow Celtic and Glasgow Rangers (now 'The Rangers').\nRecords.\nMick Mills holds the record for Ipswich league appearances.
