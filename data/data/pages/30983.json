In a broader definition it can also be the belief in God or gods in general, including all types of god-belief. Polytheism is the belief in several gods, while monotheism is the belief in just one god. For example, a theistic religion is Christianity. The opposite to a theist is an atheist. An atheist is a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.\nDifferent theisms.\nGnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism. For example, it is possible to be an agnostic atheist, or a gnostic theist. In common usage, some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism \u2014 absence of clear belief in any deity.\nThis is another way to group different theisms, based on the nature of the gods.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":27},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":37},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"god","offset":62},{"uri":"Polytheism","surface_form":"polytheistic","offset":120},{"uri":"Polytheism","surface_form":"Polytheism","offset":264},{"uri":"Monotheism","surface_form":"monotheism","offset":312},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":390},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheist","offset":435},{"uri":"Nontheism","surface_form":"nontheism","offset":790}]}
