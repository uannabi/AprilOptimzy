It is called Midland, because it is the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth and El Paso. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy.\nMidland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":13},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":25},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":34},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":43},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":132},{"uri":"Fort_Worth%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Fort Worth","offset":139},{"uri":"El_Paso%2C_Texas","surface_form":"El Paso","offset":154},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"Oil","offset":163},{"uri":"1923","surface_form":"1923","offset":199},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":238},{"uri":"First_Lady_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"First Lady","offset":296},{"uri":"Barbara_Bush","surface_form":"Barbara Walker Bush","offset":307},{"uri":"George_H._W._Bush","surface_form":"George H.
