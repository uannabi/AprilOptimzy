{"id":309894,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Steinman","text":"Ralph Marvin Steinman (January 14, 1943 \u2013 September 30, 2011) was a Canadian immunologist and cell biologist at Rockefeller University. He studied a kind of cell in the immune system and called them \"dendritic cells\". He made these discoveries while working in the laboratory of Zanvil A. Cohn. He was of Jewish descent.\nOn October 3, 2011, the Nobel Committee announced that Steinman had received one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for \"his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity\". The other half went to Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann, for \"their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity\". However, the committee did not know that Steinman had died three days earlier, on September 30, from pancreatic cancer. The committee considered what to do about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.\nThe committee later decided that, as the decision to award the prize \"was made in good faith\", they would not change the award.\nSteinman's daughter said that he had joked the previous week with his family about hanging on until the prize announcement. Steinman said: \"I know I have got to hold out for that. They don't give it to you if you have passed away. I got to hold out for that\".\nSteinman had received numerous other awards and recognitions for his life-long work on dendritic cells, such as the Albert Lasker Award (2007), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (2003), and the Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award (1998). In addition, he was made a member of Institute of Medicine (U.S.A.; elected 2002) and the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.; elected 2001).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":68},{"uri":"Immunology","surface_form":"immunologist","offset":77},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cell biologist","offset":94},{"uri":"Rockefeller_University","surface_form":"Rockefeller University","offset":112},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":157},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":169},{"uri":"Dendritic_cell","surface_form":"dendritic cell","offset":200},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":265},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":305},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Committee","offset":345},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":414},{"uri":"Adaptive_immunity","surface_form":"adaptive immunity","offset":510},{"uri":"Bruce_Beutler","surface_form":"Bruce Beutler","offset":553},{"uri":"Jules_Hoffmann","surface_form":"Jules Hoffmann","offset":571},{"uri":"Innate_immunity","surface_form":"innate immunity","offset":639},{"uri":"Pancreas","surface_form":"pancreatic","offset":758},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":769},{"uri":"Posthumously","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":885},{"uri":"Albert_Lasker_Award","surface_form":"Albert Lasker Award","offset":1403},{"uri":"United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":1638}]}
