The most important thing is that the factoid is widely believed.\nA factoid refers to something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact.\nThe term can also be used to describe partial information without context.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norman_Mailer","surface_form":"Norman Mailer","offset":211}]}
