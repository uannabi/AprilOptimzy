{"id":31048,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man","text":"\"Pac-Man\" is an arcade video game that was made by Namco and designed by Toru Iwatani. It was released in 1980, and became very popular in the history of games.\nIn \"Pac-Man\", the player makes a Pac-Man, a yellow disc, move around a maze. The goal is to eat every yellow pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters. For extra points, fruits that appear can also be eaten. When Pac-Man eats a big pellet, the ghosts turn blue and can be eaten. Even though the game has 256 stages, the last level can not be finished due to a problem with the creation of the game.\nThe game is called \"Puck Man\" in Japan. The game was named \"Pac-Man\" in the United States so that nobody could change the \"P\" to \"F\". There were many sequels and remakes based on the game. Hanna-Barbera made a animated TV show airing on ABC in the early 1970s. The game was also part of \"Namco Museum\" games. There is a \"Namco Museum Remix\" for the Wii.\nPac-Man was one of the first games to have Cutscene<nowiki/>s. It has 3 cutscenes in total.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_arcade","surface_form":"arcade","offset":16},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":23},{"uri":"Namco","surface_form":"Namco","offset":51},{"uri":"Toru_Iwatani","surface_form":"Toru Iwatani","offset":73},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":106},{"uri":"Player","surface_form":"player","offset":179},{"uri":"Pac-Man_(character)","surface_form":"Pac-Man","offset":194},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":205},{"uri":"Disc","surface_form":"disc","offset":212},{"uri":"Maze","surface_form":"maze","offset":232},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":263},{"uri":"Pellet","surface_form":"pellet","offset":270},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":278},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":319},{"uri":"Monster","surface_form":"monster","offset":326},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":354},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":440},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":616},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":659},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":733},{"uri":"Remake","surface_form":"remake","offset":745},{"uri":"Hanna-Barbera","surface_form":"Hanna-Barbera","offset":772},{"uri":"Pac-Man_(TV_series)","surface_form":"animated TV show","offset":793},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":820},{"uri":"Namco_Museum_Remix","surface_form":"Namco Museum Remix","offset":904},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":932},{"uri":"Cutscene","surface_form":"Cutscene","offset":980}]}
