{"id":310668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Suiko","text":"(554\u2013628) was the 33rd Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Her reign started in 593 and ended in 628. Historians consider details about the life of Empress Suiko to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Suiko\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for her posthumously by later generations.\nThe conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nIn the history of Japan, Suiko was the first of eight women to be empress. The seven others were: (a) Saimei, (b) Jit\u014D, (c) Gemmei, (d) Gensh\u014D, (e) Sh\u014Dtoku, (f) Meish\u014D, and (g) Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional history.\nSuiko was the third daughter of Emperor Kimmei. She was the half-sister of Emperor Y\u014Dmei and Emperor Sushun.\nSuiko was also a wife of Emperor Bidatsu.\nEvents of Suiko's life.\nWhen Suiko became empress, she ended a power struggle for the throne after the deaths of emperors who were her brothers.\nPrince Sh\u014Dtoku was the most important man in Suko's court.\nIn 599, an earthquake destroyed buildings in Yamato province which is now known as Nara Prefecture.\nThe reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the Sui court in 600.\nThe use of the Sexegenary cycle calendar (\"Jikkan J\u016Bnishi\") in Japan is credited to Empress Suiko in 604.\nSuiko ruled for 35 years. She abdicated in 628.\nAfter her death.\nSuiko died in 628. This empress' official name after her death (her posthumous name) was regularized only after death. Her reign name means \"to reason from antiquity.\"\nThe actual site of Suiko's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Osaka.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suiko's mausoleum. It is formally named \"Shinaga no Yamada no misasagi\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Emperor of Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"order of succession","offset":70},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":95},{"uri":"Possible","surface_form":"possibly","offset":200},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":209},{"uri":"Probable","surface_form":"probable","offset":224},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":261},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":277},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":299},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":316},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":396},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":442},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":474},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":489},{"uri":"History_of_Japan","surface_form":"history of Japan","offset":512},{"uri":"Empress_K%C5%8Dgyoku","surface_form":"Saimei","offset":607},{"uri":"Empress_Jit%C5%8D","surface_form":"Jit\u014D","offset":619},{"uri":"Empress_Gemmei","surface_form":"Gemmei","offset":629},{"uri":"Empress_Gensh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gensh\u014D","offset":641},{"uri":"Empress_K%C5%8Dken","surface_form":"Sh\u014Dtoku","offset":653},{"uri":"Empress_Meish%C5%8D","surface_form":"Meish\u014D","offset":666},{"uri":"Empress_Go-Sakuramachi","surface_form":"Go-Sakuramachi","offset":682},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":751},{"uri":"Emperor_Yomei","surface_form":"Emperor Y\u014Dmei","offset":794},{"uri":"Emperor_Sushun","surface_form":"Emperor Sushun","offset":812},{"uri":"Emperor_Bidatsu","surface_form":"Emperor Bidatsu","offset":853},{"uri":"Prince_Sh%C5%8Dtoku","surface_form":"Prince Sh\u014Dtoku","offset":1015},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1085},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":1119},{"uri":"Nara_Prefecture","surface_form":"Nara Prefecture","offset":1157},{"uri":"Sui_Dynasty","surface_form":"Sui","offset":1248},{"uri":"Sexegenary_cycle","surface_form":"Sexegenary cycle","offset":1281},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1505},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1526},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1632},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1678},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1693},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1702},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1709},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1743},{"uri":"Mausoleum","surface_form":"mausoleum","offset":1805}]}
