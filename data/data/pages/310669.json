It owns many different companies. It owns several companies completely, and holds large portions of other companies. It has 27,000 shareholders, and Bill Gates is one of the company's directors.\nIt takes its name from a textile mill that was started in 1839, bought by Buffett in 1964, and closed in 1985.\nSince Berkshire Hathaway's stock has gained a lot of value and never split, a single share of \"A stock\" is now worth over $250,000. Because of this, there is a \"B\" stock that sells for a small fraction of the \"A stock\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Warren_Buffett","surface_form":"Warren Buffett","offset":88},{"uri":"Shareholder","surface_form":"shareholder","offset":235},{"uri":"Bill_Gates","surface_form":"Bill Gates","offset":253},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"stock","offset":437}]}
