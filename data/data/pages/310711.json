TBS is well known for its broadcasts of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team and various National Basketball Association games. TBS also shows reruns of popular network television shows from the past.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists library.\nDuring the 1980s, WTBS focused heavily on movies \u2013 running two films during the day, and a movie-exclusive schedule during the nighttime hours after 8:00\u00A0p.m., with the exception of sports events. At other times, WTBS continued to run mostly classic sitcoms, and vintage cartoons. In 1986, when Ted Turner purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists (which he would sell back to previous owner Kirk Kerkorian that October due to debt incurred by the Turner Broadcasting System from its purchase of the film studio), WTBS gained the rights to the entire MGM film library (including certain acquisitions by MGM). This gave WTBS the rights to air many theatrical cartoon shorts such as \"Tom & Jerry\", \"Barney Bear\", \"Tex Avery\", and \"The Pink Panther\", as well as shows like \"Gilligan's Island\" and \"CHiPs\".\nAlong with \"Tom & Jerry\", WTBS began to run \"The Little Rascals\", \"Looney Tunes\"/\"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons released prior to August 1948, theatrical \"Popeye\" cartoon shorts, and \"Three Stooges\" shorts under the banner \"Tom & Jerry and Friends\" running for either one hour or 90 minutes during the morning hours and for an hour in the afternoon from 1986 until the mid-1990s. In the late 1980s, WTBS decreased the number of movies broadcast during the day slightly and began to add sitcoms from the 1970s (such as \"Happy Days\", \"The Jeffersons\", \"Good Times\" and \"One Day at a Time\") to the evening lineup; \"Little House on the Prairie\" aired during the late mornings continuously from 1986 to 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable TV","offset":48},{"uri":"Atlanta_Braves","surface_form":"Atlanta Braves","offset":152},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":167},{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"National Basketball Association","offset":206},{"uri":"Network_television","surface_form":"network television","offset":278},{"uri":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","surface_form":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","offset":678},{"uri":"United_Artists","surface_form":"United Artists","offset":698},{"uri":"Kirk_Kerkorian","surface_form":"Kirk Kerkorian","offset":757},{"uri":"Film_studio","surface_form":"film studio","offset":865},{"uri":"Tom_%26amp%3B_Jerry","surface_form":"Tom & Jerry","offset":1047},{"uri":"Barney_Bear","surface_form":"Barney Bear","offset":1062},{"uri":"Tex_Avery","surface_form":"Tex Avery","offset":1077},{"uri":"The_Pink_Panther","surface_form":"The Pink Panther","offset":1094},{"uri":"Gilligan%27s_Island","surface_form":"Gilligan's Island","offset":1136},{"uri":"CHiPs","surface_form":"CHiPs","offset":1160},{"uri":"Looney_Tunes","surface_form":"Looney Tunes","offset":1235},{"uri":"Merrie_Melodies","surface_form":"Merrie Melodies","offset":1250},{"uri":"Happy_Days","surface_form":"Happy Days","offset":1683},{"uri":"The_Jeffersons","surface_form":"The Jeffersons","offset":1697},{"uri":"Good_Times","surface_form":"Good Times","offset":1715},{"uri":"One_Day_at_a_Time","surface_form":"One Day at a Time","offset":1732},{"uri":"Little_House_(book_series)","surface_form":"Little House on the Prairie","offset":1776}]}
