According to Squidward, he was a frycook at the Krusty Krab many years ago. When he was making Krabby Patties, he accidentally cut off his own hand, and later replaced it with a rusty spatula. He was run over by a bus, and fired at his funeral. Every Tuesday night, his ghost comes to the place and haunts it.\nLater that night, everything that Squidward says actually happens. He and SpongeBob are really scared, until they find out that the so-called hash-slinging slasher is actually a person who wants a job application, and hung up on the phone because he was nervous.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SpongeBob_SquarePants","surface_form":"SpongeBob SquarePants","offset":61},{"uri":"Profit","surface_form":"profit","offset":465}]}
