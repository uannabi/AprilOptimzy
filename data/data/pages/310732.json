{"id":310732,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinomial_nomenclature","text":"=\"preserve\">In biology, trinomial nomenclature is used to name living things at a rank lower than species. The term \"trinomial nomenclature\" means \"three-part name\" or \"system of three-part names\".\nIf living things r than species get a scientific name, each name has three parts. The first part indicates the genus, the second part indicates the species, and the third part is particular to the living thing (at whatever rank it has been assigned).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":15},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":309},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":346}]}
