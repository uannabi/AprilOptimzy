{"id":31075,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence","text":"Domestic violence means that in a relationship or marriage, one or both of the partners uses physical, sexual or psychological violence to try to get power or control over the other or due to losing their temper. Domestic violence can occur in heterosexual and same-sex relationships. There is often a predictable pattern or cycle of violence in a relationship and the abuse tends to get worse over time. Domestic violence can be also a factor to be homeless, as pointed out by Principles 15 of the Yogyakarta Principles.\nIn any culture or community, there are beliefs and attitudes that support domestic violence and beliefs and attitudes that do not support domestic violence. In most countries, laws exist to protect the victim of such violent acts. There are also organisations that can help in such situations.\nDomestic violence sometimes does not get reported to the police. Estimates say that only a third of domestic violence cases (or even less) get reported to the authorities.\nMany people who use violence against their partners have mental disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":34},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":50},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychological","offset":113},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":127},{"uri":"Homelessness","surface_form":"homeless","offset":450},{"uri":"Yogyakarta_Principles","surface_form":"Yogyakarta Principles","offset":499},{"uri":"Victim","surface_form":"victim","offset":724},{"uri":"Mental_disorder","surface_form":"mental disorder","offset":1045},{"uri":"Antisocial_personality_disorder","surface_form":"antisocial personality disorder","offset":1074},{"uri":"Borderline_personality_disorder","surface_form":"borderline personality disorder","offset":1110}]}
