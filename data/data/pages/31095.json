{"id":31095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor","text":"e=\"preserve\">The mayor is a person who is in charge of the administration of a city. Some mayors are elected by the people who live in that city. For other cities, a central government body may choose the mayor. Some large cities have a Lord Mayor.\nIn federal countries like Germany the mayor can also be head of the government of a city state. The Mayor of Hamburg runs the government just like the Minister President of Bavaria runs the Bavarian government. In some big cities such as Tokyo the Mayor is a Governor.\nIn many countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, the mayor is not in charge of the daily functions of a city or town. That job is done by a Town Clerk or Chief Executive, who is appointed to a full-time paid job. The mayor works part-time, usually without payment, and represents the city at events and civic functions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":28},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administration","offset":59},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":79},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":101},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":140},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":174},{"uri":"Lord_Mayor","surface_form":"Lord Mayor","offset":237},{"uri":"Federal_republic","surface_form":"federal","offset":252},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":275},{"uri":"City_state","surface_form":"city state","offset":333},{"uri":"Mayor_of_Hamburg","surface_form":"Mayor of Hamburg","offset":349},{"uri":"Minister_President","surface_form":"Minister President","offset":400},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":422},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":487},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"Governor","offset":508},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":549},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":568}]}
