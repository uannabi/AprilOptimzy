{"id":311017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciadopitys","text":"\"Sciadopitys\", the Japanese umbrella-pine, is a unique conifer. It is endemic to Japan, and the sole surviving member of the family Sciadopityaceae. It is a living fossil with no close relatives: its fossils date from 230 million years ago.\nIt is an evergreen tree that can grow 15-27m tall. Its brown main shoots have whorls of 7\u201312\u00A0cm long flexible green \"cladodes\". These look like, and perform the function of, leaves but are actually composed of stem tissue. Occasionally, a cladode will fork and produce a bud in the 'v' of the fork, just like a normal stem.\nThe cones are 6\u201311\u00A0cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the seeds.\nIt is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate and high cost. Koyamaki was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for Prince Hisahito of Akishino, currently third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.\nThe plant was first introduced to Europe by John Gould Veitch in September 1860.\nInfrared microspectroscopy has identified conifers of the family Sciadopityaceae as the principal source of Baltic amber.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":55},{"uri":"Endemic","surface_form":"endemic","offset":70},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":81},{"uri":"Living_fossil","surface_form":"living fossil","offset":157},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":250},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":260},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":415},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":451},{"uri":"Bud","surface_form":"bud","offset":512},{"uri":"Conifer_cone","surface_form":"cones","offset":569},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":670},{"uri":"Mon_(badge)","surface_form":"Japanese Imperial crest","offset":804},{"uri":"Prince_Hisahito_of_Akishino","surface_form":"Prince Hisahito of Akishino","offset":832},{"uri":"Chrysanthemum_Throne","surface_form":"Chrysanthemum Throne","offset":892},{"uri":"John_Gould_Veitch","surface_form":"John Gould Veitch","offset":958},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"Infrared","offset":995},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopy","offset":1009},{"uri":"Baltic_amber","surface_form":"Baltic amber","offset":1103}]}
