{"id":311022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_machine_gun","text":"A general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) is a machine gun which gets its ammunition from a belt. It can be used in many different roles: it can support infantry from a bipod or tripod or be put onto a helicopter or armoured vehicle. It can provide fire support for vehicles or infantry from a variety of mounts.\nA general-purpose machine gun is generally a medium machine gun. It also fires rifle cartridges like the 7.62\u00D751mm NATO or 7.92x57mm Mauser. It is usually used from a bipod, tripod or on a vehicle. This is because it is usually too powerful and heavy to be fired well on foot or while moving.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":42},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":69},{"uri":"Belt_(firearms)","surface_form":"belt","offset":87},{"uri":"Bipod","surface_form":"bipod","offset":164},{"uri":"Tripod","surface_form":"tripod","offset":173},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":197},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":220},{"uri":"Medium_machine_gun","surface_form":"medium machine gun","offset":353},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"cartridge","offset":393},{"uri":"7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO","surface_form":"7.62\u00D751mm NATO","offset":413},{"uri":"8x57mm_IS","surface_form":"7.92x57mm Mauser","offset":431},{"uri":"Bipod","surface_form":"bipod","offset":475},{"uri":"Tripod","surface_form":"tripod","offset":482}]}
