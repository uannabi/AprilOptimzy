{"id":311033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphyla","text":"Symphyla are soil-dwelling arthropods in the subphylum Myriapoda.\nThey are relatives of centipedes. Symphylans look like centipedes, but are smaller and translucent. They move through the pores between soil particles. They are found from the surface down to a depth of about 50 cm. They eat decaying vegetation, and can do harm in agriculture by eating seeds, roots, and root hairs in cultivated soil.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":13},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":27},{"uri":"Subphylum","surface_form":"subphylum","offset":45},{"uri":"Myriapoda","surface_form":"Myriapoda","offset":55},{"uri":"Centipede","surface_form":"centipede","offset":88},{"uri":"Centipede","surface_form":"centipede","offset":121},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":202},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":331},{"uri":"Root_hair","surface_form":"root hair","offset":371}]}
