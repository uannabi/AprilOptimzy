{"id":311077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Pentridge","text":"HM Prison Pentridge was an Australian prison built in 1850 in Coburg, Victoria. The first prisoners arrived in 1851. The prison was closed on 1 May 1997.\nPentridge was often known by the nicknames \"The Bluestone College\", \"Coburg College\" or the \"College of Knowledge\". The grounds were originally landscaped by renowned landscape gardener Hugh Linaker. Since closing, much of the prison has been pulled down to make way for a housing development. Large buildings have been built and a 16 floor modern apartment block is being planned.\nThe northern section of the prison being developed by Valad Property Group and the other areas by Pentridge Village. The National Trust does not like the development plans approved by Heritage Victoria. These plans include taking down sections of the outside walls and building apartments between the historic prison buildings.\nDivisions.\nThe prison was split into many divisions, named using letters of the alphabet.\nJika Jika high security unit.\nJika Jika, opened in 1980 at a cost of AU$7 million. It was a 'gaol within a gaol', designed to hold Victoria's toughest and longest serving prisoners. It was awarded the 'Excellence in Concrete Award' by the Concrete Institute of Australia. It was closed after the deaths of five prisoners in 1987.\nJika Jika had six separate units each at the end of radiating spines. It had electronic doors, closed-circuit television and remote locking. This meant it could use less staff but still have maximum security. The furnishings were sparse and prisoners exercised in escape proof yards.\nIn 1983 four prisoners escaped from \u2018escape proof\u2019 Jika Jika. When two prison officers were disciplined in relation to the Jika Jika escape a week-long strike occurred.\n1987 Jika Jika prison fire.\nInmates Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris - from one side of the unit - and Craig 'Slim' Minogue and three other inmates on the other side sealed off their section doors with a tennis net. Mattresses and other bedding were then stacked against the doors and set on fire. They covered windows in the day room with paper so the prison officers could not see which prisoners caused the damage.\nPrisoners Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris died in the fire. Convicted Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue and three other inmates survived as they were evacuated when the fire started.\nGrave sites.\nThe graves of executed prisoners were unmarked in a corner of the prison. In 1929, 32 bodies were moved from the Melbourne Gaol during the building of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. These graves were found in 2008. The skeleton of bushranger Ned Kelly was among those discovered.\nExecutions.\nThere were 11 executions at Pentridge. The gallows beam and the trapdoor were moved from the Melbourne Gaol and put into \"D\" Division in 1924.\nWhen the gaol was closed, the beam and the trapdoor were taken back to the Melbourne Gaol to be part of its historical display.\nLast execution.\nRonald Ryan was the last man executed at Pentridge Prison and in Australia. Ryan was hanged in \"D\" Division at 8.00 on 3 February 1967. He had been convicted of murdering a prison officer during an escape from the same prison. Later that day, Ryan's body was buried in an unmarked grave within the \"D\" Division. There is still debate about his hanging.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":27},{"uri":"Coburg%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Coburg","offset":62},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":70},{"uri":"National_Trust_of_Victoria","surface_form":"National Trust","offset":657},{"uri":"Heritage_Victoria","surface_form":"Heritage Victoria","offset":720},{"uri":"AU%24","surface_form":"AU$","offset":1023},{"uri":"Closed-circuit_television","surface_form":"closed-circuit television","offset":1379},{"uri":"Craig_Minogue","surface_form":"Craig 'Slim' Minogue","offset":1888},{"uri":"Russell_Street_Bombing","surface_form":"Russell Street bomber","offset":2322},{"uri":"Craig_Minogue","surface_form":"Craig Minogue","offset":2344},{"uri":"Old_Melbourne_Gaol","surface_form":"Melbourne Gaol","offset":2563},{"uri":"Royal_Melbourne_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology","offset":2605},{"uri":"Ned_Kelly","surface_form":"Ned Kelly","offset":2706},{"uri":"Ronald_Ryan","surface_form":"Ronald Ryan","offset":3043},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":3108},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":3204}]}
