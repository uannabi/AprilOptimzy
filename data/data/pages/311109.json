She was kidnapped by and later married Zephyr.\nChloris (Meliboea).\nMeliboea was one of Niobe and Amphion's fourteen children, and the only one not killed when Artemis and Apollo killed the children as revenge. Meliboea was so scared by this that she turned permanently pale.

She had a child called Mopsus, who also became a famous seer and later joined the Argonauts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":146},{"uri":"Nymph","surface_form":"Nymph","offset":300},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman","offset":359},{"uri":"Flora_(goddess)","surface_form":"Flora","offset":392},{"uri":"Zephyr","surface_form":"Zephyr","offset":438},{"uri":"Meliboea","surface_form":"Meliboea","offset":466},{"uri":"Niobe","surface_form":"Niobe","offset":486},{"uri":"Amphion","surface_form":"Amphion","offset":496},{"uri":"Artemis","surface_form":"Artemis","offset":558},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":570},{"uri":"Neleus","surface_form":"Neleus","offset":738},{"uri":"Pylos","surface_form":"Pylos","offset":765},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"seer","offset":820},{"uri":"Ampyx","surface_form":"Ampyx","offset":825},{"uri":"Elatus","surface_form":"Elatus","offset":839},{"uri":"Mopsus","surface_form":"Mopsus","offset":871},{"uri":"Argonaut","surface_form":"Argonaut","offset":930}]}
