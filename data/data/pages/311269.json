{"id":311269,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Standard_of_Scotland","text":"The Royal Standard of Scotland, (), also known as the Banner of the King of Scots, or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland, is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms. Used historically by the King of Scots, the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotland's national flag, the Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland. It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present.\nThe earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222; with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III (1249\u20131286). This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which, together with a royal banner displaying the same, was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI acceded to the thrones of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland. Since 1603, the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland; as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom. Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Sovereign and at royal residences, the Royal Standard of Scotland continues to be one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.\nNational Flag of Scotland.\nThe Flag of Scotland, also known as the Saint Andrew's Cross or more commonly The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland. The Saltire is the correct flag for everyone to fly in order to show both their loyalty and Scottish nationality. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8am until sunset, with certain exceptions; for example United Kingdom \"National Days\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["flag"],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_of_Scotland","surface_form":"King of Scots","offset":193},{"uri":"National_flag","surface_form":"national flag","offset":263},{"uri":"Flag_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Saltire","offset":282},{"uri":"Government_Act","surface_form":"Act","offset":335},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Parliament of Scotland","offset":346},{"uri":"Great_Officer_of_State","surface_form":"Great Officers of State","offset":383},{"uri":"Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"the Sovereign","offset":432},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":449},{"uri":"Royal","surface_form":"royal","offset":502},{"uri":"Lion_rampant","surface_form":"Lion rampant","offset":599},{"uri":"Alexander_II_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Alexander II","offset":649},{"uri":"Embellishment","surface_form":"embellishment","offset":691},{"uri":"Alexander_III_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Alexander III","offset":770},{"uri":"Royal_coat_of_arms_of_Scotland","surface_form":"royal coat of arms","offset":836},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Scotland","offset":870},{"uri":"Banner","surface_form":"banner","offset":919},{"uri":"Union_of_the_Crowns","surface_form":"Union of the Crowns","offset":987},{"uri":"James_I_of_England","surface_form":"James VI","offset":1021},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"Kingdom of England","offset":1060},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Ireland","offset":1083},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"arms","offset":1186},{"uri":"List_of_Scottish_monarchs","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":1223},{"uri":"List_of_British_monarchs","surface_form":"British","offset":1237},{"uri":"Royal_Standard_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Royal Standard of the United Kingdom","offset":1314},{"uri":"Flag_of_Scotland","surface_form":"flag of Scotland","offset":1681},{"uri":"Nationality","surface_form":"nationality","offset":1800},{"uri":"Scottish_Government","surface_form":"Scottish Government","offset":1852}]}
