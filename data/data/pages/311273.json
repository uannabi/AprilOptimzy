{"id":311273,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Scotland","text":"\"Flower of Scotland\" () is a Scottish song, used mostly at special occasions and sporting events. Although Scotland has no official national anthem, \"Flower of Scotland\" is one which is used, along with the older \"Scots Wha Hae\", \"Scotland the Brave\" and \"Highland Cathedral\". It was written by Roy Williamson of the folk group The Corries, and presented in 1967, and refers to the victory of the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce, over England's Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.\nEnglish.\nWhen will we see your like again\nYour wee bit hill and glen.\n2. The hills are bare now,\nAnd autumn leaves lie thick and still\nO'er land that is lost now,\n3. Those days are past now\nAnd in the past they must remain\nBut we can still rise now\nWhen will we see your like again\nYour wee bit hill and glen.\nScots.\nYour wee bit Hill an Glen,\n2.
