{"id":311275,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thistle","text":"Thistle is a group of flowering plants which have sharp prickles on around the flower and are in the Asteraceae family. The prickles often all over the plant \u2013 on the stem and flat parts of leaves. This protects the plant against herbivorous animals, stopping them from eating the plant.\nThe term thistle is sometimes taken to mean exactly those plants in the group Cynareae (synonym: Cardueae), especially the genera \"Carduus\", \"Cirsium\", and \"Onopordum\". However, plants outside this group are sometimes called thistles, and if this is done thistles would form a polyphyletic group.\nThistle is the floral emblem of Scotland.\nHeraldry.\nThe thistle has been the national emblem of Scotland since the reign of Alexander III (1249\u20131286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. It is the symbol of the Order of the Thistle, a high chivalric order of Scotland. It is found in many Scottish symbols and as the name of several Scottish football clubs. The thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, is the symbol of seven of the eight Scottish Police Forces (the exception being the Northern Constabulary). The thistle is also the emblem of Encyclop\u00E6dia Britannica, which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland. Carnegie Mellon University features the thistle in its crest.\nOrigin as a symbol of Scotland.\nAccording to a legend, an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours Cotton Thistle \"Onopordum acanthium\", perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the Spear Thistle \"Cirsium vulgare\", an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including Dwarf Thistle \"Cirsium acaule\", Musk Thistle \"Carduus nutans\", and Melancholy Thistle \"Cirsium heterophyllum\" have also been suggested.\nMedical uses.\nMaud Grieve recorded that Pliny and medieval writers had thought it could return hair to bald heads and that in the early modern period it had been believed to be a remedy for headaches, plague, canker, sores, vertigo, and jaundice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":22},{"uri":"Asteraceae","surface_form":"Asteraceae","offset":101},{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":230},{"uri":"Cynareae","surface_form":"Cynareae","offset":366},{"uri":"Carduus","surface_form":"Carduus","offset":419},{"uri":"Cirsium","surface_form":"Cirsium","offset":430},{"uri":"Onopordum","surface_form":"Onopordum","offset":445},{"uri":"Polyphyly","surface_form":"polyphyletic","offset":565},{"uri":"Emblem","surface_form":"emblem","offset":607},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":617},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":681},{"uri":"Alexander_III_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Alexander III","offset":709},{"uri":"Silver_coin","surface_form":"silver coin","offset":751},{"uri":"James_III_of_Scotland","surface_form":"James III","offset":774},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Thistle","surface_form":"Order of the Thistle","offset":817},{"uri":"Chivalric_order","surface_form":"chivalric order","offset":846},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":865},{"uri":"Scottish_symbols","surface_form":"Scottish symbols","offset":895},{"uri":"Football_in_Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish football","offset":939},{"uri":"Northern_Constabulary","surface_form":"Northern Constabulary","offset":1094},{"uri":"Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","surface_form":"Encyclop\u00E6dia Britannica","offset":1152},{"uri":"Carnegie_Mellon_University","surface_form":"Carnegie Mellon University","offset":1218},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":1327},{"uri":"Norsemen","surface_form":"Norse","offset":1347},{"uri":"Battle_of_Largs","surface_form":"Battle of Largs","offset":1658},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":1722},{"uri":"Haakon_IV","surface_form":"Haakon IV","offset":1727},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1759},{"uri":"Northern_Isles","surface_form":"Northern Isles","offset":1793},{"uri":"Hebrides","surface_form":"Hebrides","offset":1812},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Kingdom of Scotland","offset":1851},{"uri":"Onopordum_acanthium","surface_form":"Onopordum acanthium","offset":2008},{"uri":"Cirsium_vulgare","surface_form":"Cirsium vulgare","offset":2169},{"uri":"Cirsium_acaule","surface_form":"Cirsium acaule","offset":2295},{"uri":"Carduus_nutans","surface_form":"Carduus nutans","offset":2326},{"uri":"Cirsium_heterophyllum","surface_form":"Cirsium heterophyllum","offset":2367},{"uri":"Maud_Grieve","surface_form":"Maud Grieve","offset":2430},{"uri":"Pliny_the_Elder","surface_form":"Pliny","offset":2456},{"uri":"Early_modern_period","surface_form":"early modern period","offset":2546}]}
