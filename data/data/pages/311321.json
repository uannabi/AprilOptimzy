{"id":311321,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Havana","text":"Little Havana () is a section of Miami, Florida, where many Cuban immigrants and refugees have settled. The high number of Cuban refugees Florida receives is due to its proximity to Cuba. It is called Little Havana because Cuba's capital is Havana. There is also a smaller Little Havana in Tampa, Florida.\nIn recent years, increasing numbers of Honduran, Nicaraguan, and Guatemalan immigrants have moved into the neighborhood. At the same time, increasing numbers of Cubans left the area for the suburbs in western Miami. Part of Little Havana is now called Little Managua named after the Nicaraguan capital.\nCalle Ocho Festival.\nThe Calle Ocho Festival is held in Little Havana.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Miami%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Miami, Florida","offset":33},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":60},{"uri":"Immigration_to_the_United_States","surface_form":"immigrants","offset":66},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":230},{"uri":"Havana%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Havana","offset":241},{"uri":"Tampa%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Tampa, Florida","offset":290},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduran","offset":345},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":355},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":371},{"uri":"Little_Managua","surface_form":"Little Managua","offset":558},{"uri":"Managua","surface_form":"Nicaraguan capital","offset":589}]}
