He is believed to be one of the best reggaeton artists in Puerto Rico and all of Latin America by many music critics and fans alike. Omar is best known for his songs \"Dile\" and \"Dale Don Dale\" from his first album \"The Last Don\" and \"Reggaeton Latino\". His songs are mostly about life and love; some examples of these would be \"La Recompenza\" (\"The Reward\") and \"Aunque te Fuiste\" (\"Even Though You Left Me\").\nBiography.\nHis musical debut began in the evangelical church Iglesia de la Restauraci\u00F3n in Cristo en Bayam\u00F3n, where he became the pastor for four years but he left because of a sentimental disappointment. At this time he continues to take part in several groups that sing during religious celebrations.\nHe began singing and composing at age 21, feeling very close to the reggaeton style, which began to develop in Puerto Rico in the early 1990s. He started in reggaeton with Yaga duo Yaga and Mackie Ranks in 1990 with the song Tha Cream in the album of the same name.\nHe started his career after many obstacles when H\u00E9ctor Delgado (from the duo H\u00E9ctor & Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer for them. After that, he sang in a live concert with H\u00E9ctor & Tito in 2003, which was released later as a CD and DVD, which included the songs that became instant hits, Baila Morena and Amor de Colegio (School Love). He is currently signed to VI Music through Universal Music Latino.\nIn 2003 released The Last Don, his first album, which includes titles that will now be references to reggaeton as the songs Dale Don Dale, Dile and Pobre Diabla. He becomes one of the most emblematic representatives with Daddy Yankee (with whom he will duet) and his albums become true standards of the musical genre.\nDon Omar then gives many concerts, the number of participants and staging make it a real hit with spectators. Following his tour, released in 2004 The Last Don Live.\nDon Omar has been in trouble with the law for possession of drugs and firearms. He is often the subject of accusations for the content of the lyrics. He is accused of inciting violence and pornography. The strong rhythm, dancing and sensual characterizing also this musical genre, it is no exception, like many other reggaetoneros.\nHis contribution to the genre by the title Dale Don dale in The Last Don, was named the best Latin / hip-hop rap album of the year 2005 and voted best Latin pop artist by the Billboard.\nIn 2005, he produced Los Bandoleros. In this album he works with other artists for the title Los Bandoleros with Tego Calderon; for Como olvidar, with David Bisbal, for Ella y yo, with Romeo from Aventura, for My Space and Nadie Como T\u00FA with Wisin y Yandel, for Hold You Down with Jennifer Lopez; and for La Traicionera, with Glory.\nHis compositions use little repetitive style commonly used in the reggaeton style, to tell stories he imagines.\nDon Omar released an album King of King in 2006. He is the first sales of Hispanic language music records in the United States with this album as well as in some Latin American countries. With this album Don Omar is proclaimed \"El Rey\" (\"king\" in French) of reggaeton and official promoter of the musical genre. Upon release the album is first sales, and the first single Angelito is in the lead on the day of its release with about 500,000 sales, which is then a record for this style of music.\nHe composed the song Conteo for the film Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift.\nAt the end of 2006, the special edition of the album King of Kings is released: the \"Armageddon Edition\" in which four additional titles are added.\nIn 2007 he produced the album El Pentagono, in which participate various artists of the musical genre.

The tour announcement left many fans in disbelief, while selling out in minutes in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New York. Discussing the tour and his rivalry with Daddy Yankee, Don Omar said \u201CLet me clarify: I am not his best friend, and he is not my best friend, but we respect each other. That desire to be the best is what has pushed us to be better.\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":65},{"uri":"Reggaeton","surface_form":"reggaeton","offset":84},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":94},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":102},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":112},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":122},{"uri":"Puerto_Rican","surface_form":"Puerto Rican","offset":138},{"uri":"Businessman","surface_form":"businessman","offset":151},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":246},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"critic","offset":274},{"uri":"The_Last_Don","surface_form":"The Last Don","offset":380},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":454},{"uri":"VI_Music","surface_form":"VI Music","offset":1525},{"uri":"Universal_Music_Latino","surface_form":"Universal Music Latino","offset":1542}]}
