{"id":31142,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female.\nIn sexual reproduction, offspring are produced when sperms fertilise eggs from the female. Various steps are involved in this process.\nCell biology.\nThe cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes: they are diploid. When gametes (sex cells) are produced, they have only one set of chromosomes: they are haploid. They have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis. Two things happen during meiosis, each of which makes the offspring more variable. That means they are different from the parents and from each other.\nAssortment.\nAssortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete. Of each pair of chromosomes, \"which one goes into a single gamete is random\". Because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same, this means that there is genetic variation between gametes. This process was Mendel's 'first law', the law of segregation.\nCrossing over.\nBecause crossing over occurs during meiosis, this increases the variety of the chromosomes. This makes recombination possible.\nThe consequence of assortment and crossing over makes it certain that no two offspring of the same mother and father are identical. Identical twins are the exception. They are identical genetically because they developed from the same fertilised egg.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":45},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":57},{"uri":"Protist","surface_form":"protist","offset":80},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":93},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"Organism","offset":124},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":177},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":184},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":193},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":253},{"uri":"Fertilisation","surface_form":"fertilise","offset":260},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"eggs","offset":270},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":354},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"higher plant","offset":376},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":406},{"uri":"Diploid","surface_form":"diploid","offset":428},{"uri":"Gamete","surface_form":"gamete","offset":442},{"uri":"Haploid","surface_form":"haploid","offset":524},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":566},{"uri":"Meiosis","surface_form":"meiosis","offset":587},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":914},{"uri":"Allele","surface_form":"allele","offset":940},{"uri":"Mendel","surface_form":"Mendel","offset":1069},{"uri":"Crossing_over","surface_form":"crossing over","offset":1138},{"uri":"Recombination","surface_form":"recombination","offset":1233},{"uri":"Identical_twins","surface_form":"Identical twins","offset":1389},{"uri":"Fertilisation","surface_form":"fertilised egg","offset":1492}]}
