{"id":31167,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer","text":"Lung cancer is the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in one or both of the lungs. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers when smoke gets in the lungs. Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year, more than any other cancer. It is currently the leading cause of cancer death in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women.\nThe large majority of people who get lung cancer have smoked for many years. However, there are types of lung cancers that appear in otherwise healthy patients who have never smoked.\nThere are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer typically responds well to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and non-small cell lung cancer is more commonly treated with surgical removal of the lung tumor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
