He was very critical of Israel, but also Islamist groups that wanted an extreme Islamic state.\nAn Islamic terrorist group kidnapped Arrigoni and said they would kill him unless the Hamas government released their leader from prison. They showed Arrigoni with his eyes covered, on a YouTube video, with the text \"The Italian hostage entered our land only to spread corruption.\" The police went to a building in Gaza where they found Arrigoni's body. He had been beaten and strangled.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":30},{"uri":"Besana_in_Brianza","surface_form":"Besana in Brianza","offset":38},{"uri":"Lombardy","surface_form":"Lombardy","offset":57},{"uri":"2011","surface_form":"2011","offset":77},{"uri":"Gaza","surface_form":"Gaza","offset":85},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":98},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":121},{"uri":"Gaza_Strip","surface_form":"Gaza Strip","offset":164},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":200},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":217},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":282},{"uri":"Kidnap","surface_form":"kidnap","offset":298},{"uri":"Hamas","surface_form":"Hamas","offset":357},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":458},{"uri":"Hostage","surface_form":"hostage","offset":500},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":540}]}
