{"id":311743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Twombly","text":"Edwin Parker \"Cy\" Twombly, Jr. (April 25, 1928 \u2013 July 5, 2011) was an American artist. He used the nickname \"Cy\", after his father and the star baseball pitcher Cy Young.\nTwombly was known for his large-scale, freely scribbled, calligraphic-style graffiti paintings, on solid fields of mostly gray, tan, or off-white colors. He exhibited his paintings worldwide. Twombly's paintings blur the line between drawing and painting. Many of his best-known paintings of the late 1960s are reminiscent of a school blackboard on which someone has practiced cursive \"e\"s. Twombly had at this point discarded painting figurative, representational subject-matter, citing the line or smudge \u2013 each mark with its own history \u2013 as its proper subject.\nLater, many of his paintings and works on paper moved into \"romantic symbolism\", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted the poet St\u00E9phane Mallarm\u00E9, as well as many classical myths and allegories in his works. Examples of this are his \"Apollo and The Artist\" and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word \"VIRGIL\". In a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as \u201Cinfluential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well\". After acquiring Twombly's \"Three Studies from the Temeraire\" (1998\u201399), the Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales said \"sometimes people need a little bit of help in recognising a great work of art that might be a bit unfamiliar\". He is said to have influenced younger artists such as Anselm Kiefer, Francesco Clemente, and Julian Schnabel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cy_Young","surface_form":"Cy Young","offset":161},{"uri":"Calligraphy","surface_form":"calligraphic","offset":228},{"uri":"Graffiti","surface_form":"graffiti","offset":247},{"uri":"St%C3%A9phane_Mallarm%C3%A9","surface_form":"St\u00E9phane Mallarm\u00E9","offset":928},{"uri":"Kirk_Varnedoe","surface_form":"Kirk Varnedoe","offset":1177},{"uri":"Art_Gallery_of_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Art Gallery of New South Wales","offset":1480},{"uri":"Anselm_Kiefer","surface_form":"Anselm Kiefer","offset":1682},{"uri":"Francesco_Clemente","surface_form":"Francesco Clemente","offset":1697},{"uri":"Julian_Schnabel","surface_form":"Julian Schnabel","offset":1721}]}
