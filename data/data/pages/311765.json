With co-workers, he discovered over 4,000 asteroids, including Apollo asteroids, Amor asteroids, as well as dozens of Trojan asteroids. Gehrels also discovered a number of comets. In an interview, Gehrels was asked what he would do if an asteroid hit the Earth. He said, \"Go out there and have a look, of course.\"\nIn the 1970s, Gehrels was in charge of the Imaging Photopolarimeter experiment on the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 satellites which explored the planets, Jupiter and Saturn.\nGehrels edited a number of space science textbooks. One of his sons, Neil Gehrels, was also an astronomer.\nGehrels was part of the Dutch Resistance in World War II. In 1994, he argued that German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun had been involved in Nazi concentration camps during that war.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":43},{"uri":"University_of_Arizona","surface_form":"University of Arizona","offset":107},{"uri":"Tucson","surface_form":"Tucson","offset":130},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":180},{"uri":"Apollo_asteroid","surface_form":"Apollo asteroid","offset":201},{"uri":"Amor_asteroid","surface_form":"Amor asteroid","offset":219},{"uri":"Trojan_asteroid","surface_form":"Trojan asteroid","offset":256},{"uri":"Comet","surface_form":"comet","offset":310},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":393},{"uri":"Photopolarimeter","surface_form":"Photopolarimeter","offset":503},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":520},{"uri":"Pioneer_10","surface_form":"Pioneer 10","offset":538},{"uri":"Pioneer_11","surface_form":"Pioneer 11","offset":553},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":594},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":603},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":615},{"uri":"Neil_Gehrels","surface_form":"Neil Gehrels","offset":692},{"uri":"Dutch_Resistance","surface_form":"Dutch Resistance","offset":754},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":774},{"uri":"Wernher_von_Braun","surface_form":"Wernher von Braun","offset":836},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":875},{"uri":"Concentration_camp","surface_form":"concentration camp","offset":880}]}
