{"id":311907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, an equivalence relation formula_1 on a set is a mathematical relation that is symmetric, transitive and reflexive. For a given element formula_1 on that set, the set of all elements related to formula_1 (in the sense of formula_1) is called the equivalence class of formula_1, and written as formula_1.\nIn this example, the set of all animals related to a particular ox forms an equivalence class\u2014it is the set of cattle. In fact, the set of all animals on this farm can be partitioned into different equivalence classes (in this case species).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Relation_(mathematics)","surface_form":"mathematical relation","offset":77},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetric","offset":107},{"uri":"Transitivity","surface_form":"transitive","offset":118},{"uri":"Reflexive","surface_form":"reflexive","offset":133},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":443}]}
