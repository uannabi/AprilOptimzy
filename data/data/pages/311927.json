Weasel\" because of the character) is an American animated television series produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera, created by David Feiss and aired on Cartoon Network. The show is about a very smart weasel named I.M. Weasel who uses his talents to help people in all different ways, and because of this is adored by everybody in the world. There is also a stupid baboon named I.R. Baboon who wants to be more admired than the weasel by trying to help people in his own way, but this often has bad results and makes everyone dislike him.\n\"I Am Weasel\" was originally a series of segments in its sister series \"Cow and Chicken\", usually being aired as the third of three segments in a \"Cow and Chicken\" episode. The series started on July 15, 1997 and its first four seasons premiered in that format. In 1999, \"I Am Weasel\" was separated and got its own half-hour show, premiering as an independent series on June 10, 1999. All of the 52 episodes of \"I Am Weasel\" that originally aired on \"Cow and Chicken\" began to air in the new independent show, and were later joined by a fifth season with 27 new episodes, for a total of 79 episodes. The series ended in 2000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":95},{"uri":"Hanna-Barbera","surface_form":"Hanna-Barbera","offset":153},{"uri":"Cartoon_Network","surface_form":"Cartoon Network","offset":204},{"uri":"Weasel","surface_form":"weasel","offset":252},{"uri":"Baboon","surface_form":"baboon","offset":416},{"uri":"Cow_and_Chicken","surface_form":"Cow and Chicken","offset":662}]}
