{"id":31199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower","text":"e=\"preserve\">A superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world. It is more powerful than a major power. And right now, only the United States is a superpower, however, China is quickly becoming a superpower.\nIn the years following World War II, the United Nations was formed. The 5 countries that would later have nuclear bombs \u2013 those who would be able to start a nuclear war \u2013 were all given \"permanent\" seats on the Security Council. This means they are on the Security Council forever. They were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the Security Council. These five countries were: United States, United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet Union.\nFor most of the 1900s, the Soviet Union was a superpower. After the Soviet Union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991, it was not a superpower anymore. Russia got most of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, and also its permanent seat in the Security Council. Some other countries also have nuclear weapons now, and can also start a nuclear war just as well, but they are not permanent members with veto power. The Republic of India, North Korea and Pakistan are a few countries like this.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Great_power","surface_form":"major power","offset":123},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":160},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":200},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":263},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":281},{"uri":"Nuclear_bomb","surface_form":"nuclear bomb","offset":346},{"uri":"Nuclear_war","surface_form":"nuclear war","offset":397},{"uri":"Security_Council","surface_form":"Security Council","offset":451},{"uri":"Veto","surface_form":"veto","offset":553},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":631},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":646},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":662},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":669},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":685},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":860},{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":1123},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":1142},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":1158}]}
