{"id":312030,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kashmir_War","text":"e=\"preserve\">The India-Pakistan War of 1947-48 is also known as the First Kashmir War. It was fought between the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan over the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948.\nThis was the first of four wars fought between the two newly independent nations. The result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both the countries. The result of the war was inconclusive. However, neutral assessments seem to agree that India was the victor of the war because it was able to successfully defend about two-thirds of the Kashmir, including Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dominion_of_India","surface_form":"Dominion of India","offset":113},{"uri":"Dominion_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Dominion of Pakistan","offset":135},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"Princely state","offset":172},{"uri":"Kashmir_and_Jammu","surface_form":"Kashmir and Jammu","offset":190},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":472},{"uri":"Kashmir_valley","surface_form":"Kashmir valley","offset":590},{"uri":"Jammu","surface_form":"Jammu","offset":606},{"uri":"Ladakh","surface_form":"Ladakh","offset":616}]}
