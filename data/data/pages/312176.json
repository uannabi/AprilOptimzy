{"id":312176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support","text":"e=\"preserve\">Child support is continued payment performed by a parent for the financial benefits of children following marital separations, divorces or ends of civil unions. Child maintenance is paid either directly or indirect by obligors toward an obligee for care and support of children from terminated marriages, civil unions or other relationships. The obligor is the non-custodial parent; the obligee is either the custodial parent, a caregiver, a guardian or the state.\nDuration of support orders.\nSupport orders end based on local laws and the facts of each case. Support orders usually end when the child reaches the age of majority. (This can be an age from 16 to 21 (New York State) or graduates from high school.) Some countries and states have laws that make support continue past the age of majority if the child is enrolled as a full-time, degree-seeking post-secondary student. If the obligor owes back child support, the payments must continue until the debt is satisfied, regardless of the age of the child.\nSeveral factors can end a support order for a child under the age of majority. These include the child's marriage, legal emancipation or death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parent","surface_form":"parent","offset":63},{"uri":"Finance","surface_form":"financial","offset":78},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":100},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":140},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":282},{"uri":"Parent","surface_form":"parent","offset":388},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":471},{"uri":"Age_of_majority","surface_form":"age of majority","offset":627}]}
