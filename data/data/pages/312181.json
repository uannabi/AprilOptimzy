{"id":312181,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Natural deduction is a branch of mathematical logic developed in Poland in the 1920s and 30s. It is meant to express inference rules closely related to the \"natural\" way of reasoning.\nSpurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by \u0141ukasiewicz that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, Ja\u015Bkowski made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction. In 1929 he first suggested in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updated his proposal in papers in 1934 and 1935.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":46},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":59},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":78},{"uri":"Inference","surface_form":"inference","offset":130},{"uri":"Seminar","surface_form":"seminar","offset":223},{"uri":"Diagram","surface_form":"diagram","offset":433},{"uri":"Notation","surface_form":"notation","offset":446}]}
