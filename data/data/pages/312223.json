He made a mathematical method to find a molecular structures based on the X-ray patterns of crystallized materials. With Jerome Karle, he won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nBiography.\nHe was born in New York City. He was the oldest child of Israel Hauptman and Leah Rosenfeld, and of Jewish descent.\nHauptman was interested in science and mathematics from an early age. He studied at Townsend Harris High School. He graduated from the City College of New York (1937). He earned an M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939. He married Edith Citrynell on November 10, 1940, and had two daughters.\nAfter World War II, he began working together with Jerome Karle, a physical chemist, at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.. He also enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland, College Park. They used their mathematics and physical chemistry skills to solve the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. By 1955, he had received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and they had worked out the direct methods in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 article, \"Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal\", contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods.\nIn 1970 he joined the Medical Foundation of Buffalo, becoming its Research Director in 1972. At this time he developed the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following years.\nHauptman who was an atheist, signed with 21 other Nobel laureates the Humanist Manifesto in 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":69},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":78},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":102},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":189},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystallized materials","offset":207},{"uri":"Jerome_Karle","surface_form":"Jerome Karle","offset":236},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":266},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":318},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":403},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":446},{"uri":"Townsend_Harris_High_School","surface_form":"Townsend Harris High School","offset":503},{"uri":"City_College_of_New_York","surface_form":"City College of New York","offset":554},{"uri":"Master_of_Arts","surface_form":"M.A.","offset":600},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":632},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":739},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical chemist","offset":800},{"uri":"Naval_Research_Laboratory","surface_form":"Naval Research Laboratory","offset":825},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":854},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":896},{"uri":"University_of_Maryland%2C_College_Park","surface_form":"University of Maryland, College Park","offset":917},{"uri":"Phase_problem","surface_form":"phase problem","offset":1026},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":1043},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":1095},{"uri":"Medical_Foundation_of_Buffalo","surface_form":"Medical Foundation of Buffalo","offset":1393},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":1626},{"uri":"Humanist_Manifesto","surface_form":"Humanist Manifesto","offset":1676}]}
