{"id":312424,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_Would_Suck_Without_You","text":"\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" is a song from American singer Kelly Clarkson. It was the first single from her fourth studio album, \"All I Ever Wanted\". It was her second number-one hit in Canada and the United States and her first chart-topper in the UK. This song was released on January 31, 2009.\nThe song has the largest jump to number one in \"Billboard\" Hot 100 history. It was also the biggest leap on the chart ever until 2019, when Taylor Swift broke this record. \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" entered at #97 and moved to the top the following week.\nClarkson also said that she usually asks for writing credits if she knows she created a fair-sized portion of a song. She says she lost \"millions\" of dollars in royalties by not being listed on the writing credits of the song.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":38},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":48},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":57},{"uri":"Kelly_Clarkson","surface_form":"Kelly Clarkson","offset":64},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":120},{"uri":"All_I_Ever_Wanted","surface_form":"All I Ever Wanted","offset":135},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":191},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":206},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":349}]}
