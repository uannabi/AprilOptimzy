{"id":312499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni","text":"Macaroni is a pasta food which is made of wheat and flour. It is from Italy. It is in the shape of a small tube. It can either be straight or curved. The curved type is called elbow macaroni.\nMacaroni is almost never eaten by itself. It is usually eaten with another food or covered in a sauce. A very popular type of macaroni is \"Macaroni cheese\", which is macaroni covered in melted cheese.\nIn Libya, macaroni is called Macroona Imbakbaka. Libya has Italian food because it used to be a Italian colony.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pasta","surface_form":"pasta","offset":14},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":42},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":52},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":70},{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":107},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":288},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":385},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":396}]}
