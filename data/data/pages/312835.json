{"id":312835,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_Mommy_Kissing_Santa_Claus","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\" is a Christmas song with words and music by British songwriter Tommie Connor. The original recording by 13-year-old Jimmy Boyd rose to #1 on the \"Billboard\" charts in December 1952. The words tell of a child who sees Mommy kissing Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe.\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Boston hated the song because it is a Christmas song that also mentions sex. Radio stations in several markets banned it. Boyd went to church leaders to talk about the words. The ban on the song was lifted.\nThe song has been performed by various musicians, including but not limited to the Ronettes, Jackson 5, Jessica Simpson, John Mellencamp, Amy Winehouse and other singers throughout the years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":52},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":193},{"uri":"Santa_Claus","surface_form":"Santa Claus","offset":278},{"uri":"Mistletoe","surface_form":"mistletoe","offset":305},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":320},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":345},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":383},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":591},{"uri":"Jessica_Simpson","surface_form":"Jessica Simpson","offset":656},{"uri":"Amy_Winehouse","surface_form":"Amy Winehouse","offset":690}]}
