{"id":312868,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21_Search","text":"Yahoo! Search is an Internet search engine. It is owned by Yahoo! Inc. and was, as of December 2009, the 2nd largest search engine on the web by query volume, at 6.42%, after its competitor Google at 85.35% and before Baidu at 3.67%, according to Net Applications.\nOriginally, Yahoo! Search started as a web directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In the late 1990s, Yahoo! evolved into a full-fledged portal with a search interface and, by 2007, a limited version of selection-based search.\nYahoo! Search, originally referred to as Yahoo! provided Search interface, would send queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of sites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and storage/retrieval of data was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001 the searchable index was powered by Inktomi and later was powered by Google until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent.\nOn July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that Bing would power Yahoo! Search. All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners will be shifted to Bing by early 2012.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["website"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":20},{"uri":"Search_engine","surface_form":"search engine","offset":29},{"uri":"Yahoo%21","surface_form":"Yahoo!","offset":59},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":327},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":958},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":1034},{"uri":"Yahoo%21","surface_form":"Yahoo!","offset":1048}]}
