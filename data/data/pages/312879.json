{"id":312879,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State","text":"The Congo Free State () was a large area in Central Africa. It was privately owned by Leopold II, King of the Belgians. Leopold convinced the international community that he was involved in humanitarian work. He attracted scientific and humanitarian backing for the International African Association (), which he formed during a Brussels Geographic Conference of geographic societies, explorers, and leaders he hosted in 1876. Leopold used the Association and the defunct \"Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo\" () as a way to claim most of the Congo Basin.\nLeopold created the International Association of the Congo () as a new organization. The entity was officially recognized by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 and various governments. On May 29, 1885, the king named his new colony the Congo Free State () and ruled it as a dictator (even though he never visited his colony and Africa).\nThe Congo Free State under Leopold II used slave labor and mutilation of their hands, in order to get full control and force the natives to work at extracting natural resources, mainly rubber and ivory, for Leopold II's personal profit.\nHis harsh rule was responsible for the deaths of between five to 10 million Congolese people. The Congo became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century. As a result, Leopold II was forced to give control of it to the government of Belgium. The Belgian government took control in 1908 and created the Belgian Congo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_Africa","surface_form":"Central Africa","offset":44},{"uri":"Leopold_II_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Leopold II, King of the Belgians","offset":86},{"uri":"Humanitarian","surface_form":"humanitarian","offset":190},{"uri":"International_African_Association","surface_form":"International African Association","offset":266},{"uri":"Brussels_Geographic_Conference","surface_form":"Brussels Geographic Conference","offset":329},{"uri":"Congo_Basin","surface_form":"Congo Basin","offset":548},{"uri":"International_Association_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"International Association of the Congo","offset":581},{"uri":"Berlin_Conference","surface_form":"Berlin Conference","offset":690},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":833},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":887},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slave labor","offset":939},{"uri":"Mutilation","surface_form":"mutilation","offset":955},{"uri":"Natural_resource","surface_form":"natural resource","offset":1055},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":1081},{"uri":"Ivory","surface_form":"ivory","offset":1092},{"uri":"Profit","surface_form":"profit","offset":1125},{"uri":"Infamous","surface_form":"infamous","offset":1260},{"uri":"Belgian_Congo","surface_form":"Belgian Congo","offset":1466}]}
