{"id":313037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena","text":"Scotiabank Arena, formerly known as Air Canada Centre, is a sports arena in Toronto, Ontario. The arena opened in 1999, and is the current home to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). It holds 19,800 seats for basketball and 18,819 for hockey. The arena has also been the host of many concerts and WWE events over the years.\nWhen the arena was sponsored by Air Canada, it was nicknamed \"the ACC\" and \"the Hangar\". The new nickname of \"The Vault\" was in use shortly after the new sponsorship was announced.\nIn August 2017, as the arena's sponsorship contract with Air Canada was nearing its end, MLSE announced that it had made a new deal with Scotiabank that took effect on July 1, 2018. The current deal runs for 20 years and is worth C$800 million.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":60},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":67},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":76},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":85},{"uri":"Toronto_Maple_Leafs","surface_form":"Toronto Maple Leafs","offset":151},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League (NHL)","offset":178},{"uri":"Toronto_Raptors","surface_form":"Toronto Raptors","offset":212},{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"National Basketball Association","offset":235},{"uri":"Toronto_Rock","surface_form":"Toronto Rock","offset":281},{"uri":"National_Lacrosse_League","surface_form":"National Lacrosse League","offset":301},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":447},{"uri":"Air_Canada","surface_form":"Air Canada","offset":506},{"uri":"Scotiabank","surface_form":"Scotiabank","offset":792},{"uri":"Canadian_dollar","surface_form":"C$","offset":885}]}
