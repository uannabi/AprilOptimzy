{"id":313041,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum","text":"The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum is a sports arena in Uniondale, New York. The arena opened on February 11, 1972, and is the current home to the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena is commonly known as Nassau Coliseum or The Coliseum. The arena was also notable for hosting the first part of the World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania 2 in 1986. In addition, it has also hosted WWE's SummerSlam in August 2002, The Great American Bash in July 2008, and WWE Fatal 4-Way on June 20, 2010. The arena was also the home of the New York Nets from 1972 to 1977.\nThe Islanders said they are moving to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn when their lease of the Coliseum expires at the end of the 2014-2015 season. When the Islanders move, the Coliseum would not have a permanent tenant after 2015 and leaves the future of the Coliseum in doubt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":43},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":50},{"uri":"Uniondale%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Uniondale","offset":59},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":70},{"uri":"February_11","surface_form":"February 11","offset":100},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":113},{"uri":"New_York_Islanders","surface_form":"New York Islanders","offset":150},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League (NHL)","offset":176},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":331},{"uri":"WrestleMania_2","surface_form":"WrestleMania 2","offset":360},{"uri":"SummerSlam_(2002)","surface_form":"SummerSlam","offset":422},{"uri":"The_Great_American_Bash_(2008)","surface_form":"The Great American Bash","offset":449},{"uri":"WWE_Fatal_4-Way","surface_form":"WWE Fatal 4-Way","offset":491},{"uri":"Brooklyn_Nets","surface_form":"New York Nets","offset":560},{"uri":"Barclays_Center","surface_form":"Barclays Center","offset":635},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":654},{"uri":"2014-15_NHL_season","surface_form":"2014-2015 season","offset":722}]}
