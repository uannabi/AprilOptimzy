{"id":313059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_(Confucian)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Li (\u79AE pinyin: L\u01D0) is a classical Chinese word used in Confucian and post-Confucian Chinese philosophy. The English meaning is \"the way things should be done.\"\nIn Li one must be aware of the way one should act and function within a society. In Li one can best cultivate their character by understanding what it entails. Li encompasses most importantly the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Five Constant Relationships.\nThe Doctrine of the Mean is the way in which one should make decisions in life, in which the best decision is always the middle between unworkable extremes. Taking the middle road as Confucius said would guide one to the way things should be done.\nThe Five Constant Relationships outline how one should act in society, being the relationships between parent and child, husband and wife, elder sibling and junior sibling, elder friend and junior friend, and ruler and subject. With these constant relationship guidelines, Li sets up a hierarchy between the two people and terms the accepted responses and actions between them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"pinyin","offset":19},{"uri":"Confucian","surface_form":"Confucian","offset":67},{"uri":"Chinese_philosophy","surface_form":"Chinese philosophy","offset":96}]}
