The opening verses are: \"Back in the garage with my bullshit detector\" / \"Carbon monoxide makes sure it's effective\", followed by the chorus: \"We're a garage band\" / \"We come from garageland\", and concluding with \"Back in the garage\".\nYet, only two years later, Murray was describing the band as \"the greatest rock band in the world\" in the same paper.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":24},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":32},{"uri":"The_Clash","surface_form":"The Clash","offset":47},{"uri":"The_Clash_(album)","surface_form":"The Clash","offset":90},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"Carbon monoxide","offset":478},{"uri":"NME","surface_form":"same paper","offset":745}]}
