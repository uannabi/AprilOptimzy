{"id":313249,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_All_Migrant_Workers","text":"e=\"preserve\">International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families is a treaty of the United Nations for the rights of all migrant workers. It also protects their families. It was adopted in 18 December 1990. It went into force in 2003.\nThis Convention is made as a series of the international human rights law and at the \"Preamble\" of the Convention, they recall the conventions of the International Labour Organization about migrant workers and unfree labour. The aid of the Convention is to protect the rights of migrant workers who have not the nationality of the staying country, thus who can often be under the worse working condition or even the victims of human trafficking.\nBut as of December 2019, only 55 countries have ratified, that is admitted formally the Convention. Most of those countries are in North Africa and South America. No migrant-receiving State in Western Europe or North America has ratified the Convention. Other important receiving countries, such as Australia, Arab states of the Persian Gulf, India and South Africa have not ratified the Convention either.\nBut this Convention is recalled by the Preamble of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":128},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":142},{"uri":"Migrant_worker","surface_form":"migrant worker","offset":179},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"families","offset":219},{"uri":"International_human_rights_law","surface_form":"international human rights law","offset":336},{"uri":"International_Labour_Organization","surface_form":"International Labour Organization","offset":443},{"uri":"Migrant_worker","surface_form":"migrant worker","offset":483},{"uri":"Unfree_labour","surface_form":"unfree labour","offset":503},{"uri":"Human_trafficking","surface_form":"human trafficking","offset":720},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":870},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":887},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1038},{"uri":"Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf","surface_form":"Arab states of the Persian Gulf","offset":1049},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1082},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1092},{"uri":"Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","surface_form":"Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","offset":1201}]}
