These will replace the old trains which are still being used. The freight market share of the railways are also expected to rise quickly with the completion of the Kars\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Baku railway in 2012.\nThe total length of the Azerbaijan Railways ranks 57th in length among the countries in the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"State-owned","surface_form":"state-owned","offset":68},{"uri":"Rail_transport","surface_form":"rail transport","offset":80},{"uri":"Railway_company","surface_form":"company","offset":95},{"uri":"Republic_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Republic of Azerbaijan","offset":110},{"uri":"Rail_gauge","surface_form":"rail gauge","offset":182},{"uri":"Railway_electrification_system","surface_form":"electrified","offset":202},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"kV","offset":219},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"V","offset":229},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"DC","offset":232},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":240},{"uri":"Baku","surface_form":"Baku","offset":298},{"uri":"Soviet_Railways","surface_form":"Soviet Railways","offset":346},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":442},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":622},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":770},{"uri":"Railway_track","surface_form":"railway track","offset":816},{"uri":"Railway_signal","surface_form":"railway signal","offset":1105},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":1163},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":1189},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":1284},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":1302},{"uri":"Bil%C9%99c%C9%99ri","surface_form":"Bil\u0259c\u0259ri","offset":1439},{"uri":"Shirvan_(city)","surface_form":"\u015Eirvan","offset":1462},{"uri":"Rail_yard","surface_form":"railway storage areas","offset":1528},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":1554},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"container","offset":1560},{"uri":"Mechanism","surface_form":"mechanism","offset":1584},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":1599},{"uri":"Ke%C5%9Fl%C9%99","surface_form":"Ke\u015Fl\u0259","offset":1622},{"uri":"Ganja%2C_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"G\u0259nc\u0259","offset":1639},{"uri":"X%C4%B1rdalan","surface_form":"X\u0131rdalan","offset":1649},{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"public transport","offset":1757},{"uri":"Freight_rail_transport","surface_form":"freight rail transport","offset":1814},{"uri":"Kars%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Baku_railway","surface_form":"Kars\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Baku railway","offset":1927},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":2010},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":2018},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":2030},{"uri":"Modern","surface_form":"modern","offset":2108},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":2145}]}
