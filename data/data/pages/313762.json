{"id":313762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Vacant","text":"\"Pretty Vacant\" is a song by the English punk rock band The Sex Pistols. It was released in 1977, as the third single from their album \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\".\nThe song is infamous for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word \"vacant\", emphasizing the last syllable making it sound like the vulgar word \"cunt\".\nThe B-side is a cover of The Stooges' \"No Fun\" which they played on the spot without a proper rehearsal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":41},{"uri":"Sex_Pistols","surface_form":"Sex Pistols","offset":60},{"uri":"Never_Mind_the_Bollocks%2C_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols","surface_form":"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols","offset":136},{"uri":"John_Lydon","surface_form":"John Lydon","offset":220},{"uri":"Cunt","surface_form":"cunt","offset":332},{"uri":"The_Stooges","surface_form":"The Stooges","offset":364}]}
