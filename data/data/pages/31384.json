{"id":31384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg","text":"e=\"preserve\">Project Gutenberg (PG) is an online project that offers a digital archive of copyright-free e-books in the public domain. It was started in 1971 by Michael S. Hart. The purpose of the Project is to collect in and make available cultural work (like books) using computers. These are generally free and may be used on most computers. The project gets its name from Johannes Gutenberg, a German publisher who made the first European printing press in 1439.\nAs Project Gutenberg continued to grow, in 2000, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was created. It is a non-profit organization with main office in Mississippi, United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":90},{"uri":"E-book","surface_form":"e-book","offset":105},{"uri":"Public_domain","surface_form":"public domain","offset":120},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":153},{"uri":"Michael_S._Hart","surface_form":"Michael S.
