{"id":313848,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly_Circus","text":"Piccadilly Circus is a road junction and public space in London's West End in the City of Westminster.\nThe Circus links Piccadilly with Regent Street, and the theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue, as well as the Haymarket, Coventry Street (onwards to Leicester Square), and Glasshouse Street.\nThe Circus is close to major shopping and entertainment areas in the West End. Its status as a major traffic intersection has made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting place and a tourist attraction in its own right.\nThe Circus is particularly known for its video display and neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the fountain and statue of an archer popularly known as \"Eros\". Actually the statue is that of \"Anteros\", who in legend was the brother of Eros. The fountain is a pedestrian area: it and the Circus there is surrounded by several noted buildings, the London Pavilion and the Criterion Theatre. Directly underneath the plaza is Piccadilly Circus tube station, part of the London Underground system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Junction","surface_form":"junction","offset":28},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":57},{"uri":"West_End_of_London","surface_form":"West End","offset":66},{"uri":"City_of_Westminster","surface_form":"City of Westminster","offset":82},{"uri":"Piccadilly","surface_form":"Piccadilly","offset":120},{"uri":"Regent_Street","surface_form":"Regent Street","offset":136},{"uri":"Shaftesbury_Avenue","surface_form":"Shaftesbury Avenue","offset":171},{"uri":"The_Haymarket","surface_form":"the Haymarket","offset":202},{"uri":"Coventry_Street","surface_form":"Coventry Street","offset":217},{"uri":"Leicester_Square","surface_form":"Leicester Square","offset":245},{"uri":"Neon_lighting","surface_form":"neon","offset":559},{"uri":"Eros","surface_form":"Eros","offset":691},{"uri":"Anteros","surface_form":"Anteros","offset":730},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":747},{"uri":"London_Pavilion","surface_form":"London Pavilion","offset":884},{"uri":"Criterion_Theatre","surface_form":"Criterion Theatre","offset":908},{"uri":"Piccadilly_Circus_tube_station","surface_form":"Piccadilly Circus tube station","offset":960},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":1004}]}
