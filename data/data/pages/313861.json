{"id":313861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%E2%80%93Chall_formula","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dale\u2013Chall formula is one of the ways to predict how difficult text is to read. It is a readability test. The Dale\u2013Chall formula is a one-variable test: it measures the difficulty of the words used. It does not measure the difficulty of the sentence structure (the syntax).\nOne of the first readability tests, the Dale\u2013Chall formula used a vocabulary list. It counted the number of listed words in a passage, and applied a formula which gave a grade level. It was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in US school districts. In 1995 the authors published an updated word list.\nIt is easy, in principle, to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer-based readability measure. The list is organised as a look-up table. The percentage of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula, and the user is presented with a grade level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Readability_test","surface_form":"readability test","offset":105},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":155},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":282},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":357},{"uri":"Formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":440},{"uri":"Grade_level","surface_form":"grade level","offset":461},{"uri":"Textbook","surface_form":"textbook","offset":494},{"uri":"School_district","surface_form":"school district","offset":527},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":661},{"uri":"Look-up_table","surface_form":"look-up table","offset":724}]}
