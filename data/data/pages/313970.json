He graduated from Harvard University and got his Ph.D. and Professorship from Princeton University.\nDani Rodrik is one of the most important Turkish economists and has made several important contributions to economics. He looks at international economics, economic development and political economy, and has published many articles about them. The main questions of his research are: what makes a good economic policy and why some governments are better than others in adopting it.\nHe does not like globalization, because he feels it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people poorer and that people lose their jobs. He also thinks that international organizations like the World Bank and the IMF have made it harder for poorer countries to get richer, or even do not allow them to get richer. He writes critical articles against globalization.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"August_14","surface_form":"August 14","offset":18},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":29},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":37},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":47},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":60},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economist","offset":68},{"uri":"Field","surface_form":"field","offset":85},{"uri":"International_economics","surface_form":"international economics","offset":95},{"uri":"Economic_development","surface_form":"economic development","offset":120},{"uri":"Political_economy","surface_form":"political economy","offset":145},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":172},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":185},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government","surface_form":"John F.
