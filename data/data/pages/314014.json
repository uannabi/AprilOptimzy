{"id":314014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakali","text":"The rakali (\"Hydromys chrysogaster\"), also known as the water-rat, is an Australian native rodent. The species lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries. It feeds on aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs and water birds. Rakali are in length with a thick tail measuring around. They weigh. They have webbed hind legs, waterproof fur, a flattened head, a long blunt nose, many whiskers and small ears and eyes. They are black to brown in colour with an orange to white belly, and dark tail with a white tip.\nCommon names.\nUntil the 1980s, this species was commonly known as water-rat. During the 1990s there was a push for English common names to be replaced with indigenous names. In 1995 the Australian Nature Conservation Agency recommended that the name rakali be used as the common name. The Australian Department of Environment and Heritage has taken up this suggestion and both common names are now used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":73},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":91},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":103},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuaries","offset":162},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":208},{"uri":"Mussel","surface_form":"mussel","offset":221},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australian","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":716},{"uri":"Australian_Nature_Conservation_Agency","surface_form":"Australian Nature Conservation Agency","offset":746},{"uri":"Department_of_the_Environment_and_Heritage_(Australia)","surface_form":"Department of Environment and Heritage","offset":860}]}
