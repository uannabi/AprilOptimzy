{"id":314271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-frontal_cortex","text":"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the front part of the frontal lobes of the brain. It lies in front of the motor and premotor areas.\nThis brain region helps plan complex cognitive behaviours, personality expression, and decision making. It helps correct social behaviour. The basic activity of this brain region is to bring together thoughts and actions to help achieve internal goals.\nThe most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. This is the ability to work out conflicting thoughts. It determines good and bad, better and best, same and different, consequences of current activities, working toward a goal, prediction of outcomes, and expectation of results. Critical is 'social control': the ability to suppress urges which, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes.\nMany authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frontal_lobes","surface_form":"frontal lobes","offset":53},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":74},{"uri":"Primary_motor_cortex","surface_form":"motor","offset":105},{"uri":"Premotor_cortex","surface_form":"premotor","offset":115},{"uri":"Personality","surface_form":"personality","offset":190},{"uri":"Goal","surface_form":"goals","offset":377},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychological","offset":401},{"uri":"Consequence","surface_form":"consequences","offset":618},{"uri":"Outcome","surface_form":"outcomes","offset":691},{"uri":"Urge","surface_form":"urges","offset":783}]}
