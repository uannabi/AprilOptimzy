Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still usable, the Japanese army, blaming the action on the Chinese people, fully invaded Manchuria, leading to its occupation. Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later. Soon the world knew the event, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawal from the League of Nations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":147},{"uri":"Manchuria","surface_form":"Manchuria","offset":162},{"uri":"Dynamite","surface_form":"dynamite","offset":222},{"uri":"Mukden","surface_form":"Mukden","offset":308},{"uri":"Puppet_state","surface_form":"puppet state","offset":513},{"uri":"Manchukuo","surface_form":"Manchukuo","offset":529},{"uri":"Isolation","surface_form":"isolation","offset":616},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":654}]}
