{"id":314508,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me","text":"\"Super Size Me\" is a 2004 American documentary movie directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock. It is about an experiment where Spurlock ate nothing but food from McDonald's for thirty days. He ate at McDonald's three times a day, eating an average of 5,000 kcal per day. This experiment lasted from February 1 to March 2, 2003. This experiment was bad for his own physical and psychological health.\nDuring the experiment, Spurlock gained 24\u00BD lbs., had a 13% body mass increase, his cholesterol level went to 230, and he had mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and had fat accumulation in his liver. After the experiment, he recovered with a vegan diet his then-future wife prepared for him (she is a gourmet vegan cook).\nThis experiment was conducted because of the obesity epidemic in the United States, and because of a case in which two teenage girls sued McDonald's who claimed they became obese as a result of eating food from McDonald's.\nSpurlock also uses this movie to criticize McDonald's and the fast food industry, ranging from the sale of unhealthy food to corporate marketing and to the personal profit of these organizations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Morgan_Spurlock","surface_form":"Morgan Spurlock","offset":78},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":162},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":276},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":482},{"uri":"Mood_swing","surface_form":"mood swing","offset":524},{"uri":"Sexual_dysfunction","surface_form":"sexual dysfunction","offset":537},{"uri":"Fat_accumulation","surface_form":"fat accumulation","offset":565},{"uri":"Vegan","surface_form":"vegan","offset":638},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":763},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticize","offset":974},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":1003}]}
