{"id":31459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty","text":"The Qing dynasty () was a dynasty of rulers of China from 1644 to 1912. The dynasty was founded by the Manchus and so its other name is the Manchu dynasty. The surname of the Qing emperors was Aisin Gioro.\nRise of the Manchu state.\nIn 1580, Nurhaci became the Jian Zhou general of the Ming dynasty. He unified the Manchu tribe and organised the Eight Banners. In 1616, Nurhaci declared himself Khan (King) and founded the Jin dynasty in Liao Ling. In 1626, Nurhaci led armies to attack Ning Yuan. Unluckily, Nurhaci was wounded by Yuan Chonghuan's Portuguese cannon and he died 2 days later. Huang Taiji, the son of Nurhaci, then succeeded to the throne and became the Khan of the Manchu tribe. In 1643, Huang Taiji was dead, caused by apoplexy. Shunzhi Emperor inherited Huang Taiji's throne. Prince Dorgon became the regent. In 1644, the Manchu armies conquered the north of China. The capital was changed to Beijing. The Ming dynasty was overthrown, though fighting continued until 1683.\nA. The self-strengthening movement (1861 - 1895).\nThe self-strengthening movement (or; 1861 - 1895) was a reform organised during the late Qing. With the defeat in the Opium Wars and the outbreak of Taiping Rebellion, the emperor and the imperial officials realised that it was necessary to improve the country's state with a series of reforms. Therefore, the Self-Strengthening Movement was started.\nThe movement could be divided into three phases: the first phase (1861 - 1872), the second phase (1872 - 1885) and the third phase (1885 - 1895). The major leaders are Yixin, Prince Gong (Chinese: \u606D\u89AA\u738B), Wenxiang (Chinese: \u6587\u7965), Zeng Guofan (Chinese: \u66FE\u570B\u85E9), Li Hongzhang (Chinese: \u674E\u9D3B\u7AE0), Zuo Zongtang (Chinese: \u5DE6\u5B97\u68E0), Shen Baozhen (Chinese: \u6C88\u8446\u798E) and Zhang Zhidong (Chinese: \u5F35\u4E4B\u6D1E). However, owing to the conservatives opposition and the problems of modernization, it failed finally.\nB. The hundred days' reform (1898).\nWith the failure of the Self-Strengthening Movenment, the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War and the scramble for concessions, many Chinese leaders realised that reforms were urgently needed. Thus, the Hundred Day's Reform (Chinese: \u620A\u620C\u8B8A\u6CD5; 11 June 1898 - 21 September 1898) was started in 1898. The leaders of the reform were Guangxu Emperor, Kang Youwei (Chinese: \u5EB7\u6709\u70BA) and Liang Qichao (Chinese: \u6881\u555F\u8D85). Eventually, it ended in a coup d'\u00E9tat led by Empress Dowager Cixi.\nPolitics.\nThe Manchus changed their ways to be more like the Chinese in order to rule them better. The Manchus started wearing Chinese clothes and writing in Chinese. They began to enjoy Chinese food and art. One of the Manchu emperors, Qianlong Emperor, began to worry about how much like the Chinese the Manchus were becoming and he tried to get Manchus to be more Manchu. Qianlong Emperor made Manchus ride horses and shoot bows and arrows so that they would remember where they came from. The Chinese people used different types of clothes like maccukau, konaha, schinin and sakahn.\nRegional Development.\nIn the early Qing, Guangdong was a province. There were totally 79 counties. In 1911, it was checked that there were 5,041,780 households, approximately 28,001,564 people. The famous mountains in Guangdong were Lingchau, Huangling and Luofu. Dongjiang, Beijiang and Xijiang were the most important rivers in Guangdong. Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, Xiamen and Fujian were the major Guangdong cities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"dynasty","offset":26},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":47},{"uri":"Manchu","surface_form":"Manchu","offset":103},{"uri":"Aisin_Gioro","surface_form":"Aisin Gioro","offset":193},{"uri":"Nurhaci","surface_form":"Nurhaci","offset":241},{"uri":"Jian_Zhou","surface_form":"Jian Zhou","offset":260},{"uri":"Ming_dynasty","surface_form":"Ming dynasty","offset":285},{"uri":"Eight_Banners","surface_form":"Eight Banners","offset":345},{"uri":"Jin_dynasty","surface_form":"Jin dynasty","offset":422},{"uri":"Liao_Ling","surface_form":"Liao Ling","offset":437},{"uri":"Ning_Yuan","surface_form":"Ning Yuan","offset":486},{"uri":"Yuan_Chonghuan","surface_form":"Yuan Chonghuan","offset":531},{"uri":"Huang_Taiji","surface_form":"Huang Taiji","offset":592},{"uri":"Apoplexy","surface_form":"apoplexy","offset":736},{"uri":"Shunzhi_Emperor","surface_form":"Shunzhi Emperor","offset":746},{"uri":"Prince_Dorgon","surface_form":"Prince Dorgon","offset":794},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":911},{"uri":"Opium_Wars","surface_form":"Opium Wars","offset":1159},{"uri":"Taiping_Rebellion","surface_form":"Taiping Rebellion","offset":1190},{"uri":"Yixin","surface_form":"Yixin","offset":1560},{"uri":"Wenxiang","surface_form":"Wenxiang","offset":1595},{"uri":"Zeng_Guofan","surface_form":"Zeng Guofan","offset":1619},{"uri":"Li_Hongzhang","surface_form":"Li Hongzhang","offset":1647},{"uri":"Zuo_Zongtang","surface_form":"Zuo Zongtang","offset":1676},{"uri":"Shen_Baozhen","surface_form":"Shen Baozhen","offset":1705},{"uri":"Zhang_Zhidong","surface_form":"Zhang Zhidong","offset":1737},{"uri":"Modernization","surface_form":"modernization","offset":1834},{"uri":"First_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"First Sino-Japanese War","offset":1976},{"uri":"Scramble_for_concessions","surface_form":"scramble for concessions","offset":2008},{"uri":"Guangxu_Emperor","surface_form":"Guangxu Emperor","offset":2232},{"uri":"Kang_Youwei","surface_form":"Kang Youwei","offset":2249},{"uri":"Liang_Qichao","surface_form":"Liang Qichao","offset":2280},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":2335},{"uri":"Empress_Dowager_Cixi","surface_form":"Empress Dowager Cixi","offset":2354},{"uri":"Manchus","surface_form":"Manchus","offset":2390},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":2437},{"uri":"Clothes","surface_form":"clothes","offset":2511},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":2571},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":2580},{"uri":"Qianlong_Emperor","surface_form":"Qianlong Emperor","offset":2613},{"uri":"Bows","surface_form":"bows","offset":2803},{"uri":"Arrows","surface_form":"arrows","offset":2812},{"uri":"Guangdong","surface_form":"Guangdong","offset":3004},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":3020},{"uri":"Lingchau","surface_form":"Lingchau","offset":3196},{"uri":"Huangling","surface_form":"Huangling","offset":3206},{"uri":"Luofu","surface_form":"Luofu","offset":3220},{"uri":"Dongjiang","surface_form":"Dongjiang","offset":3227},{"uri":"Beijiang","surface_form":"Beijiang","offset":3238},{"uri":"Xijiang","surface_form":"Xijiang","offset":3251},{"uri":"Guangzhou","surface_form":"Guangzhou","offset":3304},{"uri":"Zhaoqing","surface_form":"Zhaoqing","offset":3315},{"uri":"Xiamen","surface_form":"Xiamen","offset":3325},{"uri":"Fujian","surface_form":"Fujian","offset":3336}]}
