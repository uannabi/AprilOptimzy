{"id":314603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics)","text":"In mathematics, the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative. Every real number that is non-zero is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless. In addition to putting signs into real numbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity. Usually, if numbers are seen without a sign, they are seen as a positive number. Otherwise, a minus sign \"formula_1\" is appended before the number to indicate that the number is a negative of another number.\nThe word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs, such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign.\nSign of a number.\nA real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign.\nIn arithmetic, the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number. For example, +3 would denote a positive 3, and \u22123 would denote a negative 3. When no plus or minus sign is given, the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive.\nThe sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of \u22123 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written as |\u22123| = 3 and |3| = 3.\nSign of zero.\nThe number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and \u22120 both mean the same number 0.\nMeanings of signs.\nThus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.\nThe same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.\nSign of an angle.\nIn many texts, it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle, particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.\nIt is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.\nSign of a direction.\nOn the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive \"x\"-direction, and upward being the positive \"y\"-direction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":74},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":90},{"uri":"0_(number)","surface_form":"Zero","offset":177},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"signs","offset":671},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":760},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":827},{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":988},{"uri":"Absolute_value","surface_form":"absolute value","offset":1336},{"uri":"0_(number)","surface_form":"zero","offset":1532},{"uri":"Absolute_value","surface_form":"absolute value","offset":1799},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":1930},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":2205},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotation","offset":2256},{"uri":"Clockwise","surface_form":"clockwise","offset":2329},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":2428},{"uri":"Axis_of_rotation","surface_form":"axis of rotation","offset":2623},{"uri":"Cartesian_coordinate_system","surface_form":"Cartesian plane","offset":2813}]}
