{"id":314696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_(colloid)","text":"=\"preserve\">A sol is a colloidal suspension of very small solid particles in a continuous liquid medium. They can be quite stable; examples include blood, pigmented ink, and paint.\nSols can change into viscosity quickly if they are thixotropic. Examples include quicksands and paint, both of which become more fluid under pressure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colloid","surface_form":"colloid","offset":23},{"uri":"Suspension_(chemistry)","surface_form":"suspension","offset":33},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":58},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":90},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":148},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":155},{"uri":"Ink","surface_form":"ink","offset":165},{"uri":"Paint","surface_form":"paint","offset":174},{"uri":"Viscosity","surface_form":"viscosity","offset":202},{"uri":"Thixotropic","surface_form":"thixotropic","offset":232},{"uri":"Quicksand","surface_form":"quicksand","offset":262}]}
