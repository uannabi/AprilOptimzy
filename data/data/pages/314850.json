{"id":314850,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox","text":"e=\"preserve\">Enrico Fermi's paradox wonders why, given the age and size of the universe and that there are billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years, we have not detected any other alien civilizations. There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations, along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing.\nThe physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. A paper by Michael H. Hart in 1975 made scientists more curious and they began to study the question in more detail. This is why some people call it the Fermi\u2013Hart paradox. Other common names for the same phenomenon are \"Fermi's question\" (\"Where are they?\"), the \"Fermi Problem\", the \"Great Silence\", and \"silentium universi\" (Latin for \"the silence of the universe\"; the misspelling \"silencium universi\" is also common).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enrico_Fermi","surface_form":"Enrico Fermi","offset":13},{"uri":"Age_of_the_universe","surface_form":"age","offset":59},{"uri":"Size_of_the_universe","surface_form":"size","offset":67},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":79},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":119},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":129},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"alien","offset":209},{"uri":"Civilizations","surface_form":"civilizations","offset":215},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":403},{"uri":"Enrico_Fermi","surface_form":"Enrico Fermi","offset":413},{"uri":"Michael_H._Hart","surface_form":"Michael H.
