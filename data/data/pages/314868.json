{"id":314868,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record","text":"The Voyager Golden Records are records that contain sounds and images chosen to show the life and culture on Earth. They show photographs of life on earth, including nature, cities, people and animals. They also have greetings recorded in 55 languages, songs from around the world, and non-musical sounds. The record gives specific instructions and distance measurements that can be used to pinpoint Earth's location as well. The record was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.\nThese records which were sent in the Voyager spacecraft in 1977, are for alien life forms to see. The outside of the record is designed so that aliens could understand, with instructions about how to play the record next to images. However, the records can be seen as a symbol rather than a serious attempt to contact alien life forms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gramophone_record","surface_form":"records","offset":31},{"uri":"Carl_Sagan","surface_form":"Carl Sagan","offset":470},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"extraterrestrial life","offset":501},{"uri":"Voyager_spacecraft","surface_form":"Voyager spacecraft","offset":561},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"alien","offset":597},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":794}]}
