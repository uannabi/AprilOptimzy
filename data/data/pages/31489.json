{"id":31489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane","text":"An inclined plane is a simple machine. It allows one to use less force to move an object.\nExamples of inclined planes are ramps, sloping roads and hills, plows, chisels, hatchets, carpenter's planes, and wedges. The typical example of an inclined plane is a sloped surface; for example a roadway to bridge at a different height.\nAnother simple machine based on the inclined plane is the blade, in which two inclined planes placed back to back allow the two parts of the cut object to move apart using less force than would be needed to pull them apart in opposite directions.\nCalculation of forces acting on an object on an inclined planes.\nTo calculate the forces on an object placed on an inclined plane, consider the three forces acting on it.\nWe can break the force from gravity into two vectors, one perpendicular to the plane and one parallel to the plane. Since there is no movement perpendicular to the plane, the component of the gravitational force in this direction (\"mg\" cos \"\u03B8\") must be equal and opposite to normal force exerted by the plane, \"N\". Therefore, formula_1.\nIf the component of the force from gravity parallel to the surface (\"mg\" sin \"\u03B8\") is greater than the static frictional force \"fs\" \u2013 then the body will slide down the inclined plane with acceleration where \"fk\" is the force of friction \u2013 otherwise it will remain stationary.\nWhen the angle of the slope (\"\u03B8\") is zero, sin \"\u03B8\" is also zero, so the body will not move.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Simple_machine","surface_form":"simple machine","offset":23},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":65},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":82},{"uri":"Ramp","surface_form":"ramp","offset":122},{"uri":"Plow","surface_form":"plow","offset":154},{"uri":"Chisel","surface_form":"chisel","offset":161},{"uri":"Hatchet","surface_form":"hatchet","offset":170},{"uri":"Plane_(tool)","surface_form":"planes","offset":192},{"uri":"Wedge_(mechanics)","surface_form":"wedges","offset":204},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":288},{"uri":"Blade","surface_form":"blade","offset":387},{"uri":"Static_friction","surface_form":"static friction","offset":1186},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":1311}]}
