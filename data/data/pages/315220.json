Wittgenstein himself insisted that they did not understand him correctly and took to quietly reading poetry to himself during their meetings.\nThe Vienna Circle was broken up when the Nazi party came to power in Germany in 1933, many of its members moved to the USA, where they became teachers in several universities.\nThe Vienna Circle's influence on 20th century philosophy was very large.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":88},{"uri":"University_of_Vienna","surface_form":"University of Vienna","offset":130},{"uri":"Logical_positivism","surface_form":"logical positivism","offset":214},{"uri":"Nazi_party","surface_form":"Nazi party","offset":523}]}
