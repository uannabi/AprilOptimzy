{"id":315305,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Regional_League_West","text":"The Regionalliga West is one of three 3rd level football leagues in Austria. The Regionalliga West is formed by teams from the federal states Vorarlberg, Tyrol (only North Tyrol) and Salzburg. The league was formed in the 1980/81 season.\nThe champions of the three leagues have to play relegation matches against the 9th from the first league. Amateur teams of professional clubs are not allowed to promote, so Red Bull Juniors, last seasons champion, is still playing in this league.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vorarlberg","surface_form":"Vorarlberg","offset":142},{"uri":"Tyrol_(state)","surface_form":"Tyrol","offset":154},{"uri":"North_Tyrol","surface_form":"North Tyrol","offset":166},{"uri":"Salzburg_(state)","surface_form":"Salzburg","offset":183}]}
