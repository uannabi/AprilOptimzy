{"id":315321,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_material","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ultralight materials are very light substances. They include silica aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, metallic foams, polymeric foams, and metallic microlattices. The density of air is about 1.275\u00A0mg/cm3, which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material.\nThe lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. It is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes \u2013 a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes. The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong. The material is low density: it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre. Silica aerogels, the world's lightest \"solid\" materials, are only as low as 1.0\u00A0mg per cubic cm. The metallic micro-lattices are 99.99% air and only 0.01% solid. The metal used is nickel.\nThe material is not just light: it has some elastic properties. When it is squashed, the little tubes are also squashed, but when the pressure is removed, they rebound. A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98% when the pressure is lifted. That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers: they are materials used to cushion against shock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":74},{"uri":"Aerogel","surface_form":"aerogel","offset":81},{"uri":"Carbon_nanotube","surface_form":"carbon nanotube","offset":91},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":117},{"uri":"Foam","surface_form":"foam","offset":126},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":133},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":182},{"uri":"Pore","surface_form":"pore","offset":252},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscopic","offset":376},{"uri":"Lattice","surface_form":"lattice","offset":394},{"uri":"Diagonal","surface_form":"diagonal","offset":434},{"uri":"Styrofoam","surface_form":"Styrofoam","offset":546},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"Silica","offset":662},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":842},{"uri":"Elastic","surface_form":"elastic","offset":894},{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"properties","offset":902},{"uri":"Squash","surface_form":"squashed","offset":925},{"uri":"Elastomer","surface_form":"elastomer","offset":1146},{"uri":"Shock","surface_form":"shock","offset":1201}]}
