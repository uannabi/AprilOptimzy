{"id":315374,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_%C3%A0_deux","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"This is about the mental disorder, the studio album is at Folie \u00E0 Deux (album)\"\nFolie \u00E0 deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis. If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions, people speak about \"folie \u00E0 trois\" (3), \"folie \u00E0 quatre\" (4), \"folie \u00E0 plusieurs\", or \"folie en famille\". Officially, the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today, but many publications still use the original terms, which were developed in France in the 19th century.\nNewer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe 'folie \u00E0 deux'. There may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above. Also, in many cases, separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go away in one of them. Also, the person described as \"sane\" before developing the folie \u00E0 deux may already be suffering from a psychiatric illness, or may develop one.\nThe condition was first described in an article pubilshed by Ernest-Charles Las\u00E8gue and Jules Farlet in 1877.\nMass hysteria can be seen as a form of folie \u00E0 deux.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Folie_%C3%A0_Deux_(album)","surface_form":"Folie \u00E0 Deux (album)","offset":73},{"uri":"Delusion","surface_form":"delusion","offset":193},{"uri":"Psychosis","surface_form":"psychosis","offset":230},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":582},{"uri":"Ernest-Charles_Las%C3%A8gue","surface_form":"Ernest-Charles Las\u00E8gue","offset":1115},{"uri":"Jules_Farlet","surface_form":"Jules Farlet","offset":1142},{"uri":"Mass_hysteria","surface_form":"Mass hysteria","offset":1164}]}
