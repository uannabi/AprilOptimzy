{"id":315402,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nexus","text":"The Nexus is a series of Android smartphones and tablets produced by Google in co-operation with some phone-making companies. The purpose of the Nexus phones and tablets is to offer a \"pure Android experience\", in which the phones or tablets come free of carrier or manufacturer modifications and with an unlockable bootloader to allow for further development and end-user modification. Nexus phones and tablets were once considered the \"flagship\" Android devices. The Nexus line was later replaced with the Google Pixel.\nThe series also had a media streaming device known as the Nexus Q, however it was never officially released because it didn't have enough features to make it worth using.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Android_(operating_system)","surface_form":"Android","offset":25},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":69},{"uri":"Google_Pixel","surface_form":"Google Pixel","offset":508}]}
