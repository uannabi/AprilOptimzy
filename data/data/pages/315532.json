{"id":315532,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbro","text":"Gabbro is a large group of dark, coarse-grained, igneous rocks. They are chemically equivalent to basalt. The rocks are plutonic, formed when molten magma is trapped under the Earth's surface and cools into a crystalline mass.\nMost of the Earth's surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust, produced by basalt magmatism at mid-ocean ridges. In general, when the gabbro is formed, it lies above the Earth's mantle, and below the basalt.\nGabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater. It is an essential part of the oceanic crust. Long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient rift zone margins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Igneous_rock","surface_form":"igneous rock","offset":49},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":98},{"uri":"Intrusive","surface_form":"plutonic","offset":120},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":149},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":176},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":209},{"uri":"Oceanic_crust","surface_form":"oceanic crust","offset":273},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":307},{"uri":"Mid-ocean_ridge","surface_form":"mid-ocean ridge","offset":320},{"uri":"Earth%27s_mantle","surface_form":"Earth's mantle","offset":395},{"uri":"Oceanic_crust","surface_form":"oceanic crust","offset":552},{"uri":"Rift_(geology)","surface_form":"rift zone","offset":629}]}
