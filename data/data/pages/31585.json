{"id":31585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelid","text":"Camelids are a group of even-toed ungulate mammals. They form the family Camelidae. There are six living species of camelids.\nTaxonomy.\nThe animals of the genus \"Camelus\" are also called \"Afro-Asiatic Camelids\". The animals of the genus \"Lama\" and genus \"Vicugna\" are also called \"South American Camelids\".\nHybrid.\nThere also exists a camelid hybrid called a \"Cama\". It is the child of a female Llama and a male Dromedary Camel. The Cama does not exist in nature, but is \"made\" by humans through artificial insemination (that means the sperm is artificially put into the female).\nHabitat.\nThe two \"Camelus\" species originally lived in northern Africa, south-west and eastern Asia. The other four camelids lived in South America.\nCamelids and humans.\nCamelids have been domesticated by humans for about 5000 years. They have been important for transport, but were also kept for wool, meat and milk. The llama and alpaca were very important for the South American cultures, like the Inca. The camels were used by people in north Africa and Asia, especially in deserts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Even-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"even-toed ungulate","offset":24},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":43},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":66},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":105},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":343},{"uri":"Artificial_insemination","surface_form":"artificial insemination","offset":496},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":536},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":644},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":675},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":714},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":769},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":877},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":883},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":892},{"uri":"Inca","surface_form":"Inca","offset":981},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1058}]}
