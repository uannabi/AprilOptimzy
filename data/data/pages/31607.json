{"id":31607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Russian Civil War was a civil war fought from November 1917 until October 1922 between several groups in Russia. The main fighting was between the Red Army and the White Army. The Red Army was an army of communists. The White Army opposed the communists. Other forces fought against both these groups or sometimes helped one against the other. Foreign countries such as Japan, Britain, France and the United States sent troops to help the divided white army. The Red Army won this war because their army was better-organized and they held the best territory. After this war, the communists established the Soviet Union in 1922.\nTsar Nicholas II, the traditional, autocratic ruler of the Russian Empire, had just lost his throne in the February Revolution of 1917. Many regions of the Russian Empire were not stable. Many groups had organized themselves to fight. The workers and farmers supporting the communists organized themselves into the Red Army. People opposing them organized themselves into the White Army.\nIn Ukraine, some groups fighting for a free Ukraine organized themselves as the Green Army. There were several other groups. The Green Army and the smaller groups fought each other, and sometimes they fought the Red Army and the White Army. Other nationalist armies fought for independence from any kind of Russian control. Finland, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia succeeded.\nAt the same time, some foreign countries were worried about the communists ruling the Soviet Union. They feared that communism would come to their countries also if the communists were successful so they helped fight against the communists\u2019 Red Army. They started the Siberian Intervention and otherwise helped the Whites. Slowly, the war became very large and continued for years.\nThe periods.\nThe Red Army and the White Army fought this war on three main fronts. These regions were located in the east, the south and the northwest of the Soviet Union. There were also three main periods of the war. The outbreak of the Russian Civil War and its big scale surprised Vladimir Lenin.\nSoon after the Russian Revolution of 1917, the first period of the Russian Civil War began. Most of the fighting in this period was on a small scale. But, the fighting started at many places.\nThe second period of the Russian Civil War was a very important phase. It lasted from January to November of 1919] At first the White Army was winning on all three fronts. Some foreign countries were helping the White Army. But, Leon Trotsky reorganized the Red Army. The Red Army fought back, and the White Army\u2019s loss was heavy. The White Army almost lost its fighting power.\nFighting in Crimea was the third and final period of the war. Many soldiers of the White Army had gathered in Crimea. They had made their position very secure and strong. The Red Army continued to fight with them. When the Polish-Soviet War ended in Polish independence, more soldiers of the Red Army could reinforce their comrades in Crimea. This action defeated the White Army in November 1920. Fighting continued against nationalists in the Caucusus in the early 1920s.\nAfter the war.\nDuring and after the Russian Civil War, Soviet Russia suffered great damage. In 1920 and 1921, there was little rain which caused serious famine in 1921. About one million Russians left Russia and went to other countries to live there on a permanent basis. Many of them were very educated and expert persons.\nEconomic loss was also very big. The value of Russia\u2019s currency (ruble) fell. In 1914, with 2 rubles one could buy a US dollar. In 1920, one had to give 1,200 rubles to buy one US dollar. Estimates say that the war cost the Soviet Russia around 50 billion rubles or $35,000,000,000.00 in today\u2019s price. Production of industrial goods fell to very low level. For example, The Soviet Union was producing only 5 % of the cotton, and only 2 % of the iron ore, compared to the production of 1913. Generally, the production had fallen to 20% of the production of 1913.\nThe Russian Civil War had a very bad effect on agriculture also. Farms produced only 37 % of the normal production. The number of horses fell from 35 million (in 1916) to 24 million (in 1920). The number of cattle also decreased, from 58 million to 37 million.\nDuring this war, the government of the Soviet Union could somehow manage the country. In March 1921, four months after the defeat of the White Army in the Crimea, the Lenin administration abandoned the policy of War Communism and instead formulated the New Economic Policy which allowed denationalisation of agriculture and industry, but most financial institutions retained state ownership with a deregulation in such sectors. On 30 December 1922, the USSR was formally created, and by 1928, production returned to pre-war levels. Lenin, however, did not live to see that day:. He died in 1924 and Joseph Stalin became the new leader.\nThe result of the First World War and the Russian Civil War was very bad for the life and society for the newborn Soviet Union. People always remembered their bad results.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":122},{"uri":"Red_Army","surface_form":"Red Army","offset":164},{"uri":"White_Army","surface_form":"White Army","offset":181},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":221},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":623},{"uri":"Nicholas_II_of_Russia","surface_form":"Tsar Nicholas II","offset":645},{"uri":"Autocratic","surface_form":"autocratic","offset":680},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":704},{"uri":"February_Revolution","surface_form":"February Revolution","offset":752},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":1036},{"uri":"Green_Army","surface_form":"Green Army","offset":1113},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":1310},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":1357},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":1366},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":1374},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":1385},{"uri":"Estonia","surface_form":"Estonia","offset":1396},{"uri":"Siberian_Intervention","surface_form":"Siberian Intervention","offset":1683},{"uri":"Vladimir_Lenin","surface_form":"Vladimir Lenin","offset":2082},{"uri":"Leon_Trotsky","surface_form":"Leon Trotsky","offset":2519},{"uri":"Crimea","surface_form":"Crimea","offset":2680},{"uri":"Polish-Soviet_War","surface_form":"Polish-Soviet War","offset":2891},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":3059},{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucusus","offset":3112},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":3245},{"uri":"1914","surface_form":"1914","offset":3546},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":3883},{"uri":"1913","surface_form":"1913","offset":3951},{"uri":"War_Communism","surface_form":"War Communism","offset":4501},{"uri":"New_Economic_Policy","surface_form":"New Economic Policy","offset":4542},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":4888}]}
