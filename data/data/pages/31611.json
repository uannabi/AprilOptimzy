It is also called \"El Ni\u00F1o\" and \"La Ni\u00F1a\". In Spanish they mean \"little boy\" and \"little girl\".\nEl Ni\u00F1o happens when the sea water temperature rises in surface waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Every two to five years the Pacific Ocean has this event. A weak, warm current starts around Christmas along the coast of Ecuador and Peru. It lasts for only a few weeks to a month or more. Every three to seven years, an El Ni\u00F1o event may last for many months. This can change the weather and have important effects around the world. Australia and Southeast Asia can have drought but the deserts of Peru have very heavy rainfall. East Africa can have both. In a La Ni\u00F1a event the weather patterns are reversed.\nThe Southern Oscillation was discovered by Sir Gilbert Walker in 1923. It is a \"seesaw\" of atmospheric pressure between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. There is an inverse relationship between the air pressure measured at two sites: Darwin, Australia, in the Indian Ocean and the island of Tahiti in the South Pacific. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is the difference in sea-level pressure measured at Tahiti and Darwin. The Cold Tongue (CT) Index measures how much the average sea-surface temperature in the central and eastern Pacific near the equator varies from the annual cycle. The two measurements are anti-correlated, so that a negative SOI is usually together with an unusual warm ocean wind known as El Ni\u00F1o.\nBy the early 1980s it was clear that El Ni\u00F1o and the Southern Oscillation were related, and the acronym ENSO is used to describe this large-scale event.\nThe 2010-2011 Queensland floods were caused by a La Ni\u00F1a event which brought very heavy rain to the east coast of Australia. Other big floods in Australia have also happened during a La Ni\u00F1a, 1916, 1917, 1950, 1954-1956, and 1973-1975. The cost of the 2010-2011 Queensland floods has been worked out to A$30 billion.\nCentral Pacific El Ni\u00F1o.\nNot all El Ni\u00F1os happen in the Eastern Pacific. During recent decades, Central Pacific El Ni\u00F1os have been discovered. When these happen, the effects from CP El Ni\u00F1os are very different from traditional El Ni\u00F1os. Central Pacific El Ni\u00F1os took place in 1986\u201388, 1991\u201392, 1994\u201395, 2002\u201303, 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307, 2009\u201310 and 2015\u201316.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":99},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":288},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":405},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":434},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":446},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":646},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":660},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":684},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":742},{"uri":"Seesaw","surface_form":"seesaw","offset":903},{"uri":"Atmospheric_pressure","surface_form":"atmospheric pressure","offset":914},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":959},{"uri":"Darwin%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Darwin, Australia","offset":1055},{"uri":"Tahiti","surface_form":"Tahiti","offset":1112},{"uri":"Sea-level","surface_form":"sea-level","offset":1199},{"uri":"Correlation","surface_form":"correlated","offset":1442},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":1643},{"uri":"2010-2011_Queensland_floods","surface_form":"2010-2011 Queensland floods","offset":1704},{"uri":"A%24","surface_form":"A$","offset":2003}]}
