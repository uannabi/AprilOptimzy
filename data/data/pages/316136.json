{"id":316136,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_analysis","text":"=\"preserve\">Stress analysis is the study of stresses and strains in materials and structures as force is applied against them. It is a topic in engineering. Stress may cause deformation or fractures in materials. Stress analysis is about finding out how much stress causes deformation in a given material.\nStress analysis is an important task for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers. They work on the design of structures of all sizes, such as bridges and dams, machines, and even plastic cutlery and staples. Stress analysis is also used in the maintenance of such structures, and to investigate the causes of structural failures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stress_(mechanics)","surface_form":"stresses","offset":44},{"uri":"Strain_(mechanics)","surface_form":"strains","offset":57},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":96},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":144},{"uri":"Deformation","surface_form":"deformation","offset":174},{"uri":"Material_fracture","surface_form":"fractures","offset":189},{"uri":"Civil_engineering","surface_form":"civil","offset":347},{"uri":"Mechanical_engineering","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":354},{"uri":"Aerospace_engineering","surface_form":"aerospace engineers","offset":369},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":450},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":462},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":468},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":487},{"uri":"Cutlery","surface_form":"cutlery","offset":495},{"uri":"Staple_(fastener)","surface_form":"staples","offset":507}]}
