Based on 2007 statistics the country has about 66,940 troops, and a paramilitary force of 15,000 troops. There are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last fifteen years.\nAzerbaijan had actually established the Azerbaijani Armed Forces and a Ministry of Defense on June 26, 1918 with the first independence of Azerbaijan, as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, after the collpase of the Russian Empire in 1918 until it was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1920 which came after the Russian Empire. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense were established again in 1991 with the second and final independence of Azerbaijan, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the Azerbaijani Armed Forces were formed out of the former Soviet forces in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":39},{"uri":"Republic_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Republic of Azerbaijan","offset":55},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_Land_Force","surface_form":"Azerbaijani Land Force","offset":121},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_Air_Force","surface_form":"Azerbaijani Air Force","offset":149},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_Navy","surface_form":"Azerbaijani Navy","offset":180},{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":277},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_National_Guard","surface_form":"Azerbaijani National Guard","offset":290},{"uri":"Internal_Troops_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Internal Troops of Azerbaijan","offset":322},{"uri":"State_Border_Service_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"State Border Service of Azerbaijan","offset":361},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":434},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":443},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":451},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":457},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":468},{"uri":"Defense_(military)","surface_form":"defense","offset":509},{"uri":"Commander-in-Chief","surface_form":"Commander-in-Chief","offset":522},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":548},{"uri":"President_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"President of Azerbaijan","offset":564},{"uri":"Ilham_Aliyev","surface_form":"Ilham Aliyev","offset":599},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_Ministry_of_Defense","surface_form":"Ministry of Defense","offset":617},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":653},{"uri":"Safar_Abiyev","surface_form":"Safar Abiyev","offset":700},{"uri":"General_Staff","surface_form":"General Staff","offset":754},{"uri":"Colonel-General","surface_form":"Colonel-General","offset":806},{"uri":"Najmaddin_Sadigov","surface_form":"Najmaddin Sadigov","offset":822},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":863},{"uri":"Statistic","surface_form":"statistic","offset":1010},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"troops","offset":1050},{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":1064},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"military service","offset":1157},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"Azerbaijan Democratic Republic","offset":1359},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":1417},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invaded","offset":1453},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexed","offset":1465},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1480},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1706},{"uri":"Red_Army","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":1784},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic","offset":1805}]}
