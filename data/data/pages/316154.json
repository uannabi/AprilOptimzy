{"id":316154,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_Air_Force","text":"The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force often called the Azerbaijani Air Force () is the air force and air defence force of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.\nThe origin of the current organization goes back to June 26, 1918, when the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic which became independent in 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire, bought its first fighter aircraft. After the second independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the presence of former Soviet air bases in Azerbaijan helped the Air and Air Defence Force develop.\nCurrent organization.\nThe Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has about 600 aircraft and 350 helicopters, and 7,900 personnel. There are Soviet-made MiG-21s, MiG-23s, Su-24s and Su-25s, as well as fourth generation MiG-29s bought from Ukraine in 2006 and Soviet-made Il-76s. Azerbaijan is holding talks with either China or Pakistan to buy JF-17 Thunder aircraft. The MiG-29 has been chosen as the standard aircraft for the Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Air_force","surface_form":"air force","offset":91},{"uri":"Air_defence","surface_form":"air defence","offset":105},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"Azerbaijani Armed Forces","offset":130},{"uri":"June_26","surface_form":"June 26","offset":208},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":217},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"Azerbaijan Democratic Republic","offset":232},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":276},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":291},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":323},{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":356},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":421},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":453},{"uri":"Air_base","surface_form":"air base","offset":497},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":645},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":662},{"uri":"MiG-21","surface_form":"MiG-21","offset":718},{"uri":"MiG-23","surface_form":"MiG-23","offset":727},{"uri":"Su-24","surface_form":"Su-24","offset":736},{"uri":"Su-25","surface_form":"Su-25","offset":747},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":773},{"uri":"MiG-29","surface_form":"MiG-29","offset":784},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":804},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":815},{"uri":"Il-76","surface_form":"Il-76","offset":836},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":884},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":893},{"uri":"Buy","surface_form":"buy","offset":905},{"uri":"JF-17","surface_form":"JF-17","offset":909}]}
