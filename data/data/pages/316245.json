The Brothers Grimm heard it from Dortchen Wild in Cassel and published it in their \"Children's and Household Tales\" in 1812. The Grimms revised the tale over the years. They gave the children names, changed the mother to a stepmother, and introduced Christian motifs. Their final version is dated 1857. The tale has been adapted to many media, most notably the opera \"H\u00E4nsel und Gretel\" (1893) by Engelbert Humperdinck. A stop-motion animated movie based on the opera was made in the 1950s.\nStory.\nHansel and Gretel are a young brother and sister who learn their parents intend to abandon them in the forest. They find their way home by leaving a trail of pebbles. One day, however, their parents succeed. The children wander the forest and come upon a house made of cake and candy.
