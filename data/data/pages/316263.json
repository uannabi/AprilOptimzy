When Singapore became independent from Malaysia in 1965, the country began sending its own team again. It sent a team for every summer games after then, except in 1980. The country boycotted the 1980 games along with many other countries. No athletes from Singapore have been in any Winter Olympic Games.\nOlympic medals.\nThe country has won four Olympic medals.
