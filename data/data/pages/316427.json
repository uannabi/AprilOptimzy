{"id":316427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasties_in_Chinese_history","text":"Many Chinese dynasties have ruled the country during its history. China is a society which has had a very long history. This history was affected by the dynasties which have ruled it. They have slowly changed China into its current form.\nXia dynasty.\nThe Xia dynasty lasted from 2070 BC until 1600 BC. It was the first ruling dynasty in Chinese history. The Xia was probably created by emperor Yu the Great. It is not known for certain if the Xia dynasty actually existed. Many people think that the Xia dynasty is only a legend. This is because there is no evidence that can prove that there was some dynasty before 1600 BC. There were found some archaeological excavations from 1500 BC which may come from the Xia dynasty. For example one of the excavations causes archaeologists to believe that the foundations of China were created during the Xia dynasty. Also there are findings of the oldest Chinese calendar called a lunar calendar. Xia dynasty was ended by a dynasty named Shang.\nShang dynasty.\nThe Shang dynasty lasted from 1600 BC until 1046 BC. It started when Tang took control from the last Xia emperor, Jie. The dynasty ended with the suicide of Di Xin.\nThe Shang dynasty was important for Chinese culture. The first Chinese character fonts were created at this time. They were mainly used by seers and shaman. People made their own ritualvessels, agricultural and craft tools and even weapons. Everything was made of cast bronze.\nIn agriculture, millets, wheats and rice were the main crops. Mulberries were also grown. They were used to feed mulberry silkworms.\nZhou dynasty.\nThe Zhou dynasty lasted from 1045 BC until 256 BC. The Shangs had became weak because they were always fighting with a neighboring tribes. This was good for the less advanced Zhou. They defeat the Shang in the current town of An-yang. After that, the Zhou dynasty took the government. They ruled for the longest time of all Chinese dynasties.\nZhous were nomadic shepherds from the Shanxi province. The rulers of Zhou dynasty divided the country into four smaller areas. Each of these areas were controlled by relatives and members of aristocracy. Princes controlled fortified towns with a peasant background. They also helped the rulers at times of war. This form of government allowed the Zhou rulers to control more area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":38},{"uri":"History_of_China","surface_form":"history","offset":57},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":66},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":77},{"uri":"Xia_dynasty","surface_form":"Xia dynasty","offset":255},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":386},{"uri":"Yu_the_Great","surface_form":"Yu the Great","offset":394},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":522},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":558},{"uri":"Prove","surface_form":"prove","offset":576},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeological excavations","offset":648},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":906},{"uri":"Lunar_calendar","surface_form":"lunar calendar","offset":924},{"uri":"Shang_dynasty","surface_form":"Shang dynasty","offset":1007},{"uri":"Tang_of_Shang","surface_form":"Tang","offset":1072},{"uri":"Jie_of_Xia","surface_form":"Jie","offset":1117},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":1149},{"uri":"King_Zhou_of_Shang","surface_form":"Di Xin","offset":1160},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1212},{"uri":"Chinese_character","surface_form":"Chinese character","offset":1231},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":1249},{"uri":"Seer","surface_form":"seer","offset":1307},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"shaman","offset":1317},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":1347},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":1362},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":1379},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":1400},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"cast bronze","offset":1432},{"uri":"Millet","surface_form":"millet","offset":1461},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":1470},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":1481},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":1500},{"uri":"Mulberry","surface_form":"Mulberries","offset":1507},{"uri":"Silkworm","surface_form":"mulberry silkworm","offset":1558},{"uri":"Zhou_Dynasty","surface_form":"Zhou dynasty","offset":1596},{"uri":"Neighbor","surface_form":"neighbor","offset":1711},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":1723},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1810},{"uri":"Anyang_(Henan)","surface_form":"An-yang","offset":1818},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1865},{"uri":"Nomad","surface_form":"nomad","offset":1946},{"uri":"Shepherd","surface_form":"shepherd","offset":1954},{"uri":"Shaanxi","surface_form":"Shanxi province","offset":1973},{"uri":"Relative","surface_form":"relative","offset":2101},{"uri":"Aristocracy","surface_form":"aristocracy","offset":2126},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"Prince","offset":2139},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortified","offset":2158},{"uri":"Peasant","surface_form":"peasant","offset":2181},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":2241}]}
