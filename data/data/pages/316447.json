{"id":316447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_gear_shifting","text":"In 1861, Pirren Michaux invented the first bicycle with pedals. Later bicycles are more complex. They have a drivetrain. The first bicycle gearshift was constructed at the beginning of the 20th century. It had two speeds. Now, some bicycles have electronic gear shifting.\nHow it works.\nThe standard system for gearing up and down works with bowdens. A bowden is special kind of wound steel cable, which connects levers to the shifter, derailleur or brakes. As the rider pulls or taps a lever, the bowden reacts at the same time. That causes the bicycle to change gear.\nElectronic works without bowdens. The system is digital. There is no wound steel cable. Instead, there are multiple combinations of 0 and 1. A battery placed under the frame powers the system. Each battery should last for 1000\u00A0km depending on the manufacturer. Then it needs to be recharged. Wires for data and power are hidden inside the frame. Parts of the shifting systems are connected to each other. Servomotors do the shifting. The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built into them. There is a self-adjustable microchip in the derailleur. The system has its own logic, which keeps the chain from dropping. There is no need for maintenance because the derailleur adjusts itself using the microchip.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":43},{"uri":"Pedal","surface_form":"pedal","offset":56},{"uri":"Drivetrain","surface_form":"drivetrain","offset":109},{"uri":"Gearshift","surface_form":"gearshift","offset":139},{"uri":"Cable","surface_form":"cable","offset":390},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"lever","offset":412},{"uri":"Brake","surface_form":"brake","offset":449}]}
