{"id":316503,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor","text":"Valve Hammer Editor, which used to be called Worldcraft and is now often called Hammer, is Valve Corporation's map creation program for their game engines, Source and formerly GoldSrc. Worldcraft was originally made for Quake and Quake II, but is now used on other games such as \"Half-Life 2\", ' and \"Left 4 Dead 2\".\nHistory.\nIn September 1996, Ben Morris created and released the original Worldcraft as a tool for making custom Quake maps. On July 14, 1997, Valve hired Ben Morris and started to use Worldcraft in \"Half-Life\".\nBasic tools.\nHammer uses four windows: three grids and a 3D view. Many tools are available to the user. Work on a map starts by the user creating the main world out of blocks called \"brushes\". These brushes can be made to look different by selecting images called \"textures\" to paint onto it. Many other tools can change the look and shape of these brushes to create any shape or figure the user wants.\nSmaller parts of a level can be made out of \"props\", which cannot be made in Hammer and only in a 3D drawing program. Special devices called \"entities\" can be used to give a level functionality. Entities can be anything from where the player starts (called \"info_player_start\" in Hammer) to specific guns to non-player characters.\nFile format.\nMaps save in the \".vmf\" (Valve Map File) format, but cannot be played in-game until it is compiled. Compiled maps take all the entities and lights and transform it into a format that the desired game can read (\".bsp\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Valve_Corporation","surface_form":"Valve Corporation","offset":91},{"uri":"Game_engine","surface_form":"game engines","offset":142},{"uri":"Half-Life_2","surface_form":"Half-Life 2","offset":280},{"uri":"Left_4_Dead_2","surface_form":"Left 4 Dead 2","offset":301},{"uri":"Half-Life","surface_form":"Half-Life","offset":516}]}
