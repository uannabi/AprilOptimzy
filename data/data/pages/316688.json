It was built in 1307. It was built by order of Eli\u0161ka Rej\u010Dka because the church of St. Klement was too small. The church was burned and rebuilt several times between the 14th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, the church was plundered by Swedish soldiers. In 1664, Pope Alexander VII blessed the church as a cathedral. The last repairs were done after World War II.\nInterior.\nThe cathedral has an old Gothic altar from the end of the 15th century.
