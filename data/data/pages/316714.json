Many things can be resolved through an arbitration committee. An arbitration committee can help with disagreements about things in articles, block users or stop certain users from editing articles on certain topics. Misuse of an administrator's privileges can also be easily appealed.\nThe Chuvash Wikipedia accepts fair use content. Many things are allowed. One thing that is not allowed is categorizing or listing people based on their ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Such categories are usually not allowed unless the category is relevant to the main activity of a person.\nHistory.\nThe Chuvash Wikipedia was created on November 22, 2004.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chuvash_language","surface_form":"Chuvash language","offset":32},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":60},{"uri":"Arbitration_committee","surface_form":"arbitration committee","offset":348},{"uri":"Fair_use","surface_form":"fair use","offset":624},{"uri":"Ethnicity","surface_form":"ethnicity","offset":746},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":757},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":769}]}
