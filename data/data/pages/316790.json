{"id":316790,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_aviation","text":"Air travel has a major impact on the world's environment, especially the atmosphere. With fast globalisation, air traffic has quickly increased, and is one of the biggest causes of climate change.\nThis is due to the noise pollution emitted from the aircraft while it is flying. It also takes fuel to fly the planes which causes pollution. Aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can carry more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle.\nPublic awareness of the impact of aircraft on the environment is a lot less compared with automobiles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":45},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":73},{"uri":"Globalisation","surface_form":"globalisation","offset":95},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":181},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":292},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"pollution","offset":328},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":579},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":635}]}
