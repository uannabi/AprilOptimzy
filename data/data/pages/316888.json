{"id":316888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_people","text":"e=\"preserve\">Arakanese is a nationality in Myanmar; they form the majority along the coastal region of present-day Rakhine State or Arakan State. They possibly constitute 5.53% or more of Myanmar's total population but no accurate census figures exist. Arakanese or Rakhine people also live in the southeastern parts of Bangladesh, especially in Chittagong and Barisal Divisions. A group of Arakanese descendants, living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least since the 16th century, are known as the Marma people. These Arakanese descendants have been living in that area since the Arakanese kingdom's control of the Chittagong region.\nArakanese descendants spread as far north as Tripura state in India, where their presence dates back to the ascent of the Arakanese kingdom when Tripura was ruled by Arakanese kings. In northeast India, these Arakanese people are referred to as the Mog, while in Bengali, the Marma (the ethnic Arakanese descendants in Bangladesh) and other Arakanese people are referred to as the Magh people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":43},{"uri":"Arakan_State","surface_form":"Arakan State","offset":132},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":231},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":320},{"uri":"Chittagong_Hill_Tracts","surface_form":"Chittagong Hill Tracts","offset":428},{"uri":"Tripura","surface_form":"Tripura","offset":696}]}
