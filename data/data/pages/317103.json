{"id":317103,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowbar","text":"e=\"preserve\"> A crowbar is a metal tool used mainly to pry things open. It is usually hook shaped. Sometimes the bottom is slightly curved to allow for better leverage. Some crowbars have a notched an end for removing nails. Crowbars are often made of carbon steel. They can also be made of titanium which is lighter and non-magnetic. The first known use of the word was somewhere in the 1400s where they were simply called crows or iron crows.\nIt is used as a lever either to force apart two objects or to remove nails. Crowbars are commonly used to open nailed wooden crates. Common uses for larger crowbars are: removing nails, prying apart boards, and generally breaking things. Crowbars can be used as any of the three lever classes but the curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second class lever. In mining, crowbars are used to break blasted rocks and to remove loose rock on roof sides and the working face, but not much in modern mining.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":29},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":35},{"uri":"Pry","surface_form":"pry","offset":55},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"lever","offset":159},{"uri":"Carbon_steel","surface_form":"carbon steel","offset":252},{"uri":"Titanium","surface_form":"titanium","offset":291},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"non-magnetic","offset":321}]}
