{"id":317302,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilineal_evolution","text":"=\"preserve\">Unilineal evolution, also called classical social evolution, was a 19th-century social theory about the evolution of societies and cultures.\nThere were different theories by various sociologists and anthropologists. However, they all believed that Western culture is the peak of social evolution. Social status is seen as a single line that goes from most primitive to most civilized. This theory is now generally considered obsolete in universities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sociologist","surface_form":"sociologist","offset":194},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":211},{"uri":"Western_culture","surface_form":"Western culture","offset":260},{"uri":"Obsolete","surface_form":"obsolete","offset":437}]}
