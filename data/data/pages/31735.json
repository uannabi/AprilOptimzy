{"id":31735,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement","text":"Measurement means compare to a fix standard value. To measure something is to give a number to some property of the thing. Measuring something puts the amount of the thing into numbers. Measurement can be written using many different units. For example, if we want to compare two different sized container for holding a given quantity of liquid so we can ask: Are both containers the same size? Will they hold the same amount of liquid?\nWhat can be measured?\nOne can measure many other things.\nUnits of measurement.\nMost properties are measured using a number and a unit of measurement. The unit of measurement is a standard amount. The number compares the property to the standard amount.\nMeasure theory.\nThere is an advanced part of mathematics that is about measuring things with unusual characteristics. This is called measure theory.\nMeasurement can be the capacity, how long something is, or distance, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amount","surface_form":"amount","offset":152},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":177},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":553},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit of measurement","offset":566},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":616},{"uri":"Advanced","surface_form":"advanced","offset":718},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":735},{"uri":"Unusual","surface_form":"unusual","offset":783},{"uri":"Characteristic","surface_form":"characteristic","offset":791},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":831}]}
