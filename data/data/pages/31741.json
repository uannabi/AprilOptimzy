{"id":31741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown","text":"James Gordon Brown (born 20 February 1951) is a British politician. He served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and was the leader of the British Labour Party. He was the Labour MP Representative for the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath UK Constituency.\nHe was born at Orchard Maternity Nursing Home in Giffnock, Scotland and is married to Sarah Macaulay. Their daughter Jennifer Jane died as a baby. They have two sons, John Macaulay and James Fraser. Brown is blind in his left eye after a sports injury but he has a replacement eye made of glass.\nBrown took over as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after Tony Blair resigned on 27 June 2007. Before this, he had been Chancellor of the Exchequer since May 1997.\nBrown has a PhD in history from the University of Edinburgh. He spent his early career working as a television journalist. He has been a Member of Parliament since 1983. At the beginning for Dunfermline East and since 2005 for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he was also First Lord of the Treasury and the Minister for the Civil Service.\nBrown's time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's financial and fiscal policy architecture. For example, was the interest rate setting power transferred to the Bank of England. This was done by a wide extension of the powers of the Treasury to cover much domestic policy and by giving the responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Controversial moves included the abolition of Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) relief in his first budget, and the removal in his final budget of the 10 per cent \"starting rate\" of personal income tax which he had introduced in 1999.\nAfter an initial rise in opinion polls, Brown's time as Prime Minister has seen his approval ratings fall. The Labour Party suffered its worst local election results in 40 years. Despite public and parliamentary pressure on his leadership, he remained leader of the Labour Party. He announced on 6 April 2010 that there would be a general election on 6 May 2010, in which Labour came second, with 258 seats. Brown resigned, allowing Conservative leader David Cameron to become Prime Minister.\nOn 14 July 2012, United Nations Secretary-General Ban ki-moon named Brown UN Special Envoy for Education.\nIn 2017, he made a statement about Scotland having a \"full blown mental health emergency\" citing the hiring of mental health staff by a Charity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["prime minister"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom","offset":85},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":148},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":156},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"MP","offset":188},{"uri":"Kirkcaldy","surface_form":"Kirkcaldy","offset":214},{"uri":"Cowdenbeath","surface_form":"Cowdenbeath","offset":228},{"uri":"Constituency","surface_form":"Constituency","offset":243},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":316},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":576},{"uri":"Tony_Blair","surface_form":"Tony Blair","offset":619},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor of the Exchequer","offset":681},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":737},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":744},{"uri":"University_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"University of Edinburgh","offset":761},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":862},{"uri":"Dunfermline_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"Dunfermline East","offset":916},{"uri":"First_Lord_of_the_Treasury","surface_form":"First Lord of the Treasury","offset":1032},{"uri":"Minister_for_the_Civil_Service","surface_form":"Minister for the Civil Service","offset":1067},{"uri":"Financial","surface_form":"financial","offset":1166},{"uri":"Fiscal","surface_form":"fiscal","offset":1180},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":1194},{"uri":"Interest_rate","surface_form":"interest rate","offset":1229},{"uri":"Bank_of_England","surface_form":"Bank of England","offset":1276},{"uri":"Extension","surface_form":"extension","offset":1317},{"uri":"HM_Treasury","surface_form":"Treasury","offset":1348},{"uri":"Domestic_policy","surface_form":"domestic policy","offset":1371},{"uri":"Supervise","surface_form":"supervision","offset":1432},{"uri":"Financial_Services_Authority","surface_form":"Financial Services Authority","offset":1451},{"uri":"Abolition","surface_form":"abolition","offset":1514},{"uri":"Advance_Corporation_Tax","surface_form":"(ACT)","offset":1551},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":1675},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":1768},{"uri":"Parliamentary","surface_form":"parliamentary","offset":1910},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":1924},{"uri":"Leadership","surface_form":"leadership","offset":1940},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative","offset":2145},{"uri":"David_Cameron","surface_form":"David Cameron","offset":2165},{"uri":"United_Nations_Secretary-General","surface_form":"United Nations Secretary-General","offset":2222},{"uri":"Ban_ki-moon","surface_form":"Ban ki-moon","offset":2255}]}
