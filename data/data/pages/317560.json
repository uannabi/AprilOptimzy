Examples of this are The Right Honourable David Cameron PC MP, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, The Right Honourable Stephen Harper PC MP, former Prime Minister of Canada, and The Right Honourable John Key MP, former Prime Minister of New Zealand. The term is also used on high official in the United States such as former senator, presidents, and civil servants.\nIn the present-day United Kingdom, the term is given to members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.
