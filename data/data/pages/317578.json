{"id":317578,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl_hunting","text":"Waterfowl hunting (also called wildfowling or waterfowl shooting in Britain) is the act of hunting ducks, geese, or other waterfowl for food and sport. In many western countries, waterfowl hunting is illegal, and duck hunting is mostly an outdoor sporting activity.\nMany types of ducks and geese share the same habitat, have overlapping or same hunting seasons, and are hunted the same. Thus it is possible to hunt different species of waterfowl in the same trip. Waterfowl can be hunted in crop fields where they eat, or, more often, on or near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps, sloughs, or oceanic coastlines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":91},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":99},{"uri":"Geese","surface_form":"geese","offset":106},{"uri":"Waterfowl","surface_form":"waterfowl","offset":122},{"uri":"Game_(food)","surface_form":"food","offset":136},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":145},{"uri":"Outdoor_activity","surface_form":"outdoor sporting activity","offset":239},{"uri":"Hunting_season","surface_form":"hunting season","offset":345}]}
