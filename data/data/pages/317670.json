{"id":317670,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent","text":"The acute accent (\u00B4) is a mark in many written languages. It is usually added above a vowel to show how to say it. Acute accents are sometimes added to consonants too. Sometimes, the acute accent changes the sound of the whole word by giving it stress in a sentence. This accent is part of many modern languages that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets. The acute accent is one of many similar marks called diacritics.\nHistory.\nThe acute accent was first used in Ancient Greece. It told the speaker when to say a syllable with a high pitch. Another early accent mark was the apex. In Latin the apex marked long vowels.\nExpanding the alphabet.\nSome languages use the accent to actually make new letters. Both Faroese and Icelandic add the acute accent to all of their vowels to make new letters. These letters, \u00E1, \u00ED, \u00F3, \u00FA and \u00FD (plus \u00E9 in Icelandic) are separate letters with different pronunciations. In Turkmen, the letter is a consonant:.\nFrench words in other languages.\nMany languages have borrowed words from French. Many Norwegian words which came from French keep an acute accent. Some examples are: \"all\u00E9\", \"kaf\u00E9\", \"id\u00E9\", \"komit\u00E9\". Swedish examples include \"caf\u00E9\" and \"resum\u00E9\" (noun). Examples in English include: \"attach\u00E9\", \"canap\u00E9\", \"clich\u00E9\", \"communiqu\u00E9\", \"caf\u00E9\", \"d\u00E9cor\", \"fianc\u00E9\", \"pass\u00E9\", \"toup\u00E9e\" and \"touch\u00E9\". However, sometimes writers forget or choose not to use the accent mark.\nWriting other languages in English.\nSome languages such as Arabic, Persian, or Japanese do not use alphabets. Some writers use the acute accent to tell how the words should sound when words from these languages are written in English. This is more common in older books and less common today.\nTechnical notes.\nThe ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 character encodings included \"\u00E1\", \"\u00E9\", \"\u00ED\", \"\u00F3\", \"\u00FA\", \"\u00FD\". They also had how letters and accents looked when they were written as capital letters. Unicode has many more letters with the acute accent.\nMicrosoft Office.\nTo make an accented letter in a Microsoft Office software (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), users hold the key and press the apostrophe key once. Then, let the key go, and press the letter they want.\nMacintosh OS X.\nOn Apple Macintosh computers, users press \"option-e\" and then the vowel. Vowels can also be capitalised. For example, users make \u00E1 by pressing \"option-e\" and then 'a'. Pressing \"Option-e\" and then \"Shift-a\" makes \u00C1.\nWeb.\nOn Wikipedia, users make these symbols by clicking on a link in a box. Some other websites work the same way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":86},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"say","offset":107},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":152},{"uri":"Languages","surface_form":"languages","offset":302},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin","offset":321},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic","offset":328},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek","offset":342},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":348},{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"diacritic","offset":412},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":468},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":518},{"uri":"Pitch_accent","surface_form":"pitch","offset":539},{"uri":"Apex_(diacritic)","surface_form":"apex","offset":580},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":589},{"uri":"Vowel_length","surface_form":"long vowels","offset":611},{"uri":"Faroese_language","surface_form":"Faroese","offset":713},{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic","offset":725},{"uri":"Turkmen_language","surface_form":"Turkmen","offset":909},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1019},{"uri":"Norwegian_language","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":1032},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":1145},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1462},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":1470},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1482},{"uri":"ISO-8859-1","surface_form":"ISO-8859-1","offset":1717},{"uri":"Windows-1252","surface_form":"Windows-1252","offset":1732},{"uri":"Majuscule","surface_form":"capital","offset":1875},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":1892},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office","surface_form":"Microsoft Office","offset":1995},{"uri":"Microsoft_Word","surface_form":"Word","offset":2022},{"uri":"Microsoft_PowerPoint","surface_form":"PowerPoint","offset":2028},{"uri":"Microsoft_Excel","surface_form":"Excel","offset":2040},{"uri":"Apostrophe","surface_form":"apostrophe","offset":2087},{"uri":"Apple_Macintosh","surface_form":"Apple Macintosh","offset":2181},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":2244}]}
