The Alamo was authorized in 1718 but was not built until 1744. The original name was \"San Antonio de Valero Mission\".\nThe Alamo is most famous for The Battle of the Alamo, which took place during 1836. It was occupied by 187 men from Texas and around the world who were fighting for the independence of Texas from what was then Mexico. the men in the Alamo were defeated by a force of 5,000 Mexican troops. General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was the general for the Mexican army. All 189 Texans were killed, and \"Remember the Alamo!\" became the battle cry of the Texas Revolution. The battle ended on March 6, 1836, when the defenders were executed.\nMany years later, the Texas government restored the Alamo. The Alamo became a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and is now open for tourists. The Alamo also became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on July 5, 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_Empire","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":20},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":44},{"uri":"Roman_Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":60},{"uri":"Missionary","surface_form":"missionaries","offset":69},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"natives","offset":101},{"uri":"San_Antonio%2C_Texas","surface_form":"San Antonio, Texas","offset":133},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":153},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Alamo","surface_form":"Battle of the Alamo","offset":319},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":455},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":471},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":496},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"troops","offset":567},{"uri":"Battle_cry","surface_form":"battle cry","offset":714},{"uri":"Texas_Revolution","surface_form":"Texas Revolution","offset":732},{"uri":"National_Historic_Landmark","surface_form":"National Historic Landmark","offset":897},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":987},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":994}]}
