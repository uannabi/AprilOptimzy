{"id":317724,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gristmill","text":"A gristmill (usually flour mill in British English) grinds grain into flour. Grist can refer to both the grain that has been separated from its chaff and to the ground grain.\nMost old ones are watermills.\nThey typically have a waterwheel and from 1 to 3 stones for grinding, although some have more. Water pours on to the wheel causing it to spin. This movement causes an axle inside to turn. The axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin. At the top, there is a chute filled with grain. The grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones.\nThere are different ways to transmit power from the waterwheel to the stones. The simplest method is known as a single-geared drive. Only one set of gears is used to drive a single stone. This arrangement was used since vertical waterwheels were used in gristmills and was still used until the 19th century.\nAnother method was known as spur-wheel drive. This method used a set of bevelled gears that would drive a horizontal 'spur-wheel', a large gearwheel that would then drive up to 3 or 4 millstones.\nAnother arrangement was known as a layshaft drive. The waterwheel would drive a horizontal 'layshaft' with gears mounted on it. Each gear would drive one set of stones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":59},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":70},{"uri":"Grist","surface_form":"Grist","offset":77},{"uri":"Watermill","surface_form":"watermill","offset":193},{"uri":"Axle","surface_form":"axle","offset":372},{"uri":"Gear","surface_form":"gear","offset":420}]}
