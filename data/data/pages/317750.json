{"id":317750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi","text":"e=\"preserve\">In Egyptian mythology, Babi, also Baba, was god in the form of a baboon. His name is translated as \"Bull of the baboons\". This basically means \"Alpha male of all baboons\" or the chief of the baboons. Because Baboons have many human characteristics, it was believed that they were dead ancestors.\nBecause baboons were thought to be the dead, Babi was felt to be an underworld deity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":16},{"uri":"Baboon","surface_form":"baboon","offset":78},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translated","offset":98},{"uri":"Alpha_male","surface_form":"Alpha male","offset":157},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":239},{"uri":"Characteristic","surface_form":"characteristic","offset":245},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":298},{"uri":"Duat","surface_form":"underworld","offset":377}]}
