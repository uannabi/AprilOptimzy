{"id":317809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_G._Wilson","text":"Kenneth Geddes Wilson (June 8, 1936 \u2013 June 15, 2013) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.\nAs an undergraduate at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow. He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann.\nHe became a junior faculty member in Cornell University Physics Department in 1963. He became a full professor in 1970. In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff. He got the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions. In other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group. In this theory he gave not only important, and even numerical, insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics, but indirectly also basic answers to the question: \"What is quantum field theory?\" and \"What does renormalization mean?\". He also gave a constructive answer to another important \"renormalization\" problem from solid-state physics, the Kondo effect.\nHe advocated that the federal government should buy supercomputers for science research. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (known now as the Cornell Theory Center, one of five national supercomputer center created by the National Science Foundation. Since 1988, Dr. Wilson has been a faculty member at The Ohio State University. His current research interests include physics education research.\nSome of his PhD students include Roman Jackiw, Steve Shenker, and Michael Peskin.\nWilson's father was the prominent chemist E. Bright Wilson, and his brother David is also a Professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics.\nWilson died on June 19, 2013 from lymphoma in Saco, Maine, aged 77.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":60},{"uri":"Theoretical_physicist","surface_form":"theoretical physicist","offset":69},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":95},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard","offset":138},{"uri":"William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition","surface_form":"Putnam Fellow","offset":156},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":185},{"uri":"Caltech","surface_form":"Caltech","offset":194},{"uri":"Murray_Gell-Mann","surface_form":"Murray Gell-Mann","offset":226},{"uri":"Cornell_University","surface_form":"Cornell University","offset":281},{"uri":"Wolf_Prize","surface_form":"Wolf Prize","offset":461},{"uri":"Michael_E._Fisher","surface_form":"Michael E.
