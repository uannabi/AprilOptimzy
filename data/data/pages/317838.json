It is now led by his son, Ilham Aliyev, who succeeded his father as the party leader and as President of Azerbaijan since October 31, 2003. The founder of the party, Heydar Aliyev, was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until July 1991 before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Azerbaijan later that year. The headquarters of the party is in the capital city Baku.\nThe party's stated ideologies are lawfulness, secularism, and Azerbaijani nationalism. It wants to build a \"social-oriented\" economy, meaning a middle path between socialism and \"laissez-faire\" capitalism (a mixed economy), and lists civil solidarity and social justice as the basis of its ideology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":74},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":93},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":110},{"uri":"18_December","surface_form":"18 December","offset":133},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":145},{"uri":"President_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"President of Azerbaijan","offset":164},{"uri":"Heydar_Aliyev","surface_form":"Heydar Aliyev","offset":188},{"uri":"Retirement","surface_form":"retirement","offset":224},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":248},{"uri":"Ilham_Aliyev","surface_form":"Ilham Aliyev","offset":280},{"uri":"October_31","surface_form":"October 31","offset":376},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":388},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Communist Party of the Soviet Union","offset":455},{"uri":"July","surface_form":"July","offset":497},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":502},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":534},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":555},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":603},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":639},{"uri":"Baku","surface_form":"Baku","offset":652},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideologies","offset":677},{"uri":"Rule_of_law","surface_form":"lawfulness","offset":692},{"uri":"Secularism","surface_form":"secularism","offset":704},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalism","offset":732},{"uri":"Social_market_economy","surface_form":"social-oriented","offset":766},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":822},{"uri":"Laissez-faire","surface_form":"laissez-faire","offset":837},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"capitalism","offset":852},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":872},{"uri":"Solidarity","surface_form":"solidarity","offset":898},{"uri":"Social_justice","surface_form":"social justice","offset":913}]}
