Historically, this has been classified as a third gender in the tradition of Samoan society.\nThis usually occurs when there are too many sons and not enough daughters in a family. They identify themselves as females in a male\u2019s body. People from societies that do not recognize a third gender may mistake them for being either homosexual or transsexual.\nGender roles.\nThey take on the role of both male and female in the society e.g. teaching, construction and also domestic work. They tend to have sexual intercourse with both sexes, however rarely with another fa\u2019afafine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adulthood","surface_form":"adulthood","offset":78},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":139},{"uri":"Samoa","surface_form":"Samoa","offset":166},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":416},{"uri":"Transsexual","surface_form":"transsexual","offset":430},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":588}]}
