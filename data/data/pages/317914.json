The band was formed in 1979 by veteran musicians of British blues of the 1960s.\nBand history.\nThe band was formed in 1979.\nIn the 1960s Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness played for Manfred Mann. Jones worked also as actor and radio DJ.As a harmonica man, he has performed publicly and/or recorded with Memphis Slim, Alexis Korner, Henry Gray, Alvin \"Youngblood\" Hart, Susan Tedeschi, Eric Bibb and Otis Grand. Hughie Flint was the drummer of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Together with McGuinness he later formed McGuiness Flint who had a hit with \"When I\u00B4m dead and gone\". Dave Kelly was guitarist in the John Dummer Blues Band and in the touring bands of Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker. They played together mostly in London pubs just for fun about playing rhythm \u00B4n blues.\nTheir first album \"The Official Blues Band Bootleg Album\" raised no interest with record labels, so they sold it during concerts and via mail order. The record was a fine mixture of blues standards and own songs. Arista signed with the band and the album reached #40 in the charts. 1982 Hughie Flint left the band and was replaced by Rob Townsend. In 1983 they parted but they came together soon.\nWhen not playing with the Blues Band Jones, McGuinness and Townsend are playing with \"The Manfreds\". The band can be seen as the 1960s Manfred Mann Band without the leader. Dave Kelly plays often with his \"The Dave Kelly Band\".\nBy playing a lot of concerts all over Europe they had and still have a lot of fans. Till present they recorded over 20 albums. It is said, that three generations of a family can be seen in their concerts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_blues","surface_form":"British blues","offset":92}]}
