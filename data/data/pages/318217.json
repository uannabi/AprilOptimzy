{"id":318217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_rebellion_of_1798","text":"The Irish rebellion of 1798 was an uprising of Irish people against British rule in Ireland. It was led by Wolfe Tone and consisted primarily of a secret society called the United Irish. It was aided by Republican France. However, it never gained much traction due to its alliance with anti-Catholic France, because Ireland was primarily Catholic. Despite the British government's anti-Catholicism, most Irish Catholics supported the Crown as the lesser of two evils because of the issue of Revolutionary France's involvement. The uprising lasted several months. A group called the United Irishmen were the main driving force in the rebellion. They were influenced by revolutions taking place in America and France around the time. The uprising is also known as United Irishmen Rebellion.\nBetween 10.000 and 50.000 people died as casualties on the Irish side, between 500 and 2000 on the English side.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uprising","surface_form":"uprising","offset":35},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":84},{"uri":"United_Irishmen","surface_form":"United Irishmen","offset":582},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":668},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"America","offset":696},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"France","offset":708},{"uri":"Casualty","surface_form":"casualties","offset":830}]}
