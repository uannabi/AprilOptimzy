{"id":31825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court","text":"e=\"preserve\">The International Criminal Court (ICC) was created on 1 July 2002. It investigates and punishes people for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. It is sometimes called the ICC or the ICCt.\nThe ICC's main office is in The Hague in The Netherlands. It has smaller offices in New York City, Kampala, Kinshasa, Bunia, Ab\u00E9ch\u00E9 and Bangui.\nThe ICC is different from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The main difference is that ICJ settles arguments between countries, but the ICC punishes people.\nMembers.\nOn 1 January 2008, 105 countries were members of the ICC. These countries have a duty to help the ICC.\nNearly all the countries in Europe and South America are members, and about half the countries in Africa are members. Only a few countries in Asia have joined.\nWhat kind of crimes does the ICC investigate?\nThe ICC can only investigate crimes that happened after 1 July 2002. It can only open a case when national courts are not able to or do not want to. If a national court is investigating or prosecuting a case, the ICC is not allowed to.\nWho does what?\nThere are 18 judges in the ICC. They all come from member-countries of the ICC. No two judges can come from the same country.\nThe prosecutor's job is to investigate crimes. If he finds evidence that a person did something wrong, he asks the judges to start a trial.\nThe ICC is managed by an \"Assembly of States Parties\". The Assembly elects the judges and the prosecutor. Each ICC member-country has one vote in the Assembly.\nCases.\nThe ICC has opened investigations in four places: Northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic and Darfur.\nThe ICC has arrested three people. They are all from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thomas Lubanga is accused of using children to make war. Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui are both accused of murder, sexual slavery, using children to make war, and other crimes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genocide","surface_form":"genocide","offset":120},{"uri":"Crime_against_humanity","surface_form":"crimes against humanity","offset":130},{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":159},{"uri":"The_Hague","surface_form":"The Hague","offset":243},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":256},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":299},{"uri":"Kampala","surface_form":"Kampala","offset":314},{"uri":"Kinshasa","surface_form":"Kinshasa","offset":323},{"uri":"Bunia","surface_form":"Bunia","offset":333},{"uri":"Ab%C3%A9ch%C3%A9","surface_form":"Ab\u00E9ch\u00E9","offset":340},{"uri":"Bangui","surface_form":"Bangui","offset":351},{"uri":"International_Court_of_Justice","surface_form":"International Court of Justice","offset":389},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":557},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":665},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":676},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":735},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":779},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":1107},{"uri":"Prosecutor","surface_form":"prosecutor","offset":1224},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":1279},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"trial","offset":1353},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":1586},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":1598},{"uri":"Central_African_Republic","surface_form":"Central African Republic","offset":1636},{"uri":"Darfur","surface_form":"Darfur","offset":1665},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":1883},{"uri":"Sexual_slavery","surface_form":"sexual slavery","offset":1891}]}
