{"id":318307,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge","text":"Fledge is the stage in a young bird's life when the feathers and wing muscles become developed enough for flight. It also describes the act of a chick's parents raising it until it is fully grown. A young bird that has recently fledged but still needs care and feeding is called a fledgling.\nIn ornithology, fledging has many meanings, depending on species. Birds are sometimes considered fledged once they leave the nest, even if they still cannot fly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":31},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":65},{"uri":"Describe","surface_form":"describes","offset":122},{"uri":"Ornithology","surface_form":"ornithology","offset":295},{"uri":"Consider","surface_form":"considered","offset":378},{"uri":"Bird_nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":417}]}
