{"id":31831,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund","text":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization. 189 countries are members of the International Monetary Fund. It has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., USA.\nOrigin.\nIn the 1930s, many countries faced economic problems. The standard of living declined, and a great many people were unemployed. International trade became much smaller. Some countries reduced the value of their currencies. All these factors combined in the 1930s, and an economic depression resulted. By late 1939, the Second World War had started.\nAs the Second World War ended, most countries found that international values faced many restrictions and were not smooth. Leaders of many countries thought over these matters and discussed them in meetings and agreed on the Bretton Woods system. Thus, after the Second World War, many countries felt the need to have an organization to get help in monetary matters between countries. To begin with, 29 countries discussed the matter, and signed an agreement. The agreement was the Articles of Association of the International Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund came into being in 29th December 1945.\nMembership.\nAny country may apply to become a member of the IMF. When a country applies for membership, the IMF\u2019s Executive Board examines the application. If found suitable, the Executive Board gives its report to IMF\u2019s Board of Governors. After the Board of Governor clears the application, the country may join the IMF. However, before joining, the country should fulfill legal requirements, if any, of its own country. Every member has a different voting right. Likewise, every country has a different right to draw funds. This depends on many factors, including the member country\u2019s first subscription to the IMF.\nManagement.\nA Board of Directors manages the IMF. One tradition has governed the selection of two most senior posts of IMF. Firstly, IMF\u2019s managing director is always European. World Bank's president is always from the United States of America.\nCurrent managing director is French economist Christine Lagarde.\nThe major countries of Europe and America control the IMF. This is because they have given more money to IMF by way of first subscriptions, and so have larger share of voting rights.\nComments.\nMany people and countries have commented about IMF. Some are good and some are bad comments about the work of IMF. Despite many bad comments about IMF, research shows that more than 60 percent of Asians and 70 percent of Africans feel that IMF has had a \"positive\" effect on their country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_organization","surface_form":"international organization","offset":44},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":161},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":179},{"uri":"1930","surface_form":"1930","offset":199},{"uri":"Standard_of_living","surface_form":"standard of living","offset":250},{"uri":"International_trade","surface_form":"International trade","offset":320},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":511},{"uri":"Bretton_Woods_system","surface_form":"Bretton Woods system","offset":766},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":804},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":1992},{"uri":"Christine_Lagarde","surface_form":"Christine Lagarde","offset":2064}]}
