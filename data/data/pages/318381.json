{"id":318381,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_physiology","text":"Exercise physiology is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide-range of physical exercise conditions. In addition, many exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression. Professional bodies in most developed countries review and approve education programs to ensuring the quality and consistency of education.\nAn exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and perpheral nervous system function. Also, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physical_exercise","surface_form":"physical exercise","offset":99},{"uri":"Pathology","surface_form":"pathology","offset":202},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":508},{"uri":"Bioenergetics","surface_form":"bioenergetics","offset":522},{"uri":"Cardiopulmonary","surface_form":"cardiopulmonary","offset":537},{"uri":"Hematology","surface_form":"hematology","offset":563},{"uri":"Biomechanics","surface_form":"biomechanics","offset":575},{"uri":"Skeletal_muscle","surface_form":"skeletal muscle","offset":589},{"uri":"Neuroendocrine","surface_form":"neuroendocrine","offset":617},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":668}]}
