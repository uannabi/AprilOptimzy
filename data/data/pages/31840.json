Parvati is a word in the Sanskrit language that means \"daughter of the mountain\". Hindu teachings call Parvati the daughter of the Himalayas Mountains, where she is said to live. She has two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya with her husband Shiva. Shiva is one of the main gods of the Hindu religion.\nParvati has four arms. In her arms she carries prayer beads, a mirror, a bell and citron. But when she sits by the side of her husband Shiva, Parvati has only two arms. In her form with two arms, Parvati holds her right hand up in blessing and holds a lotus flower in her left hand.\nParvati's conveyance (vahana) is a lion or tiger. This means that Parvati rides a lion or a tiger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":13},{"uri":"Hindu_mythology","surface_form":"Hindu mythology","offset":26},{"uri":"Sanskrit_language","surface_form":"Sanskrit language","offset":129},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":175},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":235},{"uri":"Ganesha","surface_form":"Ganesha","offset":301},{"uri":"Kartikeya","surface_form":"Kartikeya","offset":313},{"uri":"Shiva","surface_form":"Shiva","offset":340},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":372},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":384},{"uri":"Citron","surface_form":"citron","offset":482},{"uri":"Nymphaea","surface_form":"lotus flower","offset":652}]}
