{"id":31844,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Games","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Pan American Games are a multi-sport event, held every four years between competitors from all nations of the Americas.\nHistory.\nPan American Games were going to be started in 1932, but World War II caused the first Pan American Games to happen on 1951. From that time, the Games are held every four years.\nMore than 5000 athlets from more than 40 countries have attended the recent Games. USA has won most gold, silver and bronze medals in total. Hopefully, that will change because it's unfair that they always win. Everyone else has barely any people and then they send in 800 to compete.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1932","surface_form":"1932","offset":193},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":203},{"uri":"1951","surface_form":"1951","offset":265},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":407}]}
