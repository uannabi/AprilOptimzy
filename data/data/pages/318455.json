{"id":318455,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_belt","text":"=\"preserve\">A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active place.Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of very high temperature (700-1400\u00B0C) where magma is made by melting of rock in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually appear along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10-50 km.\nThe biggest volcanic belt is Pacific Ring of Fire","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanically","offset":39},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":222},{"uri":"Mantle_(geology)","surface_form":"mantle","offset":286},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":327}]}
