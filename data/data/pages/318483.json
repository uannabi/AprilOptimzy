{"id":318483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapsid","text":"A diapsid is a reptile with two fenestrae (holes) behind the eye on each side of its skull. Most reptiles are diapsids, and the condition does not occur in mammals. The function of the holes is to improve jaw movements, and to reduce the weight of the skull. The holes give places for muscle attachment; also, as jaw muscles contract, the holes allow space for the muscles to bulge.\nThe \"Allosaurus\" skull shows the way the skull became lighter in dinosaurs, especially the large theropods. It is here not much more than a series of struts, yet provides massive bite power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":15},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":85},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":156},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":388},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":448},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":480}]}
