The falling rain comes into contact with surfaces and turns into a thin sheet of ice. Ice storms cause accidents, take power lines down and cause serious damage.\nFormation.\nIt starts with a layer of warmer (not freezing) air above a layer of huge-freezing temperatures lower down. Frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer, and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":15},{"uri":"Freezing_rain","surface_form":"freezing rain","offset":43},{"uri":"Precipitation_(meteorology)","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":346}]}
