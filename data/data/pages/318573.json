{"id":318573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_chemistry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that occur in the liquid phase. It is also called bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench.\nMaterials.\nWet chemistry uses laboratory glassware, such as beakers and flasks, without quantitative chemical analysis using instrumentation. Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods.\nHistory.\nBefore the age of theoretical and computational chemistry, it was the main form of scientific discovery in the chemical field. So, some people call wet chemistry classic chemistry or classical chemistry. Today's society and quality control requirements need a high volume of wet chemistry. So, many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for faster analysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":35},{"uri":"Occur","surface_form":"occur","offset":59},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":72},{"uri":"Phase_(matter)","surface_form":"phase","offset":79},{"uri":"Lab_bench","surface_form":"lab bench","offset":170},{"uri":"Laboratory_glassware","surface_form":"laboratory glassware","offset":211},{"uri":"Beaker","surface_form":"beaker","offset":241},{"uri":"Flask","surface_form":"flask","offset":253},{"uri":"Quantitative_chemical_analysis","surface_form":"quantitative chemical analysis","offset":269},{"uri":"Instrumentation","surface_form":"instrumentation","offset":306},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratories","offset":352},{"uri":"Theoretical_chemistry","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":436},{"uri":"Computational_chemistry","surface_form":"computational chemistry","offset":452},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific discovery","offset":501},{"uri":"Quality_control","surface_form":"quality control","offset":642},{"uri":"Automate","surface_form":"automate","offset":749},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":763}]}
