It was developed in \"gungjung\" which means a Korean court.\nGeneral tteokbokki is cooked with seasoning using gochujang with starch syrup or sugar for the sweet taste. Generally gungjung tteokbokki uses beef and vegetable because it was cooked at court but general tteokbokki uses fish cake, green onions and boiled egg.\njja-jang tteokbokki.\njja-jang tteokbokki () is a stir-fried dish with jjajang.\nHistory.\nIn a cook book named 'Siuijeonseo' which was written in late 1800s, there is a record of tteokbokki. However, tteokbokki might have existed before the late 1800s because the main ingredient is rice cake and there were rice cakes during the Three Kingdoms of Korea period.\nGungjung tteokbokki is different from tteokbokki because there were no red peppers in Joseon Dynasty so they made gungjung tteokbokki with vegetables and meats.\u00A0Modern tteokbokki was first made by Mabokrim who has sold tteokbokki with gochujang since 1953.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tteok","surface_form":"tteok","offset":108},{"uri":"Gochujang","surface_form":"gochujang","offset":509},{"uri":"Siuijeonseo","surface_form":"Siuijeonseo","offset":830},{"uri":"Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea","surface_form":"Three Kingdoms of Korea","offset":1048},{"uri":"Joseon_Dynasty","surface_form":"Joseon Dynasty","offset":1166},{"uri":"Gochujang","surface_form":"gochujang","offset":1315}]}
