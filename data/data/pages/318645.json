Reducing the size and not using any high cost parts were the secret to low price. However, because of cutting costs, they do not have rear suspension and the maximum speed is around. It also has an aluminum four-stroke 50 cc engine. The special thing about the engine is that it weighs 40% less than other four-stroke engines. It also make the scooter lighter and cheaper.\nDue to its low price, it was a great hit in Japan. However, Suzuki stopped producing Choinori in 2007 because it failed to pass the new gas emission standards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":42},{"uri":"Suzuki","surface_form":"Suzuki","offset":74},{"uri":"Yen","surface_form":"Yen","offset":117},{"uri":"Suspension_(vehicle)","surface_form":"suspension","offset":261},{"uri":"Four-stroke_engine","surface_form":"four-stroke","offset":329}]}
