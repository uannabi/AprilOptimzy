{"id":31865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Multilingualism is the ability to speak more than one language. The ability to speak two languages is \"bilingualism,\" a type of multilingualism. Many immigrants are bilingual and speak languages of both their old and their new country. Multilingualism is useful in many kinds of work, partly because international trade is more common than in past centuries. Some Countries and organization having more than one official language hire people who speak more than one, so they can work with more people.\nMost people have a first language that they learned as babies. Other languages are usually learned much later.\nSome linguists think there are more multilingual people in the world than monolingual people, who speak only one language\nPeople who can speak several languages are called \"polyglots\". Those who can speak many, such as Heinrich Schliemann and Ghil'ad Zuckermann, are called \"hyperpolyglots\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":67},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigrants","offset":163},{"uri":"International_trade","surface_form":"international trade","offset":313},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":425},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":534},{"uri":"Heinrich_Schliemann","surface_form":"Heinrich Schliemann","offset":845},{"uri":"Ghil%27ad_Zuckermann","surface_form":"Ghil'ad Zuckermann","offset":869}]}
