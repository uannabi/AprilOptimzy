{"id":318740,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston%2C_Illinois_(DuPage_County)","text":"Weston, Illinois was a community next to Batavia. It was a subdivision of pre-fabricated homes started in the early 1960s. Sales were very slow, so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town. However, it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town. So, the town voted to sell all of the land, including the houses that had been built to Fermilab. The people wanted to move the town to the east beyond the edge of Fermilab, but county officials prohibited the move. The town then dissolved.\nBefore new Fermilab buildings could be finished, the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space. They renamed Weston, \"Fermilab Village.\" It still houses visiting scientists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Batavia%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Batavia","offset":41},{"uri":"Fermilab","surface_form":"Fermilab","offset":185}]}
