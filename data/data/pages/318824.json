{"id":318824,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dhoku_region","text":"The is one of Japan's traditional regions. The Japanese conventions of geography and history divide the nation into eight regions, including the T\u014Dhoku region. These have been used since 1905 as basic units for description and comparison and as cultural markers.\nThe regions of Japan are a fusion of historical divisions and modern administrative needs. The significance of the region in Japan is geographical, cultural and administrative.\nHistory.\nIn the late 7th century, the \"T\u014Dsand\u014D\" region were identified as one of the eight largest administrative areas of the Imperial system (\"ritsuryo seido\").\n\"Gokishichid\u014D\" is an ancient system of names for parts of the country, including \"T\u014Dsand\u014D\". \"T\u014Dhoku\" covers the northern area of the island of Honsh\u016B in roughly the same area as the traditional \"T\u014Dsand\u014D\".\nIn the Meiji period, the modern regional system was made by Imperial decree. Japan was divided into regions (\"[http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/languagesofsecurity/2011/05/27/japanese-region/ chih\u014D]\"), including the T\u014Dhoku region. A regional council (\"chih\u014D gy\u014Dsei ky\u014Dgisai\") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping. The council also included regional chiefs of central government ministries.\nOver time, T\u014Dhoku has developed its own regional dialects, customs and unique traditional culture. T\u014Dhoku is famous for farming. Now a lot of kinds of vegetable are grown.\nThe T\u014Dhoku University was built in 1907.\nIn 2011, T\u014Dhoku was struck with a very strong earthquake and tsunami. It caused a lot of damage. Now, people in Japan do their best for the complete revival of T\u014Dhoku.\nGeography.\nThe region occupies the northeastern part of Honshu, which is the largest Japanese island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":14},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventions","offset":56},{"uri":"List_of_regions_of_Japan","surface_form":"regions of Japan","offset":267},{"uri":"Fusion","surface_form":"fusion","offset":290},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographical","offset":397},{"uri":"Cultural","surface_form":"cultural","offset":411},{"uri":"Public_administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":424},{"uri":"T%C5%8Dsand%C5%8D","surface_form":"T\u014Dsand\u014D","offset":479},{"uri":"Gokishichid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gokishichid\u014D","offset":604},{"uri":"Honsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"island of Honsh\u016B","offset":736},{"uri":"Meiji_period","surface_form":"Meiji period","offset":815},{"uri":"Grouping","surface_form":"grouping","offset":1162},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":1368},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1507},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":1522},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":1685}]}
