{"id":318976,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camposaurus","text":"\"Camposaurus\" is a dinosaur from the Late Triassic of North America. It is a relative of \"Coelophysis\". This relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis.\nWith fossils dating back to 205\u2013210 million years ago (mya), it is the oldest known neotheropod. It is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material.\nA study of \"Camposaurus arizoniensis\" by Ezcurra and Brusatte discovered two unique features. This meant the specimen was a valid genus and species. \"Camposaurus\" is definitely a neotheropod. Based on phylogenetic analysis, its closest known relative is \"Megapnosaurus rhodensis\", because they share similarities in the tibia, and ankle. Spielman et al. (2007) put \"Camposaurus\" in the family Coelophysidae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":19},{"uri":"Late_Triassic","surface_form":"Late Triassic","offset":37},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":54},{"uri":"Coelophysis","surface_form":"Coelophysis","offset":90},{"uri":"Phylogenetic","surface_form":"phylogenetic","offset":145},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":172},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":254},{"uri":"Megapnosaurus","surface_form":"Megapnosaurus","offset":592},{"uri":"Tibia","surface_form":"tibia","offset":657},{"uri":"Coelophysidae","surface_form":"Coelophysidae","offset":730}]}
