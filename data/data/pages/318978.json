{"id":318978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staurikosaurus","text":"\"Staurikosaurus\" is a genus of Upper Triassic theropod dinosaurs found in Brazil. It was a small, lightly built carnivore.\nThe rarity of \"Staurikosaurus\" remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive, or because it lived in an environment such as a forest, where fossils rarely form.\nDescription.\nAt just, 80\u00A0centimetres tall (31\u00A0in), and weighing just 30\u00A0kilograms (66\u00A0lb), \"Staurikosaurus\" was tiny in comparison to later theropods like \"Megalosaurus\". \"Staurikosaurus\" and the related \"Herrerasaurus\" are definitely theropods and evolved after the sauropod line had split from the theropods.\nThe fossil record of \"Staurikosaurus\" is poor, but the skeletal structure of the legs is known. \"Staurikosaurus\" was a quick runner for its size. It also had just two vertebrae joining the pelvis to the spine, a distinctly primitive arrangement.\nThe available teeth for Staurikosaurus strongly suggest a carnivorous diet.\nTail.\nThe tail of \"Staurikosaurus\" was relatively long (with more than 40 vertebrae) compared to the rest of its body and was held straight and off the ground as it ran. The rear part of \"Staurikosauruss tail is stiffened by features of the tail vertebrae. Ostrom thought this was a dynamic stabilizer to help balance while leaping and running.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":22},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":31},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":46},{"uri":"Dinosaurs","surface_form":"dinosaurs","offset":55},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":74},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":112},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":238},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":260},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilogram","offset":367},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"lb","offset":381},{"uri":"Megalosaurus","surface_form":"Megalosaurus","offset":451},{"uri":"Herrerasaurus","surface_form":"Herrerasaurus","offset":500},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolved","offset":544},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":562},{"uri":"Vertebra","surface_form":"vertebra","offset":773},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":795},{"uri":"Vertebral_column","surface_form":"spine","offset":809},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"primitive","offset":829},{"uri":"Balance","surface_form":"balance","offset":1238}]}
