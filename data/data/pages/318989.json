{"id":318989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Delay_Storage_Automatic_Calculator","text":"Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) was an early British computer. It was made by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. EDSAC was the first stored-program electronic computer. It was also the first to run a computer game.\nLater the project was supported by J. Lyons & Co. Ltd., a British company. They were rewarded with the first commercial computer, LEO I. LEO I was based on the EDSAC design. EDSAC ran its first programs on 6\u00A0May 1949, when it calculated a table of square numbers and a list of prime numbers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":67},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":75},{"uri":"Maurice_Wilkes","surface_form":"Maurice Wilkes","offset":100},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge_Mathematical_Laboratory","surface_form":"University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory","offset":135},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":186},{"uri":"Von_Neumann_architecture","surface_form":"stored-program","offset":215},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"computer game","offset":282},{"uri":"J._Lyons_and_Co.","surface_form":"J.
