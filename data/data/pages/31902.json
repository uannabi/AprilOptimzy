{"id":31902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language","text":"Vietnamese (\"Ti\u1EBFng Vi\u1EC7t\") is the official language of Vietnam. Like many other languages in Asia, Vietnamese is a tonal language\nInfluences.\nVietnamese has been strongly influenced by Chinese languages. It has a shared history with other languages such as Khmer. It now uses a Latin alphabet that is based on the French alphabet but was written based on Chinese characters, called Ch\u1EEF N\u00F4m. Few people know Ch\u1EEF N\u00F4m today.\nMost Chinese speakers who live in Vietnam now use regular Chinese script for calligraphy, but some traditional calligraphy artists can still be found. For example, Ho Chi Minh City (sometimes still called Saigon) has a district that is famous for its popular Chinatown.\nVietnamese adds new words when they are needed, especially in the professions of engineering, science, and academics. Also there has been an increase in media use. Some social words from the media are now accepted as common.\nSpoken language.\nThe spoken language of Vietnam changes in each province. The greater the distance between provinces, the stronger the difference. There some diffference between the Hanoian and the Mekong is called a dialects. The national education for all of Vietnam now usesthe Hanoian dialect, but each ethnic tribe may still use a different dialect, language, or vocabulary.\nComputers.\nThere are speaking programs that use Vietnamese. A computer add-on for the Firefox web browser, Vietnamese TTS (Text to Speech), can read text with the 'Vietnamization needed\u00E9\nAudio libraries are available to reproduce Vietnamese. [http://translate.google.com Google translate] uses a TTS reader and sound library to read Vietnamese in simple sentences. Portable electronic translators are also very popular. [http://www.kimtudien.vn/ Kim Tu Dien] makes the most common portable dictionary for the Vietnamese market.\nAlphabet.\nThe Vietnamese alphabet (In Vietnamese: \"Ch\u1EEF Qu\u1ED1c ng\u1EEF\", means \"The National Scripts\").\nDiphthong.\nThe combination of two vowels makes a diphthong. The dipthongs used in the Vietnamese language have some rules when used. For example, one rule states that the singular tone for both letters must be placed.\nTriphthongs.\nThere are more triphthongs in Vietnamese than English, such as 'uye'.\nVietnamese syllables.\nThe syllables refers to the Chinese use of two characters as syllables. Vietnamese also uses one syllable as a word.Like in English, people can say just 'go'. For more emphasis, it could be said twice in Vietnamese. That is common in Asia. n languages. Some Australian Aboriginal languages do the same thing. So, 'go - go' () means \"go now\" but with emphasis. However, 'go' is also common in Vietnamese.\nMany single syllables are used in Vietnamese. They can form sentences without pairing with other syllables as they do in Chinese. Readers (and speakers) still notice that many syllables, in most sentences, are paired.\nVietnamization (Make it sounds like \"Vietnamese\").\nMany words from around the world were needed in Vietnamese. Sushi is a common word used by most languages. When a word is vietnamized, it is changed to sound Vietnamese. China uses the same idea: Ao-da-li-ya in Pinyin means Australia.\nThe first rule for vietnamization is that Vietnamese word or syllables are not normally broken by a consonant: ([http://vi.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vi\u1EC7t_Nam Vi\u1EC7t Nam]).\nAn example of how to break a foreign word into two syllables is [http://vi.wiktionary.org/wiki/m\u00F4_t\u00F4 m\u00F4 t\u00F4], one of the words for \"motorbike\", is a vietnamized version of 'motor' and 'auto' ([http://vi.wiktionary.org/wiki/\u00F4_t\u00F4 \u00F4 t\u00F4]). However, the rule has exceptions: [http://vi.wiktionary.org/wiki/l\u00F4gic l\u00F4gic].\nWhen introducing a common foreign word, people vietnamize the word in at least one spoken demonstration for Vietnamese listeners.\nThe second (softer) rule for vietnamization is that the sound of each syllable must be made a little closer to Viet sounds. Tone marks for vowel letters are added: [http://vi.wiktionary.org/wiki/l\u00F4gic l\u00F4gic] is an alteration of logic and would be need for a few subjects.\nExceptions.\nAny word can be an exception to vietnamization. Names like Barack Obama or Bill Clinton might be attempted by Vietnamese-speakers. In writing, these foreign names will mostly stay together. Names like David are easy for the Vietnamese to say and so they have become very popular in Englishwriting.\nExclamations.\nExclamations are very popular in Vietnamese. People can use exclamations as an introduction to things said. People can also comment with a quick exclamation after they say something. The exclamation may express a feeling or just an expression.\nConjunctions.\nConjunctions are used in Vietnamese.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":42},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":54},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":92},{"uri":"Tonal_language","surface_form":"tonal language","offset":114},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":184},{"uri":"Khmer_language","surface_form":"Khmer","offset":256},{"uri":"Latin_script","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":277},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":313},{"uri":"Chinese_characters","surface_form":"Chinese characters","offset":354},{"uri":"Chu_Nom","surface_form":"Ch\u1EEF N\u00F4m","offset":381},{"uri":"Calligraphy","surface_form":"calligraphy","offset":498},{"uri":"Ho_Chi_Minh_City","surface_form":"Ho Chi Minh City","offset":585},{"uri":"Chinatown","surface_form":"Chinatown","offset":680},{"uri":"Profession","surface_form":"professions","offset":757},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":772},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":785},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":798},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":844},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":860},{"uri":"Provincial_city_(Vietnam)","surface_form":"province","offset":980},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialects","offset":1133},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1205},{"uri":"Ethnic","surface_form":"ethnic","offset":1223},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":1284},{"uri":"Mozilla_Add-ons","surface_form":"add-on","offset":1367},{"uri":"Firefox","surface_form":"Firefox","offset":1382},{"uri":"Browser","surface_form":"browser","offset":1394},{"uri":"TTS","surface_form":"TTS","offset":1414},{"uri":"Text_to_Speech","surface_form":"Text to Speech","offset":1419},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":1650},{"uri":"Translator","surface_form":"translator","offset":1681},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":1816},{"uri":"Vietnamese_alphabet","surface_form":"Vietnamese alphabet","offset":1838},{"uri":"Combination","surface_form":"combination","offset":1936},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":1955},{"uri":"Diphthong","surface_form":"dipthong","offset":1985},{"uri":"Singular","surface_form":"singular","offset":2092},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":2248},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":2272},{"uri":"Sushi","surface_form":"Sushi","offset":2977},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":3087},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"Pinyin","offset":3128},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":3141},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":3252},{"uri":"Motorbike","surface_form":"motorbike","offset":3447},{"uri":"Tone_language","surface_form":"Tone mark","offset":3884},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":3899},{"uri":"Popular","surface_form":"popular","offset":4315},{"uri":"Conjunction","surface_form":"Conjunction","offset":4614}]}
