He is the author of the epic \"Ramayana\", based on the attribution in the text of the epic itself. He is revered as the \"Adi Kavi,\" which means \"First Poet,\" for he discovered the first \"\u015Bloka\" i.e. first \"verse\", which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.\nAt least by the 1st century AD, Valmiki's reputation as the father of Sanskrit classical poetry seems to have been legendary.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ramayana","surface_form":"Ramayana","offset":148},{"uri":"Shloka","surface_form":"\u015Bloka","offset":304}]}
