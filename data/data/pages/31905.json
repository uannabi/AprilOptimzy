{"id":31905,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali","text":"Kali is one of the goddesses in Hinduism and aspect of Parvati. She is the goddess of creation, destruction, time and commonly presented as dark and violent. Various Shakta Hindu cosmologies, as well as Shakta Tantric beliefs, worship her as the ultimate reality or Brahman.\nKali is represented as the consort of Lord Shiva, on whose body she is often seen standing. She is associated with many other Hindu goddesses like Durga, Bhadrakali, Sati, Rudrani, Parvati and Chamunda. She is the foremost among the Dasa Mahavidyas, ten fierce Tantric goddesses.\nOrigin of the word \"Kali\".\nThe name Kali comes from k\u0101la (meaning black, time, death, lord of death, Shiva). K\u0101l\u012B is the feminine of k\u0101la (\"black, dark coloured\"). K\u0101la primarily means \"black,\" but also means \"time.\" K\u0101l\u012B means \"the black one\" and also \"time\", \"beyond time\" and \"power of time\". Since Shiva is called K\u0101la - the eternal time, K\u0101l\u012B, his consort, also means \"the Time\" or \"Controller of Time\". Hence, Kali is considered the goddess of time and change.\nShe has many names like K\u0101lar\u0101tri (\"black night\"), K\u0101lik\u0101 (\"relating to time\"), or Bhadrakali (\"a gentle form of Kali\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"goddesses","offset":19},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":32},{"uri":"Parvati","surface_form":"Parvati","offset":55}]}
