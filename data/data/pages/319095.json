Generally, electronic dance music is created by producers and composers, and is then used by DJs, or disc jockeys, in the above settings. Electronic dance music takes many forms and styles. As a genre, it is generally up-tempo music created by electronic software and machines, such as synthesizers, drum machines, keyboards, samplers, sequencers and computers. Occasionally, the term \"techno\" is used to describe electronic dance music in general, despite being a generalisation as techno is a distinguishable subgenre of EDM.\nHistory and origins.\nBeing quite a generic term, EDM has a variety of 'origins' and derivations. EDM can be said to stem from a fusion between regular dance music and electronic music. One notable example can be Donna Summer's 1977 single \"I Feel Love\", which combined elements of disco with electronic music. The innovative blend helped trigger several major EDM genres, such as Hi-NRG, Eurodance and techno music. Giorgio Moroder, who co-wrote the song and was also one of its producers, additionally created some of the earliest forms of electronic dance music. Kraftwerk are also credited as influencing electronic music. Whilst a lot of electronic dance music originates from disco, this is not the case for all EDM.\nThe song which has been credited as bringing EDM into mainstream popular music is Madonna's 1998 single \"Ray of Light\". Whilst it is attributed as helping bring the genre mainstream, electronic dance music existed and had enjoyed popularity years before the single's release; house music, for instance, had been popular in the United States since the early 1990s (its popularity can also be attributed to another Madonna single, 1990's \"Vogue\").\nDifferent forms of electronic dance music.\nThere are different types of EDM, each varying in style and sound. This is a list of some of the major electronic dance music genres (each genre may additionally have further subgenres, which have not been looked at in too much detail for this section)","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Music genre"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronica","surface_form":"electronica","offset":160},{"uri":"Dance_music","surface_form":"dance","offset":175},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic music","offset":195},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":270},{"uri":"Madonna_(entertainer)","surface_form":"Madonna","offset":1635}]}
