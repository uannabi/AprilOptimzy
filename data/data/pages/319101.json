It was based on Conrad's experience working on a steamer (ship), the \"Vigar\".\nThe novel tells about the fall of Peter Willems. He is a bad man, and has a bad reputation. On the run from a scandal in Makassar, he finds a place to hide in a hidden native village. However, he betrays the people who are helping him, because of lust for the tribal chief's daughter.

S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men\": \"Life is very long.\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Joseph_Conrad","surface_form":"Joseph Conrad","offset":51},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":250},{"uri":"Betrayal","surface_form":"betrays","offset":366},{"uri":"Lust","surface_form":"lust","offset":417},{"uri":"Almayer%27s_Folly","surface_form":"Almayer's Folly","offset":544},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":666},{"uri":"T._S._Eliot","surface_form":"T.
