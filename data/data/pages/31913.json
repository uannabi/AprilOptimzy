{"id":31913,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk","text":"Kemal Atat\u00FCrk (or alternatively written as Kam\u00E2l Atat\u00FCrk, Mustafa Kemal Pasha until 1934, commonly referred to as Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00FCrk; 1881\u00A0\u2013 10 November 1938) was a Turkish field marshal and statesman who became the first President of Turkey from 1923 until his death in 1938. He is known for being a leader who freed his people from being controlled by other countries and later for starting changes that founded Turkish nation state based on social and economic nationalism, more modern and similar to Western civilization, mainly France (such as the French model of secularism called \"la\u00EFcit\u00E9\").\nMustafa Kemal Atat\u00FCrk was born under the name Mustafa in 1881. His birth place was in Salonika, Macedonia (now Thessaloniki, Greece). Salonika was part of the Ottoman Empire at that time. He took the name Kemal as a schoolboy and Atat\u00FCrk (which means Father-Turk) when he was president. His father's name was Ali R\u0131za Efendi. His mother's name was Z\u00FCbeyde Han\u0131m. He also had a sister whose name was Makbule (Atadan). He became an army officer and the most successful general officer of the empire in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli.\nWhen the Ottoman Empire was ended after the war, Atat\u00FCrk organized a nationalist movement that created the new, secular, Republic of Turkey. This meant that the country's government was no longer led by hereditary or religious leaders. Visitors to Turkey are often surprised by the importance given to Atat\u00FCrk in present-day Turkey.\nFew countries have such a person in their history. He was a successful military commander, and later established a democratic constitution and put in place changes that set Turkey on the road to becoming a new and developing nation. He inspired many later leaders like Habib Bourguiba, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Sukarno, and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pasha","surface_form":"Pasha","offset":72},{"uri":"Surname_Law_(Turkey)","surface_form":"until 1934","offset":78},{"uri":"Field_Marshal","surface_form":"field marshal","offset":176},{"uri":"Statesman","surface_form":"statesman","offset":194},{"uri":"President_of_Turkey","surface_form":"President","offset":225},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":238},{"uri":"1938","surface_form":"1938","offset":274},{"uri":"Nation_state","surface_form":"nation state","offset":425},{"uri":"Economic_nationalism","surface_form":"economic","offset":458},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalism","offset":467},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":536},{"uri":"Secularism","surface_form":"secularism","offset":572},{"uri":"Salonika","surface_form":"Salonika","offset":688},{"uri":"Macedonia_(region)","surface_form":"Macedonia","offset":698},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":761},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"general officer","offset":1069},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1102},{"uri":"Gallipoli_Campaign","surface_form":"Gallipoli","offset":1127},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":1147},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democratic","offset":1586},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":1597},{"uri":"Habib_Bourguiba","surface_form":"Habib Bourguiba","offset":1740},{"uri":"Gamal_Abdel_Nasser","surface_form":"Gamal Abdel Nasser","offset":1757},{"uri":"Sukarno","surface_form":"Sukarno","offset":1777},{"uri":"Mohammad_Ali_Jinnah","surface_form":"Mohammad Ali Jinnah","offset":1790}]}
