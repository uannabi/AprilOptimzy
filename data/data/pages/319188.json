{"id":319188,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Weston_(chemist)","text":"Edward Weston (May 9, 1850 \u2013 August 20, 1936) was an English-born American chemist noted for his achievements in electroplating and his development of the electrochemical cell, named the Weston cell, for the voltage standard. Weston was a competitor of Thomas Edison in the early days of electricity generation and distribution.\nBiography.\nBorn in Oswestry, Shropshire, England, in 1850 to a merchant family, Weston first studied medicine but grew interested in chemistry. He emigrated to the United States after receiving his medical diploma in 1870. He then found a job in the electroplating industry. He saw the need for a constant source of current. He developed an interest in power generation and invented several dynamos and generators. He eventually co-founded the Weston Electric Light Company in Newark, New Jersey and later got the contract to light the Brooklyn Bridge. Weston was a founding member of the board of trustees of what later became the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Some of his inventions, instruments, and writings are maintained at the university's library and at its Weston Museum. Weston was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1888-89.\nHe invented two alloys, constantan and manganin. Weston developed measurement instruments for electrical current\u2014the modern foundation for the voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter. In 1888, he formed the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation which was known for its voltmeters, ammeters, wattmeters, ohmmeters, frequency meters, transformers, and transducers. Weston developed a method for producing a \"true\" permanent magnet. Weston conceived of and built a magnetic speedometer. Weston also developed the dashboard ammeter for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\nWeston invented and patented the saturated cadmium cell in 1893. The cathode in the cell is an amalgam of cadmium with mercury. The anode is of pure mercury, and the electrolyte is a solution of cadmium sulphate. The Weston cell is a wet-chemical cell that produces a highly stable voltage suitable as a laboratory standard for calibration of voltmeters. The temperature coefficient was reduced by shifting to an unsaturated design, the predominant type today. When the Weston cell became the International Standard for EMF in 1911, Weston waived his patent rights.\nWeston died in Montclair, New Jersey in 1936. He got 309 United States patents during his life.\nPatents.\nWeston's son Edward Faraday Weston (1878\u20131971) received several patents regarding exposure meters, also manufactured by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation and widely distributed since the 1930s, and established the system of the Weston film speed ratings for the measurement of film speeds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"electroplating","offset":113},{"uri":"Electrochemical_cell","surface_form":"electrochemical cell","offset":155},{"uri":"Weston_cell","surface_form":"Weston cell","offset":187},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":208},{"uri":"Thomas_Edison","surface_form":"Thomas Edison","offset":253},{"uri":"Oswestry","surface_form":"Oswestry","offset":348},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":358},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":370},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":493},{"uri":"Electrical_generator","surface_form":"dynamos","offset":720},{"uri":"Weston_Electric_Light_Company","surface_form":"Weston Electric Light Company","offset":773},{"uri":"Newark%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Newark, New Jersey","offset":806},{"uri":"Brooklyn_Bridge","surface_form":"Brooklyn Bridge","offset":865},{"uri":"New_Jersey_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","offset":961},{"uri":"Weston_Museum","surface_form":"Weston Museum","offset":1101},{"uri":"American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers","surface_form":"American Institute of Electrical Engineers","offset":1144},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":1217},{"uri":"Constantan","surface_form":"constantan","offset":1225},{"uri":"Manganin","surface_form":"manganin","offset":1240},{"uri":"Measurement_instrument","surface_form":"measurement instrument","offset":1267},{"uri":"Electrical_current","surface_form":"electrical current","offset":1295},{"uri":"Voltmeter","surface_form":"voltmeter","offset":1344},{"uri":"Ammeter","surface_form":"ammeter","offset":1355},{"uri":"Wattmeter","surface_form":"wattmeter","offset":1367},{"uri":"Weston_Electrical_Instrument_Corporation","surface_form":"Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation","offset":1401},{"uri":"Voltmeter","surface_form":"voltmeter","offset":1466},{"uri":"Ammeter","surface_form":"ammeter","offset":1478},{"uri":"Wattmeter","surface_form":"wattmeter","offset":1488},{"uri":"Ohmmeter","surface_form":"ohmmeter","offset":1500},{"uri":"Frequency_meter","surface_form":"frequency meter","offset":1511},{"uri":"Transformer","surface_form":"transformer","offset":1529},{"uri":"Transducer","surface_form":"transducer","offset":1547},{"uri":"Permanent_magnet","surface_form":"permanent magnet","offset":1609},{"uri":"Speedometer","surface_form":"speedometer","offset":1668},{"uri":"Harley-Davidson","surface_form":"Harley-Davidson","offset":1729},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":1745},{"uri":"Weston_cell","surface_form":"saturated cadmium cell","offset":1791},{"uri":"Amalgam","surface_form":"amalgam","offset":1853},{"uri":"Cadmium","surface_form":"cadmium","offset":1864},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":1877},{"uri":"Electrolyte","surface_form":"electrolyte","offset":1924},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"EMF","offset":2278},{"uri":"Montclair%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Montclair, New Jersey","offset":2339},{"uri":"United_States_patent_law","surface_form":"United States patents","offset":2381},{"uri":"Edward_Faraday_Weston","surface_form":"Edward Faraday Weston","offset":2442},{"uri":"Exposure_meter","surface_form":"exposure meter","offset":2511},{"uri":"Weston_Electrical_Instrument_Corporation","surface_form":"Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation","offset":2553},{"uri":"Film_speed","surface_form":"film speed","offset":2717}]}
