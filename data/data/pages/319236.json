He said, the land between positions () and (). He described it as two masses of land with a break, a strait, or an indentation between. The land was named for John R. Bradley, who had sponsored Cook's expedition.\nCook published two photographs of the land and described it as follows: \"The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island, with mountains and high valleys. The upper coast I estimated as being about one thousand feet high, flat, and covered with a thin sheet ice.\"\nIt is now known there is no land at that location. Cook's observations were based on either a misidentification of sea ice or an outright fabrication. Cook's Inuit companions reported that the photographs were actually taken near the coast of Axel Heiberg Island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frederick_Cook","surface_form":"Frederick Cook","offset":39},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":84},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":336},{"uri":"Heiberg_Island","surface_form":"Heiberg Island","offset":416},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Inuit","offset":732},{"uri":"Axel_Heiberg_Island","surface_form":"Axel Heiberg Island","offset":817}]}
