He is remembered as one of the most important French painters of the rococo style. He was a pupil of Fran\u00E7ois Boucher, and developed Boucher's style further. At first he did historical paintings, but soon gave up on these.\nHe then painted things that were light-hearted, gay, and slightly erotic. His works include \"The Swing\", \"A Young Girl Reading\", and \"The Secret Meeting\". Together with Boucher and Antoine Watteau, he is one of the principal painters of French Rococo. He lost his wealth during the French Revolution. After the revolution, the painting style was different, because he had trouble adapting, he died a poor man.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grasse","surface_form":"Grasse","offset":39},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":66},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":79},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":86},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":147},{"uri":"Rococo","surface_form":"rococo","offset":163},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Boucher","offset":195},{"uri":"Antoine_Watteau","surface_form":"Antoine Watteau","offset":498},{"uri":"Wealth","surface_form":"wealth","offset":581},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":599}]}
