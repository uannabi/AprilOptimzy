{"id":3194,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening","text":"Gardening is the growing of plants such as flowers, shrubs and trees as a hobby or recreation. Some people also grow vegetables or fruit in their gardens. People do gardening outdoors in the soil in their backyard, or in pots or containers on their balcony or on their patio. Some people do gardening on a roof.\nPeople do indoor gardening inside their house or inside a building. Sometimes indoor gardening is done in greenhouses, which are special buildings where plants are grown. A greenhouse has a transparent glass or plastic roof and walls that let sunlight in. Grow tent is also used for indoor plants. Grow tent helps plant to grow in a more spectacular and develop a friendly environment. Water gardening is growing plants in ornamental pools and ponds. People doing water gardening plant water lilies and other aquatic plants.\nGardening can be done outside of the home, in city parks, botanical gardens, zoos, amusement parks, theme parks, and around tourist attractions. These types of gardens are cared for by people called gardeners or groundskeepers.\nGardening compared with farming.\nGardening is related to farming. But farming is done on a much larger scale. A farm may have hundreds of square kilometres of plants and crops. A garden in a person's backyard usually only measures a few square meters. As well, farming is done as a business, to sell the crops, fruit, and vegetables that are produced. Gardening is done just to produce fruit or vegetables for the gardener's own family. Gardening is done as a hobby or as a recreation, not as a business.\nGardening tools.\nGardeners use tools to dig in the soil and water the crops. These tools include a spade, a fork, a hoe, a basket, a watering can, a hose, a Sprinkler, a bucket, a trowel and a wheelbarrow. With growing, technology gardeners now have tech like Self-watering containers, Garden sensors, Hydroponic systems and Indoor lighting systems.\nGardens as art.\nIn many countries and cultures, designing beautiful gardens is treated as a fine art. In Japan, for instance, Zen monks created Japanese gardens. In Europe in the 1700s, kings and queens had formal gardens built. One example is the gardens at the Versailles palace in Paris, France. Landscaping, the making of an artificial landscape, may include gardening and the designer may be a professional landscape architect.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":28},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":43},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":52},{"uri":"Trees","surface_form":"trees","offset":63},{"uri":"Hobby","surface_form":"hobby","offset":74},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":83},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":117},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":131},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":191},{"uri":"Balcony","surface_form":"balcony","offset":249},{"uri":"Patio","surface_form":"patio","offset":269},{"uri":"Roof","surface_form":"roof","offset":306},{"uri":"Greenhouse","surface_form":"greenhouse","offset":418},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":449},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":514},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":555},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"Water","offset":698},{"uri":"Water_lily","surface_form":"water lilies","offset":798},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":888},{"uri":"Botanical_garden","surface_form":"botanical garden","offset":895},{"uri":"Zoo","surface_form":"zoo","offset":914},{"uri":"Amusement_park","surface_form":"amusement park","offset":920},{"uri":"Theme_park","surface_form":"theme park","offset":937},{"uri":"Gardener","surface_form":"gardener","offset":1036},{"uri":"Groundskeeper","surface_form":"groundskeeper","offset":1049},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":1122},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":1235},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":1347},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crops","offset":1369},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1451},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":1460},{"uri":"Hobby","surface_form":"hobby","offset":1525},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":1539},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":1601},{"uri":"Spade","surface_form":"spade","offset":1669},{"uri":"Garden_fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":1678},{"uri":"Hoe","surface_form":"hoe","offset":1686},{"uri":"Basket","surface_form":"basket","offset":1693},{"uri":"Watering_can","surface_form":"watering can","offset":1703},{"uri":"Hose","surface_form":"hose","offset":1719},{"uri":"Sprinkler","surface_form":"Sprinkler","offset":1727},{"uri":"Bucket","surface_form":"bucket","offset":1740},{"uri":"Trowel","surface_form":"trowel","offset":1750},{"uri":"Wheelbarrow","surface_form":"wheelbarrow","offset":1763},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":2017},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2025},{"uri":"Zen","surface_form":"Zen","offset":2046},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":2050},{"uri":"Japanese_garden","surface_form":"Japanese garden","offset":2064},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2085},{"uri":"Versailles","surface_form":"Versailles","offset":2183},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":2204},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":2211},{"uri":"Landscaping","surface_form":"Landscaping","offset":2219},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":2260},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":2342}]}
