Prince Philippe was the expected to be the next king; but Baudouin's brother Albert became the new monarch.\nSince 2009, Belgian law identifies the eldest child of a Belgian monarch the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.\nIn 2013, Albert abdicated for health reasons and his son, Philippe became the King.\nOrder of succession.\nIn 2019, the current order of succession is clear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":112},{"uri":"Baudouin","surface_form":"Baudouin","offset":148},{"uri":"Primogeniture","surface_form":"primogeniture","offset":514},{"uri":"Succession","surface_form":"succession","offset":664}]}
