Its annexation by France was not allowed by the other Allies and the Atlantic charter's points 2 and 3.\nBecause local population did not want to join France, separate international organisation<a href=\"Organisation\">></a>s were created. These included the Saarland football team and in 1950 a NOC, in German called \"Nationales Olympisches Komitee des Saarlandes\". The region did not send athletes to Oslo for the 1952 Winter Olympics.\nThe Saarland had history of over 500 years of coal mining.

At the opening ceremony, 36 athletes from the Saarland marched in front of the team of Germany. They did not win a medal. They were ranked 44th among a total of 69 teams Many other teams with no wins were all ranked 44th together.\nThe Saar treaty of October 1956 allowed the Saarland to rejoin Germany as of 1 January 1957.\nAlthough it was possible, no separate Saarland teams were sent to the 1956 games. A United Team of Germany that included athletes of all three German states took part in the Olympics that year. 1952 was the only Olympic appearance of the Saarland as a separate team.
