It is now NED.\nHistory.\nThe Netherlands sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time in 1900. They have taken part in almost all Games since then. In 1956, the nation boycotted the Games in Melbourne as a protest against the Soviet invasion in Hungary just a few weeks before the Games. They did have one person take part in the Equestrian events that were held in Stockholm a few months before the rest of the Games.\nThe Netherlands hosted the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The Netherlands want to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in either Amsterdam or Rotterdam, as a 100 year celebration of the 1928 Games.\nBefore to the 1992 Olympics, the country name was \"Holland\" with the country code of \"HOL\". From the 1992 onward, they have used the \"Netherlands\" and \"NED\".\nDutch athletes have won 246 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. They have won the most of their medals in swimming and cycling. The nation has won 86 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Eighty-two of these medals have come from speed skating.\nThe Netherlands Antilles, a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), left the Netherlands in 2010. This caused the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee (NAOC) to lose its Olympic license in July, 2011. After the 2012 Olympic Games in London, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles can choose to be a member of the team for the Netherlands or Aruba, which is a semi-independent part of the kingdom of the Netherlands. At the 2012 Games, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles will be a part of the unified Olympic team under the IOC flag. Some athletes have said that they want to be a part of either the Netherlands or Aruba in London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":66},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":130},{"uri":"List_of_IOC_country_codes","surface_form":"NED","offset":161},{"uri":"Sportsperson","surface_form":"athletes","offset":196},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":212},{"uri":"1900_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1900","offset":248},{"uri":"1956_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1956","offset":310},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":320},{"uri":"Boycott","surface_form":"boycott","offset":327},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":350},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":365},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":385},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":392},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":404},{"uri":"Equestrian","surface_form":"Equestrian","offset":489},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":525},{"uri":"1928_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1928 Summer Olympics","offset":605},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":629},{"uri":"2028_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2028 Summer Olympics","offset":673},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":704},{"uri":"Rotterdam","surface_form":"Rotterdam","offset":717},{"uri":"Celebrate","surface_form":"celebration","offset":742},{"uri":"1992_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1992 Olympics","offset":787},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":806},{"uri":"Summer_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Summer Olympic Games","offset":973},{"uri":"Swimming_(sport)","surface_form":"swimming","offset":1037},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"cycling","offset":1050},{"uri":"Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympic Games","offset":1095},{"uri":"Speed_skating","surface_form":"speed skating","offset":1159},{"uri":"Netherlands_Antilles","surface_form":"Netherlands Antilles","offset":1178},{"uri":"Constituent_country","surface_form":"constituent","offset":1202},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Kingdom of the Netherlands","offset":1229},{"uri":"Netherlands_Antilles_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee","offset":1304},{"uri":"2012_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2012 Olympic Games","offset":1403},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1425},{"uri":"Aruba","surface_form":"Aruba","offset":1533},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":1556}]}
