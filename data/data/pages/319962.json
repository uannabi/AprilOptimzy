It was one of the last dynasties before Mongol invasion (and eventual conquest) of China.\nThe dynasty was founded by the Wanyan (\u5B8C\u984F W\u00E1ny\u00E1n) clan of the Jurchens. These were the ancestors of the Manchu, who established the Qing dynasty some 500 years later. The Jin Dynasty was founded in northern Manchuria, The founder was Wanyan Aguda (\u5B8C\u984F\u963F\u9AA8\u6253).\nThe name of this dynasty is sometimes written as \"Jinn\" to differentiate it from an earlier Jin dynasty (265-420) of China whose name is spelt identically in the Roman alphabet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mongol","surface_form":"Mongol","offset":139},{"uri":"Military_invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":146},{"uri":"Conquest","surface_form":"conquest","offset":169},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":182},{"uri":"Wanyan","surface_form":"Wanyan","offset":220},{"uri":"Clan","surface_form":"clan","offset":239},{"uri":"Jurchens","surface_form":"Jurchens","offset":251},{"uri":"Manchu","surface_form":"Manchu","offset":293},{"uri":"Qing_dynasty","surface_form":"Qing dynasty","offset":321},{"uri":"Manchuria","surface_form":"Manchuria","offset":396},{"uri":"Wanyan_Aguda","surface_form":"Wanyan Aguda","offset":423},{"uri":"Jin_dynasty_(265-420)","surface_form":"Jin dynasty (265-420)","offset":537},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":562},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"the Roman alphabet","offset":603}]}
