It was the 25th yearly Royal Rumble event.\nBackground.\nAs is the case every year since the event's beginning, the event's main event was the 30-man over-the-top-rope battle royal, also known as the Royal Rumble match. The match will start with two wrestlers and a new one will be added every 90 seconds. To eliminate an opposing wrestler you must throw him over the top rope and have \"both\" his two feet hit the floor, this will continue til there is only one man left, who is named the winner. The winner will receive either a WWE Championship match or a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXVIII.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":26},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":49},{"uri":"List_of_WWE_pay-per-view_events","surface_form":"event","offset":68},{"uri":"Scottrade_Center","surface_form":"Scottrade Center","offset":117},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":137},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":148},{"uri":"Royal_Rumble","surface_form":"Royal Rumble","offset":181},{"uri":"Battle_royal","surface_form":"battle royal","offset":324},{"uri":"WWE_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Championship","offset":686},{"uri":"World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)","surface_form":"World Heavyweight Championship","offset":714},{"uri":"WrestleMania_XXVIII","surface_form":"WrestleMania XXVIII","offset":754}]}
