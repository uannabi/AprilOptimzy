{"id":32001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curitiba","text":"Curitiba (pron. or) is one of the most important cities in the southern part of Brazil. Curitiba is the capital of the state of Paran\u00E1. The city has more than 1,800,000 people living in it. It covers an area of 430.9 km\u00B2. It is the 7th largest Brazilian city and 4th largest in the Southern Cone (the south part of South America). The city has the largest population and the largest economy in Southern Brazil. The urban area of Curitiba is looked after by 26 local governments and has 3,335,588 people living there.\nHistory.\nCuritiba started in 1693 as a small village. It became an important trading stop because a road was opened. The road joined the southeast area to Southern Brazil. In 1853, it became the capital of the newly made province of Paran\u00E1. Since then, the city has seen a lot of urban growth.\nDuring the 19th century, many European people arrived, including Germans, Poles, Ukrainians and Italians. They added to the cultural mix that still is there. The city made plans and laws to slow the growth of the city and that led to the city being famous for its new ideas and connection to the environment. Most of the new ideas had to do with the public transport system.\nPresent.\nToday, the city has a sense of cosmopolitan life and is said to be the safest city in Brazil. It is the Brazilian capital with the best quality of life and is a diversified industrial center that gives Curitiba the rank of 4th largest economy in Brazil; the largest in the southern region. The city is said to be one of the five best cities to invest in Latin America and the 49th city with the greatest influence in the world.\nLarge companies have moved their headquarters to the city because of Curitiba's structure, its international airport, which serves the whole southern region (the Afonso Pena International Airport), its access to the Port of Paranagu\u00E1, and the junction of highways and railroads linking the south region directly to the southeast of the country. Many multinational automotive (car) companies are in Greater Curitiba, which makes Curitiba the second largest automotive center in the country. Curitiba is an important cultural, political, and economic center in the country.\nCuritiba has high rates of education and is home to the oldest Brazilian university, the Federal University of Paran\u00E1. People from Curitiba are called \"curitibanos\" in Portuguese, and \"Curitibans\" in English.\nThe name.\nThe name \"Curitiba\" comes from the large number of Brazilian \"Pines\", commonly called \"Parana Pine\" (\"Araucaria angustifolia\") which grew in the region before the city was built. There are two reasons for the name: the Indians of the Tupi nation, namely the J\u00EA and the Guarani, used the word \"corae\" (\"pine seed\") \"atuba\" (\"a lot\"). It may also come from joining the words \"kurit\" (\"pine tree\") and \"yba\" (\"large amount\"), also from the Tupi language, together. So, \"Curitiba\" means something like \"Land of Abundant Pines\".\nTransport.\nCuritiba is known for the urban differentiated solutions, notably for the integrated (connected) system of transport of people, together with the regular transit routes, has served, especially from the 1970s, to encourage urban development.\nThe public transport system in Curitiba features large passenger terminals connected by roads used only by the buses \"Vermelhos\" (\"Red Buses\"), the \"Expressos\" (\"Express Buses\"), \"Articulados\" (\"Articulated buses\"), and \"Biarticulados\" (\"Biarticulated buses\"). The biarticulated bus travels on long trips, stopping only on the tube-station stops to pick up or drop off people. Each biarticulated bus can carry 270 people - and complemented with the speedy silver \"Ligeirinho\" (literally, \"speedy\"), with an modern design, has fewer stops, therefore shortening distances \u2013 when compared to the \"Linha Direta\" (\"Direct Line\") \u2013 due to saved time, and feeders marked by their own colors.\nThis model has inspired similar tests in cities of other countries, such as Los Angeles and New York City, where, in the 1990s, the installation of an experimental line of \"ligeirinho\" in the city connected it to the World Trade Center. The system is the source of inspiration for the TransMilenio in Bogot\u00E1, Colombia, Metrovia in Guayaquil, Ecuador,as well as the Orange Line of Los Angeles, California, and for a future transportation system in Panama City, Panama.\nCity planning.\nAround the city and commonly joined with the terminals of buses, are the \"Ruas da Cidadania\" (\"Streets of Citizenship\"), which are municipal centers that bring together municipal departments and public agencies, state and federal, points of trade, services, free Internet access and equipment, and leisure, such as playgrounds and space for all kinds of sports.\nRecent measurements indicate that the green area of Curitiba is of 51.5\u00A0metres per capita - about three times the minimum area recommended by the UN - one of the highest in Brazil and higher than cities such as London or Paris. These areas are made mostly by municipal parks and forests to protect the forests' gallery of local rivers. There are also a variety of city squares and public grounds, usually associated with public and wooden roads.\nThe urban zoning of the city and the integrated transport system has allowed a development of urban architecture, taken by some analysts as strong and balanced without the main problems of large modern cities. Curitiba was recently recommended by UNESCO as one of the city-models for the reconstruction of the cities of Afghanistan, after the military action that happened in that country in 2001.\nCuritiba was the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola, In the 20th century when he was looking for the \"perfect city\" in order to create the New York \"Megalopolis\" (a huge city \"which is good for its citizens\" for his movie). The director lived in Curitiba for a few weeks and praised the city in many of his lectures around the world, as the only Brazilian city praised by this famous producer of movies. He did not make the movie, however.\nIn the 1990s, the city won the United Nations Environment Program prize - UNEP, from the UN, said to be the top prize of the environment in the world. In June 1996, the chairman of the Habitat II summit of mayors and urban planners in Istanbul said Curitiba was \"the most innovative city in the world.\" In 2003, the city received the title of Capital of Culture of the Americas by the organization CAC-ACC. In 2006, Curitiba hosted the event COP8/COP-MOP3 the UN. Today, Curitiba is considered one of the best examples of urban planning worldwide.\nIn 1991, the city asked the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau to open the Free University of the Environment, being an place for learning about the environment and ecology for the population. Since was created, the UNILIVRE is a reference about studies in economically sustainable care of ecosystems, serving as a model for other similar institutions in various parts of the world, as in Cordoba in (Argentina), R\u00EDo Grande in (Patagonia), Seoul in (Korea), Guadalajara in (Mexico), and in many other Brazilian cities.\nThe capital of the state of Paran\u00E1 was the only Brazilian city to enter the 21st century as a reference for national and international urban planning and quality of life; a search by the American magazine Reader's Digest found that it was the Brazilian city better placed in the ranking of the best cities in the world to live in. In March 2001, a poll sponsored by the UN pointed Curitiba as the best capital of Brazil by the Index of Living Conditions (ILC) and second best among the HDI of Brazilian capitals. The city is the gateway to entering the Mercosur (the southern zone common market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay).\nThe city recently was identified as the Brazilian capital with the lowest rate of illiteracy, and also indicated as number 1 in the national education between the Brazilian capitals, and one of the five best cities for investment in Latin America.\nAccording study of the \"Am\u00E9rica Economia\" magazine, published in the \"Special Edition Cities 2006\", which has the title \"The City Innovative\", Curitiba is ahead of important capitals as Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Brasilia, occupying fifth place. The magazine considered the main Latin American economies or those that have relevance to the business conducted on the continent. In front of the Paran\u00E1 state capital are just S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil, first in the ranking; Santiago, Chile; Monterrey, Mexico; and Miami, USA. In 2009, it was one of the three \"smartest\" cities in the world according to Forbes magazine. The criteria were caring about the environment, quality of life, urban planning, good infrastructure and a strong economy.\nThe city was the first in Brazil to introduce the separation of domestic garbage on a wide-scale basis. The acclaimed program \"Lixo que n\u00E3o \u00E9 Lixo\" (literally, \"Garbage that isn\u2019t Garbage\"; a successful recycling program) created in 1989 has become an ideal model of caring for the environment. Actually, Curitiba is the Brazilian city that recycles garbage more often: currently, 22% of all the waste produced - about 450 tons each day - are recycled.\nIn 2007, the city was the third place in a list of \"15 Green Cities\" in the world, according the American website \"Grist\". In the same year, the city was featured in the American newspaper \"The New York Times\"; the news report, with 8 pages, features many changes made in the city, saying that Curitiba remains a destination for urban planners from various parts of the world, fascinated with the public transport system, program for recycling of garbage and the group of parks in the city.\nThe MasterCard Emerging Markets Index 2008, created to evaluate and compare the performance of cities in different functions that connect markets and commerce worldwide, shows Curitiba as the safest city in Brazil - considering details such as freedom of expression, risk of natural disasters and personal security - in addition to being in 49th position among the cities with the greatest influence in the world.\nCuritiba won the \"Globe Award Sustainable City 2010\" and was chosen unanimously by the committee. At the same year, Curitiba was elected by the \"Am\u00E9rica Econom\u00EDa\" Magazine as one of the best cities for doing business in Latin America.\nHistory.\nCuritiba used to be a forest where the tribe Ting\u00FCi used to live. During the 16th century, Europeans began to go to war with this tribe.\nLocalization.\nCuritiba is on the first plateau of Paran\u00E1, in the most flat area, also called plateau curitibano. It covers a geographical area of 432.17\u00A0km\u00B2, located at 25\u00BA25'40\"S latitude and 49\u00BA16'23\"W longitude. The coastline of the state (the Atlantic Ocean) is 70 km away from the city. The capital has a length of 35\u00A0km from north to south, and 20\u00A0km from east to west.\nTerrain.\nThe city has surface area of 432.17\u00A0km\u00B2 in the First Plateau of Paran\u00E1. The terrain of Curitiba is a little wavy. The average altitude of the city is 934.6\u00A0m above sea level, ranging between minimum and maximum values of 900 and 1,000 meters, approximately.\nCuritiba has a wavy topography of smooth rounded hills, an terrain a little wavy, giving a relatively regular appearance.\nThe municipality of Curitiba has an average altitude of 934.6\u00A0m above sea level, where the highest point is to the north (1,021.0\u00A0m). To the south is the situation of lower altitude (864.9\u00A0m).\nThere are mountain ranges and sets of rocky elevations in almost all around the city, being the most remarkable and impressive of the \"Serra do Mar\" (Portuguese for \"Mountain Range of the Sea\"), in the east that separates the plateau from the coast of Paran\u00E1.\nClimate.\nCuritiba's climate is usually mild all year round though locals complain that the weather can change at anytime. It can be hot in the winter and cold in the summer. Even in one day, there can be great differences.\nThe flat terrain, lakes and marshland help its mild damp winters, with an average temperature of 13\u00A0\u00B0C (57\u00A0\u00B0F), but it can fall a bit below 0\u00A0\u00B0C (32\u00A0\u00B0F) on the coldest days. During summer, the average temperature is around 21\u00A0\u00B0C (70\u00A0\u00B0F), but sometimes gets around 32\u00A0\u00B0C (90\u00A0\u00B0F) on hot days.\nCuritiba is a humid city in the subtropical zone in southern Brazil. It is the coldest of Brazil's twenty-six state capitals, because of the altitude. The city is on a plateau 932\u00A0m (3107\u00A0ft) above sea level. The city is in the Atlantic Rainforest region with the higher peaks of a mountain range making a barrier that separate it from the Atlantic Ocean just 105\u00A0km (65\u00A0miles) away.\nHydrography and Pluviometry.\nThe catchment area of Curitiba consists of several rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the watershed of the city are: Atuba River, Bel\u00E9m River, Barig\u00FCi River, Passa\u00FAna River, Ribeir\u00E3o dos Padilhas and the Igua\u00E7u River, all with characteristics of dendritic drainage. Since the 1970s, Curitiba has working on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on rivers. An example of this was the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which retain the water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods. Currently, after many studies about the local water passages, almost all the rivers are in canalization process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the effects of urbanization are the implementation of the programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.\nThe index reaches 1,500\u00A0mm rainfall on average per year, because the rain is constant in the climate of the city. It happens, among other reasons, because of the large deforestation of the Mountain Range of the Sea (\"Serra do Mar\"), a natural barrier to moisture.\nVegetation.\nCuritiba is in the area of vegetation called Araucaria moist forests, composed of steppes, Araucaria forest and other formations.\nIn the local vegetation still appear remnants of the parana pine (\"Araucaria angustifolia\"), which resisted the action of modern civilization. The parana pines are in private and public areas, now protected by environmental legislation which prevents it from being overturned. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a botanical garden and three green houses for the annual production of 150,000 seedlings of native and exotic tree species, 16,000 seedlings of fruit trees, 260,000 seedlings of flowers, foliage and underbrush, on top of the total maintenance of 350,000 seedlings. The green area of the city is one of largest in Brazil.\nThe vegetation of Curitiba is also characterized by the existence of a large quantity of purple and yellow \"ip\u00EAs\" (tabebuias), making a spectacle of beauty to the landscape of the city during the flowering in the end of winter. Currently, the yellow ip\u00EA is the most common tree in the city.\nNeighborhoods.\n\"Bairros\" (neighbourhoods) of Curitiba are geographical divisions of the city. There is no delegation of administrative powers to neighborhoods, although there are several neighborhoods associations devoted to improve their own standards of living.\nCuritiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs), covering the 75 neighbourhoods of the city. All districts are served by the system of integrated urban transport.\nIn the second half of the 19th century many European immigrants formed colonial settlements. These settlements developed into the modern-day districts and neighbourhoods of Curitiba.\nThe centre (\"Downtown\" in American English or \"CBD\" - central business district - in other English use), is the place where the city was founded. It is the busiest area, most of the financial institutions of Curitiba are there.\nSocial issues.\nThe growth of urban population of Curitiba, that turned the city in a modern metropolis, has generated some social problems. Like other major Brazilian cities, Curitiba has seen the emergence of slums in some neighborhoods and around the city, and the growth of street inhabitants, that many times had been sent of other cities and States, and are dropped in the streets of the city. This fact has made a small growth of crime level, but is not comparable to other major Brazilian cities.\nMoreover, many rivers contains levels of pollution; the landfill (deposit of garbage) is almost full; the public transport sometimes is not enough for the quantity of people (in the rush hour), and the Brazilian government does not yield funds for the construction of a subway in the city.\nArchitecture.\nA variety of architectural styles, ancient and modern, make the urban landscape of Curitiba be very interesting and represent an enormous cultural heritage.\nThe architecture that is in Curitiba has a strong influence of the culture of immigrants, from various countries, mainly Europe.\nBuildings in eclectic architecture, neoclassical, colonial, Byzantine, oriental, and styles inspired by the land of immigrants confirm the diversity and cultural richness of Curitiba. It is possible to find places that still keep lambrequins (short ornaments, typical of some European places in the past, on top of roofs or windows), palaces in the urban area, buildings made between the nature, and even the first rotating building in the world, who are harmoniously distributed in the city.\nAlso, buildings that are integrate with nature is a tendency in the 21st century and reflect an important style of Curitiba, as one can see in some famous places of the city.\nBecause it is a planned city, the administration uses a rigid plan for growth, aiming to facilitate the use of public transport. The idea was to organize the city along transport corridors. The buildings are close to major bus lines. The rule is simple: buildings with more than eight floors can only be built in the first block, near the corridor. Buildings with less than eight floors, in the second block, and in other, smaller buildings and houses. This encourages the system bus, that is widely used, reducing the number of cars.\nThe people.\nIn 2007, there were 1,797,408 people living in the city of Curitiba. In 2000, Curitiba was the seventh biggest city in Brazil. It is the biggest city in the southern part of the country, as big as second and third largest cities in the south together. In the same year, the city was the leader in longevity, with the life expectancy at birth at 71.6 years of age.\nIn 2007, there were 3,230,000 people living in the urban areas around Curitiba. The population density was 4.159,4 inh./km\u00B2. The census showed the numbers: 2,503,250 White people (77.4%), 584,000 Pardo people (18.2%), 93,000 Black people (2.9%), 45,000 Asian or Amerindian people (1.4%).\nEconomy.\nCuritiba is the economic center of the southern Brazil and is among the four largest GDP of the country. The city concentrates the largest portion of the structure of government and public services of the Paran\u00E1 state and hosts major companies in the sectors of trade, services and financial things. The city has the strongest economy of the south of the country, because the work of export of more than 900 factories just in the \"Cidade Industrial\" neighborhood and major automobile industries which are in the Greater Curitiba.\nThe city was elected several times as \"The Best Brazilian City for Business\", according to rankings done by the \"Exame\" magazine, in partnership with the consultancy Simonsen & Associates.\nIn July 2001, Curitiba has become the first city in the country to receive the prize \"Pole of Information Technology\", granted by \"InfoExame\" magazine, because the performance of their companies of technology.

Ninety-four experts, chosen by the magazine, show the capital as the best Brazilian city for investment. The city is becoming one of the largest and most important centers of technology, attracting giants of the sector of information technology in the areas of software and hardware, becoming the national pole.\nGross domestic product.\nAnalyzing the GDP of Curitiba, it appears that in the period from 1995 to 2000, the economy grew about 3% a year.\nAbout the GDP per capita, in 2000, the city had an income 37% higher than Brazil. In the same year, the economic sector that compose most of GDP in Curitiba was the service sector with 38.8%, followed by the industrial sector with 36%.\nApproximately 40% of GDP comes from the industry and the rest of activities related to the tertiary sector.\nEducation.\nIn the 1990s, the city started a project called \"Far\u00F3is de Saber\" (\"Lighthouses of Knowledge\"). These Lighthouses are free educational centers which include libraries, Internet access, and other cultural resources. This community libraries works with municipal schools, have a collection of approximately 5000 books, and be cultural reference and leisure for the community, and are designed to diversify the opportunities of access to knowledge, expanding the area of formal education.\nIn each quarter of the city, these \"Lighthouses of Knowledge\" have been implanted containing library and room of computer science, to public use, mainly by students; job training, social welfare and educational programs are coordinated, and often supply labor to improve the city's amenities or services, as well as education and income.\nAmong the Brazilian capitals, Curitiba has the lowest rate of illiteracy, and also number 1 in education between the Brazilian capitals.\nCuritiba has many universities, being \"Universidade Federal do Paran\u00E1\" (\"Federal University of Paran\u00E1\") the most important of the region, and the oldest of Brazil.\nPortuguese is the official national language, and is the primary language used in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.\nTourism.\nEvery year, tourism grows in Curitiba. To attend this demand, the \"Linha Turismo\" (\"Tourism Line\") started in 1994. It is a special city tour that visits the principal tourist attractions in Curitiba, featuring comfortable white buses with big windows and a shape similar to that of streetcars. The vehicles have a sound system that plays recorded messages describing sites in three different languages: Portuguese, English and Spanish. It is possible to visit the parks, squares and the rest of the city's tourist attractions. Considered one of the best in the country, the \"Linha Turismo\" is available every thirty minutes and has a two and a half-hour tour, which travels around forty-four kilometers. To go on the tour you must buy a ticket with five tickets that give you the right to get on and off bus four times. Users can therefore choose the touristic point where they want to stay longer. Then, they can embark again to complete the remaining part of the itinerary. Today the line goes to 25 key reference points in Curitiba, completing 44\u00A0km in 2 and \u00BD hours.\nAccording to a study done by the International Congress & Convention Association (ICCA), Curitiba is the sixth Brazilian city with the largest number of international events and, according to the FIPE, is the third city to receive foreign tourists for business. In 2006, the city placed 6th among the best Brazilian cities to hold events and tourism business; in the same year, the flow of tourists outnumbered the number of inhabitants. Out of about the 2 million visitors, approximately half landed the business.

In 2008 another important magazine said that Curitiba is the best cultural destination and better cost-benefit to tourism in the South region of Brazil.\nGastronomy.\nThe pine nuts (seeds of Parana Pine) are probably the most unique elements in the gastronomy of Paran\u00E1 and Curitiba; it is used not only as aperitif, but also with traditional recipes that pass from generation to generation. Among the ingredients used, the pine nuts is a major ingredient, not only in Midwinter party (\"Festa Junina\", the annual Brazilian celebration which take place in the beginning of the Brazilian winter), but also in daily diet. Pancakes, breads, cakes, soups and appetizers are just some of the recipes prepared with this seed. The colonization and migration contributed to the mixture of flavors and dishes in the state. Indigenous and even Brazilians from other states added its revenue in local cuisine.\nIn Curitiba, one can find restaurants of all kinds. There are options for all tastes and palates, the regional to international cuisine. The city has food establishments specializing in German, Polish, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese, Indian, Mexican, etc., and, of course, regional cuisines of Brazil.
