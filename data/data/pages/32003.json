{"id":32003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia","text":"The Order Crocodilia is a group of Archosaur reptiles. There are three living families.\nCrocodiles are the nearest living relatives to birds, because they are both survivors of the Archosaurs.\nCrocodiles are first found in the Upper Cretaceous period. They are descendents of a much wider group of Archosaurs called the Crocodylomorphs. These, in the Upper Triassic, were slender land-living forms, the sister group of the dinosaurs.\nThe Crocodylomorphs, in turn, were part of an even larger group, the Crurotarsi, which are first seen early in the Triassic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"Order","offset":4},{"uri":"Archosaur","surface_form":"Archosaur","offset":35},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":78},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":135},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":227},{"uri":"Crocodylomorph","surface_form":"Crocodylomorph","offset":320},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":351},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":423},{"uri":"Crurotarsi","surface_form":"Crurotarsi","offset":503},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":549}]}
