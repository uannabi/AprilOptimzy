The equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne were held in Stockholm, due to quarantine reasons.\nSwedish athletes have a total of 475 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 118 at the Winter Olympic Games.\nThe International Olympic Committee had Swedish officer and sports instructor Viktor Balck as one of its original members. The Swedish Olympic Committee was formed and recognized in 1913.\nSwedish Winter Olympic Games bids.\n2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 Winter Games bids were declared non-finished applications by the Swedish Olympic Committee, due lack of political support from the Swedish government. The reason has been that the bidding is financially insecure for the Swedish society as a nation. 2018 Winter Olympic Games bids were promised support by the former government, but when the new government was elected, the bid was withdrawn. \u00D6stersund and \u00C5re were the only applicant cities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":0},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":24},{"uri":"1896_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1896 Games","offset":55},{"uri":"1904_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1904 Summer Olympics","offset":135},{"uri":"1896_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1896 Games","offset":223},{"uri":"1904_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1904 Games","offset":242},{"uri":"Host","surface_form":"hosted","offset":261},{"uri":"1912_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1912 Summer Olympics","offset":299},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":323},{"uri":"Equestrian","surface_form":"equestrian","offset":338},{"uri":"1956_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1956 Summer Olympics","offset":363},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":387},{"uri":"Quarantine","surface_form":"quarantine","offset":428},{"uri":"Sportsperson","surface_form":"athletes","offset":456},{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"medal","offset":485},{"uri":"Summer_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Summer Olympic Games","offset":499},{"uri":"Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Winter Olympic Games","offset":544},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":570},{"uri":"Viktor_Balck","surface_form":"Viktor Balck","offset":644},{"uri":"Swedish_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"Swedish Olympic Committee","offset":693},{"uri":"2006_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2006","offset":789},{"uri":"2010_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2010","offset":795},{"uri":"2014_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2014","offset":801},{"uri":"2018_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2018","offset":810},{"uri":"Swedish_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"Swedish Olympic Committee","offset":880},{"uri":"Swedish_government","surface_form":"Swedish government","offset":946},{"uri":"2018_Winter_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"2018 Winter Olympic Games","offset":1064},{"uri":"%C3%96stersund","surface_form":"\u00D6stersund","offset":1207},{"uri":"%C3%85re","surface_form":"\u00C5re","offset":1221}]}
