{"id":320085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux","text":"Magnetic flux is what generates the field around a magnetic material. It consists of photons, however, unlike the light we receive from the Sun, it is at a much lower frequency. (1) This is why magnetic field lines are not visible to the naked eye.\nIt is the alignment of \"electrons\" in the atomic shells of Ferromagnets and, separately, the \u201C\"spinning\u201D electrons\" in Electromagnets, that provides a material with it\u2019s Magnetism. (2)\nThe number of magnetic field lines passing through a surface (such as a loop of wire). The magnetic flux through a closed surface (such as a ball) is always zero.\nThe SI unit of magnetic flux is the Weber (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds).\nThe CGS unit is the Maxwell.\nMagnetic flux is sometimes used by electrical engineers designing systems with electromagnets or designing dynamos. Physicists designing particle accelerators also calculate magnetic flux.\nReferences.\n1 - https://www.rpi.edu/dept/phys/ScIT/InformationStorage/faraday/magnetism_a.html","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":601},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":604},{"uri":"Weber_(unit)","surface_form":"Weber","offset":633},{"uri":"Centimeter-gram-second_system_of_units","surface_form":"CGS","offset":682},{"uri":"Maxwell_(unit)","surface_form":"Maxwell","offset":698},{"uri":"Electromagnet","surface_form":"electromagnets","offset":786},{"uri":"Dynamo","surface_form":"dynamo","offset":814},{"uri":"Particle_accelerator","surface_form":"particle accelerator","offset":844}]}
