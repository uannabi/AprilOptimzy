{"id":320107,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenovela","text":"e=\"preserve\">A telenovela, or simply novela, is a serial drama television program. It is popular in Latin American, Portuguese, and Spanish television programming. Telenovelas are different from soap operas. Telenovelas have an ending. They come to an end after a long run. This is usually less than one year. The telenovela combines drama with the 19th century \"feuilleton\" and the Latin American radionovela. They are often used to give cultural messages by adding them into storylines.\nBecause the telenovela is similar to the American soap opera, the telenovela is often called a \"Spanish soap opera\" in the United States. While most English language soap operas have no ending, almost all telenovelas run for a limit time. They are usually shown five or six days a week and run for an average of 120 episodes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serial","surface_form":"serial","offset":50},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":57},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television program","offset":63},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":100},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":116},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":132},{"uri":"Soap_opera","surface_form":"soap opera","offset":195},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":349},{"uri":"Feuilleton","surface_form":"feuilleton","offset":363},{"uri":"Radionovela","surface_form":"radionovela","offset":398},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":439},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":530},{"uri":"Soap_opera","surface_form":"soap opera","offset":539},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":612},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":638},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":805}]}
