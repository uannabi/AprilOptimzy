{"id":32011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz","text":"The hertz (symbol: Hz, definition: 1/s) is a unit derived from time which measures frequency in the International System of Units (SI). Frequency is how often something happens. A frequency of 1 hertz means that something happens once a second. The note Middle C (the C in the middle of the piano) is 261.65 (262)\u00A0Hz. This means there are 262 vibrations every second, which is heard as the note Middle C, when that piano key is played.\nHumans are able to hear sounds between 20-20 000\u00A0Hz. Owls are able to hear sounds between 200\u201312000\u00A0Hz.\nThe basic unit is 1/second. The unit is named after a German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.\nMultiple units.\n1000 hertz is 1 kilohertz. 1000 kilohertz is 1 megahertz, 1000 megahertz is 1 gigahertz: (see table)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":83},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"International System of Units","offset":100},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":237},{"uri":"Middle_C","surface_form":"Middle C","offset":254},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":291},{"uri":"Vibration","surface_form":"vibration","offset":343},{"uri":"Heinrich_Rudolf_Hertz","surface_form":"Heinrich Rudolf Hertz","offset":611}]}
