{"id":320116,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_Formation","text":"The Santana Formation is a high quality fossil site in Brazil. It is in northeastern Brazil's Arar ipe Basin. It qualifies as a Lagerst\u00E4tte, which means it is one of the best fossil sites, with many undisturbed fossils.\nThe strata come from the Lower Cretaceous, laid down about 92 million years ago in a shallow inland sea.\nSome 25 species of fish are found, many with stomach contents preserved. This lets palaeontologists study predator\u2013prey relationships in the ecosystem. There are also fine examples of pterosaurs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (especially insects) and plants. Even dinosaurs are found here: a new maniraptor was described in 1996.\nLimestone nodules formed around dead organisms; this preserved even the soft parts of their anatomy. The limestone was etched away using a mild acid. The fossils were then preserved by the 'transfer technique' which means they were embedded in a plastic resin such as polyester or epoxy.\nThe nearby Crato Formation is also a lagerst\u00E4tte. It was produced in similar conditions, about 10 million years before the Santana Formation.\nNotable taxa.\nVarious remains of non-avian theropods, avialans, ornithischians, and possibly oviraptorosaurs have been found in Estado do Ceara, Brazil. Examples are spinosaurs like \"Irritator\" and maniraptors like \"Santanaraptor\".\nThe pterosaurs are all pterodactyls, because the long-tailed rhamphorhynchoidea died out at the Jurassic\u2013Cretaceous junction.\n\"Ornithocheirus\" and \"Tupuxuara\" are examples. The inland sea also had turtles, such as \"Santanachelys\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":40},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":55},{"uri":"Lagerst%C3%A4tte","surface_form":"Lagerst\u00E4tte","offset":128},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":224},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":245},{"uri":"Inland_sea","surface_form":"inland sea","offset":313},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":333},{"uri":"Palaeontologists","surface_form":"palaeontologists","offset":408},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":431},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":440},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":466},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":509},{"uri":"Reptiles","surface_form":"reptiles","offset":521},{"uri":"Amphibia","surface_form":"amphibia","offset":531},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":543},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":569},{"uri":"Plants","surface_form":"plants","offset":582},{"uri":"Dinosaurs","surface_form":"dinosaurs","offset":595},{"uri":"Maniraptor","surface_form":"maniraptor","offset":627},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"Limestone","offset":661},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":753},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":805},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":915},{"uri":"Polyester","surface_form":"polyester","offset":929},{"uri":"Epoxy","surface_form":"epoxy","offset":942},{"uri":"Crato_Formation","surface_form":"Crato Formation","offset":960},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":1134},{"uri":"Dinobird","surface_form":"avialans","offset":1145},{"uri":"Ornithischia","surface_form":"ornithischia","offset":1155},{"uri":"Oviraptor","surface_form":"oviraptor","offset":1184},{"uri":"Spinosaur","surface_form":"spinosaur","offset":1257},{"uri":"Irritator","surface_form":"Irritator","offset":1274},{"uri":"Maniraptor","surface_form":"maniraptor","offset":1289},{"uri":"Santanaraptor","surface_form":"Santanaraptor","offset":1307},{"uri":"Pterodactyl","surface_form":"pterodactyl","offset":1346},{"uri":"Rhamphorhynchoidea","surface_form":"rhamphorhynchoidea","offset":1384},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":1419},{"uri":"Ornithocheirus","surface_form":"Ornithocheirus","offset":1450},{"uri":"Tupuxuara","surface_form":"Tupuxuara","offset":1471},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"turtle","offset":1520},{"uri":"Santanachelys","surface_form":"Santanachelys","offset":1538}]}
