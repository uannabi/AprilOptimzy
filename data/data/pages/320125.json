{"id":320125,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower","text":"Coit Tower is a tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built in 1933. Lillie Hitchcock Coit left one-third of her estate to the city \"to be expended in an appropriate manner for the purpose of adding to the beauty of the city which I have always loved\".\nThe art deco tower is made of unpainted reinforced concrete. Architects Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard designed it. The tower has fresco murals by 27 different on-site artists and their assistants, plus two additional paintings installed after creation off-site.\nThe tower was not designed to resemble a fire hose nozzle, despite Coit's affinity with the San Francisco firefighters of the day, in particular with Knickerbocker Engine Company Number 5.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telegraph_Hill%2C_San_Francisco","surface_form":"Telegraph Hill","offset":29},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":60},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":75},{"uri":"Pioneer_Park%2C_San_Francisco","surface_form":"Pioneer Park","offset":112},{"uri":"Lillie_Hitchcock_Coit","surface_form":"Lillie Hitchcock Coit","offset":145},{"uri":"Art_deco","surface_form":"art deco","offset":333},{"uri":"Reinforced_concrete","surface_form":"reinforced concrete","offset":369},{"uri":"Arthur_Brown%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Arthur Brown, Jr.","offset":401},{"uri":"Henry_Howard","surface_form":"Henry Howard","offset":423},{"uri":"Fresco","surface_form":"fresco","offset":463},{"uri":"Knickerbocker_Engine_Company","surface_form":"Knickerbocker Engine Company","offset":746}]}
