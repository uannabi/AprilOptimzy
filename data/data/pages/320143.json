The name Jit\u014D\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nThe conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nIn the history of Japan, Jit\u014D was the third of eight women to be empress. The two female monarchs before Jit\u014D were (a) Suiko and (b) K\u014Dgyoku/Saimei. The five women monarchs after Jit\u014D were (c) Gemmei, (d) Gensh\u014D, (e) K\u014Dken/Sh\u014Dtoku, (f) Meish\u014D, and (g) Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional narrative.\nBefore she became the monarch, this princess's personal name (\"imina\") was, or alternately Uno.\nPrincess Uno was the daughter of Emperor Tenji and she was the wife of Emperor Temmu, who was Tenji's brother.\nEvents of Jit\u014D's life.\nIn this period, the court and the government was centered at Fujiwara Palace in Yamato.\nAfter her death.\nThe actual site of Jit\u014D's grave is known.
