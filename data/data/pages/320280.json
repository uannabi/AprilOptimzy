{"id":320280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamline","text":"In particle physics, a beamline is the path in a particle accelerator of the particles.\nIn materials science, physics, chemistry, and molecular biology a beamline leads to the experimental endstation utilizing particle beams from a particle accelerator, synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron, or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor.\nBeamline in a particle accelerator.\nIn particle accelerators the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a cement housing. The beamline is usually cylindrical metal. Typical names include, \"beam pipe\", and/or a blank section called a \"drift tube\". This entire section must be under a good vacuum in order to have a the beam travel for a long distance.\nA survey and alignment crew carefully align the beamline segments by using a laser tracker. All beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation.\nSynchrotron radiation beamline.\nRegarding synchrotrons, a beamline is the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron light source. A typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography. Scientists also use synchrotron light in many other ways.\nA large synchrotron laboratory will have many beamlines, each optimized for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station.\nA typical beamline at a modern synchrotron will be 25 to 100 m (82 ft to 328 ft) long from the storage ring to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines at the start of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.\nThe beamline elements are in radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. People are not allowed to enter hutches when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. Hutches have complex safety systems with redundant interlocking functions to make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is turned off by dumping the electron beam circulating in the synchrotron. So, opening one door will shut down all of the beamlines in the facility.\nThe combination of beam conditioning devices controls the thermal load (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or liquid nitrogen. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under ultra high vacuum conditions.\nNeutron beamline.\nAn experimental end station in a neutron facility is called a neutron beamline. Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a research reactor or a spallation source instead of photons. The experiments usually measure neutron scattering from the sample under study.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Particle_physics","surface_form":"particle physics","offset":3},{"uri":"Particle_accelerator","surface_form":"particle accelerator","offset":49},{"uri":"Materials_science","surface_form":"materials science","offset":91},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":110},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":119},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":134},{"uri":"Particle_beam","surface_form":"particle beam","offset":210},{"uri":"Synchrotron_light_source","surface_form":"synchrotron light","offset":254},{"uri":"Synchrotron","surface_form":"synchrotron","offset":288},{"uri":"Neutrons","surface_form":"neutrons","offset":304},{"uri":"Spallation_source","surface_form":"spallation source","offset":320},{"uri":"Research_reactor","surface_form":"research reactor","offset":341},{"uri":"Particle_accelerator","surface_form":"particle accelerator","offset":398},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":680},{"uri":"Surveying","surface_form":"survey","offset":745},{"uri":"Laser_tracker","surface_form":"laser tracker","offset":820},{"uri":"Micrometre","surface_form":"micrometre","offset":864},{"uri":"Secondary_emission","surface_form":"secondary emission","offset":988},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":1015},{"uri":"Synchrotron","surface_form":"synchrotron","offset":1068},{"uri":"Synchrotron_radiation","surface_form":"synchrotron radiation","offset":1138},{"uri":"Bending_magnet","surface_form":"bending magnet","offset":1233},{"uri":"Insertion_device","surface_form":"insertion device","offset":1253},{"uri":"Storage_ring","surface_form":"storage ring","offset":1278},{"uri":"Synchrotron_light_source","surface_form":"synchrotron light source","offset":1296},{"uri":"Crystallography","surface_form":"crystallography","offset":1373},{"uri":"Synchrotron_light","surface_form":"synchrotron light","offset":1410},{"uri":"Insertion_device","surface_form":"insertion device","offset":1599},{"uri":"Storage_ring","surface_form":"storage ring","offset":1865},{"uri":"Hutch","surface_form":"hutch","offset":2193},{"uri":"Interlock_(engineering)","surface_form":"interlocking functions","offset":2609},{"uri":"Thermal_load","surface_form":"thermal load","offset":3066},{"uri":"Focus","surface_form":"focus","offset":3191},{"uri":"Collimated_light","surface_form":"collimation","offset":3200},{"uri":"Liquid_nitrogen","surface_form":"liquid nitrogen","offset":3341},{"uri":"Ultra_high_vacuum","surface_form":"ultra high vacuum","offset":3413},{"uri":"Research_reactor","surface_form":"research reactor","offset":3667},{"uri":"Spallation_source","surface_form":"spallation source","offset":3689},{"uri":"Neutron_scattering","surface_form":"neutron scattering","offset":3759}]}
