{"id":32034,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_o%27lantern_mushroom","text":"The jack o'lantern mushroom is an orange- to yellow gilled mushroom. It looks like the chanterelle and emits light. Unlike the chanterelle, the jack o'lantern mushroom is very poisonous. While eating this mushroom will not kill you, it may cause cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. This mushroom smells and looks very appealing, so there are reports of repeat poisonings from individuals who were tempted to try them a second time.\nDescription.\nThe Jack-o-Lantern mushroom's fruiting body (its stem and cap) is an orange color. It grows from late summer into November, in large clumps on or near tree stumps. However, it can also be found growing on the ground (along buried roots) nearby. Underneath the cap is its well-known glowing color, which glows in a lime green color. This mushroom is asexual.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":34},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":45},{"uri":"Mushroom","surface_form":"mushroom","offset":59},{"uri":"Chanterelle","surface_form":"chanterelle","offset":87},{"uri":"Bioluminescence","surface_form":"emits light","offset":103},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":176},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"kill","offset":223},{"uri":"Cramp","surface_form":"cramp","offset":246},{"uri":"Vomit","surface_form":"vomit","offset":254},{"uri":"Diarrhea","surface_form":"diarrhea","offset":268},{"uri":"Asexual","surface_form":"asexual","offset":790}]}
