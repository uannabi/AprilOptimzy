{"id":320372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotype","text":"e=\"preserve\">An enterotype is a classification of gut flora. It is based on the ecosystem in the human intestinal system. The classification is done by identifying the bacteria and protists which live there. This is called the \"human gut biome\".\nResearch shows there are three distinct ecosystems in the guts of people. People can be classified into one of three groups based on the bacteria in their intestines. The enterotype of each person is set while the person is an infant.\nThe enterotype affects how well a person can digest food or absorb drugs. Chimpanzees have enterotypes that look similar to human enterotypes.\nType 1 has high levels of \"Bacteroides\". \"Prevotella\" are common in Type 2. Type 3 has high levels of \"Ruminococcus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":32},{"uri":"Gut_flora","surface_form":"gut flora","offset":50},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":80},{"uri":"Human_gastrointestinal_tract","surface_form":"human intestinal system","offset":97},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":168},{"uri":"Protists","surface_form":"protists","offset":181},{"uri":"Human_microbiome","surface_form":"human gut biome","offset":228},{"uri":"Intestines","surface_form":"intestines","offset":401},{"uri":"Infant","surface_form":"infant","offset":473},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digest","offset":526},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":548},{"uri":"Chimpanzee","surface_form":"Chimpanzee","offset":555},{"uri":"Bacteroides","surface_form":"Bacteroides","offset":651},{"uri":"Prevotella","surface_form":"Prevotella","offset":666},{"uri":"Ruminococcus","surface_form":"Ruminococcus","offset":727}]}
