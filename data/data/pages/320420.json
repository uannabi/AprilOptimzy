{"id":320420,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantungosaurus","text":"\"Shantungosaurus\", meaning \"Shandong Lizard\", is a genus of hadrosaur dinosaurs found in the Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Formation of the Shandong Peninsula in China.\nDescription.\nIt is the longest and largest known hadrosaur. The skeleton of a medium-sized individual mounted at the Geological Institute of China in Beijing is in length, and the type skull is long. The weight of this genus is estimated at up to. With a composite mounted skeleton 16.6\u00A0meters long (54.5\u00A0ft) it is the largest known ornithischian and the largest non-sauropod dinosaur.\nIt had an unusually long tail, presumably to counterbalance the great weight of the body at the animal's hips.\nLike all hadrosaurs its beak was toothless, but its jaws were packed with around 1,500 tiny chewing teeth. A large hole near its nostrils may have been covered by a loose flap, which could be inflated to make sounds.\nFirst described in 1973, \"Shantungosaurus\" is known from at least five incomplete skeletons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":51},{"uri":"Hadrosaur","surface_form":"hadrosaur","offset":60},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":70},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":93},{"uri":"Shandong","surface_form":"Shandong","offset":135},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":157},{"uri":"Geological_Institute_of_China","surface_form":"Geological Institute of China","offset":281},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":314},{"uri":"Holotype","surface_form":"type","offset":344},{"uri":"Ornithischia","surface_form":"ornithischia","offset":497},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":531},{"uri":"Nostril","surface_form":"nostril","offset":790}]}
