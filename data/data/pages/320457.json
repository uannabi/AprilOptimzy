{"id":320457,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(unit)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In physics, the weber (symbol: Wb;, or) is the SI unit of magnetic flux. A \"flux density\" of one Wb/m2 (one weber per square meter) is one tesla.\nThe weber is named for the German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804\u20131891).\nDefinition.\nThe weber may be defined in terms of Faraday's law, which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop. A change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt (produce an electric potential difference of one volt across two open-circuited terminals).\nWeber (unit of magnetic flux) \u2014 The weber is the magnetic flux which, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second.\nIn SI base units, the dimensions of the weber are (kg\u00B7m2)/(s2\u00B7A). Many times, the weber is expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla-square meter (T\u00B7m2), volt-seconds (V\u00B7s), or joules per ampere (J/A).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":16},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":60},{"uri":"Physical_unit","surface_form":"unit","offset":63},{"uri":"Magnetic_flux","surface_form":"magnetic flux","offset":71},{"uri":"Tesla_(unit)","surface_form":"tesla","offset":152},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":186},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber","surface_form":"Wilhelm Eduard Weber","offset":203},{"uri":"Faraday%27s_law_of_induction","surface_form":"Faraday's law","offset":286},{"uri":"Magnetic_flux","surface_form":"magnetic flux","offset":326},{"uri":"Electric_field","surface_form":"electric field","offset":362},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":428},{"uri":"Electromotive_force","surface_form":"electromotive force","offset":450},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"volt","offset":477},{"uri":"Potential_difference","surface_form":"potential difference","offset":503},{"uri":"SI_base_unit","surface_form":"SI base unit","offset":789}]}
