{"id":320486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface","text":"The Digital Visual Interface (or DVI) is a video interface standard. It is used to send video between a source (such as a personal computer) and a display (such as a monitor). This interface cannot be used to transmit audio unless it is connected to a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) converter. HDMI and DVI use the same protocol for signalling, named Transition-minimized differential signaling.\nThe DVI standard has is widely used in the personal computer industry. Many desktop personal computers and monitors can use it. Most desktop personal computers and liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors sold in stores today have more than one video interface, including DVI. Many other devices (such as projectors and televisions) can use DVI as part of HDMI.\nHDMI is a newer video interface standard. Many laptops still have an old-fashioned VGA connector. Many models in the 2010s have HDMI ports. Fewer laptops have DVI.\nDVI was created by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG). It was created to replace the \"legacy analog technology\" VGA connector standard. DVI is designed to carry uncompressed digital video data to a display. It works very well with the HDMI standard in digital mode (DVI-D), and VGA in analog mode (DVI-A). It is also found in some television sets even though it has been widely replaced by HDMI.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":43},{"uri":"Interface","surface_form":"interface","offset":49},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":59},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":122},{"uri":"Computer_monitor","surface_form":"monitor","offset":166},{"uri":"High-Definition_Multimedia_Interface","surface_form":"High-Definition Multimedia Interface","offset":252},{"uri":"HDMI","surface_form":"HDMI","offset":290},{"uri":"Transition-minimized_differential_signaling","surface_form":"Transition-minimized differential signaling","offset":364},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":452},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":470},{"uri":"Liquid_crystal_display","surface_form":"liquid crystal display","offset":573},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"stores","offset":619},{"uri":"Projector","surface_form":"projector","offset":711},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":726},{"uri":"HDMI","surface_form":"HDMI","offset":762},{"uri":"VGA_connector","surface_form":"VGA connector","offset":851},{"uri":"VGA_connector","surface_form":"VGA connector","offset":1050},{"uri":"Digital_signal","surface_form":"uncompressed digital","offset":1099},{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":1190},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"analog","offset":1223}]}
