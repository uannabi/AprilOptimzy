After the Taylor Report from 1990 all top league clubs must have all seater stadiums. Because the space was limited to enlarge Ayresome Park the club decided to built a new stadium. This stadium was built in only 32 weeks on the Middlehaven site by the River Tees.\nThe building had 30 000 seats but was enlarged to its present capacity in 1998. 4 900 seats were built in the north and west corners.\nInternational matches.\nDuring the construction of the new Wembley stadium the English nationalteam toured the country. The Riverside was chosen to host the Euro 2004 qualifying match against Slovakia on 11 June 2003. But also some U21 matches were held.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Middlesbrough","surface_form":"Middlesbrough","offset":47},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":61},{"uri":"Middlesbrough_F.C.","surface_form":"Middlesbrough F.C.","offset":103}]}
