{"id":320557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gardner_(composer)","text":"e=\"preserve\">John Linton Gardner, (born Manchester, 2 March 1917; died Liss, Hampshire, 12 December 2011) was an English composer of classical music. He is particularly remembered for his church music, especially for his setting of the carol \"Tomorrow shall be my dancing day\".\nEarly life and education.\nGardner was born in Manchester, England and brought up in Ilfracombe, North Devon. His father was a doctor and amateur composer who was killed while fighting at the end of the First World War.\nGardner went to school at Eagle House and Wellington College and studied at Exeter College, Oxford. He enjoyed jazz, but concentrated on classical music and soon started to compose. An \"Intermezzo for Organ\" was published by Oxford University Press in 1936. In the same year he got an organ scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford. He got to know the composer Arthur Benjamin and dedicated his \"Rhapsody for Oboe and String Quartet\" (1935) to him. At Oxford he became friendly with Theodor Adorno with whom he played piano duets.\nCareer.\nGardner went to Repton School to teach music, but after two terms World War II started and he joined the RAF. He conducted the RAF band and played the piano for the dance band. He enjoyed playing jazz and started a swing band. Later in the war he was a navigator in the fighting.\nAfter the war Gardner got a job as repetiteur at the Royal Opera House. He rejected all the music he had composed (although he did not throw it away) and started again by calling his next piece his opus 1. His First Symphony was numbered opus 2. It was a mature work and made him famous. He resigned from his job at the opera house and he had time to concentrate on composing. He wrote \"Cantiones Sacrae\" for the Three Choirs Festival in 1952 and an opera \"The Moon and Sixpence\" which was performed at Sadler\u2019s Well in 1957.\nIn 1956 he was invited by Thomas Armstrong to teach at the Royal Academy of Music. For 30 years he was professor of harmony and counterpoint there. A few years later he also had a part-time job as Director of Music at St Paul's Girls' School in London, where Gustav Holst and Herbert Howells had taught.\nGardner wrote a lot of music for his pupils and also worked on holiday programs. He composed a total of about 300 works. The carol \"Tomorrow shall be my Dancing Day\" is particularly famous. It has a lively rhythm with time signatures that keep changing.\nAwards.\nHe was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1976.\nPersonal life.\nHe married in 1955 and had one son and two daughters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":40},{"uri":"2_March","surface_form":"2 March","offset":52},{"uri":"1917","surface_form":"1917","offset":60},{"uri":"Liss","surface_form":"Liss","offset":71},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":77},{"uri":"12_December","surface_form":"12 December","offset":88},{"uri":"2011","surface_form":"2011","offset":100},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":113},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":121},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":133},{"uri":"Church_music","surface_form":"church music","offset":188},{"uri":"Carol","surface_form":"carol","offset":236},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":324},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":336},{"uri":"Ilfracombe","surface_form":"Ilfracombe","offset":362},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":380},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":404},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":415},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"First World War","offset":480},{"uri":"Wellington_College%2C_Berkshire","surface_form":"Wellington College","offset":539},{"uri":"Exeter_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Exeter College, Oxford","offset":573},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":608},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":634},{"uri":"Oxford_University_Press","surface_form":"Oxford University Press","offset":722},{"uri":"1936","surface_form":"1936","offset":749},{"uri":"Pipe_organ","surface_form":"organ","offset":782},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":788},{"uri":"Arthur_Benjamin","surface_form":"Arthur Benjamin","offset":855},{"uri":"Theodor_Adorno","surface_form":"Theodor Adorno","offset":977},{"uri":"Piano_duet","surface_form":"piano duet","offset":1012},{"uri":"Repton_School","surface_form":"Repton School","offset":1049},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1099},{"uri":"RAF","surface_form":"RAF","offset":1138},{"uri":"Swing_band","surface_form":"swing band","offset":1248},{"uri":"Navigator","surface_form":"navigator","offset":1286},{"uri":"Repetiteur","surface_form":"repetiteur","offset":1348},{"uri":"Royal_Opera_House","surface_form":"Royal Opera House","offset":1366},{"uri":"Opus","surface_form":"opus","offset":1511},{"uri":"Three_Choirs_Festival","surface_form":"Three Choirs Festival","offset":1726},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":1751},{"uri":"Sadler%E2%80%99s_Well","surface_form":"Sadler\u2019s Well","offset":1816},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":1833},{"uri":"Thomas_Armstrong_(conductor)","surface_form":"Thomas Armstrong","offset":1865},{"uri":"Royal_Academy_of_Music","surface_form":"Royal Academy of Music","offset":1898},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmony","offset":1955},{"uri":"Counterpoint","surface_form":"counterpoint","offset":1967},{"uri":"St_Paul%27s_Girls%27_School","surface_form":"St Paul's Girls' School","offset":2057},{"uri":"Gustav_Holst","surface_form":"Gustav Holst","offset":2098},{"uri":"Herbert_Howells","surface_form":"Herbert Howells","offset":2115},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":2349},{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"time signature","offset":2361},{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"Order of the British Empire","offset":2436},{"uri":"1955","surface_form":"1955","offset":2508}]}
