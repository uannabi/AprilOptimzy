{"id":320659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)","text":"A beat is the basic unit of music. Beats can help measure tempos and are performed in grooves and rhythmic music. They measure the pulse and rhythm of a musical piece. They are usually divided into two kinds: stressed and unstressed beats. Stressed beats are the 'strong' beats and unstressed are the 'weak' beats. Time signatures and tempos are created by moving the beats into particular orders.\nOn-beat and off-beat.\nIn music that is played in 4|4 time, (counted as \"1\u00A02\u00A03\u00A04, 1\u00A02\u00A03\u00A04...\"), the first beat of the bar (downbeat) is usually the strongest stressed in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change. The third is the next strongest: these are the on beats. The second and fourth are weaker: these are the off-beats.\nSo \"off-beat\" is a musical term in syncopation that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar, as opposed to the usual on-beat. This is a basic beat in African polyrhythm that was transferred over into popular western music. According to Grove Music, the \"Offbeat is [often] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is carried over from the preceding bar\". The downbeat (the first beat of a measure in music) can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in 4/4 time. Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat; especially rock and roll and Ska music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":28},{"uri":"Tempo","surface_form":"tempo","offset":58},{"uri":"Groove_(music)","surface_form":"grooves","offset":86},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythmic music","offset":98},{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"Time signature","offset":315},{"uri":"Tempo","surface_form":"tempo","offset":335},{"uri":"Bar_(music)","surface_form":"bar","offset":515},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":571},{"uri":"Chord","surface_form":"chord","offset":608},{"uri":"Syncopation","surface_form":"syncopation","offset":773},{"uri":"Polyrhythm","surface_form":"polyrhythm","offset":896},{"uri":"Popular_music","surface_form":"popular","offset":938},{"uri":"Western_hemisphere","surface_form":"western music","offset":946},{"uri":"Musical_genre","surface_form":"genres","offset":1228},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":1278},{"uri":"Ska","surface_form":"Ska","offset":1296}]}
