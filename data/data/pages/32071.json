{"id":32071,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland","text":"The partitions were carried out by Prussia, Russia and Habsburg Austria dividing up the Commonwealth lands among themselves.\nPrelude.\nPoland-Lithuania in its final period (mid-18th century), before the partitions was already not a completely sovereign state. It was almost a vassal, or a Russian satellite state, with Russian tsars effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress Catherine the Great.\nIn 1730 Commonwealth's neighbours, namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement in order to maintain the \"status quo\": specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the \"Alliance of the Three Black Eagles\" (or \"L\u00F6wenwolde's Treaty\"), because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol (in contrast to the white eagle, a symbol of Poland).\nThe Commonwealth had remained neutral in the Seven Years' War, though sympathizing with the alliance of France, Austria, and Russia. It allowed Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Prussia. Frederick II of Prussia retaliated by ordering Polish currency counterfeited to affect the Polish economy.\nThe Poles tried to expel foreign forces in an uprising (the Confederation of Bar, 1768\u20131772), but the irregular and poorly commanded forces had litte chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a defeat. Adding to the chaos was a Ukrainian peasant rebellion, the Koliyivschyna, which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of noblemen (szlachta), Jews, Uniates, and Catholic priests before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Partition_(politics)","surface_form":"partitions","offset":4},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":35},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russia","offset":44},{"uri":"Habsburg_Monarchy","surface_form":"Habsburg Austria","offset":55},{"uri":"Vassal","surface_form":"vassal","offset":275},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian","offset":288},{"uri":"Satellite_state","surface_form":"satellite state","offset":296},{"uri":"Tsar","surface_form":"tsar","offset":326},{"uri":"Stanis%C5%82aw_August_Poniatowski","surface_form":"Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski","offset":423},{"uri":"Catherine_II_of_Russia","surface_form":"Catherine the Great","offset":507},{"uri":"Alliance_of_the_Three_Black_Eagles","surface_form":"Alliance of the Three Black Eagles","offset":785},{"uri":"Seven_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Seven Years' War","offset":1010},{"uri":"Habsburg_Monarchy","surface_form":"Austria","offset":1077},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":1169},{"uri":"Frederick_II_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Frederick II of Prussia","offset":1178},{"uri":"Counterfeit","surface_form":"counterfeit","offset":1241},{"uri":"Bar_Confederation","surface_form":"Confederation of Bar","offset":1345},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":1531},{"uri":"Koliyivschyna","surface_form":"Koliyivschyna","offset":1564},{"uri":"Szlachta","surface_form":"noblemen","offset":1630},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":1651},{"uri":"Uniates","surface_form":"Uniates","offset":1657},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":1670}]}
