{"id":32072,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth","text":"The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, formally known as the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and, after 1791, the Commonwealth of Poland, was a state of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch. The Commonwealth was an extension of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, a personal union between those two states that had existed from 1386. It was the largest and one of the most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth covered more lands than the present lands of Poland and Lithuania. The lands of the Commonwealth also covered all the lands of present-day Belarus; a large part of Ukraine and Latvia; and western part of present-day Russia.\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had high levels of ethnic diversity and by religious tolerance. The amount of religious freedom varied over time.\nAfter several decades of prosperity, it entered a period of political, military and economic decline. It ended with the final Partitions of Poland in 1795. Its growing weakness led to it being divided by its more powerful neighbors, Austria, Prussia and the Russian Empire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"state","offset":173},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Poland_(1385-1569)","surface_form":"Poland","offset":182},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":193},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":221},{"uri":"Polish-Lithuanian_Union","surface_form":"Polish-Lithuanian Union","offset":271},{"uri":"Personal_union","surface_form":"personal union","offset":298},{"uri":"1386","surface_form":"1386","offset":360},{"uri":"Populous","surface_form":"populous","offset":405},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":538},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":549},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":632},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":657},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":669},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":709},{"uri":"Religious_toleration","surface_form":"religious tolerance","offset":795},{"uri":"Prosperity","surface_form":"prosperity","offset":891},{"uri":"Partitions_of_Poland","surface_form":"Partitions of Poland","offset":992},{"uri":"Habsburg_Monarchy","surface_form":"Austria","offset":1099},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":1108},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":1124}]}
