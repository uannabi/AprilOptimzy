Since 1965, the headquarters of OPEC has been in Vienna, Austria. OPEC was established in Baghdad, Iraq on 10\u201314 September 1960.\nIts work is to \"coordinate and unify the petroleum policies\" of its members, and also to \"ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry\".\nAccording to the United States Department of Energy Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC crude oil production is an important factor affecting global oil prices. OPEC sets production targets for its member nations and generally, when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase. Projections of changes in Saudi production result in changes in the price of crude oil.\nOPEC was formed in 1960 when the international oil market was largely dominated by multinational companies known as the 'seven sisters'. The formation of OPEC was a turning point in state control over natural resources. In the 1960s OPEC made sure that oil companies could not unilaterally cut prices. In December 2014, OPEC and the oil men were named in the top 10 most influential people in the shipping industry by Lloyds.\nMembers:.\nIndonesia and Qatar are former members.\nAims.\nHowever, OPEC has not always been able to achieve all these aims.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_organization","surface_form":"international organization","offset":66},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":143},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":151},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":184},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":193},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Energy","surface_form":"United States Department of Energy","offset":565},{"uri":"Crude_oil","surface_form":"crude oil","offset":926},{"uri":"Seven_Sisters_(oil_companies)","surface_form":"seven sisters","offset":1058}]}
