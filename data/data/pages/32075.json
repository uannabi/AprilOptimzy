{"id":32075,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD","text":"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organisation of countries. Member countries of OECD all have a democratic system of government. They also accept the principle of a free economy. A country has a free economy when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies.\nThe OECD started 1948 as the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). The Second World War had just ended three years before in 1945. Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to help each other re-build their industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War. Later on, some non-European countries also joined this organisation. In 1960, OEEC changed its name, and it became OECD: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nThe OECD's headquarters are at the Ch\u00E2teau de la Muette in Paris.\nColombia is set to become the 38th member.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_organisation","surface_form":"international organisation","offset":72},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democratic system","offset":149},{"uri":"Free_economy","surface_form":"free economy","offset":218},{"uri":"WWII","surface_form":"The Second World War","offset":438},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":588},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_la_Muette","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de la Muette","offset":865},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":889}]}
