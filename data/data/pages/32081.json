{"id":32081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso","text":"Fernando Alonso D\u00EDaz (born July 29, 1981 in Oviedo, Spain) is a racing driver in Formula One. He is from Spain. He won his first F1 title in 2005 and then became the youngest ever Formula 1 World Champion at the age of 24.\nAlonso drove until 2006 in Formula 1 for the Renault F1-Team, with which he achieved the driver world championship in the year 2005 and had a major part to play in the Renault F1 Team winning the constructor championship in the same year.\nThe Drivers' Championship was won again by Fernando with Renault F1 for the second year in a row in 2006 (interestingly, had Alonso not become the youngest World Champion in 2005, he would have still achieved this feat with his 2006 victory) edging out Michael Schumacher of Scuderia Ferrari by 13 points. Renault also retained the Constructor's Championship, beating Ferrari by only five points.\nIn 2007 Alonso joined Team Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes and entered a four way battle for the World Championship with his team-mate, the rookie Lewis Hamilton, and Ferrari drivers Kimi R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen and Felipe Massa. Halfway through the season, with wins in Sepang and Monaco, Alonso trails his rookie team-mate by 14 points. The second half of the season should prove interesting.\nIn the second part Alonso won at Europe and Italy but missed the title by 1 point.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["F1 driver"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oviedo","surface_form":"Oviedo","offset":44},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":52},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":81},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":105},{"uri":"Michael_Schumacher","surface_form":"Michael Schumacher","offset":715},{"uri":"McLaren","surface_form":"McLaren","offset":895},{"uri":"Rookie","surface_form":"rookie","offset":993},{"uri":"Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen","surface_form":"Kimi R\u00E4ikk\u00F6nen","offset":1036},{"uri":"Felipe_Massa","surface_form":"Felipe Massa","offset":1055}]}
