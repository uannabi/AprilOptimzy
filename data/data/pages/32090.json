{"id":32090,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait","text":"The Taiwan Strait or Formosa Strait is a 180\u00A0km-wide strait between mainland China and the island of Taiwan. The strait is part of the South China Sea and attaches to East China Sea to the northeast. The thinest part is 131\u00A0km wide. The Taiwan Strait is often incorrectly called the \"Taiwan Straits\".\nThe Strait has been the theatre for several military confrontations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China since the last days of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 when the Kuomintang forces led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated across the Strait and relocated its government on its final stronghold of Taiwan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":53},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"mainland China","offset":68},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":101},{"uri":"South_China_Sea","surface_form":"South China Sea","offset":135},{"uri":"East_China_Sea","surface_form":"East China Sea","offset":167},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":381},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":416},{"uri":"Chinese_Civil_War","surface_form":"Chinese Civil War","offset":461},{"uri":"1949","surface_form":"1949","offset":482},{"uri":"Kuomintang","surface_form":"Kuomintang","offset":496},{"uri":"Chiang_Kai-shek","surface_form":"Chiang Kai-shek","offset":521}]}
