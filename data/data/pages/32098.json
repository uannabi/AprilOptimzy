{"id":32098,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew","text":"A crew usually is a group of people that work within a common organisation, and that have some activities in common. The usual place where crews can be found are ships and airplanes. On such ships and aircraft, some functions some people perform are very special. It is therefore common that crews are organised in a hierarchy. Every person, except the captain, at the top, has a person above them. They will report to that person.\nTeams who work backstage in theaters, on movie sets, and in television studios are also called crews. Such crews are distinct from the cast.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":162},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":172},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchy","offset":317},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":353},{"uri":"Cast_member","surface_form":"cast","offset":567}]}
