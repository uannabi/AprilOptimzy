{"id":32099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo","text":"Cargo or freight means goods which people transport, often using a vehicle made for that purpose rather than for passenger service. The vehicle is usually a truck or freighter or cargo aircraft or freight train.\nThe noun is used as not countable; people will talk about \"some\" freight. Today, goods other than bulk cargo are usually packed in shipping containers, which are carried. A place which loads or unloads cargo is usually called a \"cargo terminal\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Good_(economics)","surface_form":"goods","offset":23},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":67},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":113},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":157},{"uri":"Freighter","surface_form":"freighter","offset":166},{"uri":"Cargo_aircraft","surface_form":"cargo aircraft","offset":179},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":205},{"uri":"Bulk_cargo","surface_form":"bulk cargo","offset":310},{"uri":"Containerization","surface_form":"shipping container","offset":343}]}
