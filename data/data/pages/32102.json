{"id":32102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Paraphilia is a word used in sociology and medicine. Like many other medical terms it comes from Ancient Greek. It means that someone is sexually aroused by people (or by things) that are unable to return their affection. The word can also be used to refer to sexual practices which are bad for the mind or body and are mental disorder<nowiki/>s.\nThe respective behaviour is only classified as \"paraphilia\" if it is the only means for the person involved to get sexually aroused, for a considerable time.\nWhen normal people talk about paraphilia, they usually mean non-mainstream sexual behaviour.\nHomosexuality (LGBT) used to be considered a paraphilia, but this is no longer the case in a lot of countries. However, in a lot of other countries it is still considered abnormal. The opposite of paraphilia is normophilia. An example of a normophilia is teleiophilia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":42},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":56},{"uri":"Sexual_arousal","surface_form":"sexually aroused","offset":150},{"uri":"Mental_disorder","surface_form":"mental disorder","offset":333},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"Homosexuality","offset":611},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":626},{"uri":"Normophilia","surface_form":"normophilia","offset":822},{"uri":"Teleiophilia","surface_form":"teleiophilia","offset":866}]}
