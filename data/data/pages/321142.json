{"id":321142,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury%2C_Connecticut","text":"e=\"preserve\">Canterbury is a town in Windham County, Connecticut. The population was 5,132 at the 2010 census. The racial makeup of the town was 97.34% White, 0.36% African American, 0.28% Native American, 0.26% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.30% from other races, and 1.45% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.07% of the population.\nHistory.\nThe town was founded in the 1680s as Peagscomsuck until 1703. In 1832, Prudence Crandall, a school teacher, opened the first school for African American girls. The \"Black Law\" did not allow the education of black people. However, Crandall taught until she was sent to prison in 1832 for a short time. Angry mobs forced the school to close in 1834. Crandall later married and moved out of the state. Connecticut ended the \"Black Law\" in 1838. They also gave Crandall a small pension in 1886, four years before her death. The school is now the Prudence Crandall Museum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":29},{"uri":"Windham_County%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Windham County","offset":37},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":53},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":70},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":98},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"racial","offset":115},{"uri":"Caucasian","surface_form":"White","offset":152},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":165},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":189},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":212},{"uri":"Pacific_Islands","surface_form":"Pacific Islander","offset":225},{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":301},{"uri":"Latino","surface_form":"Latino","offset":313},{"uri":"Prudence_Crandall","surface_form":"Prudence Crandall","offset":442},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":463},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":470},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":507},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":565},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"black people","offset":578},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":639},{"uri":"Mob","surface_form":"mobs","offset":678},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":734},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"state","offset":763},{"uri":"Pension","surface_form":"pension","offset":845},{"uri":"Prudence_Crandall_Museum","surface_form":"Prudence Crandall Museum","offset":913}]}
