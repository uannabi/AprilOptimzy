{"id":321238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Interactive","text":"Virgin Interactive was a British video game publisher. It was formed as Virgin Games Ltd. in 1981. The company became much larger after purchasing the budget label, Mastertronic in 1987. It was part of the Virgin Group. In 1994 it was renamed Virgin Interactive.\nGeneral summary.\nIt published games for PC and systems, including the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, C64, Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast.\nIt helped the career of many developers, including Westwood Studios (who developed Command & Conquer Series and the PC port of Resident Evil) and Synergistic. Also, many workers for Shiny Entertainment, including David Perry, worked for Virgin before splitting off to create \"Earthworm Jim\".\nAlso among Virgin Interactive alumni are famed video game composer Tommy Tallarico, artist Doug TenNapel, designer David Bishop, animator Bill Kroyer, animator/artists Andy Luckey and Mike Dietz and programmer Andy Astor.\nIn 1993 Virgin Interactive created the \"Digicel\" process, originally for an unpublished game called \"Dynoblaze\". Key to developing the process were Dr. Stephen Clarke-Willson, David Perry, designer David Bishop, animator Bill Kroyer, animator artists Andy Luckey, animator Mike Dietz and programmer Andy Astor. The technology was first released to the general public in \"Disney's Aladdin\" for the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and subsequently on such projects as \"The Lion King\" video game.\nThe worldwide operations were acquired in a management buyout backed by Mark Dyne who became its Chief Executive Officer in 1998. Tim Chaney, the former Managing Director was named as President. The U.S. operations were spun out to Electronic Arts as part of its acquisition of Westwood Studios that same year.\nThe Company's assets were acquired by the French publisher Titus Software -- its name was changed to Avalon Interactive on July 1, 2003.\nIn May 2002, the Spanish division of Virgin Interactive, known as Virgin Interactive Espa\u00F1a, was purchased by Tim Chaney along with former Spanish president and founder Paco Encinas. The branch was then separated from the main Virgin Interactive company, already part of Titus Software, and kept its own identity as a Virgin brand. Renamed Virgin Play in October 2002, this Spanish publisher remains as the sole representation of the Virgin Group in the video game industry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mastertronic","surface_form":"Mastertronic","offset":165},{"uri":"Virgin_Group","surface_form":"Virgin Group","offset":206},{"uri":"IBM_PC_compatible","surface_form":"PC","offset":303},{"uri":"Commodore_Amiga","surface_form":"Amiga","offset":333},{"uri":"ZX_Spectrum","surface_form":"ZX Spectrum","offset":340},{"uri":"Amstrad_CPC","surface_form":"Amstrad CPC","offset":353},{"uri":"Commodore_64","surface_form":"C64","offset":366},{"uri":"Sega_Master_System","surface_form":"Sega Master System","offset":371},{"uri":"Sega_Mega_Drive","surface_form":"Sega Mega Drive","offset":391},{"uri":"Sega_Game_Gear","surface_form":"Sega Game Gear","offset":408},{"uri":"Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","offset":424},{"uri":"Sega_Saturn","surface_form":"Sega Saturn","offset":461},{"uri":"Sony_PlayStation","surface_form":"Sony PlayStation","offset":474},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":492},{"uri":"Dreamcast","surface_form":"Dreamcast","offset":508},{"uri":"Video_game_developer","surface_form":"developers","offset":548},{"uri":"Westwood_Studios","surface_form":"Westwood Studios","offset":570},{"uri":"Command_%26amp%3B_Conquer","surface_form":"Command & Conquer Series","offset":602},{"uri":"Resident_Evil_(video_game)","surface_form":"Resident Evil","offset":646},{"uri":"Synergistic","surface_form":"Synergistic","offset":665},{"uri":"Shiny_Entertainment","surface_form":"Shiny Entertainment","offset":701},{"uri":"David_Perry_(game_developer)","surface_form":"David Perry","offset":732},{"uri":"Earthworm_Jim","surface_form":"Earthworm Jim","offset":795},{"uri":"Tommy_Tallarico","surface_form":"Tommy Tallarico","offset":878},{"uri":"Doug_TenNapel","surface_form":"Doug TenNapel","offset":902},{"uri":"Bill_Kroyer","surface_form":"Bill Kroyer","offset":949},{"uri":"Andy_Luckey","surface_form":"Andy Luckey","offset":979},{"uri":"Stephen_Clarke-Willson","surface_form":"Stephen Clarke-Willson","offset":1185},{"uri":"Disney%27s_Aladdin_(video_game)","surface_form":"Disney's Aladdin","offset":1404},{"uri":"The_Lion_King_(video_game)","surface_form":"The Lion King","offset":1497},{"uri":"Mark_Dyne","surface_form":"Mark Dyne","offset":1596},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":1877},{"uri":"Titus_Software","surface_form":"Titus Software","offset":1894},{"uri":"Avalon_Interactive","surface_form":"Avalon Interactive","offset":1936},{"uri":"Video_game_industry","surface_form":"video game industry","offset":2426}]}
