{"id":321311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Stadium","text":"Teddy Stadium (, \"Itztadion Teddy\") is a football stadium in Jerusalem, Israel.\nIt is the homeground of Beitar Jerusalem F.C. and Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. It is named after the long time Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek. For Beitar the stadium was important. They played at the YMCA Stadium. That stadium was nicknamed \"The Sandbox\" because of its bad ground conditions.\nOriginally only the west and east sides of the stadium were built giving it a capacity of 13,000. In 1999 work was finished on a north side. Now the capacity is 21,600. The city of Jerusalem decided to increase the stadium's capacity to 34,000 seats until 2013 for UEFA European Under-21 Championship and the Maccabiah Olympic Games.\nThe stadium itself is one of the newest in Israel and meets all European standards. The stadium has 5,000 parking spots and is connected to the Malha Mall and its parking facilities by a pedestrian bridge. The stadium is located at the Begin Expressway and the Malha Train Station. So people can go to the stadium either by car or rail.\nBecause of its atmosphere (stands are close to the ground and the acoustics are excellent), Teddy Stadium hosted matches of the National football team. It was also the place for the Maccabiah Games opening ceremony and other public events.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":72},{"uri":"Teddy_Kollek","surface_form":"Teddy Kollek","offset":200},{"uri":"YMCA_Stadium","surface_form":"YMCA Stadium","offset":271},{"uri":"Jerusalem_Shopping_Mall","surface_form":"Malha Mall","offset":842},{"uri":"Begin_Expressway","surface_form":"Begin Expressway","offset":934},{"uri":"Jerusalem_Malha_Train_Station","surface_form":"Malha Train Station","offset":959},{"uri":"Maccabiah_Games","surface_form":"Maccabiah Games","offset":1217}]}
