{"id":321437,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment","text":"The magnetic moment of a magnet is a quantity that determines the force that the magnet can exert on electric currents and the torque that a magnetic field will exert on it. A loop of electric current, a bar magnet, an electron, a molecule, and a planet all have magnetic moments.\nBoth the magnetic moment and magnetic field may be considered to be vectors having a magnitude and direction. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of a magnet. The magnetic field produced by a magnet is proportional to its magnetic moment as well. More precisely, the term \"magnetic moment\" normally refers to a system's magnetic dipole moment, which produces the first term in the multipole expansion of a general magnetic field. The dipole component of an object's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.\nTwo definitions of moment.\nIn text books, two complementary approaches are used to define magnetic moments. In pre-1930's textbooks, they were defined using magnetic poles. Most recent textbooks define it in terms of Amp\u00E8rian currents.\nMagnetic pole definition.\nPhysicists represent sources of magnetic moments in materials as poles. The North and South poles are an analogy to the positive and negative charges in electrostatics. Consider a bar magnet which has magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite polarity. Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since magnetic poles always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels. This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors: on both the strength formula_1 of its poles, and on the vector formula_1 separating them. The moment is defined as\nIt points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with angular momentum (see Magnetic moment and angular momentum). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for magnetostatic calculations, particularly in applications to ferromagnets. Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the magnetic field by the irrotational field formula_1, in analogy to the electric field formula_1.\nCurrent loop definition.\nBy convention, the direction of the vector area is given by the right hand grip rule (curling the fingers of one's right hand in the direction of the current around the loop, when the palm of the hand is \"touching\" the loop's outer edge, and the straight thumb indicates the direction of the vector area and thus of the magnetic moment).\nIf the loop is not planar, the moment is given as\nwhere formula_1 is the position vector pointing from the origin to the location of the volume element, and formula_1 is the current density vector at that location.\nThe above equation can be used for calculating a magnetic moment of any assembly of moving charges, such as a spinning charged solid, by substituting\nwhere formula_1 is the electric charge density at a given point and formula_1 is the instantaneous linear velocity of that point.\nFor example, the magnetic moment produced by an electric charge moving along a circular path is\nwhere formula_1 is the position of the charge formula_1 relative to the center of the circle and formula_1 is the instantaneous velocity of the charge.\nPractitioners using the current loop model generally represent the magnetic field by the solenoidal field formula_1, analogous to the electrostatic field formula_1.\nMagnetic moment of a solenoid.\nA generalization of the above current loop is a multi-turn coil, or solenoid. Its moment is the vector sum of the moments of individual turns. If the solenoid has formula_1 identical turns (single-layer winding),\nUnits.\nThe ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal exactly to the speed of light in free space, expressed in cm/s.\nAll formulas in this article are correct in SI units, but in other unit systems, the formulas may need to be changed. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current I and area A has magnetic moment I\u00D7A (see below), but in Gaussian units the magnetic moment is I\u00D7A/c.\nFor relation between the notions of magnetic moment and magnetization see magnetization.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":25},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":66},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":127},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":141},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":184},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":208},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":219},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":231},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":247},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":349},{"uri":"Multipole_expansion","surface_form":"multipole expansion","offset":699},{"uri":"Dipole","surface_form":"dipole","offset":752},{"uri":"Electrostatics","surface_form":"electrostatics","offset":1345},{"uri":"Polarity_(physics)","surface_form":"polarity","offset":1440},{"uri":"Magnetic_poles_and_atomic_currents","surface_form":"magnetic pole","offset":1527},{"uri":"Magnetic_pole_strength","surface_form":"strength","offset":1875},{"uri":"Angular_momentum","surface_form":"angular momentum","offset":2138},{"uri":"Magnetostatics","surface_form":"magnetostatic","offset":2248},{"uri":"Ferromagnetism","surface_form":"ferromagnets","offset":2308},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":2393},{"uri":"Irrotational","surface_form":"irrotational","offset":2415},{"uri":"Electric_field","surface_form":"electric field","offset":2463},{"uri":"Right_hand_grip_rule","surface_form":"right hand grip rule","offset":2578},{"uri":"Current_density","surface_form":"current density","offset":3026},{"uri":"Solenoid","surface_form":"solenoid","offset":3684},{"uri":"Solenoid","surface_form":"solenoid","offset":3859},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light in free space","offset":4093},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"cm","offset":4136},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"s","offset":4139},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":4186},{"uri":"Gaussian_units","surface_form":"Gaussian units","offset":4374},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"c","offset":4416},{"uri":"Magnetization","surface_form":"magnetization","offset":4493}]}
