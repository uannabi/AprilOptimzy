The Turnverein was founded by Jewish members of the \"Ersten Wiener Turnverein 1861\" (First Vienna gymnastic club). In the 1880s the club allowed only members of German origin to be members. So did other sports clubs. The Jewish members formed the Deutsch-\u00D6sterreichischen Turnverein.\nIn 1898 the football section became a club of its own. In the first year they reached the final of the Challenge-Cup, a football competition for clubs from the Austrian- Hungary Empire. They lost 7-0 to Vienna Cricket and Football-Club. In the next editions the club reached the semi finals. In 1900/01 the \u00D6sterreichischen Fu\u00DFball-Union organized a league and Wiener FC was put in the 1. Klasse.
