{"id":3220,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force","text":"In physics, a force is an interaction between \"objects\". It is called an interaction because if one object acts on another, its action is \"matched\" by a reaction from the other object. This idea is known as Newton's third law, where \"action\" and \"reaction\" are \"equal and opposite\" (\"matched\").\nThe \"objects\" are just the things the force acts between. Different forces act between different sorts of object. For example, gravity acts between objects with mass, like the sun and the earth. Another example is electromagnetic force, which acts between objects with charge, like an electron and the nucleus of an atom. \"Gravity\" and \"electromagnetic force\" are two examples of forces.\nA force changes the state of an object (some physical quantity changes) or, strictly, the states of two objects, since the force is an interaction. For example, a force causes an affected object to be pushed or pulled in a certain direction. This changes the object's momentum. Forces cause objects to accelerate, add to the object's overall pressure, change direction, or change shape. The strength of a force is measured in Newtons (N). There are four fundamental forces in physics.\nA force is always a push, pull, or a twist, and it affects objects by pushing them up, pulling them down, pushing them to a side, or by changing their motion or shape in some other way.\nNewton's Second Law.\nwhere formula_1 is the force,\nformula_1 is the mass of an object,\nand formula_1 is the acceleration of the object.\nThis formula says that when there is a force on an object then it will move faster and faster.\nIf the force is weak and the object is heavy, then it will take a long time to increase the speed very much,\nbut if the force is strong and the object is light, then it will move a lot faster very quickly.\nWeight.\nGravity is an acceleration. Everything that has a mass is being pulled toward the Earth because of that acceleration. This pull is a force called weight.\nwhere formula_1 is the weight of an object,\nformula_1 is the mass of an object,\nand formula_1 is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level. It is about formula_1.\nThis formula says that when you know the mass of an object, then you can calculate how much force there is on the object because of gravity.\nYou must be on earth to use this formula. If you are on the moon or another planet, then you can use the formula but \"g\" will be different.\nForce is a vector, so it can be stronger or weaker and it can also point in different directions.\nGravity always points down into the ground (if you are not in space).\nGravitational force.\nformula_1 is force; formula_1 is the gravitational constant, which is used to show how gravity accelerates an object; formula_1 is the mass of one object; formula_1 is the mass of the second object; and formula_1 is the distance between the objects.\nThis equation is used to calculate how the earth moves around the sun and how the moon moves around the earth. It is also used to calculate how other planets, stars and objects in space move around.\nThe equation says that if two objects are very heavy then there is a strong force between them because of gravity.\nIf they are very far apart then the force is weaker.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":3},{"uri":"Interaction","surface_form":"interaction","offset":73},{"uri":"Reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":153},{"uri":"Newton%27s_third_law","surface_form":"Newton's third law","offset":207},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":422},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":456},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":471},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":483},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"electromagnetic force","offset":509},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"charge","offset":564},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":580},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":597},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":611},{"uri":"Momentum","surface_form":"momentum","offset":951},{"uri":"Acceleration","surface_form":"accelerate","offset":985},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":1025},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"change direction","offset":1035},{"uri":"Deformation","surface_form":"change shape","offset":1056},{"uri":"Fundamental_force","surface_form":"fundamental force","offset":1137},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":1422},{"uri":"Acceleration","surface_form":"acceleration","offset":1462},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":1976},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":2085},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":2411},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"directions","offset":2486},{"uri":"Gravitational_constant","surface_form":"gravitational constant","offset":2626}]}
