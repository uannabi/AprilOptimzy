The company publishes his books and also is the production company for his movies, \"What Is It?\" and \"It is Fine. Everything is Fine!\".\nGlover has written between 15 and 20 books. He makes the books by reusing old novels and other publications which are in the public domain due to their age. He rearranges text, blacks out certain standing passages, and adds his own prose and sometimes images.\nHis father is actor Bruce Glover. His mother was Betty Glover who died in 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":60},{"uri":"Back_to_the_Future","surface_form":"Back to the Future","offset":99},{"uri":"Epic_Movie","surface_form":"Epic Movie","offset":121},{"uri":"Willy_Wonka","surface_form":"Willy Wonka","offset":163},{"uri":"Johnny_Depp","surface_form":"Johnny Depp","offset":185},{"uri":"Open_Season","surface_form":"Open Season","offset":207},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":220},{"uri":"Volcanic_Eruptions","surface_form":"Volcanic Eruptions","offset":283},{"uri":"What_Is_It%3F","surface_form":"What Is It?","offset":387},{"uri":"It_is_Fine._Everything_is_Fine%21","surface_form":"It is Fine.
