{"id":3222,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units","text":"The International System of Units is the standard modern form of the metric system. The name of this system can be shortened or abbreviated to SI, from the French name \"Syst\u00E8me International d'unit\u00E9s\".\nThe International System of Units is a system of measurement based on 7 base units: the metre (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), Kelvin (temperature), mole (quantity), and candela (brightness). These base units can be used in combination with each other. This creates \"SI derived units\", which can be used to describe other quantities, such as volume, energy, pressure, and velocity.\nThe system is used almost globally. Only Myanmar, Liberia, and the United States do not use SI as their official system of measurement. In these countries, though, SI is commonly used in science and medicine.\nHistory and use.\nThe metric system was created in France after the French Revolution in 1789. The original system only had two standard units, the kilogram and the metre. The metric system became popular amongst scientists.\nIn the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) suggested a system with three base units - length, mass, and time. Other units would be derived from those three base units. Later, this suggestion would be used to create the centimetre-gram-second system of units (CGS), which used the centimetre as the base unit for length, the gram as the base unit for mass, and the second as the base unit for time. It also added the dyne as the base unit for force and the erg as the base unit for energy.\nAs scientists studied electricity and magnetism, they realized other base units were needed to describe these subjects. By the middle of the 20th century, many different versions of the metric system were being used. This was very confusing.\nIn 1954, the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) created the first version of the International System of Units. The six base units that they used were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, Kelvin, and candela. The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971.\nSI is now used almost everywhere in the world, except in the United States, Liberia and Myanmar, where the older imperial units are still widely used. Other countries, most of them historically related to the British Empire, are slowly replacing the old imperial system with the metric system or using both systems at the same time.\nBase units.\nThe SI base units are measurements used by scientists and other people around the world. All the other units can be written by combining these seven base units in different ways. These other units are called \"derived units\".\nDerived units.\nDerived units are created by combining the base units. The base units can be divided, multiplied, or raised to powers. Some derived units have special names. Usually these were created to make calculations simpler.\nPrefixes.\nVery large or very small measurements can be written using prefixes. Prefixes are added to the beginning of the unit to make a new unit. For example, the prefix \"kilo-\" means \"1000\" times the original unit and the prefix \"milli-\" means \"0.001\" times the original unit. So one \"kilometre\" is 1000\u00A0metres and one \"milligram\" is a 1000th of a gram.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metric_system","surface_form":"metric system","offset":69},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviated","offset":128},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":156},{"uri":"System_of_measurement","surface_form":"system of measurement","offset":241},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":290},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilogram","offset":306},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":323},{"uri":"Ampere","surface_form":"ampere","offset":338},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"Kelvin","offset":365},{"uri":"Mole_(unit)","surface_form":"mole","offset":387},{"uri":"Candela","surface_form":"candela","offset":408},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":580},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":588},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":596},{"uri":"Velocity","surface_form":"velocity","offset":610},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":661},{"uri":"Liberia","surface_form":"Liberia","offset":670},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":687},{"uri":"Metric_system","surface_form":"metric system","offset":850},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":879},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":896},{"uri":"1789","surface_form":"1789","offset":917},{"uri":"1860s","surface_form":"1860s","offset":1060},{"uri":"James_Clerk_Maxwell","surface_form":"James Clerk Maxwell","offset":1067},{"uri":"William_Thomson","surface_form":"William Thomson","offset":1091},{"uri":"Centimetre-gram-second_system_of_units","surface_form":"centimetre-gram-second system of units","offset":1312},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"centimetre","offset":1373},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":1417},{"uri":"Dyne","surface_form":"dyne","offset":1509},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":1535},{"uri":"Erg","surface_form":"erg","offset":1549},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":1604},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":1620},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1723},{"uri":"1954","surface_form":"1954","offset":1827},{"uri":"CGPM","surface_form":"General Conference on Weights and Measures","offset":1841},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":2098},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2165},{"uri":"Liberia","surface_form":"Liberia","offset":2180},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":2192},{"uri":"Imperial_unit","surface_form":"imperial unit","offset":2217},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":2313},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":2471},{"uri":"Exponent","surface_form":"powers","offset":2800},{"uri":"Prefix","surface_form":"prefix","offset":2973},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":3191},{"uri":"Milligram","surface_form":"milligram","offset":3226},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":3254}]}
