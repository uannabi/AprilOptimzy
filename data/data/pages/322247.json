It is about twice the size of a domestic cat, and eats mice, ground squirrels, and lemming. and young deer. The lynx's favorite food is the snowshoe hare, which makes up 60% to 97% of its diet. This wild animal is not endangered (except in the southern 48 states of the US). It is of \"least concern\" (IUCN). Humans hunt them for their beautiful, thick fur.\nIt has tufts on its ears whose function is probably social signalling.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":21},{"uri":"Lynx","surface_form":"lynx","offset":32},{"uri":"Taiga","surface_form":"taiga","offset":56},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":118},{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":131},{"uri":"Lemming","surface_form":"lemming","offset":146},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":165},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":191},{"uri":"Snowshoe_hare","surface_form":"snowshoe hare","offset":203},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":281},{"uri":"IUCN","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":364},{"uri":"Humans","surface_form":"Humans","offset":371},{"uri":"Hunt","surface_form":"hunt","offset":378},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":415},{"uri":"Tuft","surface_form":"tuft","offset":427},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":440}]}
