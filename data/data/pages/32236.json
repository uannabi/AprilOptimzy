{"id":32236,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Dover%2C_Ontario","text":"e=\"preserve\">Port Dover is a small fishing town in Ontario, Canada. During Friday the 13th, motorcycle fans dominate the town. There is also the famous \"Arbor Restaurant\" stand in the southern part of town where \"Cherry Glows\" are served instead of soft drinks and the bees frequent the outdoor place as much as the local customers and tourists do.\nThere was a public high school in the town where students aged 14 to 21 years of age study to earn their \"Ontario High School Diploma\"; it closed at the end of the 2013-14 school year. Port Dover is also the home to Ms. Carrie Sinkowski, a leader for rural equality, and a former candidate for the Canadian House of Commons. Live theatre is also done here as well as a miniature golf course, a beach, and a thriving seaport just to name a few attractions that Port Dover has to offer.\nThe town is dominated with little shops, with very few franchised businesses in the town; which sells irregular consumer items like British merchandise, local souvenirs and T-shirts that appeal to young tourists. Notable exceptions include Tim Hortons and Giant Tiger department store. On Friday the 13th, motorcycle people come to town in order to drink beer. However, they must be at least 19 years of age to perform this activity. While some violence has resulted in previous years, the 2007 running of the PD13 event was peaceful.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":35},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":51},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":60},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":92},{"uri":"Arbor_Restaurant_(Port_Dover)","surface_form":"Arbor Restaurant","offset":153},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":249},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":269},{"uri":"Customer","surface_form":"customers","offset":322},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":336},{"uri":"Port_Dover_Composite_School","surface_form":"public high school","offset":361},{"uri":"Rural","surface_form":"rural","offset":600},{"uri":"Miniature_golf","surface_form":"miniature golf","offset":718},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":743},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":765},{"uri":"Attraction","surface_form":"attraction","offset":792},{"uri":"Tim_Hortons","surface_form":"Tim Hortons","offset":1074},{"uri":"Giant_Tiger","surface_form":"Giant Tiger","offset":1090},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":1189}]}
