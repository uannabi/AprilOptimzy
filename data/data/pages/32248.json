{"id":32248,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie","text":"A pie is a baked food. It has a pastry crust with or without a pastry top. The filling of a pie is either savoury (with meat and/or vegetables) or sweet. Pies often have a round or oval shape. It originated in the United Kingdom.\nA pie is cooked beforehand: this is the main idea. It can be cooked days before it is eaten. The crust keeps it in good condition if the pie is kept in a cool place. The pie can be eaten warm or cold.\nFilling.\nPies are baked with a shell or crust, which is usually made of pastry. The filling may be fruit, meat, fish, vegetables, cheeses, creams, chocolate, custards, nuts, or other sweet or savoury ingredients.\nSweet pies.\nSome of these pies are pies in name only. An example is the Boston cream pie, which is a cake. Many fruit and berry pies are very similar, with the only difference being the fruit used in filling.\nRegional variations.\nThere are many different kinds of pie. People from different countries often have their own different type of pie.\nGreat Britain, Australia and New Zealand.\nMeat pies with fillings such as steak and cheese, steak and kidney, minced beef or chicken and mushroom are popular in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand as take-away snacks. They are also served with chips as an alternative to fish and chips at British chip shops. A \"Wigan kebab\" is a pie, put between halves of a flour-covered bap (bun). This is called a barm cake. The combination of pie and mash is associated with London. Shepherd's pie (which does not involve pastry) is a favourite with people in Britain.\nMost meat pies are served hot. Pork pies usually have a very high fat content and may be served cold. These meat pies contain beef and gravy in a shortcrust piecase, often with a flaky top. Many bakeries and specialty shops sell gourmet pies. Adelaide (a city in Australia) has the \"pie floater\", where a meat pie is floated in a plate of thick green pea soup.\nNorth America.\nPot pies with a flaky crust and bottom are a popular American dish. They usually have a filling of meat (often beef, chicken or turkey), gravy, and mixed vegetables (potatoes, carrots and peas). Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.\nFruit pies may be served with a scoop of ice cream, a style known in North America as \"\u00E0 la mode\". Apple pie is a traditional choice. This combination, and possibly the name as well, is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States.\nA tourti\u00E8re is a meat pie. It was first created in Quebec, Canada. It is usually made with ground pork, veal, or beef.\nPie throwing.\nCream filled or topped pies are favourite props for humour, particularly when aimed at people who are too serious. Throwing a pie in a person's face has been a staple of movie comedy since the early days of the movies. It is often associated with clowns in popular culture.\nPranksters have taken to targeting politicians and celebrities with their pies, an act called \"pieing\". Activists sometimes engage in the pieing of political and social targets as well. \"Pieing\" can result in injury to people and pie throwers can face assault or more serious charges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bake","surface_form":"bake","offset":11},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":17},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastry","offset":32},{"uri":"Crust","surface_form":"crust","offset":39},{"uri":"Savoury","surface_form":"savoury","offset":106},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":120},{"uri":"Vegetables","surface_form":"vegetables","offset":132},{"uri":"Sweet","surface_form":"sweet","offset":147},{"uri":"Oval","surface_form":"oval","offset":181},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":214},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastry","offset":503},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":530},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":537},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":543},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":549},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":561},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":570},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":578},{"uri":"Custard","surface_form":"custard","offset":589},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nut","offset":599},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":745},{"uri":"Steak_and_kidney_pie","surface_form":"steak and kidney","offset":1081},{"uri":"Minced_beef","surface_form":"minced beef","offset":1099},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":1114},{"uri":"Mushroom","surface_form":"mushroom","offset":1126},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1154},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1170},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":1184},{"uri":"Snack","surface_form":"snack","offset":1209},{"uri":"French_fried_potatoes","surface_form":"chips","offset":1243},{"uri":"Fish_and_chips","surface_form":"fish and chips","offset":1270},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":1358},{"uri":"Bap","surface_form":"bap","offset":1372},{"uri":"Barm_cake","surface_form":"barm cake","offset":1400},{"uri":"Pie_and_mash","surface_form":"pie and mash","offset":1430},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1462},{"uri":"Shepherd%27s_pie","surface_form":"Shepherd's pie","offset":1470},{"uri":"Bakery","surface_form":"bakeries","offset":1751},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":1774},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":1799},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1819},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":1907},{"uri":"Soup","surface_form":"soup","offset":1911},{"uri":"Pot_pies","surface_form":"Pot pies","offset":1932},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"American","offset":1985},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":2049},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"turkey","offset":2060},{"uri":"Carrot","surface_form":"carrot","offset":2108},{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":2227},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":2255},{"uri":"Apple_pie","surface_form":"Apple pie","offset":2285},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2429},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":2495},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":2503},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":2542},{"uri":"Veal","surface_form":"veal","offset":2548},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":2747},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":2753},{"uri":"Clown","surface_form":"clown","offset":2824},{"uri":"Popular_culture","surface_form":"popular culture","offset":2834},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":2886},{"uri":"Pieing","surface_form":"pieing","offset":2946},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"Activist","offset":2955},{"uri":"Assault","surface_form":"assault","offset":3103},{"uri":"Indictment","surface_form":"charges","offset":3127}]}
