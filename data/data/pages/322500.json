{"id":322500,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permineralization","text":"e=\"preserve\">Permineralization is a process of fossilization in which mineral deposits form internal casts of organisms.\nMinerals in water fill the spaces inside organic tissue. The process gives a record of soft tissue as well as hard tissues. Fossils with permineralization are useful in studying internal structures, especially of plants.\nSilicification.\nSilicification is the most common type of permineralization.\nCarbonate mineralization.\nCarbonate mineralization occurs as coal balls. Coal balls are fossilizations of plants and their tissues, usually made when there is seawater or acidic peat. This type of fossilization gives information about plant life in the Upper Carboniferous (325 to 280 million years ago).\nPyritization.\nOrganisms are pyritized when they are in marine sediments saturated with iron sulfides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":47},{"uri":"Casting","surface_form":"casts","offset":101},{"uri":"Coal_ball","surface_form":"Coal ball","offset":492},{"uri":"Peat","surface_form":"peat","offset":597},{"uri":"Upper_Carboniferous","surface_form":"Upper Carboniferous","offset":672},{"uri":"Iron_sulfide","surface_form":"iron sulfide","offset":811}]}
