{"id":322612,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow_Island_School","text":"Crow Island School is an elementary school in Winnetka, Illinois. Several architects worked together to design the building. Eero Saarinen worked with the architectural firm of Perkins, Wheeler and Will. The building was finished in 1940. It is different from many other schools because of its design and its ideas about education. Now, kindergarten through fourth grade students go to this school.\nThe first jungle gym is here. It used to be at the Horace Mann School, but that school building was taken down in 1940. People who ran the school moved this special playground equipment to the Crow Island School then.\nThe building won the Twenty-five Year Award in 1971. The school was named a National Historic Landmark in 1990.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Elementary_school","surface_form":"elementary school","offset":25},{"uri":"Winnetka%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Winnetka, Illinois","offset":46},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":74},{"uri":"Eero_Saarinen","surface_form":"Eero Saarinen","offset":125},{"uri":"Architectural_firm","surface_form":"architectural firm","offset":155},{"uri":"Jungle_gym","surface_form":"jungle gym","offset":409},{"uri":"Horace_Mann_School","surface_form":"Horace Mann School","offset":450},{"uri":"Twenty-five_Year_Award","surface_form":"Twenty-five Year Award","offset":638},{"uri":"National_Historic_Landmark","surface_form":"National Historic Landmark","offset":693}]}
