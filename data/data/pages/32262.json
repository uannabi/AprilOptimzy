{"id":32262,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose","text":"The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word \"Rosa\". The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow roses and sometimes white or purple roses. Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild and they come from several parts of the world, North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 100 different species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been chosen by people.\nOver hundreds of years they have been specially bred to produce a wide variety of growing habits and a broad range of colours from dark red to white including as well yellow and a bluish/lilac colour. Many roses have a strong, pleasant scent. Most roses have prickles (incorrectly called thorns) on their stems. Rose bushes are able to tolerate a wide variety of growing conditions. The fruit of the rose is called a hip. Some roses have decorative hips.\nRoses are widely used across the world as symbols of love, sympathy or sorrow.\nRose is widely used as a girl's name.\nAlso, roses protect themselves from other predators trying to hunt them with thorns, a widely known defense system.\nRoses in legend and in history.\nThe rose was sacred to Venus (mythology). Venus was the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It was also linked with Cupid (son of Venus). He was the Roman god of desire \u2013 in one myth, he dropped nectar and the nectar bubbled up from the ground as roses. The rose was also sacred to Bacchus. He was the Roman god of wine.\nRich Romans would lie on couches with roses laid on them. They would wear roses tied onto string around their neck. Anything which was said \"under the rose\" was considered to be a secret. Cleopatra VII of Egypt was said to have had a floor of her palace covered in roses before her lover Mark Antony visited her.\nThe rose has been used as a symbol of love for hundreds of years.\nDescription and use.\nThe flower of the rose plant can be different sizes. It may be as small as 1/2 inch across to a diameter of almost 7 inches.\nAlso, roses can be used for good scent. The scent of the rose comes from tiny perfume glands on the petals, which can be seen through a powerful microscope. Sometimes rose petals are dried and packed so that you can use them for decoration or for scent.\nRoses can be seen very much in gardens. Sometimes they can be in vineyards as well. In a big vineyard, a bush of roses are planted at the end of each row of vines. As long as the roses stay healthy, the vine growers can see that their vines are healthy as well.\nGarden roses.\nThere are thousands of rose cultivars that people grow in gardens and on farms. The names used to describe the different types often refer to one species that is the main ancestor of that group, for example, Gallica roses are mostly descended from \"Rosa gallica\". Other groups have several different species among their ancestors. Hybrid Tea roses, Floribunda roses, and English roses are the most common in gardens today. They are of so many colours like red, yellow, orange, pink, purple and so on\nSymbolism.\nIn the Catholic religion, rose is a symbolic element of the Holy Rosary; it is reported that Fra Angelico, praying the rosary in the street, saw the Virgin with a group of Angels offering her\nhymns and prayers while they were composing a crown of roses. Surprised by the vision, he interrupted the prayer and the angels stopped; when he prayed again he saw the angels recommencing to compose the crown of roses to offer to Mary.\nDifferent colored roses have different meanings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":22},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":32},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":63},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":239},{"uri":"Rosaceae","surface_form":"Rosaceae","offset":263},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":351},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":366},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":384},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":409},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":418},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":456},{"uri":"Cultivar","surface_form":"cultivar","offset":547},{"uri":"Spine_(botany)","surface_form":"prickles","offset":851},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stems","offset":897},{"uri":"Hip","surface_form":"hip","offset":1009},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1089},{"uri":"Sacred","surface_form":"sacred","offset":1325},{"uri":"Venus_(mythology)","surface_form":"Venus (mythology)","offset":1335},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman","offset":1368},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":1374},{"uri":"Link","surface_form":"linked","offset":1414},{"uri":"Cupid","surface_form":"Cupid","offset":1426},{"uri":"Desire","surface_form":"desire","offset":1472},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":1488},{"uri":"Nectar","surface_form":"nectar","offset":1505},{"uri":"Liquid_bubble","surface_form":"bubbled","offset":1527},{"uri":"Bacchus","surface_form":"Bacchus","offset":1592},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":1625},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":1636},{"uri":"Sofa","surface_form":"couch","offset":1656},{"uri":"Secret","surface_form":"secret","offset":1811},{"uri":"Cleopatra_VII_of_Egypt","surface_form":"Cleopatra VII of Egypt","offset":1819},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":1878},{"uri":"Mark_Antony","surface_form":"Mark Antony","offset":1919},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":2110},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":2127},{"uri":"Scent","surface_form":"scent","offset":2189},{"uri":"Decoration","surface_form":"decoration","offset":2385},{"uri":"Cultivar","surface_form":"cultivar","offset":2714},{"uri":"Rosary","surface_form":"Rosary","offset":3262},{"uri":"Fra_Angelico","surface_form":"Fra Angelico","offset":3290},{"uri":"Virgin","surface_form":"Virgin","offset":3346},{"uri":"Angels","surface_form":"Angels","offset":3369}]}
