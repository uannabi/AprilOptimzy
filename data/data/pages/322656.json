{"id":322656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Anti-Bigamy_Act","text":"The Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act (37th United States Congress, Sess. 2., ch. 126,) was a federal law. The act banned men having more than one wife at the same time (bigamy). It also limited the amount of property that a church and non-profit could own in any territory of the United States to $50,000. Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont sponsored it. President Abraham Lincoln signed it on July 8, 1862.\nHistory.\nThe act wanted to stop the Mormon practice of plural marriage and the property dominance of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Utah Territory. The measure had no funds allocated for enforcement. Lincoln chose not to enforce this law. Instead, Lincoln gave Brigham Young tacit permission to ignore the Morrill Act in exchange for not becoming involved with the Civil War. General Patrick Edward Connor, commanding officer of the federal forces garrisoned at Fort Douglas, Utah beginning in 1862 was explicitly instructed not to confront the Mormons over this or any other issue.\nIn 1878 the Supreme Court ruled in \"Reynolds v. United States\" that religious duty was not a suitable defense for breaking this law. Many Mormons went into hiding.The Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act was amended in 1882 by the Edmunds Act, and then again in 1887 by the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act. By 1904, the LDS church disavowed bigamy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"37th_United_States_Congress","surface_form":"37th United States Congress","offset":29},{"uri":"Bigamy","surface_form":"bigamy","offset":160},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"$","offset":288},{"uri":"Justin_Smith_Morrill","surface_form":"Justin Smith Morrill","offset":297},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":321},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":353},{"uri":"Mormon","surface_form":"Mormon","offset":432},{"uri":"Plural_marriage","surface_form":"plural marriage","offset":451},{"uri":"The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","surface_form":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints","offset":497},{"uri":"Utah_Territory","surface_form":"Utah Territory","offset":552},{"uri":"Brigham_Young","surface_form":"Brigham Young","offset":681},{"uri":"Tacit","surface_form":"tacit","offset":695},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":785},{"uri":"Patrick_Edward_Connor","surface_form":"Patrick Edward Connor","offset":804},{"uri":"Fort_Douglas%2C_Utah","surface_form":"Fort Douglas, Utah","offset":882},{"uri":"Reynolds_v._United_States","surface_form":"Reynolds v.
