He was a shortstop and a first baseman. He spent his entire 19-year career with the Chicago Cubs of the National League (1953\u20131971).\nHe hit 512 home runs in his career. Very few players have hit more than 500 home runs in their careers. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. He was known as \"Mr. Cub\".\nIn 2013, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\nHigh school years.\nBanks was born in Dallas, Texas and went to Booker T.

He was their first black player. He played for the Cubs his entire career. He started at shortstop, then moved to first base in 1962.\nIn 1955, he set the record for grand slam home runs in a single season with five. That record stood for over thirty years.\nBanks won the National League Most Valuable Player Award twice, in 1958 and 1959. He became the first shortstop in the history of the National League to win the MVP award in back to back seasons.\nOn May 12, 1970, at Chicago's Wrigley Field, Banks hit his 500th career home run. Banks finished his career with 512 home runs, and his 277 homers as a shortstop were the most ever at the time of his retirement.
