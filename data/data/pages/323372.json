{"id":323372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy","text":"An Absolute monarchy is a form of monarchy where one person, usually called a monarch holds absolute power. It is in contrast to constitutional monarchy, which is restrained or controlled by other groups of people. Controllers may be an entity such as clergy, lawmakers, social elites or a written constitution.\nVirtually all monarchs in the Middle Ages were absolute rulers within their kingdom. After the French Revolution (end-18th century) it became ever more common for monarchs to be limited by a constitution.\nNowadays, there are a few Absolute monarchies that have been preserved, mostly in Arab and Middle Eastern countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"monarchy","offset":34},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":53},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":78},{"uri":"Constitutional_monarchy","surface_form":"constitutional monarchy","offset":129},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":298},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":342},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":407},{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":599},{"uri":"Middle_Eastern","surface_form":"Middle Eastern","offset":608}]}
