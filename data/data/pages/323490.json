{"id":323490,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone","text":"A ketone is an organic compound that has a carbon atom with a double bond to an oxygen atom (this is called carbonyl functional group). This carbon atom must also have single bonds to two other carbon atoms.\nA ketone can be produced by oxidating a secondary alcohol.\nA ketone will show a strong peak between 1690 and 1715cm-1 using infrared spectroscopy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":15},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":43},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":50},{"uri":"Double_bond","surface_form":"double bond","offset":62},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":80},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"functional group","offset":117},{"uri":"Secondary_alcohol","surface_form":"secondary alcohol","offset":248},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":332},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopy","offset":341}]}
