{"id":323956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_cedar","text":"The Cyprus cedar (\"Cedrus brevifolia\") is a large coniferous member of the \"cedrus\" genus and is native to Cyprus where it grows in the Tro\u00F6dos Mountains. It is thought by some experts to be either a variety or a subspecies of the Cedar of Lebanon.\nIt grows to 25m in height and up to 12m in width. When young it has a conical shape but as it matures it becomes broader with a flattened top. It has bark that is silvery-grey, becoming thickened, with deep cracks as the tree ages. The needle-shaped leaves are grey-green to mid-green, but sometimes bluish-green and they are attached singly to long shoots and in dense cluster of 20-30 on short shoots. The cones are cylindrical, 7\u201310\u00A0cm long and green when young but maturing to a pale brown when they shed their scales and winged seeds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coniferous","surface_form":"coniferous","offset":50},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":84},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":107},{"uri":"Variety","surface_form":"variety","offset":200},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":213},{"uri":"Cedar_of_Lebanon","surface_form":"Cedar of Lebanon","offset":231}]}
