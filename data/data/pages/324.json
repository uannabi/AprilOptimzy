{"id":324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History","text":"e=\"preserve\">History is the study of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at things \"from\" the past including sources (like books, newspapers, and letters) and artifacts (like pottery, tools, and human or animal remains.) Libraries, archives, and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a historian. A person who studies pre-history and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist. A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist. The study of the sources and methods \"used to study and write\" history is called historiography.\nPeople can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened at some point in the past. This is called oral history. For example, when people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old, some historians recorded them talking about their lives, so that history would not be lost.\nIn old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often. Some groups of people never met each other. The rulers of Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were \"barbarian\". But they were still connected, even if they didn't realize it.\nTimeline of history.\nCurrent events, modern economic history, modern social history and modern intellectual history take very different views of the way history has affected the way that we think today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"study","offset":28},{"uri":"Thing","surface_form":"things","offset":102},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":149},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":156},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":172},{"uri":"Artifact_(archaeology)","surface_form":"artifacts","offset":185},{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"pottery","offset":201},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":210},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"Libraries","offset":247},{"uri":"Archive","surface_form":"archive","offset":258},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":272},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":380},{"uri":"Pre-history","surface_form":"pre-history","offset":412},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":496},{"uri":"Human_race","surface_form":"mankind","offset":532},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":544},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":565},{"uri":"Historiography","surface_form":"historiography","offset":662},{"uri":"Oral_history","surface_form":"oral history","offset":807},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slaves","offset":859},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":870},{"uri":"Survivor","surface_form":"survivor","offset":889},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":1183},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1192},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":1200},{"uri":"Ancient_China","surface_form":"Ancient China","offset":1217},{"uri":"Barbarian","surface_form":"barbarian","offset":1325},{"uri":"Current_events","surface_form":"Current events","offset":1421},{"uri":"Modern_economic_history","surface_form":"modern economic history","offset":1437},{"uri":"Modern_social_history","surface_form":"modern social history","offset":1462},{"uri":"Modern_intellectual_history","surface_form":"modern intellectual history","offset":1488}]}
