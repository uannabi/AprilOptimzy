{"id":324053,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_city","text":"e=\"preserve\">In the airline industry, a focus city is an airport that is important to one airline but is not a hub. An airline has daily flights from the Focus city to many destinations that are also not its hubs. Even though the word \"city\" is part of this term, it means a city's airport, not the city.\nAn example of an airline's focus city is US Airways (now part of American Airlines) at Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. Focus city airports can have some of the same facilities that hubs have. For example, the airline may repair or clean their aircraft at a focus city because it is cheaper. They might also have places and equipment to handle cargo.\nMany low-cost carriers that mostly fly point-to-point use focus cities more than hubs. Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Allegiant Air and WestJet in the Americas, and Ryanair, EasyJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wizz Air in Europe are examples.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":20},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":28},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":57},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":90},{"uri":"Airline_hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":111},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":275},{"uri":"US_Airways","surface_form":"US Airways","offset":346},{"uri":"American_Airlines","surface_form":"American Airlines","offset":370},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport","surface_form":"Washington National Airport","offset":392},{"uri":"Arlington%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Arlington, Virginia","offset":423},{"uri":"Facility","surface_form":"facilities","offset":490},{"uri":"Repair","surface_form":"repair","offset":546},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":568},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":668},{"uri":"Low-cost_carrier","surface_form":"low-cost carrier","offset":680},{"uri":"Point-to-point_transit","surface_form":"point-to-point","offset":714},{"uri":"Southwest_Airlines","surface_form":"Southwest Airlines","offset":762},{"uri":"Spirit_Airlines","surface_form":"Spirit Airlines","offset":782},{"uri":"JetBlue_Airways","surface_form":"JetBlue Airways","offset":799},{"uri":"Allegiant_Air","surface_form":"Allegiant Air","offset":816},{"uri":"WestJet","surface_form":"WestJet","offset":834},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":849},{"uri":"Ryanair","surface_form":"Ryanair","offset":863},{"uri":"EasyJet","surface_form":"EasyJet","offset":872},{"uri":"Norwegian_Air_Shuttle","surface_form":"Norwegian Air Shuttle","offset":881},{"uri":"Wizz_Air","surface_form":"Wizz Air","offset":907},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":919}]}
