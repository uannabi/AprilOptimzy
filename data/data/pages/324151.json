He was a great-grandson of John Veitch, the founder of the Veitch family plant growing business. He also visited the Philippines, Australia, Fiji, and other Polynesian islands looking for new plants to bring back to Great Britain.\nHe brought back a number of the glasshouse plants that were in fashion at the time, such as \"Acalyphas\", \"Cordylines\", \"Codiaeums\" (Crotons) and \"Dracaenas\", and from Fiji, a palm of a new genus later named after him, \"Veitchia joannis\", in addition to this genus the Veitch family name is honoured by hundreds of other plant names.\nIn Japan, he met another famous plant collector called Robert Fortune, and their competing collections returned to England on the same ship. For example, each man claimed that they had discovered a species of \"Chamaecyparis pisifera\" (a kind of cypress).\nHe married Jane Hodge soon after his return to England in 1866 and they had two sons, James Herbert Veitch, (1868 \u2013 1907) and John Gould Veitch, Jr. (1869 \u2013 1914)\nJohn Gould Veitch died of tuberculosis at the age of 31.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victorian_era","surface_form":"Victorian","offset":137},{"uri":"John_Veitch_(horticulturist)","surface_form":"John Veitch","offset":247},{"uri":"Fiji","surface_form":"Fiji","offset":361},{"uri":"Dracaena_(plant)","surface_form":"Dracaena","offset":597},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":640},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":1228}]}
