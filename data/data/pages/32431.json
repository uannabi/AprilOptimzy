{"id":32431,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Richards","text":"Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English guitarist best known as a founder member of the Rolling Stones. He is mostly famous for his rhythm guitar playing, but he can also play lead guitar quite well. He often likes to use a guitar with only 5 strings \u2014 the lowest-tuned string is removed. On a small number of Rolling Stones recordings, he plays bass guitar, as well as other instruments. He sings background vocals on most Rolling Stones songs. Occasionally, he also sings lead vocals, on songs like \"Happy\", \"Little T & A\", and \"The Worst\".\nDuring the late 1960s and most of the 1970s, he had a serious addiction to heroin. However, he recovered and quit using it. Sometimes, in interviews, he talks about taking drugs in a way that seems humorous.\nIn 2003 he was ranked 10th on Rolling Stone Magazine's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".\nRichards has co-written and recorded hundreds of songs with his song writing partner Mick Jagger. Fourteen of their songs are listed by Rolling Stone Magazine in their \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" issue.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":45},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":53},{"uri":"The_Rolling_Stones","surface_form":"the Rolling Stones","offset":97},{"uri":"Rhythm_guitar","surface_form":"rhythm guitar","offset":145},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":359},{"uri":"Heroin","surface_form":"heroin","offset":631},{"uri":"Rolling_Stone_Magazine","surface_form":"Rolling Stone Magazine","offset":794},{"uri":"Mick_Jagger","surface_form":"Mick Jagger","offset":943}]}
