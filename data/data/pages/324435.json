The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains the database.\nEach record in the PubMed database is assigned a special number to identify it. This is the PMID, an acronym for \"PubMed IDentifier\" number. PMIDs do not change over time and they are never reused. Any PMID is only a number. The PMID tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content of any publication.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database","offset":24},{"uri":"Life_sciences","surface_form":"life sciences","offset":50},{"uri":"National_Institutes_of_Health","surface_form":"National Institutes of Health","offset":161},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":322}]}
