It is a co-production of Graham King's GK Films and Johnny Depp's Infinitum Nihil. It stars Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, and Jude Law.\n\"Hugo\" is Scorsese's first movie to be shot in 3D.\nPlot.\nIn 1931, Hugo Cabret, a 12-year-old boy who lives with his father, a widowed, but kind and devoted master clockmaker in Paris. Hugo's father takes him to see movies and loves the movies of Georges M\u00E9li\u00E8s best of all. Hugo's father is burned alive in a museum fire, and Hugo is taken away by his uncle, an alcoholic watchmaker who is responsible for maintaining the clocks in the railway station of Gare Montparnasse. His uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks, then disappears. Hugo lives between the walls of the station, maintaining the clocks, stealing food and working on his father's most ambitious project: repairing a broken automaton \u2013 a mechanical man who is supposed to write with a pen. Hugo steals mechanical parts in the station to repair the automaton, but he is caught by a toy store owner who takes away Hugo's blueprints for the automaton. The automaton is missing one part \u2013 a heart\u2013shaped key. Convinced that the automaton contains a message from his father, Hugo goes to desperate lengths to fix the machine. He gains the assistance of Isabelle, a girl close to his age and the goddaughter of the toy shop owner. He introduces Isabelle to the movies, which her godfather has never let her see. Isabelle turns out to have the key to the automaton. When they use the key to activate the automaton, it produces a drawing of a movie scene Hugo remembers his father telling him about. They discover that the movie was created by Georges M\u00E9li\u00E8s, Isabelle's godfather, an early \u2013 but now neglected and disillusioned \u2013 cinema legend, and that the automaton was a beloved creation of his, from his days as a magician. In the end, the children reconnect Georges with his past and with a new generation of cinema aficionados who have come to appreciate his work","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"2011","surface_form":"2011","offset":10},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":15},{"uri":"3D_movie","surface_form":"3D","offset":24},{"uri":"Adventure_movie","surface_form":"adventure","offset":27},{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama movie","offset":37},{"uri":"Brian_Selznick","surface_form":"Brian Selznick","offset":66},{"uri":"The_Invention_of_Hugo_Cabret","surface_form":"The Invention of Hugo Cabret","offset":90},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":125},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":167},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":173},{"uri":"Martin_Scorsese","surface_form":"Martin Scorsese","offset":253},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"screenwriter","offset":280},{"uri":"John_Logan_(writer)","surface_form":"John Logan","offset":297},{"uri":"Graham_King","surface_form":"Graham King","offset":334},{"uri":"Johnny_Depp","surface_form":"Johnny Depp","offset":361},{"uri":"Infinitum_Nihil","surface_form":"Infinitum Nihil","offset":375},{"uri":"Asa_Butterfield","surface_form":"Asa Butterfield","offset":401},{"uri":"Ben_Kingsley","surface_form":"Ben Kingsley","offset":418},{"uri":"Sacha_Baron_Cohen","surface_form":"Sacha Baron Cohen","offset":432},{"uri":"Ray_Winstone","surface_form":"Ray Winstone","offset":451},{"uri":"Emily_Mortimer","surface_form":"Emily Mortimer","offset":465},{"uri":"Jude_Law","surface_form":"Jude Law","offset":485},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":522},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":542},{"uri":"1931","surface_form":"1931","offset":555},{"uri":"Boy","surface_form":"boy","offset":588},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father","offset":611},{"uri":"Clockmaker","surface_form":"clockmaker","offset":658},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":672},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father","offset":776},{"uri":"Uncle","surface_form":"uncle","offset":847},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholic","offset":857},{"uri":"Watchmaker","surface_form":"watchmaker","offset":867},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clocks","offset":917},{"uri":"Train_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":931},{"uri":"Uncle","surface_form":"uncle","offset":973},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clocks","offset":1011},{"uri":"Train_station","surface_form":"station","offset":1072},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clocks","offset":1097},{"uri":"Theft","surface_form":"stealing","offset":1105},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":1114},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father's","offset":1138},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"man","offset":1215},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"write","offset":1238},{"uri":"Pen","surface_form":"pen","offset":1251},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy store","offset":1347},{"uri":"Blueprint","surface_form":"blueprints","offset":1385},{"uri":"Key","surface_form":"key","offset":1466},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father","offset":1528},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":1578},{"uri":"Girl","surface_form":"girl","offset":1626},{"uri":"Goddaughter","surface_form":"goddaughter","offset":1656},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy shop","offset":1675},{"uri":"Godparent","surface_form":"godfather","offset":1739},{"uri":"Father","surface_form":"father","offset":1932},{"uri":"Godparent","surface_form":"godfather","offset":2029},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"children","offset":2203}]}
