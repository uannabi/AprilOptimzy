{"id":324606,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Commonwealth_Games","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The 2014 Commonwealth Games were held in Glasgow, Scotland.\nIt is the largest multi-sport event ever held in Scotland, although the country previously hosted the 1970 and 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Over the last 10 years, however, Glasgow and Scotland have also staged World, Commonwealth, European, or British events in all 17 sports proposed for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, including the World Badminton Championships in 1997.\nSelection process.\nScotland was the first country to consider hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games in 2004, with Scottish cities being invited by the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland to consider making a bid. In September 2004, Glasgow was announced as the Scottish candidate city over Edinburgh (which hosted the Games in 1970 and 1986, and the inaugural Commonwealth Youth Games in 2000) following a cost-benefit analysis by the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland. The Scottish Executive under then First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell, with the support of the United Kingdom government and all main parties in the Scottish Parliament, formally announced Glasgow's intention to host the games on 16 August 2005.\nIn March 2006, the bidding process began, with the Glasgow Bid team presenting their case to the Commonwealth Games Federation at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, along with the other confirmed candidate cities; the Nigerian capital, Abuja and Halifax in Canada. In October 2006, the first voting delegates arrived in Glasgow, in order to inspect the city's existing and proposed amenities and facilities. Glasgow announced on 16 January 2007, the 17 sports to be included should its bid be successful. Halifax later withdrew its bid on 8 March 2007, following the withdrawal of funding from the municipal government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":55},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":64},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":212},{"uri":"World_Badminton_Championships","surface_form":"World Badminton Championships","offset":416},{"uri":"Commonwealth_Games_Council_for_Scotland","surface_form":"Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland","offset":604},{"uri":"1970_British_Commonwealth_Games","surface_form":"1970","offset":784},{"uri":"1986_Commonwealth_Games","surface_form":"1986","offset":793},{"uri":"Commonwealth_Youth_Games","surface_form":"Commonwealth Youth Games","offset":817},{"uri":"2000_Commonwealth_Youth_Games","surface_form":"2000","offset":845},{"uri":"Cost-benefit_analysis","surface_form":"cost-benefit analysis","offset":863},{"uri":"Scottish_Executive","surface_form":"Scottish Executive","offset":937},{"uri":"First_Minister_of_Scotland","surface_form":"First Minister of Scotland","offset":967},{"uri":"Jack_McConnell","surface_form":"Jack McConnell","offset":995},{"uri":"Her_Majesty%27s_Government","surface_form":"United Kingdom government","offset":1035},{"uri":"Scottish_Parliament","surface_form":"Scottish Parliament","offset":1089},{"uri":"2006_Commonwealth_Games","surface_form":"2006 Commonwealth Games","offset":1320},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":1347},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":1411},{"uri":"Abuja","surface_form":"Abuja","offset":1429},{"uri":"Halifax_Regional_Municipality","surface_form":"Halifax","offset":1439},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1450}]}
