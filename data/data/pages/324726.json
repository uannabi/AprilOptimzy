He is an entomologist who studies ants, but to the public he is known for sociobiology, biodiversity and conservation.\nWilson's writing has been very influential. He is a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction. He is known for his role as \"the father of sociobiology\", his environmentalism, and his secular humanist and deist ideas on religion and ethics.\nHe holds the posts of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Curator in Entomology, Harvard University, and a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He is a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was awarded the National Medal of Science (1977), and the Crafoord Prize (1990), which recognizes research in scientific fields not eligible for the Nobel Prize.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":58},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":69},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":84},{"uri":"Entomologist","surface_form":"entomologist","offset":101},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":126},{"uri":"Sociobiology","surface_form":"sociobiology","offset":166},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":180},{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":197},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize","offset":286},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":317},{"uri":"Environmentalism","surface_form":"environmentalism","offset":388},{"uri":"Secular","surface_form":"secular","offset":414},{"uri":"Humanist","surface_form":"humanist","offset":422},{"uri":"Deist","surface_form":"deist","offset":435},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":450},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":463},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":548},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Fellow","offset":574},{"uri":"Committee_for_Skeptical_Inquiry","surface_form":"Committee for Skeptical Inquiry","offset":588},{"uri":"International_Academy_of_Humanism","surface_form":"International Academy of Humanism","offset":654},{"uri":"National_Medal_of_Science","surface_form":"National Medal of Science","offset":708},{"uri":"Crafoord_Prize","surface_form":"Crafoord Prize","offset":750},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":841}]}
