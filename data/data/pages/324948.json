{"id":324948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupid_(art_movement)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Stupid was a short-lived grouping of constructivist artists, formed in Cologne in 1919. The founding members were Willy Fick, Heinrich Hoerle and his wife Angelika Hoerle (1899\u20131923), Anton R\u00E4derscheidt and his wife Marta Hegemann, and Franz Wilhelm Seiwert.\nThe Stupid group aimed to address sociopolitical issues through an art of proletarian character. Seiwert and R\u00E4derscheidt were at the time active in the local Dada scene. R\u00E4derscheidt's studio was their base of operations, but by 1920 he had abandoned the constructivist style. The group exhibited together and issued a publication, \"Stupid 1\", before disbanding.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constructivism_(art)","surface_form":"constructivist","offset":50},{"uri":"Cologne","surface_form":"Cologne","offset":84},{"uri":"Willy_Fick","surface_form":"Willy Fick","offset":127},{"uri":"Heinrich_Hoerle","surface_form":"Heinrich Hoerle","offset":139},{"uri":"Anton_R%C3%A4derscheidt","surface_form":"Anton R\u00E4derscheidt","offset":197},{"uri":"Franz_Wilhelm_Seiwert","surface_form":"Franz Wilhelm Seiwert","offset":249},{"uri":"Dada","surface_form":"Dada","offset":431}]}
