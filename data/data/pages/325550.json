{"id":325550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Dry_Dock_and_Shipbuilding_Company","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Western Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company operated at Port Arthur, Ontario, now part of Thunder Bay, on Lake Superior from its organization in October 1909 until its reorganization in November 1916 as the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company. It was probably a subsidiary of the Cleveland-based American Ship Building Company until entrepreneur James Whalen took control in 1916. Whalen was president from 1909\u20131916.\nIts dry dock and shops were located at Bare Point at the extreme eastern end of the Thunder Bay harbour. They were constructed in 1910. The first launching of a vessel was June 27, 1911, a scow or barge for the Great Lakes Dredging Company.\nDuring the First World War, the company also produced shells and munitions for the Imperial Munitions Board. It also built Big Bull tractors in 1915.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Port_Arthur%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Port Arthur","offset":71},{"uri":"Thunder_Bay","surface_form":"Thunder Bay","offset":105},{"uri":"Lake_Superior","surface_form":"Lake Superior","offset":121},{"uri":"American_Ship_Building_Company","surface_form":"American Ship Building Company","offset":308},{"uri":"James_Whalen_(Canadian_businessman)","surface_form":"James Whalen","offset":358},{"uri":"Imperial_Munitions_Board","surface_form":"Imperial Munitions Board","offset":754}]}
