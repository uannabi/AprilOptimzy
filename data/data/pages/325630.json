{"id":325630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_information_display_system","text":"A Flight Information Display System (FIDS) is a computer system in airports. It tells passengers about arrivals and departures as they happen. The computer system controls mechanical or electronic displays or TV screens.\nIn large airports, there is a FIDS for each terminal. Some airports use a separate FIDS for each major airline. FID systems help passengers during air travel and people who want to pick-up passengers after the flight.\nBecause of code sharing, a single flight may be shown with many different flight numbers. For example, a flight may use the flight numbers LH474 and AC9099) even though there is just one aircraft doing both flights. Lines may be sorted by time, airline name, or city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":48},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":57},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":67},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":86},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":172},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":186},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"TV screens","offset":209},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":324},{"uri":"Air_travel","surface_form":"air travel","offset":368},{"uri":"Code_sharing","surface_form":"code sharing","offset":450},{"uri":"Lufthansa","surface_form":"LH","offset":578},{"uri":"Air_Canada","surface_form":"AC","offset":588}]}
