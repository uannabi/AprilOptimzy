{"id":32566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky","text":"Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (11 November 1821 \u2013 9 February 1881) was a Russian novelist.\nThe event of his life.\nIn his 20s he joined a group of radicals in St Petersburg They were into French socialist ideas. A police agent reported the group to the authorities. On 22 April 1849, Dostoyevsky was arrested and imprisoned with the other members. After months of questioning and investigation they were tried. They were found guilty of planning to distribute subversive propaganda and condemned to death by firing squad.\nThe punishment was changed to a sentence of exile and hard labour, but not before they were forced to go through a mock execution. In 1859 a new tsar allowed Dostoyevsky to end his Siberian exile. A year later he was back in St Petersburg. The experience had cost him ten years of his life. It is the root of all his writing.\nReligion.\nRaised in an educated and religious family, Dostoyevsky's beliefs changed through his life. In prison, he focused intensely on the figure of Christ and on the \"New Testament\", the only book allowed in prison. In a letter to the woman who had sent him the \"New Testament\", Dostoyevsky wrote that he was a \"child of unbelief and doubt up to this moment, and I am certain that I shall remain so to the grave\". He also wrote that \"even if someone were to prove to me that the truth lay outside Christ, I should choose to remain with Christ rather than with the truth\".\nFrom an analysis of religious ideas in \"Crime and Punishment\", \"The Idiot\", \"The Demons\" (\"The Possessed\"), and \"The Brothers Karamazov\", James Townsend thinks Dostoyevsky held orthodox Christian beliefs except for his view of salvation from sin. According to Townsend, \"Dostoevsky almost seemed to embrace an in-this-life purgatory\", in which people suffer to pay for their sins, rather than the Christian doctrine of salvation through Christ. Malcolm Jones sees elements of Islam and Buddhism in Dostoyevsky's religious convictions. Colin Wilson in \"The Outsider\" describes him as a \"tormented half-atheist-half-Christian\".\nHis work.\nMany scholars see Dostoyevsky as one of the greatest psychologists in literature. His works have had a big effect on twentieth-century fiction. Very often, he wrote about characters who live in poor conditions. Those characters are sometimes in extreme states of mind. They might show both a strange grasp of human psychology as well as good analyses of the political, social and spiritual states of Russia of Dostoevsky's time. Many of his best-known works are prophetic. He is sometimes considered to be a founder of existentialism, most frequently for \"Notes from Underground\", which has been described as \"the best overture for existentialism ever written\". He is also famous for writing \"The Brothers Karamazov\", which many critics, such as Sigmund Freud, have said was one of the best novels ever written.\n\"Demons\".\nHis attack on nihilism is in his great novel \"Demons\", or \"The Possessed\". Published in 1872, it is a \"dark comedy, cruelly funny in its depiction of high-minded intellectuals toying with revolutionary notions without understanding anything of what revolution means in practice\".\nThe plot is a version of actual events at the time. A former teacher of divinity turned terrorist, Sergei Nechaev, had written a pamphlet, \"The Catechism of a Revolutionary\", which argued that any means (including blackmail and murder) could be used to advance the cause of revolution. Nechaev planned to kill a student who questioned his ideas.\nOne of the characters in \"Demons\" confesses: \"I got entangled in my own data, and my conclusion contradicts the original idea from which I start. From unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism\". This suggests that the result of abandoning morality for the sake of an idea will be tyranny more extreme than any in the past.\nList of works.\nEnglish versions of titles come after the Russian title.\nNovellas and short stories.\nThe last five stories (1873-1877) are included in \"A Writer's Diary\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":75},{"uri":"Novelist","surface_form":"novelist","offset":83},{"uri":"St_Petersburg","surface_form":"St Petersburg","offset":160},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":189},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"socialist","offset":196},{"uri":"Secret_agent","surface_form":"agent","offset":222},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"tried","offset":405},{"uri":"Subversion","surface_form":"subversive","offset":461},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":472},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"condemned to death","offset":487},{"uri":"Firing_squad","surface_form":"firing squad","offset":509},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":567},{"uri":"Hard_labour","surface_form":"hard labour","offset":577},{"uri":"Mock","surface_form":"mock","offset":638},{"uri":"Tsar","surface_form":"tsar","offset":668},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":704},{"uri":"Christ","surface_form":"Christ","offset":1000},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":1019},{"uri":"Crime_and_Punishment","surface_form":"Crime and Punishment","offset":1464},{"uri":"The_Idiot","surface_form":"The Idiot","offset":1488},{"uri":"The_Demons","surface_form":"The Demons","offset":1501},{"uri":"The_Possessed","surface_form":"The Possessed","offset":1515},{"uri":"The_Brothers_Karamazov","surface_form":"The Brothers Karamazov","offset":1537},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"orthodox","offset":1601},{"uri":"Salvation","surface_form":"salvation","offset":1651},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":1666},{"uri":"Purgatory","surface_form":"purgatory","offset":1747},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":1910},{"uri":"Colin_Wilson","surface_form":"Colin Wilson","offset":1959},{"uri":"The_Outsider","surface_form":"The Outsider","offset":1976},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":2130},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"twentieth-century","offset":2177},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":2195},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":2375},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analyses","offset":2402},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":2418},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":2429},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":2440},{"uri":"Prophecy","surface_form":"prophetic","offset":2522},{"uri":"Existentialism","surface_form":"existentialism","offset":2579},{"uri":"Notes_from_Underground","surface_form":"Notes from Underground","offset":2616},{"uri":"The_Brothers_Karamazov","surface_form":"The Brothers Karamazov","offset":2753},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":2806},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":2990},{"uri":"Divinity","surface_form":"divinity","offset":3234},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":3250},{"uri":"Sergei_Nechaev","surface_form":"Sergei Nechaev","offset":3261},{"uri":"Blackmail","surface_form":"blackmail","offset":3376},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":3436},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"kill","offset":3467},{"uri":"Despotism","surface_form":"despotism","offset":3704},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"morality","offset":3760},{"uri":"Tyranny","surface_form":"tyranny","offset":3801},{"uri":"A_Writer%27s_Diary","surface_form":"A Writer's Diary","offset":3995}]}
