{"id":3257,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture","text":"e=\"preserve\">In chemistry, a mixture is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substance<nowiki/>s. These substances can be chemical elements or compounds. A mixture can be made of liquids, solids, or gases.\nA mixture is not the same as a compound which is made of two or more atoms connected together. For instance, a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.\nA mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called \"heterogenous\", one where this is not the case is called \"homogeneous\". A third form is called colloid.\nIf one substance in a mixture dissolves in the other, it is called a solution. For example, if sugar is put in water it forms a mixture, then dissolves to make a solution. If it does not dissolve, it would be called a suspension.\nSolids can be mixtures also. Alloy<nowiki/>s are mixtures. Many kinds of soil and rock are mixtures of different minerals. Thus, a mixture is made of two or more elements and/or compounds which are not chemically combined.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":16},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":91},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":136},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compounds","offset":157},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":193},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":202},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":213},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compound","offset":251},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":289},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":352},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":365},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":423},{"uri":"Colloid","surface_form":"colloid","offset":646},{"uri":"Dissolution","surface_form":"dissolves","offset":685},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":724},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":750},{"uri":"Suspension_(chemistry)","surface_form":"suspension","offset":873},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"Alloy","offset":914},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":958},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"rock","offset":967},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":998}]}
