{"id":325753,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daini_Nuclear_Power_Plant","text":"The is a nuclear power plant in the towns of Naraha and Tomioka in the Futaba District of Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) runs the plant. There are four nuclear reactors at the plant. All four of them automatically shut down after the 2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The plant is sometimes called \"Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant\" because \"Daini\" means \"Number 2\" in Japanese.\nThe plant uses Boiling Water Reactors. Toshiba built reactors 1 and 3. Hitachi built reactors 2 and 4.\nAll reactors at the plant reached cold shutdown by March 15, 2011. In June 2011, 7,000 tons of seawater from the tsunami were still in the plant. TEPCO planned to put it all back into the ocean. But, about 3,000 tons of the water had radioactive chemicals in it. Japan's Fisheries Agency did not let TEPCO release the water back into the ocean. Japan's Prime Minister said the nuclear emergency at the Fukushima Daini plant was over on December 26, 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nuclear_power_plant","surface_form":"nuclear power plant","offset":9},{"uri":"Naraha%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"Naraha","offset":45},{"uri":"Tomioka%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"Tomioka","offset":56},{"uri":"Futaba_District%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"Futaba District","offset":71},{"uri":"Fukushima_Prefecture","surface_form":"Fukushima Prefecture","offset":90},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":112},{"uri":"Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company","surface_form":"Tokyo Electric Power Company","offset":123},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactor","surface_form":"nuclear reactor","offset":191},{"uri":"Scram","surface_form":"automatically shut down","offset":239},{"uri":"2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami","surface_form":"2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami","offset":273},{"uri":"Toshiba","surface_form":"Toshiba","offset":459},{"uri":"Hitachi","surface_form":"Hitachi","offset":491},{"uri":"Cold_shutdown","surface_form":"cold shutdown","offset":557}]}
