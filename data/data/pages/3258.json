{"id":3258,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family","text":"Language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older language. The languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure.\nFor example, French and Spanish both come from Latin. Latin was spoken a long time ago, and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way, saying, for example, for good: \"bueno\" while another group started saying \"bon.\" Most words are said a little differently in Spanish and French, so the two are called different languages.\nMost languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called Language isolates.\nThere also are constructed languages, like for example Esperanto. Constructed languages are made for different reasons: making a 'world language', for fun, for use in fiction, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":111},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":211},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":222},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":245},{"uri":"Language_isolate","surface_form":"Language isolate","offset":634},{"uri":"Constructed_language","surface_form":"constructed language","offset":668},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":708}]}
