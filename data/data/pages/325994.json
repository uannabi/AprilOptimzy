{"id":325994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_(gay_slang)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bear is a gay slang term. It describes a hairy, heavy-setgay or bisexual man. A bear typically projects an image of rugged masculinity. Some bears present a very masculine, over-the-top image of a ruggedly masculine man. These men may disdain or even shun hanging out with men who exhibit any trace of effeminacy (womanliness). Bears often form clubs modeled on biker clubs. Clubs are formed for bears to hang out with their own kind. These clubs may have bylaws, membership requirements, and charities the clubs support. They may host bear-related events such as \"Mr. Bear\" male beauty contests.\nA younger (or younger looking) version of a bear is called a cub. A cub can be hairy or not. He typically has (but not always) a smaller frame. The term is sometimes used to imply the passive partner in a relationship. An \"otter\" is a slimmer or less hairy bear regardless of age.\nBears have scrapped within their communities from time to time. Discrimination has increased. Some bears and \"muscle bears\" do not welcome higher-bodyfat men at their events. Some bears do not want to associate with men who do not fit their notion of what a \"real bear\" should be. Fat (or lack of it) has become an issue. Some men regard their overweight condition as a form of self-acceptance. There is a lack of racial diversity in the bear community. Hairiness is regarded as a standard of physical attractiveness that genetically favors white men aesthetically, socially, and sexually.\nAlthough typically excluded from the mainstream gay media, there are several publications that exist for the bear community. Although most are more beefcake and porn-focused, there are some, such as \"Bear World Magazine\", which focus on the bear lifestyle, covering a range of topics and celebrating the bear community as a whole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":27},{"uri":"Overweight","surface_form":"heavy-set","offset":61},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"gay","offset":70},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":77},{"uri":"Masculinity","surface_form":"masculinity","offset":136},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"biker","offset":375},{"uri":"By-law","surface_form":"bylaws","offset":469},{"uri":"Beauty_contest","surface_form":"beauty contest","offset":593},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"Discrimination","offset":955},{"uri":"Physical_attractiveness","surface_form":"physical attractiveness","offset":1384},{"uri":"Phenotype","surface_form":"genetically","offset":1413},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white","offset":1432},{"uri":"Body_image","surface_form":"aesthetically","offset":1442},{"uri":"Sexual_attraction","surface_form":"sexually","offset":1471}]}
