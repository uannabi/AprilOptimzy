He was known for being able to throw baseballs with great speed, and he was nicknamed \"The Big Train\". He set many baseball records and has the second-most wins of all-time. Many people think he is the greatest pitcher of all-time.\nEarly life.\nWalter Johnson was born on November 6, 1887 on a farm near Humboldt, Kansas. His parents were Frank and Minnie Johnson, and he had five siblings. When Johnson was 14, his family moved to Orange County, California. Later, he moved to Idaho, where he played baseball for a small team from Idaho and worked for a phone company. When someone from the Washington Senators saw him pitch, they signed him to a contract in 1907.\nBaseball career.\nWalter Johnson was known for being a \"power pitcher,\" meaning he could throw the ball very hard and fast. His fastball was the main reason he was able to accomplish so much, like having the most 3,509 career strikeouts and the most shutouts of all-time. He also won the American League Most Valuable Player award twice, in 1913 and 1924.\nAfter baseball.\nAfter he retired from playing in 1927, Johnson was one of the first five players elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.
