{"id":326172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_dryer","text":"A hair dryer (also called a blow dryer) is a device which blows cool or hot air. Hair dryers are usually used to speed up drying wet hair.\nThe main parts of a hair dryer are a motor-powered fan and an electrically heated element. The element heats up when an electric current flows through it. When air from the fan goes through the barrel of the hair dryer, it is heated by the element. The hot air passes out of the end of the hair dryer (the nozzle). The user can direct the nozzle towards their hair.\nAlexandre Godefoy created the first model of the hair dryer in France in 1890.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":76},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"wet","offset":129},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":133},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"motor-powered","offset":176},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":190},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":259},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":568}]}
