It was on a city block bound by Avalon Boulevard, 42nd Place, San Pedro Street, and 41st Street. It opened in the last part of the 1925 baseball season and closed for baseball after the 1961 season.\nIt was used for other events from time to time. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a civil rights rally there on May 26, 1963. It was used as a set for several movies and TV shows. It was used for boxing matches a few times.
