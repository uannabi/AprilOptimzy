Newsome retired as a player after the 1990 season Cleveland, but joined the Browns front office as an executive that same year. In 1996, the Browns became the Baltimore Ravens. Newsome quickly rose up the rankings under owner Art Modell. After the 2003 season, Modell, along with several other Ravens front office members, retired. This left many open spots. Newsome became the team's new general manager under new owner Steve Biscotti.\nThroughout his career in the NFL, Ozzie Newsome has been known as one of the best tight ends and front office men in the history of the league. With Baltimore, Newsome signed Hall of Famers Mike Singletary, Shannon Sharpe, and Rod Woodson.
