It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Baltimore Orioles. It opened in 1992, replacing the Orioles' long-time home Memorial Stadium.\nThe ballpark was built on the site of a railroad area called Camden Yards. The long brick building outside the right field area was part of that rail yard. The birthplace of Babe Ruth is also nearby. It is a museum which is a couple of blocks west of the ballpark.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":33},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"park","offset":42},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore, Maryland","offset":50},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":99},{"uri":"Baltimore_Orioles","surface_form":"Baltimore Orioles","offset":137},{"uri":"Memorial_Stadium_(Baltimore)","surface_form":"Memorial Stadium","offset":213},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":271},{"uri":"Babe_Ruth","surface_form":"Babe Ruth","offset":405}]}
