{"id":326536,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Me_All_Your_Luvin%27","text":"\"Give Me All Your Luvin\" is a song by Madonna featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. The song was released in February 2012. It was released by Interscope. It was musically influenced by the 1982 Toni Basil song \"Mickey\" and the 2005 Gwen Stefani song \"Hollaback Girl\".\nThe song reached number one in Canada, the top ten in the US, and the top 40 in the UK. The artists performed the song at Super Bowl XLVI. M.I.A. flipped the middle finger, which was not caught in time by the censors.\nBackground and writing.\nIn December 2010, Madonna posted a message on her Facebook, exclaiming: \"Its official! I need to move. I need to sweat. I need to make new music! Music I can dance to. I'm on the lookout for the maddest, sickest, most badass people to collaborate with. I'm just saying\".\n\"Give Me All Your Luvin\" was written by Madonna, Martin Solveig, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A., and Michael Tordjman, while production was helmed by Madonna and Solveig.\nRelease and leaks.\nOn November 8, 2011, a demo version of the song, named \"Give Me All Your Love\", was leaked. According to Keith Caulfield from \"Billboard\", \"Within a few hours, [the song and its leak] was among one of the top 10 trending topics worldwide on Twitter.\" Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, addressed the leak on Twitter adding the singer's statement on the situation: \"My true fans wouldn't do this\". Oseary also clarified that their initial plan was for new music to come out in 2012 itself. He was happy with the positive reaction to the demo, but asked fans to help him police any more leaks. The leaked demo lacked vocals from both Minaj and M.I.A. which Madonna reflected upon, \"It's really disappointing because you don't want things to come out till you're done with them, till you're ready. It's like everybody looking at your unfinished painting. It's like, 'Wait a minute. I didn't finish that. That's not fair.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits and personnel adapted from \"MDNA\" album liner notes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Madonna_(entertainer)","surface_form":"Madonna","offset":38},{"uri":"Rappers","surface_form":"rappers","offset":56},{"uri":"Nicki_Minaj","surface_form":"Nicki Minaj","offset":64},{"uri":"M.I.A.","surface_form":"M.I.A.","offset":80},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":564},{"uri":"Martin_Solveig","surface_form":"Martin Solveig","offset":834},{"uri":"Nicki_Minaj","surface_form":"Nicki Minaj","offset":850},{"uri":"M.I.A._(rapper)","surface_form":"M.I.A.","offset":863},{"uri":"Demo_(music)","surface_form":"demo","offset":987},{"uri":"Internet_leak","surface_form":"leaked","offset":1048},{"uri":"Guy_Oseary","surface_form":"Guy Oseary","offset":1234}]}
