{"id":326563,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching","text":"Poaching is the illegal hunting, killing or capturing of animals. People poach because animal products, such as hide, ivory, horn, teeth and bone, are sold to dealers who make clothes, jewelry and other materials from them. The poaching causes various effects, its most direct impact is\u00A0extinction, either globally or within a given locality.\nPoachers catch Indian tigers with steel traps. This is against the law. After trapping a tiger, they kill it and sell the body parts for money. Like the rhino, the tiger is a very endangered species. If the killing does not end, they both face extinction (all of that type of animal dies). Extinction means that someday there may be no Indian tigers or rhinos left on earth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":16},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":24},{"uri":"Hide","surface_form":"hide","offset":112},{"uri":"Ivory","surface_form":"ivory","offset":118},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":141},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":287},{"uri":"Locality","surface_form":"locality","offset":333},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":365},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":377},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":410},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":465},{"uri":"Rhino","surface_form":"rhino","offset":496},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":711}]}
