Over time, it spread to the island of Honsh\u016B.\nIron and bronze were first used in Japan at about the same time. Iron was used for tools and weapons. Bronze was used for ritual objects such as mirrors, daggers and spears.\nThe Yayoi tools included as axes and hoes for agriculture etc., but also weapons such as arrowheads and swords.\nYayoi people.\nThe Yayoi people (\u5F25\u751F\u4EBA \"Yayoi jin\") were ancient people that migrated to the Japanese archipelago from southeastern China during the Yayoi period (300 BCE\u2013300 CE). Modern Japanese people are direct descedants of the Yayoi and have about 97% Yayoi DNA.\nThe Yayoi and the modern Japanese people are closely related to other East Asian (or Mongoloid) people, such as Chinese or Vietnamese people. They belonged to the haplogroup O and spoke the proto-Japonic languages. Most scientists and linguists suggest that they originated somewhere in southeastern China and migrated from their into Japan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"History_of_Japan","surface_form":"history of Japan","offset":21},{"uri":"Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"Ky\u016Bsh\u016B","offset":152},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"Iron","offset":206},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":215},{"uri":"Axe","surface_form":"axe","offset":408},{"uri":"Hoe","surface_form":"hoe","offset":417},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":426},{"uri":"Arrowhead","surface_form":"arrowhead","offset":469},{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":484},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"southeastern China","offset":608},{"uri":"Japanese_people","surface_form":"Japanese people","offset":676},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":827},{"uri":"Mongoloid_(race)","surface_form":"Mongoloid","offset":842},{"uri":"Chinese_people","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":869},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnamese people","offset":880},{"uri":"Japonic_languages","surface_form":"proto-Japonic languages","offset":947}]}
