{"id":327115,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous_treepie","text":"The rufous treepie (\"Dendrocitta vagabunda\") is a species of bird in the Corvidae (crow) family. The rufous treepie is native to the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining parts of Southeast Asia from Pakistan to Vietnam. Woodland, forest edges and gardens are the habitat of this species. It feeds on various fruits, insects and carrion.\nDistribution and subspecies.\nThe rufous treepie builds its nest 6\u22128 meters above the ground in trees. Both male and female take turns breeding and feeding the young. There are usually 3-5 eggs laid. After the young have hatched, the remain with their parents for several months. Rufous treepies form pair bonds for life.\nThe species was first described in 1790 by John Latham. A previous description as \"Dendrocitta rufa\" is not valid. It belongs to the Treepie genus \"Dendrocitta\" which is Southeast Asian in distribution. According to ornithologist Derek Goodwin, the rufous treepie may be closely allied to the hooded treepie (\"D. frontalis\"). There are eight recognized subspecies.\nThere are no estimates for the population of this species. It is common throughout its range, but rare in Vietnam.\nDescription.\nThe Rufous Treepie is shorter and smaller than the European magpie. The head, neck and breast are grey, although sometimes they are slightly brown. The underparts and lower back are orange-brown. The tail is a light blue color with a black tip. The bill, legs and feet are black.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":50},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":61},{"uri":"Corvidae","surface_form":"Corvidae","offset":73},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"crow","offset":83},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":89},{"uri":"Indian_Subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian Subcontinent","offset":133},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":176},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":196},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":208},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":260},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":305},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":313},{"uri":"Carrion","surface_form":"carrion","offset":325},{"uri":"John_Latham_(ornithologist)","surface_form":"John Latham","offset":698},{"uri":"Treepie","surface_form":"Treepie","offset":788},{"uri":"Dendrocitta","surface_form":"Dendrocitta","offset":803},{"uri":"Ornithologist","surface_form":"ornithologist","offset":871},{"uri":"Derek_Goodwin","surface_form":"Derek Goodwin","offset":885},{"uri":"Hooded_treepie","surface_form":"hooded treepie","offset":948},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":1126},{"uri":"European_magpie","surface_form":"European magpie","offset":1199},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":1289}]}
