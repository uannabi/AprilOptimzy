Hopsin was angry at the owner Tomica Wright and claimed that she didn't know what she was doing. He stated that his first studio album Gazing at the Moonlight was released without his consent and that he wasn't even able to listen to the mastered version before it was released. He left the label when Tomica said \"He doesn't do his job as an artist\". Hopsin would found an independent label called Funk Volume with business partner Dame Ritter. He also acted as a minor character in an episode of That's So Raven, made a guest appearance in the movie Fame and starred in the independent movie, Bomb The World.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":43},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":56},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":109},{"uri":"Ruthless_Records","surface_form":"Ruthless Records","offset":197},{"uri":"Gazing_at_the_Moonlight","surface_form":"Gazing at the Moonlight","offset":415},{"uri":"That%27s_So_Raven","surface_form":"That's So Raven","offset":778},{"uri":"Fame_(2009_film)","surface_form":"Fame","offset":832}]}
