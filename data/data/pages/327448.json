{"id":327448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learner%27s_permit","text":"A learner's permit can also be called a driver's permit, learner's license, or provisional license. It is given to those who are learning to drive a car but do not meet the requirements for a driver's license. Many countries require drivers to have a learner's permit for some time before they can be given a driver's license.\nGetting a learner's permit usually means a person has to take a written test about the rules of the road, such as traffic signs and road safety. There is also a minimum age. Depending on the area, the minimum age can range from 14 to 19 years.\nFor example, in Victoria, Australia, a person must be 16 years old and pass a written road rules test to get a Learner's permit. The written test consists of 32 questions on road rules; and 25 must be answered correctly. The person must also pass an eyesight test. There are restrictions on what a person with a Victorian learner's permit can do. They must have a sign with the letter \"L\" (called an L plate) on both the front and back of the car. They must have a fully licenced driver with them at all times. They are not allowed to drive if they have drunk any alcohol. They are not allowed to tow anything behind the car. They must have the learner's permit for 12 months, and completed 120 hours before they allowed to be tested for a full licence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":149},{"uri":"Driver%27s_license","surface_form":"driver's license","offset":192},{"uri":"Traffic_sign","surface_form":"traffic sign","offset":441},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":587},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":597},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":1135}]}
