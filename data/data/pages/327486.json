{"id":327486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_F4U_Corsair","text":"The Vought F4U Corsair was a fighter aircraft that fought in World War II and the Korean War. Vought could not keep up with demand for the aircraft, so Goodyear and Brewster made them. It was deployed in large numbers starting in 1944, and has longest production run of any piston-engined fighter in U.S. history (1942\u20131953).\nThe Corsair was used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Fleet Air Arm and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, as well as the French Navy \"A\u00E9ronavale\" and other, smaller, air forces. Some Japanese pilots said it was the best American fighter of World War II, and the U.S. Navy reported an 11:1 kill ratio. Besides serving as a fighter, it became the most capable carrier-based fighter-bomber of World War II.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":29},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":61},{"uri":"Korean_War","surface_form":"Korean War","offset":82},{"uri":"Fleet_Air_Arm","surface_form":"Fleet Air Arm","offset":379},{"uri":"Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal New Zealand Air Force","offset":401},{"uri":"French_Navy","surface_form":"French Navy","offset":445},{"uri":"Aviation_navale","surface_form":"\"A\u00E9ronavale\"","offset":457}]}
