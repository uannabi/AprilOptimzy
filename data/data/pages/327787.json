{"id":327787,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragstrip","text":"e=\"preserve\">A dragstrip is a facility for conducting automobile and motorcycle acceleration events such as drag racing. Although a quarter mile (402 m) is the best known measure for a drag track, many tracks are eighth mile (201 m) tracks. The race is begun from a standing start. Three factors decide the outcome of the race: reaction time, torque, and traction.\nFeatures.\nA dragstrip is a straight racetrack, usually an eighth or a quarter of a mile long (660/1320 feet, 201/402 metres), followed by a \"shutdown area\" to allow automobiles room to stop after crossing the finish line. Common features also include a 'water box' where cars and motorcycles start their burn-outs to clean and heat up their tires to improve traction. There is a set of lights known as a 'Christmas Tree' that counts down to the start. There are also return lanes for the vehicles to return from the end of the track to the pit area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":54},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":69},{"uri":"Drag_Racing","surface_form":"drag racing","offset":108},{"uri":"Standing_start","surface_form":"standing start","offset":266},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":343},{"uri":"Racetrack","surface_form":"racetrack","offset":401},{"uri":"Burnout","surface_form":"burn-outs","offset":669},{"uri":"Tires","surface_form":"tires","offset":706},{"uri":"Christmas_tree_(racing)","surface_form":"Christmas Tree","offset":770}]}
