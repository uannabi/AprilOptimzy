{"id":327820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year_starting_on_Saturday","text":"e=\"preserve\">This is the calendar for any common year starting on Saturday, January 1 (dominical letter B). Examples include 1977, 1983, 1994, 2005, 2011 and 2022 in the Gregorian calendar,\nor Julian years 2017 and 2023 (see bottom tables). The question mark for the ISO week before week 1 is due to ambiguity based on whether or not the previous year was a leap year. If it was, then that week is week 53, if it was a common year then it is week 52.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":25},{"uri":"Common_year","surface_form":"common year","offset":42},{"uri":"Saturday","surface_form":"Saturday","offset":66},{"uri":"Dominical_letter","surface_form":"dominical letter","offset":87},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":125},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":131},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":137},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":143},{"uri":"2011","surface_form":"2011","offset":149},{"uri":"2022","surface_form":"2022","offset":158},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":170},{"uri":"Julian_calendar","surface_form":"Julian","offset":193},{"uri":"2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":206},{"uri":"2023","surface_form":"2023","offset":215},{"uri":"ISO_week","surface_form":"ISO week","offset":267}]}
