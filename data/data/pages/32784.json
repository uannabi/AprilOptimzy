There, they met the other member of the band, Richard Hughes.\nTim made the band in 1995 with his friend Dominic Scott. They named the band \"The Lotus Eaters\". They changed their name to \"Cherry Keane\" in 1997, when Chaplin entered the band. Cherry Keane was a woman who served tea at Tim and Tom's school. The name changed again to \"Keane\". In an interview on 2006, Rice-Oxley said that the band was called Coldplay, but he gave this name to a friend (Chris Martin, of Coldplay).\nKeane began playing songs by other artists, but soon they wanted to play their own songs.\nTheir first live performance (gig) was in 1998, at the \"Hope & Anchor\" pub (bar) in England.\nThey made 2 CDs and sold at the pubs where they played. Scott left the band in 2001. Tim wrote \"Everybody's Changing\" for this.\nIn December 2002, Simon Williams of Fierce Panda went to a Keane gig in and he offered to make the band's next and first commercial single (song), \"Everybody's Changing\".\nThe single was released on 2003.\nHopes and Fears (2003 - 2006).\nAfter another single, in 2004, Island Records invited Keane to make a single with them. \"Everybody's Changing\" was made after \"Somewhere Only We Know\". An album was released in May and called \"Hopes And Fears\". The album was very successful and it was the second best-seller album of the year.\nThe album sold five million (5,000,000) copies.
