The modern term \"bombardment\" comes from this.\nBombards were usually used during sieges to hurl various things into enemy forts. Items such as stone or metal balls, burning materials and weighted cloth soaked in quicklime or Greek fire are have been written about.\nThe name comes from medieval Latin and French words from an earlier Greek word meaning the making of a humming noise.\nFamous examples.\nA famous example of a bombard is Mons Meg, a large weapon built around 1449 and used by King James II of Scotland.
