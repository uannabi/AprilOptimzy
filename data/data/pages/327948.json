{"id":327948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_gun","text":"A railway gun, also called a railroad gun, is a large artillery weapon, built on, transported by, and fired from a specially designed railway wagon. Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known were made by Krupp and used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train.\nRailway guns are no longer used. Their large size and limited movement made them easy targets. They have been replaced by aircraft, rockets, and missiles.\nHistory.\nThe idea of railway guns was first suggested in the 1860s by a Mr Anderson. He published a pamphlet in the United Kingdom titled \"National Defence\" in which he proposed a plan of ironclad railway carriages. A Russian, Lebedew, claimed to have first invented the idea in 1860 when he is reported to have mounted a mortar on a railway car.\nThe first railway gun used in battle was a banded 32-pounder Brooke naval rifle. In the American Civil War it was mounted on a flat rail car and protected with sheets of iron. On 29 June 1862, Robert E. Lee had the gun pushed by a locomotive over the Richmond and York River line (later part of the Southern Railway) and used at the Battle of Savage's Station. There is also a photo of a Union 13-inch siege mortar mounted on a rail car during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. It was nicknamed the \"Dictator\" or the \"Petersburg Express\".\nRailway guns were used by France during the Siege of Paris in 1870, and by the British during the Siege of Ladysmith during the Second Boer War.\nWorld War I.\nGermany already had a few Big Bertha guns at the start of the First World War but the French had a shortage of heavy field artillery. Large coastal defense guns and naval guns were moved to the front. These were usually unsuitable for field use and needed some kind of mounting. The railway gun was an obvious solution. By 1916, both sides were using railway guns.\nBaldwin Locomotive Works made five 50 caliber railway guns on trains for the United States Navy during April and May 1918. Each train carried a Mk 4 50 caliber gun. These were a naval rifle used on New Mexico and Tennessee class battleships, mounted on a rail carriage with four 6-wheel bogies. One of these guns is on display outside the museum at the Washington Navy Yard.\nWorld War II.\nThe Second World War saw the final use of railway guns. The Germans used the massive Schwerer Gustav gun, the largest artillery piece to be used in battle. The rise of the aeroplane effectively ended the use of the railway guns. Like battleships, they were big, expensive, and easily destroyed from the air.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":54},{"uri":"Krupp","surface_form":"Krupp","offset":221},{"uri":"German_Reich","surface_form":"Germany","offset":239},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":250},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":266},{"uri":"Armoured_train","surface_form":"armoured train","offset":315},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":463},{"uri":"Missile","surface_form":"missile","offset":476},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":602},{"uri":"Mortar_(weapon)","surface_form":"mortar","offset":808},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":921},{"uri":"Robert_E._Lee","surface_form":"Robert E.
