{"id":327962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_cannon","text":"e=\"preserve\">In science fiction, an ion cannon is a beam weapon. It shoots beams of ions (atoms or molecules with an electricalcharge). Because of its power, it is usually said to be a superweapon. An ion cannon is a type of particle cannon. The particles it shoots are ionized. Because of their electrical charges, they can cause electronic devices, vehicles, and anything else that has an electrical or similar powersource to stop working. Ion cannons are used in many science-fiction movies and television series. Ion cannons are also used in many video games.\nReal-world connections.\nThe science fiction idea for these weapons comes from the particle cannon created by Nikola Tesla. Tesla's cannon shot ions into the ionosphere. This caused them to be charged more. Research of this idea is still being done with directed-energy weapons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":16},{"uri":"Directed-energy_weapon","surface_form":"beam weapon","offset":52},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":84},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":90},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":99},{"uri":"Electrical","surface_form":"electrical","offset":117},{"uri":"Superweapon","surface_form":"superweapon","offset":185},{"uri":"Cannon","surface_form":"cannon","offset":205},{"uri":"Particle_cannon","surface_form":"particle cannon","offset":225},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":246},{"uri":"Electronic","surface_form":"electronic","offset":331},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":342},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":351},{"uri":"Power","surface_form":"power","offset":413},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":487},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":498},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":551},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":592},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":623},{"uri":"Nikola_Tesla","surface_form":"Nikola Tesla","offset":673},{"uri":"Ionosphere","surface_form":"ionosphere","offset":721},{"uri":"Directed-energy_weapon","surface_form":"directed-energy weapon","offset":817}]}
