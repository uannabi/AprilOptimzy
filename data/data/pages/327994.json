{"id":327994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubochinski%27s_pendulum","text":"Doubochinski's pendulum is an experiment with an oscillator and a magnet. The most simple case is that of a pendulum that interacts with an oscillator. The pendulum (with a magnet at the end) will swing at a frequency of one swing per period of 1-2 seconds. A stationary electromagnet is placed under the equilibrium point of the pendulum. The electromagnet is then supplied with an alternating current of a fixed frequency, of between 10 and 10.000 Hz.\nWhen the pendulum is released at any location, its movement will then evolve to stop at a height which depends on the frequency of the current of the electromagnet. This phenomenon was first discovered by the brothers Danil and Yakov Doubochinski in 1968\u201369.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oscillator","surface_form":"oscillator","offset":49},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":66},{"uri":"Pendulum","surface_form":"pendulum","offset":108},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":208},{"uri":"Electromagnet","surface_form":"electromagnet","offset":271},{"uri":"Alternating_current","surface_form":"alternating current","offset":383},{"uri":"Hertz","surface_form":"Hz","offset":450}]}
