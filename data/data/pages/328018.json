{"id":328018,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dominion of Newfoundland was a British Dominion from 1907 to 1949. It was in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast. It was made up of the island of Newfoundland and Labrador on the mainland.\nThe territory was a British colony until 1907, when it was made a dominion. The Statute of Westminster of 11 December 1931 said that the Dominion of Newfoundland was independent within the British Commonwealth, along with Canada, Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. But on 16 February 1934 the Newfoundland parliament gave up its self-government, and governance of the dominion went back to being controlled from London. Though governed from overseas, Newfoundland stayed legally a dominion, until it joined Canada in 1949 to become Canada's tenth province.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Dominions","surface_form":"British Dominion","offset":48},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":107},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":131},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"island of Newfoundland","offset":169},{"uri":"Labrador%2C_Canada","surface_form":"Labrador","offset":196},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":242},{"uri":"Statute_of_Westminster_1931","surface_form":"Statute of Westminster","offset":302},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":388},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"British Commonwealth","offset":411},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":444},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":452},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":461},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":475},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":489},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":744},{"uri":"Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","surface_form":"Canada's tenth province","offset":769}]}
