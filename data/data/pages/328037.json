Odd.\" The single peaked at number fourteen on the U.S. Billboard Alternative Songs chart in July of 2011.\nThe song was chosen as the opening act for the band's headlining Vices & Virtues U.S. Tour in 2011 duo to its rev-up sound and pop elements.\nMusic video.\nThe single's music video premiered on YouTube and VEVO on May 2, 2011 on the official Fueled By Ramen YouTube channel. As of February 1, 2012 the video itself, on YouTube, has a round-up tally of 6,000,000 views.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Single"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vices_%26amp%3B_Virtues","surface_form":"Vices & Virtues","offset":98},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":118},{"uri":"Panic%21_at_the_Disco","surface_form":"Panic! at the Disco","offset":141},{"uri":"The_Ballad_of_Mona_Lisa","surface_form":"The Ballad of Mona Lisa","offset":232},{"uri":"Panic%21_at_the_Disco","surface_form":"Brendon Urie","offset":388},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":582},{"uri":"A_Fever_You_Can%27t_Sweat_Out","surface_form":"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out","offset":661},{"uri":"Pretty._Odd.","surface_form":"Pretty.
