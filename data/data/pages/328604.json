She is the most important female painter of the 18th century. Her style is considered Rococo with an interest in Neoclassicism.

She was accepted as a member of the Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1783. She left France after the arrest of the royal family during the French Revolution. She lived and worked in Italy, Austria, and Russia. Her work met great critical acclaim in Rome. She was elected to the Roman Accademia di San Luca. In Russia, she painted many aristocrats including Catherine the Great's family. She was made a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Saint Petersburg.\nVig\u00E9e Le Brun returned to France during the reign of Emperor Napoleon I. Her relationship with the new regime was not completely harmonious. After all, she was a royalist and the former portraitist of Marie Antoinette.

In 1807 she traveled to Switzerland where she was made an honorary member of the Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 pour l'Avancement des Beaux-Arts of Geneva. She published her memoirs in 1835 and 1837.
