The boy in the picture might be Jonathan Buttall, the son of a hardware merchant. The boy wears a 17th-century suit. The painting is large. It measures 48 inches (1,200 mm) wide by 70 inches (1,800 mm) tall.\nThe painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until 1796. It was then sold many times. In 1921 it was sold to an art dealer. An American bought the painting from the dealer. The sale caused a furor in England. The British were losing a national treasure. The portrait is now in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California. \"Pinkie\" is a famous painting which hangs near it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oil_painting","surface_form":"oil painting","offset":21},{"uri":"Thomas_Gainsborough","surface_form":"Thomas Gainsborough","offset":37},{"uri":"Household_hardware","surface_form":"hardware","offset":148},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":157},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":490},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":503},{"uri":"Huntington_Library","surface_form":"Huntington Library","offset":571},{"uri":"San_Marino%2C_California","surface_form":"San Marino, California","offset":591},{"uri":"Pinkie","surface_form":"Pinkie","offset":616}]}
