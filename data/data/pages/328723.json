It was written and directed by Ed Wood It stars Gregory Walcott, Mona McKinnon, Lyle Talbot, Tor Johnson, Maila Nurmi (Vampira), and Criswell. Some footage of Bela Lugosi as the \"Old Man\" was edited into the movie after Lugosi's death.\nThe movie is about aliens who want to stop humans from creating a weapon that will destroy the universe. To do this, the aliens put their \"Plan 9\" in operation. This is a scheme to bring Earth's dead back to life. This plan will get Earth's attention and chaos will follow.\nFor years, the movie was aired on television without much notice. In 1980 authors Michael Medved and Harry Medved called \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" the \"worst movie ever made\". They posthumously awarded their Golden Turkey Award to Wood as the worst director ever.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":38},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":54},{"uri":"Ed_Wood","surface_form":"Ed Wood","offset":92},{"uri":"Lyle_Talbot","surface_form":"Lyle Talbot","offset":141},{"uri":"Tor_Johnson","surface_form":"Tor Johnson","offset":154},{"uri":"Maila_Nurmi_(Vampira)","surface_form":"Maila Nurmi (Vampira)","offset":167},{"uri":"Bela_Lugosi","surface_form":"Bela Lugosi","offset":220},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"aliens","offset":316},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":340},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":363},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":392},{"uri":"Scheme","surface_form":"scheme","offset":468},{"uri":"Chaos","surface_form":"chaos","offset":552},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":605}]}
