In Quebec, the term \"galette\" is usually applied to pastries best described as large cookies.\nGalette is also the name given in most French \"cr\u00EAperies\" to savoury buckwheat flour pancakes. Those made from wheat flour, much smaller in size and mostly served with a sweet filling, are called cr\u00EApes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French cuisine","offset":28},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":95},{"uri":"Epiphany_(holiday)","surface_form":"Epiphany","offset":179},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":192},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastries","offset":241},{"uri":"Cookies","surface_form":"cookies","offset":274},{"uri":"Savoury","surface_form":"savoury","offset":344},{"uri":"Buckwheat","surface_form":"buckwheat","offset":352},{"uri":"Pancake","surface_form":"pancake","offset":368},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":394},{"uri":"Cr%C3%AApe","surface_form":"cr\u00EApe","offset":479}]}
