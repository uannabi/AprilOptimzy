{"id":328841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_clock","text":"The Japanese clock is a device made to tell the time according to Japanese tradition.\nThese clocks were introduced to Japan via Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century.\nIn 1612, the clockmaker of Philip II of Spain created a working timepiece which became a gift for Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nOne of the major features of the Japanese clock is that it has a mechanism for measuring unequal temporal hours. Usual clock tells hours at same intervals, but in the Japanese traditional timekeeping practice, a day had six daytime units from sunrise to sunset and six night units from sunset to sunrise. Then the Japanese clock was designed to adapt to this practice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":48},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":66},{"uri":"Jesuit","surface_form":"Jesuit","offset":128},{"uri":"Philip_II_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip II of Spain","offset":196},{"uri":"Tokugawa_Ieyasu","surface_form":"Tokugawa Ieyasu","offset":267}]}
