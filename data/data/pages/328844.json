{"id":328844,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonaises_Op._40_(Chopin)","text":"The Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 (nicknamed the \"Military\" Polonaise) is a piece of music for solo piano. It was composed by Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin. It was published in 1838, with the Polonaise in C minor, Op. 40, No. 2. Anton Rubinstein wrote that the Polonaise in A major is the symbol of Polish glory, while the Polonaise in C minor is the symbol of Polish tragedy.\nThe polonaise is a Polish dance in 3/4 time. It has a distinctive rhythmic pattern which this polonaise follows unflinchingly. The A major Polonaise is written in an A-B-A form, with the B section being a \"Trio\". The polonaise opens with an A major chord. It continues in a vigorously masculine manner. The tempo indication is Allegro con brio (Fast, with bravura). The trio section begins in D major. The short passage following the first section of the trio is distinguished with trills for both hands on low C-sharps an octave apart. These trills suggest drum rolls.\nCharles Rosen writes, \"Polonaises had been written by many composers before, including Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven; Schubert, in fact, wrote lots of them. But nothing like the violence of Chopin\u2019s military polonaises...
