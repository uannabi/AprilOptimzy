{"id":328851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderszenen","text":"\"Kinderszenen\" (original spelling \"Kinderscenen\", (), Opus\u00A015, is a set of 13 pieces for solo piano by Robert Schumann. It was published in 1838. Schumann was looking back on his childhood when composing these pieces. He had originally written 30 movements for Scenes from Childhood. He chose only 13 for the final set. The unused movements were published years later in \"Bunte Bl\u00E4tter\", Opus\u00A099, and \"Albumbl\u00E4tter\" ().\nSchumann originally titled the work \"Leichte St\u00FCcke\" (). The titles for the individual pieces were only added after the music was complete. Schumann described the titles as \"nothing more than delicate hints for execution and interpretation\". Timothy Taylor has discussed Schumann's choice of titles for this work in the context of the changing situation of music in 19th century culture and economics. In 1974, Eric Sams noted that there is no known complete manuscript of \"Kinderszenen\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opus_number","surface_form":"Opus","offset":54},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":94},{"uri":"Robert_Schumann","surface_form":"Robert Schumann","offset":103},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":127}]}
