{"id":328957,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Cyprus","text":"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Cyprus may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in\u00A0Cyprus\u00A0and civil unions became legal in November 2015.\nIn Cyprus, the socially conservative Eastern Orthodox Church has a significant influence over public opinion when it comes to LGBT-rights. However, ever since Cyprus sought membership in the\u00A0European Union\u00A0it has had to change its human rights legislation, including its laws regarding\u00A0sexual orientation\u00A0and\u00A0gender identity.\nLGBT rights in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\nSame-sex sexual activity is Legal within the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus since the 7th of February in 2014. Previous laws allowed three years prison sentences, according to articles 171 and 173 of its criminal code. Female homosexuality was not criminalised. Arrests for Homosexuality have occurred as recently as 2011.\nThe Laws were a legacy of British colonial rule, left over after the Island gained Independence in the 1960s. While the south decriminalised homosexuality in 1998 in order to accede to the European Union (EU) in 2004, the North's disputed status means it lies outside the EU's jurisdiction. On the 27th of January in 2014, the Assembly of the Republic, the Northern Cypriot Parliament, voted to abolish the criminal code provisions that outlawed Same-sex relations between men and males, becoming the last territory in do so within Europe in order to decriminalise Sexual relations between consenting, Adult men. The Bill was signed into Law, and published in the official gazette on the 7th of February in 2014. It took immediate effect upon publication.\nCalls have been made by non-governmental organisations to legalise Same-sex marriage. In 2012, the Communal Democracy Party proposed a law that would have Legalised Same-sex marriages, but the Legislation was opposed by the then-ruling National Unity Party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":114},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":189},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":435},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":530},{"uri":"Gender_identity","surface_form":"gender identity","offset":553},{"uri":"Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus","surface_form":"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus","offset":667}]}
