{"id":329029,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_start","text":"e=\"preserve\">A standing start is a type of start in auto racing events where cars are standing still when the race begins. In a standing start, cars are completely still when a green signal is given to start the race. This often follows a set of lights that count down to the start of the race. Standing starts are common in many motorsports, including drag racing, most single-seat (Formula One and GP2 Series), Touring Cars (most notably British and World Touring Cars), V8 Supercars, and many types of short-course off-road races. The standing start often occurs following a parade lap.\nThe opposite of a standing start is a rolling start. Standing starts are often deemed safer in Formula sports because of high acceleration speeds, which could cause problems if a rolling start were used. A standing start can cause problems like stalled cars being hit by the driver who starts behind them on the grid. Motorsports using standing starts usually penalize drivers who \"jump the start\", or redlight, by moving before the green light is lit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drag_racing","surface_form":"drag racing","offset":353},{"uri":"Parade_lap","surface_form":"parade lap","offset":578},{"uri":"Rolling_start","surface_form":"rolling start","offset":628},{"uri":"Redlight","surface_form":"redlight","offset":992}]}
