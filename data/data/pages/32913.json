This sage was living in the south near Madurai, during the visit of Lord Ram to the south in search of his wife, abducted by the Lankan King Ravan.\nThe age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).\nLord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":45},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":53},{"uri":"Tamil_language","surface_form":"Tamil language","offset":68}]}
