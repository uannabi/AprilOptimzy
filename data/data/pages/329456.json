He was one of the first to sequence the human genome, and led the team which made the first cell with a synthetic genome (2010).\nVenter founded Celera Genomics, The Institute for Genomic Research and the J. Craig Venter Institute. He now works at his Institute to create synthetic (artificial) biological organisms, and to record genetic diversity in the world's oceans. He was listed on \"Time\" magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. In 2010, the British magazine \"New Statesman\" listed Craig Venter at 14th in the list of \"The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010\".\nVenter himself recognized his own ADHD behavior in his adolescence, and later found ADHD-linked genes in his own DNA.
