{"id":329464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Orgel","text":"Leslie Eleazer Orgel FRS (12 January 1927 \u2013 27 October 2007) was a British chemist.\nBorn in London, Orgel received his B.A. and Ph.D in chemistry at Magdalen College, Oxford University.\nHe was one of the first people to see, in April 1953, Crick and Watson's model of DNA: at the time he worked at Oxford University's Chemistry Department.\nIn 1964 Orgel was appointed Senior Fellow and Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he directed the Chemical Evolution Laboratory. He was also an adjunct professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego, and he was one of five principal investigators in the NASA-sponsored NSCORT program in exobiology. Orgel also participated in NASA's Viking Mars Lander Program as a member of the Molecular Analysis Team that designed the gas chromatography mass spectrometer instrument that robots took to the planet Mars.\nOrgel\u2019s lab came across an economical way to make cytarabine, a compound that is one of today\u2019s most commonly used anti-cancer agents.\nDuring the 1970s, Orgel suggested reconsidering the panspermia hypothesis, according to which the earliest forms of life on earth did not originate here, but arrived from outer space with meteorites.\nTogether with Stanley Miller, Orgel also suggested that peptide nucleic acids \u2013 rather than ribonucleic acids \u2013 constituted the first pre-biotic systems capable of self-replication on early Earth.\nHis name is popularly known because of Orgel's rules, credited to him, particularly Orgel's Second Rule: \"Evolution is cleverer than you are\".\nIn his book \"The Origins of Life\", Orgel coined the concept of specified complexity, to describe the criterion by which living organisms are distinguished from non-living matter. He published over three hundred articles in his research areas.\nOrgel died of cancer on 27 October 2007 at the San Diego Hospice & Palliative Care in San Diego, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":67},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":75},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":92},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D","offset":128},{"uri":"Magdalen_College","surface_form":"Magdalen College","offset":149},{"uri":"Oxford_University","surface_form":"Oxford University","offset":167},{"uri":"Francis_Crick","surface_form":"Crick","offset":240},{"uri":"James_D._Watson","surface_form":"Watson","offset":250},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":268},{"uri":"Salk_Institute","surface_form":"Salk Institute","offset":412},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_San_Diego","surface_form":"University of California, San Diego","offset":592},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":683},{"uri":"Astrobiology","surface_form":"exobiology","offset":716},{"uri":"Viking_program","surface_form":"Viking","offset":762},{"uri":"Gas_chromatography","surface_form":"gas chromatography","offset":850},{"uri":"Mass_spectrometry","surface_form":"mass spectrometer","offset":869},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":929},{"uri":"Cytosine_arabinoside","surface_form":"cytarabine","offset":985},{"uri":"Panspermia","surface_form":"panspermia","offset":1122},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":1241},{"uri":"Meteorite","surface_form":"meteorite","offset":1258},{"uri":"Stanley_Miller","surface_form":"Stanley Miller","offset":1284},{"uri":"Peptide_nucleic_acid","surface_form":"peptide nucleic acid","offset":1326},{"uri":"Ribonucleic_acid","surface_form":"ribonucleic acid","offset":1362},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"biotic","offset":1408},{"uri":"Self-replication","surface_form":"self-replication","offset":1434},{"uri":"Early_Earth","surface_form":"early Earth","offset":1454},{"uri":"Orgel%27s_rule","surface_form":"Orgel's rule","offset":1506},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"Evolution","offset":1573},{"uri":"Specified_complexity","surface_form":"specified complexity","offset":1673},{"uri":"San_Diego","surface_form":"San Diego","offset":1939},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1950}]}
