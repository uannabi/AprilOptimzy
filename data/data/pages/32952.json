Notable operating systems in this family include Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. This Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. Both of the modes used a Graphical User Interface (or picture-based), and supported a mouse, but 386 Enhanced Mode was faster and was better at multitasking (or doing many things at once). Windows NT 3.x was released in 1993-1996.\nIt also had many features from versions of Windows before it. These included a calculator, a notepad, and more. It also brought in many new features, like the Program Manager (which is still in Windows XP today - Start>Run>progman.exe), and the icons and programs looked better.\nWindows 3.x was made better in 1992, with Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (1992-1993), that added networking support.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":28},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":46},{"uri":"Windows_3.0","surface_form":"Windows 3.0","offset":136},{"uri":"Windows_3.1","surface_form":"Windows 3.1","offset":152},{"uri":"Graphical_User_Interface","surface_form":"Graphical User Interface","offset":262},{"uri":"Multitasking","surface_form":"multitasking","offset":381}]}
