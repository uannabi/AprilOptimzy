The plot was adapted from \"One Thousand and One Nights\". The movie is about a thief who falls in love with the daughter of the Caliph of Baghdad. Fairbanks was very athletic. This movie provided many moments for gymnastics. The movie was Fairbanks's favorite among all his movies.\n\"Thief\" gave Fairbanks a new direction. He was a comedy star, but after this movie he became a \"swashbuckler\". The movie had many special effects such as flying carpets and monsters and magical Djinn. The Arabian-style set was huge. The movie was remade twice: once in 1940 with Sabu and then in 1961 with Steve Reeves. The Fairbanks version was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1996.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Silent_movie","surface_form":"silent movie","offset":32},{"uri":"Director_(movie)","surface_form":"directed","offset":53},{"uri":"Raoul_Walsh","surface_form":"Raoul Walsh","offset":65},{"uri":"Douglas_Fairbanks","surface_form":"Douglas Fairbanks","offset":87},{"uri":"One_Thousand_and_One_Nights","surface_form":"One Thousand and One Nights","offset":133},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":243},{"uri":"Gymnastics","surface_form":"gymnastics","offset":318},{"uri":"Swashbuckler","surface_form":"swashbuckler","offset":483},{"uri":"Genie","surface_form":"Djinn","offset":581},{"uri":"Sabu","surface_form":"Sabu","offset":666},{"uri":"Steve_Reeves","surface_form":"Steve Reeves","offset":693},{"uri":"United_States_National_Film_Registry","surface_form":"United States National Film Registry","offset":766}]}
