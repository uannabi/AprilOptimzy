{"id":32962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht","text":"(born;* 11. February 1898 in Augsburg; \u2020 14. August 1956 in Berlin) was a German poet and dramatist.\nLife.\nBrecht went to school in Augsburg, where his father was the director of a paper factory.\nHe completed his degree in 1917.\nAfterwards he studied sciences, medicine and literature at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. He had to take a break in his studies because he had to join the army.\nIn the 1920s, Brecht went to Berlin and became a part of the cultural scene. He met his second wife Helene Weigel in Berlin and married her, after divorcing his first wife. It was with his second wife that Brecht had another son.\nIn Berlin he met a lot of artists and intellectuals of the Weimar Republic.\nHis works became very critical about the capitalistic society (e.g. \"Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\" (1930)). Many of his friends were communists, but he never joined the KPD.\nHis most famous work was from that time, the \"Dreigroschenoper\".\nIn 1933 the Nazis prohibited playing some of his works and arrested some of his friends.\nAfter the Reichstag fire, he travelled from Germany to Prague, Vienna, Switzerland and Denmark.\nFor the next five years he lived in Denmark. In 1938 he wrote \"Das Leben des Galilei\" (The Life of Galilei) about Galileo Galilei, who was hunted by the Holy Inquisition because he wanted to tell the scientific truth.\nWhen Germany occupied Denmark he had to flee once again.\nHe went to Sweden, then to Finland and finally to Moscow in the Soviet Union.\nEven under Stalin he was not safe. He therefore flew through China to the United States.\nHe lived and worked in California and translated a lot of text.\nIn 1947, in the McCarthy era, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated him, because they suspected him of being a communist.\nHe gave a statement and said that he had never been a member of the communist party.\nHe then flew back to Switzerland - the only place he could go to at the time.\nIn 1948 he was allowed to return to Berlin, East Berlin.\nHe was an important writer and director for the young East Germany.\nAfter the workers' protest on June 17 1953, Brecht complained about the Eastern German government which landed him into some trouble. From that point on he got more and more isolated.\nBrecht died of a heart attack in 1956 at the age of 58 years in Berlin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Augsburg","surface_form":"Augsburg","offset":29},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":60},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":74},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":81},{"uri":"Dramatist","surface_form":"dramatist","offset":90},{"uri":"Augsburg","surface_form":"Augsburg","offset":132},{"uri":"Ludwig-Maximilians-University","surface_form":"Ludwig-Maximilians-University","offset":292},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":325},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":433},{"uri":"Helene_Weigel","surface_form":"Helene Weigel","offset":504},{"uri":"Divorcing","surface_form":"divorcing","offset":551},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Weimar Republic","offset":693},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":852},{"uri":"KPD","surface_form":"KPD","offset":888},{"uri":"Dreigroschenoper","surface_form":"Dreigroschenoper","offset":939},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":970},{"uri":"Reichstag_fire","surface_form":"Reichstag fire","offset":1057},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":1102},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":1110},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1118},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":1134},{"uri":"Das_Leben_des_Galilei","surface_form":"Das Leben des Galilei","offset":1206},{"uri":"Galileo_Galilei","surface_form":"Galileo Galilei","offset":1257},{"uri":"Holy_Inquisition","surface_form":"Holy Inquisition","offset":1296},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":1429},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":1445},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":1468},{"uri":"Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":1507},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1557},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1570},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1608},{"uri":"McCarthy_era","surface_form":"McCarthy era","offset":1665},{"uri":"House_Un-American_Activities_Committee","surface_form":"House Un-American Activities Committee","offset":1683},{"uri":"East_Berlin","surface_form":"East Berlin","offset":2003},{"uri":"East_Germany","surface_form":"East Germany","offset":2070},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":2285},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":2332}]}
