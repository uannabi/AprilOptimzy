But is usually hidden well from the law.\nIn movies.\nIn 1958 Robert Mitchum made a film \"Thunder Road\" about a moonshine \"runner\" who makes one last-and fatal run.\nThe part of the \"runner\" being killed was loosely based on the death of a actual runner named Rufus Gunther of Cocke County Tennessee in January 1953\nThe movie part of the burning car going over the cliff was reused in the 1963 Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Bouncing Boomerang\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Robert_Mitchum","surface_form":"Robert Mitchum","offset":229}]}
