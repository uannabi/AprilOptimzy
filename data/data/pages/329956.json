The bacteria spread through sexual contact. The infection is not caused by the same bacteria that cause genital chlamydia.\nLGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America. Every year, a few hundred cases of LGV are diagnosed in the United States. However, the actual number of infections is unknown.\nLGV is more common in men than women.
