{"id":33,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel","text":"In many mythologies and religions, an angel is a good spirit. The word angel comes from the Greek word \"angelos\" which means \"messenger\". Angels appear frequently in the Old Testament, the New Testament, Qur'an and Aqdas.\nIn the Bible.\nAngels are powerful, smart spirits that obey God's commands and praise him with singing and they have male (masculine)gender, but without any sex. They sometimes appear to humans in human form. They can deliver messages to people in person or in dreams. Angels that are named in the Bible are Michael (called a \"chief prince\"), Gabriel (known for telling Mary that she would be the mother of Jesus), and Raphael (in the Apocryphal Book of Tobit). The Ethiopian Book of Enoch also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible.\nTypes.\n13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.\n14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.\nIt describes the sound of their wings, \"like the roar of rushing waters.\"\nEzekiel 10:5-7; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings.\nEzekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have \"straight feet\" and four wings and four faces.\nEzekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20; Ezekiel 10:16\nEzekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be \"a wheel in the midst of a wheel\" and that the color of the wheels was the color of \"Amber\" Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there.\nIn art.\nThey are often shown in art as having wings and a halo. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness.\nThe cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.\nThe cherubim statue or bronze casting of cherubim in the Temple of Solomon depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.\nThe same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the Ark of the Covenant. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by Leonardo da Vinci.\nAngelology.\nThe study of Angels is called Angelology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":24},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":54},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":170},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":189},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":204},{"uri":"Aqdas","surface_form":"Aqdas","offset":215},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":338},{"uri":"Masculine","surface_form":"masculine","offset":344},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":354},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":408},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":482},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":519},{"uri":"Michael_(archangel)","surface_form":"Michael","offset":529},{"uri":"Gabriel","surface_form":"Gabriel","offset":564},{"uri":"Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","surface_form":"Mary","offset":591},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":628},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"Apocrypha","offset":656},{"uri":"Book_of_Tobit","surface_form":"Book of Tobit","offset":667},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":687},{"uri":"Book_of_Enoch","surface_form":"Book of Enoch","offset":697},{"uri":"Uriel","surface_form":"Uriel","offset":815},{"uri":"Halo","surface_form":"halo","offset":2277},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":2468},{"uri":"Solomon","surface_form":"Solomon","offset":2512},{"uri":"Ark_of_the_Covenant","surface_form":"Ark of the Covenant","offset":2700},{"uri":"Leonardo_da_Vinci","surface_form":"Leonardo da Vinci","offset":2795}]}
