{"id":330037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E1%B9%89angu","text":"Anangu, A\u1E49a\u014Bu or Arnangu (pronounced with the stress on the first syllable:), is a word used to refer to Aboriginal people in Australia. It is found in some dialects of the Western Desert Language (WDL) of western and central Australia.\nBefore European people arrived in central Australia, the word probably meant 'human being', or 'person'. But now it is used to mean 'Aboriginal person' only. Because other Aboriginal languages have their own words for '(Aboriginal) person' the word \"anangu\" is mostly used in English to refer to the WDL-speaking people. Used in this way, it is not used to refer to any traditional grouping (or tribe), but to the WDL people as a whole. The correct term for \"black person\" in Pitjantjatjara is ', literally \"dark/black person\".\nEquivalents in other languages and dialects.\nOther Western Desert Language dialects have different words with a similar meaning and many uses. In the far west of the WDL (i.e. amongst Manyjilyjarra, Kartujarra, Putijarra and Warnman) the word \"martu\" is used, and in the central Western Desert (i.e. amongst the western Pintupi) the word \"purntu\", although this seems to be rarely used now.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian_Aborigine","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":105},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":157},{"uri":"Western_Desert_Language","surface_form":"Western Desert Language","offset":173},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"western","offset":206},{"uri":"Central_Australia","surface_form":"central Australia","offset":218},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":632},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":713},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":840},{"uri":"Manyjilyjarra","surface_form":"Manyjilyjarra","offset":949},{"uri":"Kartujarra","surface_form":"Kartujarra","offset":964},{"uri":"Putijarra","surface_form":"Putijarra","offset":976},{"uri":"Warnman","surface_form":"Warnman","offset":990},{"uri":"Pintupi","surface_form":"Pintupi","offset":1085}]}
