{"id":330219,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)","text":"Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It is named after Haskell Brooks Curry, a U.S. mathematician who contributed a lot to logic. Haskell is based on lambda calculus and uses the Greek letter lambda as its logo. The main implementations are the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and Hugs, a Haskell interpreter.\nExamples.\nfib n = fibs !! n\nwhere fibs = 0: 1: zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\nInfluence.\nHaskell was influenced by many earlier programming languages. These were Clean, FP, Gofer, Hope and Hope+, Id, ISWIM, KRC, Lisp, Miranda, ML and Standard ML, Orwell, SASL, SISAL, and Scheme.\nHaskell itself has influenced many later programming languages, such as Agda, Bluespec, C++11/Concepts, /LINQ, Cayenne, Clean, Clojure, CoffeeScript, Curry, Isabelle, Java/Generics, Mercury, Perl 6, Python, Scala, Visual Basic 9.0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Functional_programming_language","surface_form":"functional","offset":20},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":31},{"uri":"Haskell_Brooks_Curry","surface_form":"Haskell Brooks Curry","offset":71},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":139},{"uri":"Lambda_calculus","surface_form":"lambda calculus","offset":166},{"uri":"Greek_letter","surface_form":"Greek letter","offset":195},{"uri":"Lambda","surface_form":"lambda","offset":208},{"uri":"Clean_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Clean","offset":486},{"uri":"FP_(programming_language)","surface_form":"FP","offset":493},{"uri":"Gofer_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Gofer","offset":497},{"uri":"Hope_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Hope","offset":504},{"uri":"Id_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Id","offset":520},{"uri":"ISWIM","surface_form":"ISWIM","offset":524},{"uri":"Kent_Recursive_Calculator","surface_form":"KRC","offset":531},{"uri":"Lisp_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Lisp","offset":536},{"uri":"Miranda_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Miranda","offset":542},{"uri":"ML_(programming_language)","surface_form":"ML","offset":551},{"uri":"Standard_ML","surface_form":"Standard ML","offset":558},{"uri":"Orwell_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Orwell","offset":571},{"uri":"SASL_(programming_language)","surface_form":"SASL","offset":579},{"uri":"SISAL","surface_form":"SISAL","offset":585},{"uri":"Scheme_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Scheme","offset":596},{"uri":"Agda_(theorem_prover)","surface_form":"Agda","offset":676},{"uri":"Bluespec%2C_Inc.","surface_form":"Bluespec","offset":682},{"uri":"C%2B%2B11","surface_form":"C++11","offset":692},{"uri":"Concepts_(C%2B%2B)","surface_form":"Concepts","offset":698},{"uri":"Language_Integrated_Query","surface_form":"LINQ","offset":709},{"uri":"Cayenne_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Cayenne","offset":715},{"uri":"Clean_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Clean","offset":724},{"uri":"Clojure","surface_form":"Clojure","offset":731},{"uri":"CoffeeScript","surface_form":"CoffeeScript","offset":740},{"uri":"Curry_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Curry","offset":754},{"uri":"Isabelle_theorem_prover","surface_form":"Isabelle","offset":761},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":771},{"uri":"Generics_in_Java","surface_form":"Generics","offset":776},{"uri":"Mercury_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":786},{"uri":"Perl_6","surface_form":"Perl 6","offset":795},{"uri":"Python_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Python","offset":803},{"uri":"Scala_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Scala","offset":811},{"uri":"Visual_Basic_.NET","surface_form":"Visual Basic 9.0","offset":818}]}
