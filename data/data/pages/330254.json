It was published in October 1858. It sold 25,000 copies in two months.\nIt tells the story of early New England settlers Miles Standish, John Alden, and Priscilla Mullins. Miles Standish and John Alden are both in love with Priscilla.\nIt is unknown whether the story was taken from real-life, or if it was an American folk tale. One critic liked some aspects of the poem. He complained about other aspects though. Longfellow wrote the poem in an unfamiliar meter, Greek hexameter, and used medieval words.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow","surface_form":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow","offset":52},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":87},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":179},{"uri":"Miles_Standish","surface_form":"Miles Standish","offset":200},{"uri":"John_Alden","surface_form":"John Alden","offset":216},{"uri":"Priscilla_Mullins","surface_form":"Priscilla Mullins","offset":232},{"uri":"Folk_tale","surface_form":"folk tale","offset":397},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"critic","offset":412},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":536},{"uri":"Hexameter","surface_form":"hexameter","offset":549},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":569}]}
