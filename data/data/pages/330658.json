{"id":330658,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tudes_(Chopin)","text":"The \u00C9tudes by Polish composer Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin are three sets of \u00E9tudes for piano.\nComposition.\nChopin's \"\u00C9tudes\" are some of the hardest pieces of all the works in concert piano repertoire. Because of this, the music remain famous and are often played at concerts. Some of them have been given nicknames (but not by Chopin himself) - for example, the last \"\u00C9tude\" from Op. 10 has been called the \"Revolutionary\" because it was inspired by the November 1830 Uprising, when the Poles were defeated by the Russian Empire.\nAll twenty-seven \"\u00C9tudes\" were published during Chopin's lifetime; Opus 10, the first group of twelve were written between 1829 and 1832, and were published in 1833, in France, Germany, and England. The twelve \"\u00C9tudes\" of Opus 25 were composed at various times between 1832 and 1836, and were published in the same countries in 1837. The final three, part of a series called \"M\u00E9thode des m\u00E9thodes de piano\" compiled by Moscheles and F\u00E9tis, were composed in 1839 but with no opus number.\nThe first \"\u00C9tudes\" of the Opus 10 set were written when Chopin was still in his teens. Chopin's \"\u00C9tudes\" elevated the musical form from purely utilitarian exercises to great artistic masterpieces. At a concert in which Chopin performed his opus 25, Robert Schumann said \"\u00C0 la Chopin\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin","surface_form":"Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin","offset":30},{"uri":"%C3%A9tude","surface_form":"\u00E9tude","offset":64},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":75},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":503},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":688},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":696},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":709},{"uri":"Ignaz_Moscheles","surface_form":"Moscheles","offset":938},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois-Joseph_F%C3%A9tis","surface_form":"F\u00E9tis","offset":952}]}
