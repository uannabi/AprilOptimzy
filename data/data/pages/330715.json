{"id":330715,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr.","text":"Sammy Davis Jr. (December 8, 1925\u00A0\u2013 May 16, 1990) was an American entertainer. He was a dancer, singer and instrumentalist (playing vibraphone, trumpet and drums), comedian and actor. He was born in Harlem, New York City. Davis became hugely successful as a stage singer and recording artist and when asked to play at segregated places (where African-Americans were not allowed) he refused. Because of this some popular venues began to allow African-Americans to attend just so they could have Davis and other popular black musicians play. Before that black singers like Davis and Nat King Cole could play at the hotels and casinos but not stay or gamble there.\nDavis led an unhealthy lifestyle of drinking, smoking and cocaine use but was one of the most popular musicians and actors of the time. He converted to Judaism while in the hospital in 1954 and 1955. He was also a member of the Rat Pack with friends Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.\nThe Kennedy Center honored Davis in 1987.\nDavis died of throat cancer in Beverly Hills, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":57},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainer","offset":66},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":88},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":96},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrumentalist","offset":107},{"uri":"Vibraphone","surface_form":"vibraphone","offset":132},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":144},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":156},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedian","offset":164},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":177},{"uri":"Harlem","surface_form":"Harlem","offset":199},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":207},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"segregated","offset":318},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":343},{"uri":"Nat_King_Cole","surface_form":"Nat King Cole","offset":581},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":613},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"gamble","offset":648},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"drinking","offset":698},{"uri":"Smoking","surface_form":"smoking","offset":708},{"uri":"Cocaine","surface_form":"cocaine","offset":720},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":814},{"uri":"Rat_Pack","surface_form":"Rat Pack","offset":890},{"uri":"Frank_Sinatra","surface_form":"Frank Sinatra","offset":912},{"uri":"Dean_Martin","surface_form":"Dean Martin","offset":930},{"uri":"Kennedy_Center_Honors","surface_form":"Kennedy Center honored","offset":947},{"uri":"Throat_cancer","surface_form":"throat cancer","offset":999},{"uri":"Beverly_Hills%2C_California","surface_form":"Beverly Hills, California","offset":1016}]}
