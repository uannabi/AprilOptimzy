{"id":33077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus","text":"\"Bacillus\" is a genus of rod shaped bacteria. They are Gram-positive, meaning they have an extra outside cell layer.\nBacilli are partly or wholly aerobic. They do aerobic respiration. They are everywhere in nature. \"Bacillus\" includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species.\nUnder stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Rod_shaped","surface_form":"rod shaped","offset":25},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":36},{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"Gram-positive","offset":55},{"uri":"Aerobic","surface_form":"aerobic","offset":146},{"uri":"Aerobic_respiration","surface_form":"aerobic respiration","offset":163},{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":272},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":282}]}
