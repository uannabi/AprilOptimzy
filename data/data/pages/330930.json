He played college football for Penn State.\nJohnson spent most of his career with the Kansas City Chiefs. After replacing the often-injured veteran Priest Holmes, Johnson excelled. He played very well in 2005 and 2006 and far passed the 1,000 yard mark that notable backs and receivers aim for. However, after an argument with head coach Todd Haley in 2009, he was released. He finished the season with the Cincinnati Bengals, but was not resigned.\nJohnson spent portions of offseasons with the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins, but was cut both times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["NFL player"],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_Football","surface_form":"American Football","offset":51},{"uri":"Runningback","surface_form":"runningback","offset":69},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":88},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":124},{"uri":"Penn_State","surface_form":"Penn State","offset":145},{"uri":"Kansas_City_Chiefs","surface_form":"Kansas City Chiefs","offset":199},{"uri":"Priest_Holmes","surface_form":"Priest Holmes","offset":261},{"uri":"Todd_Haley","surface_form":"Todd Haley","offset":451},{"uri":"Cincinnati_Bengals","surface_form":"Cincinnati Bengals","offset":520},{"uri":"Washington_Redskins","surface_form":"Washington Redskins","offset":608},{"uri":"Miami_Dolphins","surface_form":"Miami Dolphins","offset":632}]}
