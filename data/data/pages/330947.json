He rushed for two yards in one game, lined up as a wide receiver in another, and completed an 18-yard pass to Anquan Boldin as well. He was on the roster when the Ravens won Super Bowl XLVII and defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31.\nTaylor left Baltimore after four years for the Buffalo Bills, becoming the starter for three years.
