It was based in New York City, New York. It was the world's second biggest media company in revenue in 2011, and the world's third largest company in entertainment in 2009.\nNews Corporation was founded in Adelaide in 1979, by Rupert Murdoch. It was incorporated under South Australian commercial law until 2004 when the company moved to the United States. It was re-incorporated under Delaware law after its shareholders approved the move on 12 November 2004. It was a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ. Murdoch remained the chairman and chief executive officer of the company until its end in 2013.\nAmong its major holdings were News Limited, News International (whose properties include \"The Times\", \"The Sun\", and the now-closed \"News of the World\"), Dow Jones & Company (which owned \"The Wall Street Journal\"), the book publisher HarperCollins, and the Fox Entertainment Group (owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Fox Broadcasting Company).\nNews Corporation was split into two different companies on 28 June 2013. Both are publicly traded companies: 21st Century Fox consists mainly of television and media assets, while a new News Corp focuses on publishing.\nMagazines and inserts.\nAll titles sourced from [http://www.newsspace.com.au/magazines News Limited - NewsSource: Magazines] on 15 October 2010.\nInternational.\nDow Jones & Company\nDormant or shuttered News Corporation businesses.\nThe following companies are subsidiaries of News Corporation that either are no longer active or have been absorbed into another part of the company.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"mass media","offset":78},{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":89},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":118},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":133},{"uri":"Revenue","surface_form":"revenue","offset":194},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":307},{"uri":"Rupert_Murdoch","surface_form":"Rupert Murdoch","offset":328},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":370},{"uri":"Delaware","surface_form":"Delaware","offset":487},{"uri":"Public_company","surface_form":"publicly traded","offset":571},{"uri":"NASDAQ","surface_form":"NASDAQ","offset":609},{"uri":"Chief_executive_officer","surface_form":"chief executive officer","offset":651},{"uri":"News_Limited","surface_form":"News Limited","offset":743},{"uri":"News_UK","surface_form":"News International","offset":757},{"uri":"The_Times","surface_form":"The Times","offset":803},{"uri":"The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)","surface_form":"The Sun","offset":816},{"uri":"News_of_the_World","surface_form":"News of the World","offset":846},{"uri":"Dow_Jones_%26amp%3B_Company","surface_form":"Dow Jones & Company","offset":867},{"uri":"The_Wall_Street_Journal","surface_form":"The Wall Street Journal","offset":901},{"uri":"HarperCollins","surface_form":"HarperCollins","offset":947},{"uri":"Fox_Entertainment_Group","surface_form":"Fox Entertainment Group","offset":970},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox","surface_form":"20th Century Fox","offset":1009},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox Broadcasting Company","offset":1046},{"uri":"21st_Century_Fox","surface_form":"21st Century Fox","offset":1182},{"uri":"News_Corp","surface_form":"News Corp","offset":1259},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishing","offset":1280},{"uri":"Dow_Jones_%26amp%3B_Company","surface_form":"Dow Jones & Company","offset":1451}]}
