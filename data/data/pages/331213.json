{"id":331213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Sylphides","text":"\"Les Sylphides\" () is a ballet choreographed by Michel Fokine to the music of Frederic Chopin. The music was orchestrated by Stravinsky among others. The scenery and costumes were designed by Alexandre Benois.\nThe ballet was first performed by the Ballets Russes in Paris at the Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2telet on 2 June 1909. It starred Nijinsky, Tamara Karsavina, Anna Pavlova, and Maria Baldina. The ballet is non-narrative. It does not tell a story. It is a series of dances meant to evoke the atmosphere and ambiance of a romantic ballet.\n\"Les Sylphides\" was developed from a Fokine ballet called \"Chopiniana\". This ballet was performed in St Petersburg on 21 March 1908. It was a series of imagined scenes from Chopin's life that included a Polish wedding and a ballroom polonaise. It was revised. All characters and any suggestion of a plot were dropped to create instead an evocation of the romantic ballet.\nThe revised ballet (still called \"Chopiniana\") was performed in St Petersburg on 6 April 1908. This second version was costumed in the long white ballet tutu made famous by Marie Taglioni in \"La Sylphide\". \"Chopiniana\" was renamed \"Les Sylphides\" when it was presented in Paris.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["ballet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":24},{"uri":"Choreograph","surface_form":"choreograph","offset":31},{"uri":"Michel_Fokine","surface_form":"Michel Fokine","offset":48},{"uri":"Frederic_Chopin","surface_form":"Frederic Chopin","offset":78},{"uri":"Orchestrate","surface_form":"orchestrate","offset":109},{"uri":"Stravinsky","surface_form":"Stravinsky","offset":125},{"uri":"Alexandre_Benois","surface_form":"Alexandre Benois","offset":192},{"uri":"Ballets_Russes","surface_form":"Ballets Russes","offset":248},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":266},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_du_Ch%C3%A2telet","surface_form":"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2telet","offset":279},{"uri":"1909","surface_form":"1909","offset":309},{"uri":"Nijinsky","surface_form":"Nijinsky","offset":326},{"uri":"Tamara_Karsavina","surface_form":"Tamara Karsavina","offset":336},{"uri":"Anna_Pavlova","surface_form":"Anna Pavlova","offset":354},{"uri":"Maria_Baldina","surface_form":"Maria Baldina","offset":372},{"uri":"Romantic_ballet","surface_form":"romantic ballet","offset":515},{"uri":"St_Petersburg","surface_form":"St Petersburg","offset":633},{"uri":"1908","surface_form":"1908","offset":659},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":735},{"uri":"Polonaise","surface_form":"polonaise","offset":765},{"uri":"Evocation","surface_form":"evocation","offset":870},{"uri":"Romantic_ballet","surface_form":"romantic ballet","offset":887},{"uri":"Tut","surface_form":"tut","offset":1057},{"uri":"Marie_Taglioni","surface_form":"Marie Taglioni","offset":1077},{"uri":"La_Sylphide","surface_form":"La Sylphide","offset":1096}]}
