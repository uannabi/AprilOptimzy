He played college football for the Missouri Tigers. He also played for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nEarly life.\nGabbert was born in Ballwin, Missouri, USA and went to Parkway West High School, where he played high school football. In his sophomore season, he threw for about 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns as a first-year starter. As a junior, he had 1,523 yards and 20 scores and also added 458 yards and 8 TDs rushing. He threw 623 passing yards and five touchdowns as a senior, despite an injured foot that limited him to four games. He was considered one of the best players entering college at his position.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nAfter an impressive showing at the combine, Gabbert was taken 10th overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2011 NFL Draft. Gabbert, who to his credit was playing on a team that had done very poorly the past several years, had a bad season in 2011. He was sacked 40 times (3rd most in league history), fumbled 14 times, and threw only 12 touchdown passes next to eleven interceptions as Jacksonville's bad luck continued. Analysts noted how Gabbert's height decreased when he threw, which is the opposite of what is supposed to happen.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn March 11, 2014, Gabbert got traded to the San Francisco 49ers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":21},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":39},{"uri":"San_Francisco_49ers","surface_form":"San Francisco 49ers","offset":59},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":86},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":122},{"uri":"Jacksonville_Jaguars","surface_form":"Jacksonville Jaguars","offset":187},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":250},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":260},{"uri":"High_school_football","surface_form":"high school football","offset":318},{"uri":"Touchdown","surface_form":"touchdown","offset":565},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":696},{"uri":"Jacksonville_Jaguars","surface_form":"Jacksonville Jaguars","offset":825},{"uri":"Jacksonville_Jaguars","surface_form":"Jacksonville","offset":1132},{"uri":"San_Francisco_49ers","surface_form":"San Francisco 49ers","offset":1347}]}
