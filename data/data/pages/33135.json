They are often rectangular, and may or may not have handles with which to carry them.\nA butler's tray has a deeper surround, handles on the short sides (usually cut into the surround) so that it can be easily carried, and folding legs. It is used to carry drinks, and can be used as a side table.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangular","offset":154},{"uri":"Side_table","surface_form":"side table","offset":424}]}
