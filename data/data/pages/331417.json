A farmer puts a scarecrow in a field after he has planted seeds. He hopes the scarecrow will frighten birds away from the field. Some birds such as crows and sparrows eat the seeds the farmer plants. He does not want the birds to do this. If the birds eat the seeds, the farmer will not have a big crop of things to eat.\nScarecrows in stories and literature.\nScarecrows are sometimes characters in stories. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a story about a scarecrow who comes to life in \"Feathertop\". The most famous storybook scarecrow is probably the one in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":109},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":209},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"crow","offset":255},{"uri":"Sparrow","surface_form":"sparrow","offset":265},{"uri":"Nathaniel_Hawthorne","surface_form":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","offset":514},{"uri":"Feathertop","surface_form":"Feathertop","offset":588},{"uri":"The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz","surface_form":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz","offset":661},{"uri":"L._Frank_Baum","surface_form":"L.
