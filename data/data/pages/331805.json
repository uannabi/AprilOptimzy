{"id":331805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Op%C3%A9ra_Ballet","text":"The Paris Opera Ballet (French: Ballet de l'Op\u00E9ra de Paris) is the oldest national ballet company in the world. Many European and international ballet companies can trace their origins to it. It has always been an integral part of the Paris Op\u00E9ra, which was founded in 1669 as the Acad\u00E9mie d'Op\u00E9ra (Academy of Opera).\nTheatrical dance was not an important part of the Paris Opera until 1673. Then was renamed the Acad\u00E9mie Royale de Musique (Royal Academy of Music) and placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully. The Paris Opera has had many different official names during its long history but since 1994 has been called the Op\u00E9ra National de Paris (Paris Opera). Currently the company presents ballet primarily at the Palais Garnier.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":24},{"uri":"Paris_Op%C3%A9ra","surface_form":"Paris Op\u00E9ra","offset":235},{"uri":"Jean-Baptiste_Lully","surface_form":"Jean-Baptiste Lully","offset":500},{"uri":"Palais_Garnier","surface_form":"Palais Garnier","offset":728}]}
