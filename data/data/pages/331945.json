{"id":331945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan","text":"An alluvial fan is a fan-shaped deposit of soil and rocks. It forms where a fast-flowing river spreads out over a flat plain. They are usually found in between mountain ranges that are crumbling away. If it rains a lot, the fan area will usually flood.\nAllevial plain.\nAn alluvial plain is a mostly flat landform where sediment is deposited over time. The cause is the same: one or more rivers coming from highland regions. A floodplain is the smaller area over which the rivers flood at a particular period of time, and the alluvial plain is the larger area, where floodplains have shifted over geological time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":21},{"uri":"Deposition_(geology)","surface_form":"deposit","offset":32},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":89},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":119},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":160},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"crumbling","offset":185},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":246},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":319}]}
