He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 7th round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at LSU.\nCollege career.\nFlynn redshirted the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season, as did the other LSU quarterback signee, JaMarcus Russell.\nIn 2004, Flynn was a third string quarterback as a redshirt freshman, behind starter Marcus Randall and backup JaMarcus Russell. He was also LSU's holder on placekicks. Flynn played in all 12 games, but only three games at quarterback. His collegiate first complete throw went to Xavier Carter for a 67-yard touchdown against Mississippi State. Flynn also made a short appearance in the 2004 Capital One Bowl. In that game, he completed 1 of 4 passes for 11 yards in a 25-30 loss against Iowa. He finished the year by completing 4 of 10 passes for 99 yards and 1 TD.\nSophomore season.\nWhen Randall left the team, Russell and Flynn fought for the starting QB position. Russell got the job. Flynn was the backup. Flynn played in seven games at quarterback for the Tigers in 2005. He completed 27 of 48 passes for 457 yards, 7 touchdowns and 1 interception. In a win over North Texas, Flynn threw 7-of-7 for 139 yards and 3 TDs, all in the fourth quarter. In the 2005 SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, starting quarterback Russell was injured. Flynn finished the game. He was then made the main quarterback for the Tigers in the 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl against the University of Miami Hurricanes. In that game, he led the Tigers to a 40-3 win over Miami.\nJunior season.\nFlynn played in seven games as a junior. He completed 12 of 20 passes for 133 yards over the season. He had 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Both TDs came in a 49-0 win against Kentucky on October 14, 2006.\nSenior season.\nWhen Russell was drafted by the Oakland Raiders, Flynn finally became a starter as a fifth-year senior. He started every game that season except the SEC Championship in which he was injured.\nFlynn threw a 22 yard TD pass to Demetrius Byrd to win the game against Auburn on October 20, 2007 with 1 second remaining on the clock. LSU won the game 30 - 24.\nHe then led the Tigers to a 4th quarter comeback against Alabama State University. The Tigers then beat Louisiana Tech the following weekend and became the #1 team in the nation. The next week the Tigers beat Ole Miss. In his final game at Tiger Stadium, the Tigers lost to Arkansas State University. With this loss, it was not likely the team could win the national title. However, LSU, without Flynn, beat Tennessee for the SEC Championship. This win by LSU and losses by Missouri State University and West Virginia State University let LSU go to the championship game in New Orleans.\nOn January 7, 2008, Flynn led LSU to a BCS National Championship. They beat Ohio State 38-24. Flynn was named offensive MVP of the game.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nFlynn was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 7th round (209th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. On July 23, he was signed to a four-year contract through the 2011 season. He is now Green Bay's second-string quarterback. He won the back-up role to Aaron Rodgers by beating out fellow rookie and second-round pick Brian Brohm. The battle for the second-string position became the most interesting battle in camp. Flynn was seen as being less talented than Brohm because of Brohm's larger size, and better arm and foot speed.\nOn December 19, 2010, Flynn made his first NFL start against the New England Patriots because starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers was hurt. Flynn threw three touchdown passes. He threw one each to John Kuhn, James Jones and Greg Jennings against New England. He also threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Kyle Arrington. The Packers lost the game 31-27. Flynn completed 23 of 37 passes for 254 yards in the loss, and was praised for his good work\nOn January 1, 2012, the Packers were the #1 seed and rested most of their starting players., Matt Flynn started the final game of the season against the Detroit Lions. He threw for 480 yards and 6 touchdowns in the 45-41 victory. both of these statistics set all-time Green Bay Packers records, and got many other teams interested in signing Flynn as a starter.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nFlynn was signed by the Seattle Seahawks in mid-March of the 2012 offseason to a 3-year deal worth up to $26 million and $10 million guaranteed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["NFL player"],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":49},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":67},{"uri":"Green_Bay_Packers","surface_form":"Green Bay Packers","offset":102},{"uri":"2008_NFL_Draft","surface_form":"2008 NFL Draft","offset":144},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":170},{"uri":"LSU_Tigers_football","surface_form":"LSU","offset":190},{"uri":"Redshirt","surface_form":"redshirt","offset":217},{"uri":"2003_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","surface_form":"2003 NCAA Division I-A football season","offset":232},{"uri":"JaMarcus_Russell","surface_form":"JaMarcus Russell","offset":313},{"uri":"Marcus_Randall","surface_form":"Marcus Randall","offset":416},{"uri":"JaMarcus_Russell","surface_form":"JaMarcus Russell","offset":442},{"uri":"Holder_(American_football)","surface_form":"holder","offset":478},{"uri":"Placekick","surface_form":"placekick","offset":488},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"collegiate","offset":571},{"uri":"Xavier_Carter","surface_form":"Xavier Carter","offset":611},{"uri":"Touchdown","surface_form":"touchdown","offset":639},{"uri":"Mississippi_State_University","surface_form":"Mississippi State","offset":657},{"uri":"Capital_One_Bowl","surface_form":"Capital One Bowl","offset":723},{"uri":"Iowa_State_University","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":819},{"uri":"Interception","surface_form":"interception","offset":1172},{"uri":"University_of_North_Texas","surface_form":"North Texas","offset":1200},{"uri":"2005_SEC_Championship_Game","surface_form":"2005 SEC Championship Game","offset":1291},{"uri":"Georgia_Bulldogs","surface_form":"Georgia Bulldogs","offset":1330},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injured","offset":1381},{"uri":"Peach_Bowl","surface_form":"Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl","offset":1480},{"uri":"University_of_Miami","surface_form":"University of Miami","offset":1515},{"uri":"University_of_Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":1797},{"uri":"Oakland_Raiders","surface_form":"Oakland Raiders","offset":1874},{"uri":"Demetrius_Byrd","surface_form":"Demetrius Byrd","offset":2066},{"uri":"Auburn_Tigers_football","surface_form":"Auburn","offset":2105},{"uri":"Alabama_State_University","surface_form":"Alabama State University","offset":2253},{"uri":"Louisiana_Tech","surface_form":"Louisiana Tech","offset":2300},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":2367},{"uri":"Ole_Miss","surface_form":"Ole Miss","offset":2405},{"uri":"Tiger_Stadium","surface_form":"Tiger Stadium","offset":2436},{"uri":"Arkansas_State_University","surface_form":"Arkansas State University","offset":2470},{"uri":"SEC_Championship","surface_form":"SEC Championship","offset":2622},{"uri":"Missouri_State_University","surface_form":"Missouri State University","offset":2670},{"uri":"West_Virginia_State_University","surface_form":"West Virginia State University","offset":2700},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":2770},{"uri":"BCS_National_Championship","surface_form":"BCS National Championship","offset":2822},{"uri":"Ohio_State","surface_form":"Ohio State","offset":2859},{"uri":"Most_Valuable_Player","surface_form":"MVP","offset":2903},{"uri":"Green_Bay_Packers","surface_form":"Green Bay Packers","offset":2964},{"uri":"2008_NFL_Draft","surface_form":"2008 NFL Draft","offset":3022},{"uri":"Green_Bay","surface_form":"Green Bay","offset":3123},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":3149},{"uri":"Aaron_Rodgers","surface_form":"Aaron Rodgers","offset":3189},{"uri":"Brian_Brohm","surface_form":"Brian Brohm","offset":3254},{"uri":"Training_camp","surface_form":"camp","offset":3347},{"uri":"New_England_Patriots","surface_form":"New England Patriots","offset":3530},{"uri":"Aaron_Rodgers","surface_form":"Aaron Rodgers","offset":3580},{"uri":"John_Kuhn","surface_form":"John Kuhn","offset":3661},{"uri":"James_Jones_(wide_receiver)","surface_form":"James Jones","offset":3672},{"uri":"Greg_Jennings","surface_form":"Greg Jennings","offset":3688},{"uri":"Kyle_Arrington","surface_form":"Kyle Arrington","offset":3790},{"uri":"Detroit_Lions","surface_form":"Detroit Lions","offset":4085},{"uri":"Statistic","surface_form":"statistic","offset":4176},{"uri":"Seattle_Seahawks","surface_form":"Seattle Seahawks","offset":4336}]}
