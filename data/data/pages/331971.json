{"id":331971,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_Bay_National_Park","text":"Coffin Bay National Park is a large national park on the west coast of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. It is west of Port Lincoln. The park protects a range of different coastal areas including high cliffs, surf beaches, quiet bays and huge sand dunes. A large area of the park is on the Coffin Bay Peninsula. Much of the park is only accessible by four-wheel drive vehicles or boat.\nAboriginal stories say a great fire came from the ocean. Two men stopped the fire by dumping the sand dunes on top of it.\nOne of the trees found in the park is the Drooping Sheoak, Allocasuarina verticillata, and it is being replanted to restore some of the grassy woodlands. Western Grey Kangaroos, lizards and emus can be found through the park.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":36},{"uri":"Eyre_Peninsula","surface_form":"Eyre Peninsula","offset":75},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":93},{"uri":"Port_Lincoln%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Port Lincoln","offset":124},{"uri":"Four-wheel_drive","surface_form":"four-wheel drive","offset":356},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australian","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":391},{"uri":"Western_Grey_Kangaroo","surface_form":"Western Grey Kangaroo","offset":667},{"uri":"Emu","surface_form":"emu","offset":703}]}
