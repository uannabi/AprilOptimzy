{"id":332208,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_Christianity","text":"Muscular Christianity is a term for a movement originating during the Victorian era. It stressed the need for active Christian activism and belief of vigorous masculinity. It is most associated with the English writers Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes, and in Canada with Ralph Connor, though the name was bestowed by others. Kingsley and Hughes promoted physical strength and health (at least for men) as well as an active pursuit of Christian ideals in personal life and politics.\nMuscular Christianity has continued itself through organisations that combine physical and Christian spiritual development. It is influential within both Catholicism and Protestantism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victorian_era","surface_form":"Victorian era","offset":70},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":117},{"uri":"Activism","surface_form":"activism","offset":127},{"uri":"Masculinity","surface_form":"masculinity","offset":159},{"uri":"Charles_Kingsley","surface_form":"Charles Kingsley","offset":219},{"uri":"Thomas_Hughes","surface_form":"Thomas Hughes","offset":240},{"uri":"Ralph_Connor","surface_form":"Ralph Connor","offset":274},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":437},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":639},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestantism","offset":655}]}
