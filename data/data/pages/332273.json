It stars Alan Steel (real name Sergio Ciani). The movie \"blends\" elements from Roman, Greek, Cretan and Egyptian mythologies. In the original Italian language version, the hero was not Hercules. The hero was Maciste. Maciste was a hero in Italian silent movies. Its original Italian title was \"Maciste e la regina di Samar\" (\"Maciste and the Queen of Samar\"). Its French title was \"Maciste contre les hommes de pierre\" (\"Maciste Against the Men of Stone\"). The English distributors dubbed the hero Hercules, because Maciste was not well known to American audiences.\nStory.\nA race of evil moon men land on Earth.
