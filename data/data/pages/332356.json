{"id":332356,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s","text":"Georges M\u00E9li\u00E8s (8 December 1861 \u2013 21 January 1938) was a French moviemaker. He led the way in the use of special effects, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted colour in his work. His movies include \"Conquest of the Pole\", \"A Trip to the Moon\", and \"The Impossible Voyage\". These movies involve strange, surreal voyages, like those in Jules Verne's books. These movies are among the most important early science fiction movies. M\u00E9li\u00E8s's \"The Haunted Castle\" is an early horror movie.\nLife and work.\nM\u00E9li\u00E8s was born in Paris, France in 1861. He liked drawing and playing with a puppet theater as a child. He went to the theater often as a young man. About 1888, M\u00E9li\u00E8s bought the Th\u00E9atre Robert-Houdin and worked there as a magician. He became obsessed with moviemaking after seeing a movie by Antoine Lumi\u00E8re in 1895. In May 1896, he acquired his own movie camera and set up a movie studio. At the end of 1896, he formed a new company, Star Film.\nM\u00E9li\u00E8s began making movies that were three to nine minute long. He wrote, designed, filmed, and acted in nearly all of his movies. He liked putting magic tricks into his movies. While filming a street scene one day, the camera stopped briefly. When M\u00E9li\u00E8s looked at the movie later, he noticed that at the moment of the break, the bus he had been filming suddenly disappeared and new vehicles replaced it. Making items appear and disappear by stopping and starting the camera would become one of his most commonly used movie tricks.\nIn 1902, M\u00E9li\u00E8s produced his first masterpiece, \"A Trip to the Moon\". It was inspired by several works of the time that speculated about life on the moon. H.G. Wells and Jules Verne wrote about space travel, for instance, and Offenbach composed an opera about a trip to the moon. \"Trip\" was a huge success in France. M\u00E9li\u00E8s hoped to make a fortune showing it in the United States. Thomas Edison and other moviemakers made copies of \"Trip\" however, and made money on M\u00E9li\u00E8s's work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conquest_of_the_Pole","surface_form":"Conquest of the Pole","offset":234},{"uri":"A_Trip_to_the_Moon","surface_form":"A Trip to the Moon","offset":258},{"uri":"Surrealism","surface_form":"surreal","offset":338},{"uri":"Voyage","surface_form":"voyage","offset":346},{"uri":"Jules_Verne","surface_form":"Jules Verne","offset":369},{"uri":"Science_fiction_movies","surface_form":"science fiction movies","offset":438},{"uri":"The_Haunted_Castle","surface_form":"The Haunted Castle","offset":472},{"uri":"Horror_movie","surface_form":"horror movie","offset":504},{"uri":"Paris%2C_France","surface_form":"Paris, France","offset":552},{"uri":"Puppet","surface_form":"puppet","offset":611},{"uri":"Magician","surface_form":"magician","offset":757},{"uri":"Antoine_Lumi%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Antoine Lumi\u00E8re","offset":827},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":891},{"uri":"Movie_studio","surface_form":"movie studio","offset":911},{"uri":"A_Trip_to_the_Moon","surface_form":"A Trip to the Moon","offset":1563},{"uri":"H.G._Wells","surface_form":"H.G.
