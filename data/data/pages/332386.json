{"id":332386,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triodia","text":"\"Triodia\" is a large genus of grass endemic to Australia. They are often called spinifex, but they are not a part of the genus \"Spinifex\", which is only found near the coast. There are 64 known species. Triodia is a perennial grass that grows in dry areas. They have spikey, pointed leaves, about 30-40 centimetres long.\nThe leaf tips can break off in people's skin, causing infections. Spinifex has been used by Australian Aborigines in many things. The seeds are collected for food. Spinifex resin is used as a glue in spear-making. The grasses were also burned to make smoke signals, to communicate with groups a long way away. Some species are used for building shelters. Others are used to make traps for catching fish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":21},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":30},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":36},{"uri":"Spinifex_(genus)","surface_form":"Spinifex","offset":128},{"uri":"Perennial_plant","surface_form":"perennial","offset":216},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":361},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":375},{"uri":"Australian_Aborigines","surface_form":"Australian Aborigines","offset":413},{"uri":"Bushfood","surface_form":"food","offset":479},{"uri":"Spinifex_resin","surface_form":"Spinifex resin","offset":485},{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":521},{"uri":"Smoke_signal","surface_form":"smoke signal","offset":572},{"uri":"Trap","surface_form":"trap","offset":700}]}
