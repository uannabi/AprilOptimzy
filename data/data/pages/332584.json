{"id":332584,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chelation refers to the bonding of elemental atoms that cannot normally be bonded. For example, Sodium is a metal element that can bond with many other elements, like chlorine (forming common table salt: NaCl), or hydrogen and oxygen (Sodium hydroxide). The reason for this is that the way that atoms bond with each other is similar to a jigsaw puzzle: Only the proper shape can fit into the empty space made by the other pieces. However, with atoms, it's a bit different. For each element, the atom carries a certain number of electrons in orbit around its nucleus. Sometimes these orbits are split into levels, and only a certain number of electrons can fill each orbit before moving to a higher orbit.\nSometimes, an orbit level is not filled all the way and can only be filled with electrons from another element with a smaller number of electrons in a higher level. When the atoms bond together, the electrons are traded between the two equally and create a very strong bond.\nHowever, there are a few elements that cannot bond with many other elements, because they have orbits that are already filled, or nearly filled, equally. (Like a finished jigsaw puzzle) These elements can sometimes be poisonous to a human, and cannot be removed easily (for example, mercury.) Chelation enables a non-bonding element to bond, thereby enabling removal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bonding","offset":37},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"elemental","offset":48},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":58},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"Sodium","offset":109},{"uri":"Chlorine","surface_form":"chlorine","offset":180},{"uri":"Table_salt","surface_form":"table salt","offset":205},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":227},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":240},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"Sodium hydroxide","offset":248},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":541},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":554},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":571},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1211},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":1276}]}
