The holiday was founded in 1908 by Anna Jarvis. Mother's Day was first made to celebrate a person's own mother. Now it is made to celebrate all mothers and motherhood in general. It is celebrated at different times in different countries. In the United States of America, it is the second Sunday in May. Children can make cards and a lot of other things for their mother.\nHistory.\nThe idea for Mother's Day started in the 1850s. Ann Reeves Jarvis had mother's day work clubs where women tried to fight disease and bad milk. They also helped make hurt soldiers better during the Civil War. After the war, Ann made Mother's Day Friendship picnics and Mother's Friendship Day for the women from both sides of the war.\nIn 1908 after her mother died, Anna Jarvis made the first Mother's Day celebration in Grafton, West Virginia. People also celebrated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and many other cities. For six years, Anna made the celebration bigger until President Woodrow Wilson made it a national holiday in 1914.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":18},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":103},{"uri":"Anna_Jarvis","surface_form":"Anna Jarvis","offset":153},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":364},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":400},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":417},{"uri":"Ann_Reeves_Jarvis","surface_form":"Ann Reeves Jarvis","offset":547},{"uri":"Club","surface_form":"club","offset":587},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":620},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":636},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":669},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":696},{"uri":"Friend","surface_form":"Friend","offset":744},{"uri":"Picnic","surface_form":"picnic","offset":755},{"uri":"Side","surface_form":"side","offset":815},{"uri":"Anna_Jarvis","surface_form":"Anna Jarvis","offset":864},{"uri":"Celebration","surface_form":"celebration","offset":904},{"uri":"Grafton","surface_form":"Grafton","offset":919},{"uri":"West_Virginia","surface_form":"West Virginia","offset":928},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":969},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":983},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":1011},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":1073},{"uri":"Woodrow_Wilson","surface_form":"Woodrow Wilson","offset":1083},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":1108},{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":1117}]}
