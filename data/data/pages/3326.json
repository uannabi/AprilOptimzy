{"id":3326,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter","text":"e=\"preserve\">In geometry, perimeter is the distance around a flat object. For example, all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length, so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches (2+2+2+2=8).\nFor a polygon, the perimeter is simply the sum of the length of all of its sides. For a rectangle, the perimeter is twice the sum of its length and width (formula_1). Perimeter can also be calculated for other planar figures, such as circle, sector and ellipse.\nReal-life objects have perimeters as well. A football field, including the end zones, is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. This means that the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet.\nThe perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference. It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times \"Pi\". Pi is a constant which is approximately equal to 3.14159; however, the places to the right of the decimal are endless. The number of places used depends on the accuracy required for the result.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":16},{"uri":"Rhombus","surface_form":"rhombus","offset":114},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":237},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":465},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"ellipse","offset":484},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":538},{"uri":"Circumference","surface_form":"circumference","offset":736},{"uri":"Pi","surface_form":"Pi","offset":807}]}
