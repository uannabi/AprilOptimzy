{"id":33271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digon","text":"In geometry, a digon is a polygon with two sides (edges) and two vertices. Its construction is degenerate in a Euclidean plane because either the two sides would coincide or one or both would have to be curved; however, it can be easily visualised in elliptic space.\nA regular digon has both angles equal and both sides equal and is represented by Schl\u00E4fli symbol. It may be constructed on a sphere as a pair of 180 degree arcs connecting antipodal points, when it forms a lune.\nThe digon is the simplest abstract polytope of rank 2.\nA truncated \"digon\", t is a square. An alternated digon, h is a monogon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":26},{"uri":"Edge_(geometry)","surface_form":"edge","offset":50},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"vertices","offset":65},{"uri":"Degeneracy_(mathematics)","surface_form":"degenerate","offset":95},{"uri":"Euclidean_plane","surface_form":"Euclidean plane","offset":111},{"uri":"Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol","surface_form":"Schl\u00E4fli symbol","offset":348},{"uri":"Spherical_geometry","surface_form":"sphere","offset":392},{"uri":"Antipodal_point","surface_form":"antipodal point","offset":439},{"uri":"Spherical_lune","surface_form":"lune","offset":473},{"uri":"Abstract_polytope","surface_form":"abstract polytope","offset":505},{"uri":"Truncation_(geometry)","surface_form":"truncated","offset":536},{"uri":"Square","surface_form":"square","offset":562},{"uri":"Alternation_(geometry)","surface_form":"alternated","offset":573},{"uri":"Monogon","surface_form":"monogon","offset":598}]}
