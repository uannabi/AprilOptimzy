{"id":33280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_man","text":"e=\"preserve\">A medicine man is a traditional Native American healer. Healing was only part of their function. Another part of their role was as guardian of their belief system, and their rituals.\nA very similar role was played in many other mesolithic and neolithic societies, such as pre-modern Africa and New Guinea. This person, man or woman, might help cure physical, mental, or spiritual health problems. A term such as shaman or witch doctor reflects the supernatural element in such roles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":45},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":162},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":187},{"uri":"Mesolithic","surface_form":"mesolithic","offset":241},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"neolithic","offset":256},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":296},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":307},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"physical","offset":362},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental","offset":372},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"shaman","offset":425},{"uri":"Witch_doctor","surface_form":"witch doctor","offset":435},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"supernatural","offset":461}]}
