{"id":332801,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_de_Foot_Montr%C3%A9al","text":"Club de Foot Montr\u00E9al, commonly known as CF Montr\u00E9al, is a Canadian soccer team based in Montreal, Quebec. It has played in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer (MLS) since 2012. The club was created in 2010 as an expansion team named the Montreal Impact. It was the third Canadian team to join the MLS. The old Montreal Impact of the North American Soccer League (NASL) was replaced by this team. The team's motto is \"Tous Pour Gagner\". That is French for \"All for victory.\nThe club plays its home games at the Saputo Stadium and is coached by Mauro Biello.\nHistory.\nOn March 10, 2012, the Impact played their first MLS game, which ended in a 2-0 loss against Vancouver Whitecaps. The Impact won the Canadian Championship in both 2013 and 2014.\nRivalries.\nMontreal Impact's biggest rival is Toronto F.C. because of Canada's two largest cities (Toronto and Montreal) having shared multiple rivalries. Montreal and Toronto professional soccer teams have competed against each other for over 40 years.\nFrom the original North American Soccer League, as well as the Canadian Soccer League and the A-League, the rivalry has continued through many different leagues they have played up until the past few years where both cities would still occasionally meet for the Canadian Championships. Since both teams have joined MLS, the rivalry is even more intense and the matches have become a Canadian soccer classic called the 401 Derby.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["football club"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":59},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":68},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":89},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":99},{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"Major League Soccer","offset":150},{"uri":"2012","surface_form":"2012","offset":182},{"uri":"2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":212},{"uri":"Montreal_Impact_F.C.","surface_form":"Montreal Impact","offset":321},{"uri":"North_American_Soccer_League","surface_form":"North American Soccer League","offset":344},{"uri":"Motto","surface_form":"motto","offset":418},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":455},{"uri":"Saputo_Stadium","surface_form":"Saputo Stadium","offset":521},{"uri":"Mauro_Biello","surface_form":"Mauro Biello","offset":554},{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"MLS","offset":626},{"uri":"Vancouver_Whitecaps_FC","surface_form":"Vancouver Whitecaps","offset":670},{"uri":"Canadian_Championship","surface_form":"Canadian Championship","offset":710},{"uri":"2013","surface_form":"2013","offset":740},{"uri":"2014","surface_form":"2014","offset":749},{"uri":"Toronto_F.C.","surface_form":"Toronto F.C.","offset":801},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":854},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":866},{"uri":"North_American_Soccer_League","surface_form":"North American Soccer League","offset":1027},{"uri":"Canadian_Soccer_League","surface_form":"Canadian Soccer League","offset":1072},{"uri":"Canadian_Championship","surface_form":"Canadian Championship","offset":1271}]}
