{"id":332856,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramel","text":") is a beige to dark-brown sweet food. It is made by heating sugars. It is used to add flavour to puddings and desserts. It can also be as a filling, like is done in bonbons, and as a topping for ice cream, custard and coffee.\nSimple sugar (Sucrose) starts to melt at about, without changing its color. The process called caramelisation starts when sugar is heated to at least, and more often to around. As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and turn into compounds with the colour and flavour of caramel.\nMany candies and desserts are made with caramel. Some of these are caramel apples, pralines, nougats, brittles, \"cr\u00E8me caramel\", and \"cr\u00E8me br\u00FBl\u00E9e\".\nCaramel candy.\nCaramel candy is a soft, dense, chewy candy. It is made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), butter, and vanilla flavouring. The sugar(s) are heated separately to reach. This turns them to caramel before the other ingredients are added. Another way of doing this is to cook all ingredients together. This way, the milk turns to caramel but the sugars do not. This type of candy is often called \"milk caramel\" or \"cream caramel\".\nCaramel coloring.\nCaramel coloring is a dark bitter-tasting liquid. It is what is made after near-total caramelisation. It is then bottled to be used for other things. It is used as food coloring and in beverages like cola.\nCaramel sauce.\nCaramel sauce is made from heating water and caster sugar at a low to medium temperature. This is done until the sugar dissolves and \"caramelises\". This changes its colour to golden brown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beige","surface_form":"beige","offset":7},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":61},{"uri":"Pudding","surface_form":"pudding","offset":98},{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":111},{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":196},{"uri":"Custard","surface_form":"custard","offset":207},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":219},{"uri":"Sucrose","surface_form":"Sucrose","offset":241},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":428},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compound","offset":463},{"uri":"Candy","surface_form":"candies","offset":518},{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":530},{"uri":"Caramel_apples","surface_form":"caramel apples","offset":580},{"uri":"Praline","surface_form":"praline","offset":596},{"uri":"Cr%C3%A8me_br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e","surface_form":"cr\u00E8me br\u00FBl\u00E9e","offset":647},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"dense","offset":702},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":757},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":765},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":772},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":782},{"uri":"Food_coloring","surface_form":"food coloring","offset":1300},{"uri":"Beverage","surface_form":"beverage","offset":1321},{"uri":"Cola","surface_form":"cola","offset":1336},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1392},{"uri":"Caster_sugar","surface_form":"caster sugar","offset":1402},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolves","offset":1476}]}
