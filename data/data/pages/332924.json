Scoring was common. The Outlaw defense had a pick in the 2nd quarter which led to another offensive touchdown and two score lead by halftime. The Rage fought back though, recovering an onside kick at the beginning of the 3rd quarter and driving the ball the length of the field for a touchdown. That would be the closest the game would get for the Rage. The Outlaws would put up just enough points to keep a comfortable lead throughout the fourth quarter and after recovering an onside kick in the last minute of the game, the Outlaws kneeled the ball and took home the crown with a score of 71-62 in a loud, sold out Rimrock Auto Arena.\n2010 United Bowl Championship.\nIn the 2010 IFL United Bowl, the Billings Outlaws of the Intense Conference took the league championship by beating Sioux Falls Storm of the United Conference 43-34 in front of a sold out crowd in the Billings Sportsplex (a training facility, used by the Outlaws after their arena suffered storm damage).\nOther information.\nThe IFL got more attention when former National Football League star wide receiver Terrell Owens joined the Allen Wranglers of the IFL for the 2012 season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["sports league"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indoor_American_football","surface_form":"indoor American football","offset":51},{"uri":"Intense_Football_League","surface_form":"Intense Football League","offset":129},{"uri":"United_Indoor_Football","surface_form":"United Indoor Football","offset":157},{"uri":"United_Bowl","surface_form":"United Bowl","offset":317},{"uri":"Intense_Football_League","surface_form":"Intense Football League","offset":433},{"uri":"United_Indoor_Football_League","surface_form":"United Indoor Football League","offset":461},{"uri":"Billings_Outlaws","surface_form":"Billings Outlaws","offset":587},{"uri":"River_City_Rage","surface_form":"River City Rage","offset":648},{"uri":"Onside_kick","surface_form":"onside kick","offset":850},{"uri":"Touchdown","surface_form":"touchdown","offset":949},{"uri":"Rimrock_Auto_Arena","surface_form":"Rimrock Auto Arena","offset":1283},{"uri":"Billings_Outlaws","surface_form":"Billings Outlaws","offset":1367},{"uri":"Sioux_Falls_Storm","surface_form":"Sioux Falls Storm","offset":1450},{"uri":"Billings_Sportsplex","surface_form":"Billings Sportsplex","offset":1535},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":1697},{"uri":"Wide_receiver","surface_form":"wide receiver","offset":1727},{"uri":"Terrell_Owens","surface_form":"Terrell Owens","offset":1741},{"uri":"Allen_Wranglers","surface_form":"Allen Wranglers","offset":1766}]}
