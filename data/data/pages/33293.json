{"id":33293,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill","text":"A landfill is a place where waste is kept. Waste is usually buried in landfills, but it may first be sorted to remove any recyclable materials.\nLandfills have a bad smell and look bad, therefore are usually located far away from where people live.\nOnce the waste is crushed into very small pieces, it is buried, but without oxygen, a dangerous gas called methane is created. This process is called anaerobic digestion. In some countries, the methane from landfills is used to generate energy.\nLarge landfills in the United States.\nRoosevelt Regional Landfill, Roosevelt, Washington.\nDenver Arapahoe Disposal Site, Aurora, Colorado.\nColumbia Ridge Landfill, Arlington, Oregon.\nPine Tree Acres, Lenox, Michigan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Waste","surface_form":"waste","offset":28},{"uri":"Burial","surface_form":"buried","offset":60},{"uri":"Recycling","surface_form":"recyclable","offset":122},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"smell","offset":165},{"uri":"Live","surface_form":"live","offset":242},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":355},{"uri":"Anaerobic_digestion","surface_form":"anaerobic digestion","offset":398},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":485},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":571},{"uri":"Aurora","surface_form":"Aurora","offset":614},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":622},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":668},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":700}]}
