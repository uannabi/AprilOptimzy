{"id":33295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum","text":"=\"preserve\">The rectum is a part of the large intestine which forms a part of the gastrointestinal system. The rectum ends in the anus which is the end of the gastrointestinal system. It is where feces or stools are stored temporarily before coming out of the anus.\nBody temperature can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a medical thermometer not more than 25\u00A0mm (1\u00A0inch) into the rectum via the anus. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38\u00A0\u00B0C (97.6 to 100.4\u00A0\u00B0F) and is about 0.5\u00A0\u00B0C (1\u00A0\u00B0F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1\u00A0\u00B0C (2\u00A0\u00B0F) above axilla (armpit) temperature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gastrointestinal_system","surface_form":"gastrointestinal system","offset":82},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":196},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":260},{"uri":"Body_temperature","surface_form":"Body temperature","offset":266},{"uri":"Medical_thermometer","surface_form":"medical thermometer","offset":363},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":436},{"uri":"Axillary","surface_form":"axilla","offset":607}]}
