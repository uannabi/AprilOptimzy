{"id":332974,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorland%27s_Medical_Dictionary","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Dorlands Illustrated Medical Dictionary\" is a medical dictionary edited by William Alexander Newman Dorland, and first printed in 1890. The word \"Dorland's\" is now the brand name for a family of more than 20 medical books available in various media (including printed books, CD-ROMs, and online content). The main books are \"Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary\" (now in its 32nd edition) and \"Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary\" (now in its 28th edition). \"Dorland's Medical Dictionary\" was first published in 1890 as the \"American Illustrated Medical Dictionary\", including 770 pages. The pocket edition, called the \"American Pocket Medical Dictionary\", was first published in 1898, with just over 500 pages.\nAfter Dorland died in 1956, the dictionaries were retitled to include his name, which was how they had generally come to be known. The illustrated dictionary has grown to 2208 pages for the 31st edition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":60},{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionary","offset":68},{"uri":"CD-ROM","surface_form":"CD-ROM","offset":289}]}
