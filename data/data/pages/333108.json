He was even the MVP of Super Bowl XL, in which Ward caught a touchdown from fellow wideout Antwaan Randle El. Ward is known for, not only his great receiving skills, but his hard blocks (some call them illegal, Ward was even voted the \"NFL's Dirtiest Player\") and signature toothy smile. In fourteen seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward also became their all-time leading receiver. Ward also served as a mentor to several younger Steelers wideouts, including Mike Wallace, Antonio Brown, and Santonio Holmes.\nWard's play became worse late in his career, and so he was released by the Steelers before retiring.\nPersonal.\nWard was born in Seoul, South Korea, but grew up in the Atlanta area.
