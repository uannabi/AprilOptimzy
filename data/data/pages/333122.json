{"id":333122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirin","text":"is a common ingredient (or stuff) in Japanese cooking.\nThe term \"Mirin\" is a general name that resembles a close taste for cooking purpose. But there are two types. One is a traditional type called \"\u672C\u307F\u308A\u3093\", which was developed a hundred years ago. It is produced almost all from rice, k\u014Dji and alcohol. During brewing process, about 14 % of alcohol is included, so that it protects mirin from going bad or spoiling. In fact sugar is not added to it. Mirin is a kind of rice wine similar to sake. Sweetness comes from its brewing process.\nThe other is a fake of \u672C\u307F\u308A\u3093, often called \"\u307F\u308A\u3093\u98A8\u8ABF\u5473\u6599\", which hardly contains alcohol and adds sugar and broth instead. It is 40%\u201350% sugar. Thus, new type is usually sold much cheaper in market. This kind of Mirin contain less alcohol.\nIn Kansai style cooking, mirin is boiled for a short time. This removes some of the alcohol. Kansai-style boiled mirin is called \"nikiri mirin\" (\u716E\u5207\u308A\u5473\u9182).But usually it is boiled enough to take alcohl away in cooking.\nMirin is used in teriyaki sauce, too.Mirin is popular and widely used for Japanese dishes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":37},{"uri":"K%C5%8Dji","surface_form":"k\u014Dji","offset":284},{"uri":"Rice_wine","surface_form":"rice wine","offset":468},{"uri":"Sake","surface_form":"sake","offset":489},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":762},{"uri":"Kansai","surface_form":"Kansai","offset":774},{"uri":"Teriyaki","surface_form":"teriyaki","offset":1004}]}
