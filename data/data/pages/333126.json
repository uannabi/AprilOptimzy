The organization includes psychiatric survivors and dissident psychiatrists who reject what they say is the \"domination\" by the biomedical model that defines contemporary psychiatry.\nOaks says that the psychiatric drugs that patients take have harmful side effects, and people can often recover without them.\nBiography.\nIn the 1970s, David Oaks was a student at Harvard University. He was diagnosed as having schizophrenia. He was hospitalized in an institution and forcibly treated with medications. He recovered, he says, by rejecting drugs and getting support from family and friends. Oaks says he \"maintains his mental health with exercise, diet, peer counseling and wilderness trips \u2014 strategies that are well outside the mainstream thinking of psychiatrists and many patients\".\nOaks is on the board of directors for the United States International Council on Disability.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":45},{"uri":"Eugene%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Eugene, Oregon","offset":136},{"uri":"MindFreedom_International","surface_form":"MindFreedom International","offset":157},{"uri":"Psychiatric_survivor","surface_form":"psychiatric survivor","offset":210},{"uri":"Psychiatrist","surface_form":"psychiatrist","offset":246},{"uri":"Psychiatry","surface_form":"psychiatry","offset":355},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":593}]}
