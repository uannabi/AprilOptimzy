{"id":333164,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbles_(game)","text":"Marbles is a game played with small, round glass balls called marbles.\nThe balls vary in size. Usually they are about 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.6\u00A0cm) in diameter, but they may range from less than 1/30 inch (0.111\u00A0cm) to over 3\u00A0inches (7.75\u00A0cm).\nAs the photographs show, the little glass balls can be most attractive, and they are often collected by children. In the North of England the objects and the game are sometimes called 'taws'.\nThe games has been played in many countries, but the rules are made up by the players, and there are many variations. One standard idea is to have a target marble. Players flick their marbles with their thumbnail, and try to hit the target. Another version is where players try to hit each other's marbles out of a target zone.\nMarbles were found in the ancient civilisations of Mohenjo-daro, Ancient Egypt and Rome.\nTinsley Green.\nMarbles has been played in Tinsley Green, West Sussex, England for many centuries: \"TIME\" magazine traces its origins to 1588.\nThe British and World Marbles Championship have been held at Tinsley Green every year since 1932. The first championship in 1932 was won by a team from the Black Horse public house in nearby Charlwood.\nTraditionally, the marbles-playing season started on Ash Wednesday and lasted until midday on Good Friday: it was thought playing after that brought bad luck. More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship each Good Friday. German teams have been successful several times since 2000. Often, local teams from Crawley, Copthorne and other Sussex and Surrey villages also take part.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marble_(toy)","surface_form":"marbles","offset":62},{"uri":"Collect","surface_form":"collected","offset":340},{"uri":"Thumb","surface_form":"thumb","offset":644},{"uri":"Mohenjo-daro","surface_form":"Mohenjo-daro","offset":820},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":834},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Rome","offset":852},{"uri":"Tinsley_Green","surface_form":"Tinsley Green","offset":900},{"uri":"West_Sussex","surface_form":"West Sussex","offset":915},{"uri":"Time_(magazine)","surface_form":"TIME","offset":957},{"uri":"Tinsley_Green","surface_form":"Tinsley Green","offset":1061},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"public house","offset":1168},{"uri":"Charlwood","surface_form":"Charlwood","offset":1191},{"uri":"Ash_Wednesday","surface_form":"Ash Wednesday","offset":1255},{"uri":"Good_Friday","surface_form":"Good Friday","offset":1296},{"uri":"Crawley","surface_form":"Crawley","offset":1534},{"uri":"Copthorne","surface_form":"Copthorne","offset":1543},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":1574}]}
