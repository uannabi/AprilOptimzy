{"id":333529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_queen","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bean queen (sometimes rice and bean queen) is a derogatory slang term. The term refers to a white gay man who is chiefly attracted to Hispanic and Latino men.\nOne source describes these white gay males as \"Gay men who are attracted to gentlemen of the Latino flava.\" \"Bean queen\" is probably derived from \"rice queen\". This term refers to a gay white male who is attracted to Asian men. In this case, the word rice (the food that forms the basis of the Asian diet) has been substituted with the word bean or rice and bean, foods popular throughout Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Other food-based variations include \"taco queen\" and \"salsa queen\". \"Refried beans\" refers to Hispanic and Latino men who prefer other Hispanic and Latino men. Much less frequently, these terms are used to describe gay Latino men themselves. The term is also used in a derogatory manner when referring to a drag queen of Hispanic or Latino background.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Derogatory","surface_form":"derogatory","offset":61},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":72},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white","offset":105},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":111},{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":147},{"uri":"Latino","surface_form":"Latino","offset":160},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":423},{"uri":"Bean","surface_form":"bean","offset":513},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":561},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":578},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":600},{"uri":"Taco","surface_form":"taco","offset":648},{"uri":"Salsa","surface_form":"salsa","offset":665},{"uri":"Drag_queen","surface_form":"drag queen","offset":918}]}
