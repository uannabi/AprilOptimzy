{"id":333695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bridge_(Tasmania)","text":"The Red Bridge in Tasmania crosses the Elizabeth River at Campbell Town. It was built between 1836 and 1838 by convicts using red clay bricks made on site. It has a solid stone base with sandstone piers and cappings. It is the oldest brick arch bridge in Australia, as well as the oldest bridge anywhere on an Australian National Highway. The bridge has three arches with spans of each. It is wide enough for two lanes of traffic as well as pedestrian walkways. It is on the Midland Highway, about halfway between Hobart and Launceston, and carries over two million vehicles per year.\nIt is said to have been designed by James Blackburn, an architect and a convict who had been sent to Tasmania for the crime of forgery. It was made from 1,250,000 hand-made bricks on dry land. After it was finished the course of the river was changed to flow under the bridge.\nThe Red Bridge is registered on the Register of the National Estate since 1978.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":18},{"uri":"Elizabeth_River_(Tasmania)","surface_form":"Elizabeth River","offset":39},{"uri":"Campbell_Town%2C_Tasmania","surface_form":"Campbell Town","offset":58},{"uri":"Convict","surface_form":"convict","offset":111},{"uri":"Brick","surface_form":"brick","offset":234},{"uri":"Arch_bridge","surface_form":"arch bridge","offset":240},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":255},{"uri":"National_Highway_(Australia)","surface_form":"National Highway","offset":321},{"uri":"Midland_Highway_(Tasmania)","surface_form":"Midland Highway","offset":475},{"uri":"Hobart","surface_form":"Hobart","offset":514},{"uri":"Launceston%2C_Tasmania","surface_form":"Launceston","offset":525},{"uri":"James_Blackburn_(architect)","surface_form":"James Blackburn","offset":621},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":641},{"uri":"Forgery","surface_form":"forgery","offset":712},{"uri":"Register_of_the_National_Estate","surface_form":"Register of the National Estate","offset":898}]}
