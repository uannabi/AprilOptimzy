{"id":333707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge","text":"A cable-stayed bridge is a bridge that has one or more columns (called \"towers\" or \"pylons\"), with cables directly supporting the bridge deck.\nThere are two main types of cable-stayed bridges. In the \"harp\" design, the cables are nearly parallel. This is done by attaching them to various points on the tower(s). The height of attachment of each cable on the tower is similar to the distance from the tower along the roadway to its lower attachment. In a \"fan\" design, the cables all connect to or pass over the top of the tower(s).\nCompared to other bridge types, the cable-stayed is best for longer spans than used for cantilever bridges, and shorter than those needing a suspension bridge. Cantilever spans become too heavy if they were made longer. A cable-stay bridge is cheaper to build than a suspension bridge over a short distance.\nDisadvantages of a Cable Stayed Bridge\nAdvantages of a Cable Stayed Bridge","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":27},{"uri":"Column","surface_form":"column","offset":55},{"uri":"Cable","surface_form":"cable","offset":99},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel","offset":237},{"uri":"Cantilever_bridge","surface_form":"cantilever bridge","offset":621},{"uri":"Suspension_bridge","surface_form":"suspension bridge","offset":674}]}
