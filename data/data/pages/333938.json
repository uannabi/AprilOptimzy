{"id":333938,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Honduras","text":"The Gulf or Bay of Honduras is a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. It indents the coasts of Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. From north to south, it runs for approximately 200\u00A0km from Dangriga, Belize, to La Ceiba, Honduras.\nThe inner Gulf of Honduras is lined by the Belize Barrier Reef. It forms the southern part of the 900\u00A0km long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. This is the second-largest coral reef system in the world. The Belize Barrier Reef has a number of small islands. They are called cays, and collectively known as the Pelican Cays.\nThe Gulf of Honduras contains complex dynamics of coastal and open waters, and ocean currents. These have produced a very diverse and unique ecosystem with a wide variety of coastal marine waters. It includes coastline estuaries, barrier beaches, lagoons, intertidal salt marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, keys and barrier reefs.\nThe gulf receives the runoff from the watersheds of 12 rivers. They discharge at 1232 m\u00B3 s-1. These rivers include the Moho, Sarst\u00FAn, R\u00EDo Dulce, Motagua, and Ul\u00FAa. Volume of sediment from these rivers is increasing. This damages the marine ecosystem.\nMany American anglers visit the Gulf of Honduras to catch the marlin that abound there. Tourists are often taken on boat trips to the Pelican Cays, notably Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye.\nIn 1961 Hurricane Hattie swept across the Gulf of Honduras. It destroyed buildings in Belize.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":52},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":92},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":100},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":115},{"uri":"Dangriga","surface_form":"Dangriga","offset":184},{"uri":"La_Ceiba","surface_form":"La Ceiba","offset":205},{"uri":"Belize_Barrier_Reef","surface_form":"Belize Barrier Reef","offset":268},{"uri":"Mesoamerican_Barrier_Reef_System","surface_form":"Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System","offset":335},{"uri":"Cay","surface_form":"cay","offset":499},{"uri":"Pelican_Cays","surface_form":"Pelican Cays","offset":535},{"uri":"Estuaries","surface_form":"estuaries","offset":768},{"uri":"Barrier_beach","surface_form":"barrier beach","offset":779},{"uri":"Lagoon","surface_form":"lagoon","offset":796},{"uri":"Intertidal_salt_marsh","surface_form":"intertidal salt marsh","offset":805},{"uri":"Mangrove_forest","surface_form":"mangrove forest","offset":830},{"uri":"Seagrass","surface_form":"seagrass","offset":848},{"uri":"Barrier_reefs","surface_form":"barrier reefs","offset":872},{"uri":"Cubic_metre_per_second","surface_form":"m\u00B3 s-1","offset":973},{"uri":"Moho_River","surface_form":"Moho","offset":1006},{"uri":"Sarstoon_River","surface_form":"Sarst\u00FAn","offset":1012},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_Dulce","surface_form":"R\u00EDo Dulce","offset":1021},{"uri":"Motagua_River","surface_form":"Motagua","offset":1032},{"uri":"Ul%C3%BAa_River","surface_form":"Ul\u00FAa","offset":1045},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":1061},{"uri":"Marine_ecosystem","surface_form":"marine ecosystem","offset":1120},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1143},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"anglers","offset":1152},{"uri":"Marlin","surface_form":"marlin","offset":1200},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"Tourists","offset":1226},{"uri":"Caye_Caulker","surface_form":"Caye Caulker","offset":1294},{"uri":"Ambergris_Caye","surface_form":"Ambergris Caye","offset":1311},{"uri":"Hurricane_Hattie","surface_form":"Hurricane Hattie","offset":1335}]}
