The >5000 metres deep Cayman Trench separates them.\nThe islands have no people in them, except for a small Honduran navy garrison. Great Swan has a 3800\u2032 (1158 m) grass airstrip (ICAO code MHIC, IATA code SWA).\nHistorical background.\nBoth the United States and Honduras claimed the Swan Islands until the United States dropped its claim. This was under the Guano Islands Act in 1972. The islands gained attention in the early 1960s. This was because of Radio Swan, which began broadcasting in May 1960 during preparation for, and during, the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The station was removed from the islands in the late 1960s. Its main transmitter was transferred for use in the Vietnam War.\nIn October 1998, Hurricane Mitch moved over Swan Island with winds of 180\u00A0mph.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":98},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":162},{"uri":"Rosario_Bank","surface_form":"Rosario Bank","offset":230},{"uri":"Misteriosa_Bank","surface_form":"Misteriosa Bank","offset":247},{"uri":"Cayman_Trench","surface_form":"Cayman Trench","offset":330},{"uri":"ICAO","surface_form":"ICAO","offset":487},{"uri":"IATA","surface_form":"IATA","offset":503},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":551},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":569},{"uri":"Guano_Islands_Act","surface_form":"Guano Islands Act","offset":665},{"uri":"Radio_Swan_(Honduras)","surface_form":"Radio Swan","offset":761},{"uri":"Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion","surface_form":"Bay of Pigs Invasion","offset":850},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":874},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":992},{"uri":"Hurricane_Mitch","surface_form":"Hurricane Mitch","offset":1022}]}
