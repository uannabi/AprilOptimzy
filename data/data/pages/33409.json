{"id":33409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence","text":"In geometry, two figures or objects formula_1 and formula_1 are congruent (written as formula_1) if they have the same shape and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other.\nMore formally, two sets of points are called congruent, if and only if one can be transformed into the other by isometry. For isometry, \"rigid motions\" are used.\nThis means that two geometrical figures are congruent if one object can be repositioned, rotated or reflected\u2014but not resized\u2014so that it coincides exactly with the other object. if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is, then the two figures are congruent. If one of the object has to change its size, then the two objects are not congruent: they are just called similar.\nAs an example, two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely (turning the paper over here is permitted).\nCongruent polygons are polygons that if you fold a regular polygon in half that is a congruent polygon.\nHow to obtain new congruent shapes.\nThe famous three properties, \"reflexivity\", \"symmetry\" and \"transitivity\", together make the notion of \"equivalence\". Hence, the property congruence is one sort of \"equivalence\" relation between shapes of a plane.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":119},{"uri":"Mirror_image","surface_form":"mirror image","offset":180},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"points","offset":234},{"uri":"Isometry","surface_form":"isometry","offset":319},{"uri":"Similarity","surface_form":"similar","offset":768},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":964},{"uri":"Equivalence_relation","surface_form":"\"equivalence\" relation","offset":1258}]}
