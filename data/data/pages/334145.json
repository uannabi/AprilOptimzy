It\u2019s great to be able to work with him like that.\"\nOn March 23, 2007, it was announced he would pen \"Interstellar\", a science fiction film. It is based on the theories of Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist who is known for his theories in gravitation physics and astrophysics and for having trained a generation of scientists. The film was first reported to be directed by Steven Spielberg and eventually settled with Christopher Nolan as director and is released in 2014.\nNolan is currently working with his brother for \"The Dark Knight Rises\". It is the third Batman movie.\nOn February 10, 2011, Nolan's TV pilot \"Person of Interest\" had been picked up by CBS and plan was to make it in a TV show.
