{"id":334157,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner_nationalism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Afrikaner nationalism is a political ideology which was created in the 19th century in South Africa. There is an ethnic group called Afrikaner in South Africa. Afrikaner nationalism is the idea that the Afrikaner are \"chosen people\". It says that Afrikaners who speak their language should unite to fight off foreign influences that come from English-speaking settlers of South Africa, black people or Jews.\nThe historian T. Dunbar Moodie describes Afrikaner nationalism as a kind of civil religion that combined the history of the Afrikaners, their language and the Afrikaner Calvinism as key symbols. A major proponent of the ideology was the secret \"Broederbond\" organization and the National Party that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994. Other organisations aligned with the Afrikaner nationalistic ideology were the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations (\"Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge \", FAK), the Institute for Christian National Education and the White Workers' Protection Association.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideology","offset":50},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":100},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":126},{"uri":"Afrikaner","surface_form":"Afrikaner","offset":146},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":415},{"uri":"Civil_religion","surface_form":"civil religion","offset":497},{"uri":"Afrikaner_Calvinism","surface_form":"Afrikaner Calvinism","offset":580},{"uri":"Broederbond","surface_form":"Broederbond","offset":666},{"uri":"National_Party_(South_Africa)","surface_form":"National Party","offset":700}]}
