It was designed by Gabriel Davioud. It was built between 1860 and 1862. It was named the \"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre Imp\u00E9rial du Ch\u00E2telet\". It was built on a site where a ch\u00E2telet (small castle) once stood. The theatre has undergone remodeling and name changes over the years. The theatre sits on the Place du Ch\u00E2telet facing the Th\u00E9\u00E2tre de la Ville. At the centre of the plaza is a fountain is a sphinx fountain, erected in 1808, which celebrates Napoleon's victory in Egypt.\nThe Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2telet was originally used for drama performances. In April 1876, the stage version of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" began a run spanning sixty-four years and 2195 performances. The theatre was used for operettas, variety and ballet performances, and for concerts. It was also, for a time, a movie theatre. \"Petrouchka\" premiered in the theatre on 13 June 1911, and \"Parade\" on 18 May 1917. Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and Richard Strauss made appearances here.\nThe theatre has been operated by the City of Paris since 1979. It has undergone a major restoration. It re-opened under the name of the \"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre Musical de Paris\" in 1980. It was acoustically re-modeled again in 1989. It returned to the \"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2telet\" name. In 1995, the theatre received additional improvements in acoustics and sightlines. Today, the theatre is mainly used for opera performances and concerts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":32},{"uri":"Opera_house","surface_form":"opera house","offset":44},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":59},{"uri":"Place_du_Ch%C3%A2telet","surface_form":"Place du Ch\u00E2telet","offset":369},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_de_la_Ville","surface_form":"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre de la Ville","offset":398},{"uri":"Sphinx","surface_form":"sphinx","offset":465},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":516},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":538},{"uri":"Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days","surface_form":"Around the World in Eighty Days","offset":650},{"uri":"Operetta","surface_form":"operetta","offset":769},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":792},{"uri":"Petrouchka","surface_form":"Petrouchka","offset":874},{"uri":"Parade_(ballet)","surface_form":"Parade","offset":933},{"uri":"Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Tchaikovsky","offset":957},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Mahler","offset":970},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":982}]}
