{"id":334394,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasty_Party","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term Nasty Party was first used by Theresa May where in October 2002 she described the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom as \"There's a lot we need to do in this party of ours. Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us -- the Nasty Party.\"\nThe term \"Nasty Party\" applied to Conservative Party members with traditional conservative stances which included being anti-gay, anti-minorities, and pro-business, and lacking concern for the poor.\nMany conservatives felt this one the reasons the Conservative Party lost the last three general elections and needed to broaden their traditional base to have a chance of reelection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theresa_May","surface_form":"Theresa May","offset":52},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative Party","offset":104}]}
