{"id":334556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony","text":"=\"preserve\">There are many different breeds of ponies. A baby horse or pony is called a foal. These horses are raised around farms like other horses. Ponies are usually more chubby than horses and ponies have shorter legs. Miniature horses are not ponies they are actually mini horses because they have the features of a horse (i.e. longer legs and they are not as chubby as ponies). Shetland ponies are around the same height as miniature horse maybe a bit bigger a times but they ARE ponies not miniature horses.\nPony is also a Ginuwine song that was released in 1996.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breeds","surface_form":"breeds","offset":37},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":125},{"uri":"Shetland_ponies","surface_form":"Shetland ponies","offset":384}]}
