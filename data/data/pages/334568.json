{"id":334568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolo-palatal_consonant","text":"In phonetics, alveolo-palatal (or alveopalatal) consonants are palatalized postalveolar sounds. They are usually fricatives and affricates. We pronounce them with the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, and the body of the tongue raised toward the palate. These consonants are similar to palato-alveolar consonants, but alveolo-palatal consonants are more fully palatalized.\nStops, nasals and liquids.\nThe sinological circles sometimes use (), (), and () for alveolo-palatal plosives, nasals and liquids. But the IPA does not accept these symbols. We sometimes use these symbol to represent simple palatal or platalized consonants.\nWe consider the Polish nasal (represented with the letter \"\u0144\") to be alveolo-palatal, but not palatal. And the \"palatal\" consonants of several Indigenous Australian languages are also sometimes judged closer to alveolo-palatal in their articulation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phonetics","surface_form":"phonetics","offset":3},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":48},{"uri":"Palatalization","surface_form":"palatalized","offset":63},{"uri":"Postalveolar_consonant","surface_form":"postalveolar","offset":75},{"uri":"Fricative","surface_form":"fricative","offset":113},{"uri":"Affricate","surface_form":"affricate","offset":128},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":180},{"uri":"Alveolar_ridge","surface_form":"alveolar ridge","offset":198},{"uri":"Palate","surface_form":"palate","offset":259},{"uri":"Palato-alveolar_consonant","surface_form":"palato-alveolar consonant","offset":299},{"uri":"Sinology","surface_form":"sinological","offset":417},{"uri":"Nasal_stop","surface_form":"nasals","offset":496},{"uri":"Liquid_consonants","surface_form":"liquids","offset":507},{"uri":"Palatal_consonants","surface_form":"palatal","offset":609},{"uri":"Palatalization","surface_form":"platalized","offset":620},{"uri":"%C5%84","surface_form":"\u0144","offset":702},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australian_languages","surface_form":"Indigenous Australian languages","offset":786}]}
