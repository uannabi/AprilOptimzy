{"id":33462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_(singer)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A singer who is a bass is a man with a low singing voice. Some basses may be able to sing down to C two octaves below middle C. Even low A is sometimes needed in Russian church music.\nIn opera, basses often have the part of the villain, or the king, or a priest. A buffo-bass is a character role in which the bass singer needs a wide range for the comedy of the part. The part of Leporello in Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" needs a buffo bass. The lowest kind of bass is called a basso-profondo. An example is the priest Sarastro in Mozart's \"Magic Flute\".\nFeodor Chaliapin (1873-1938) was a famous Russian bass.\nSouthern gospel singer J.D. Sumner held the world record for lowest bass singer for a number of years, from 1988 until he was beaten by Tim Storms in 2016\nA baritone is a voice between tenor and bass in range, but some low baritones describe themselves as bass-baritones. Wotan in \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" is a bass-baritone part. Bryn Terfel is a famous Welsh bass-baritone.\nJohnny Cash is well-known for his bass-baritone voice","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russian_church_music","surface_form":"Russian church music","offset":175},{"uri":"Character_role","surface_form":"character role","offset":294},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart's","offset":406},{"uri":"Don_Giovanni","surface_form":"Don Giovanni","offset":416},{"uri":"Magic_Flute","surface_form":"Magic Flute","offset":549},{"uri":"J.D._Sumner","surface_form":"J.D.
