{"id":33485,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages","text":"The Indo-European languages are the world's largest language family.\nLinguists believe they all came from a single language, Proto-Indo-European, which was originally spoken somewhere in Eurasia. They are now spoken all over the world.\nThe Indo-European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects, including most major languages in Europe, the Iranian plateau, and South Asia.\nHistorically, this language family was also important in Anatolia and Central Asia.\nThe earliest Indo-European writing is from the Bronze Age in Anatolian and Mycenaean Greek. The origin of Indo-European is after the invention of farming since some Proto-Indo-European words are farming words.\nAlthough it may have fewer different languages than some other language families, it has the most native speakers, about 2.7 billion.\nOf the 20 languages with the most speakers, 12 are Indo-European: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, German, Sindhi, Punjabi, Marathi, French, and Urdu.\nFour of the six official languages of the United Nations are Indo-European: English, Spanish, French, and Russian.\nMain language groups.\nMost Indo-European languages use the Latin script, but others use the Devanagari, Cyrillic, or Arabic scripts.\nHistory of Indo-European linguistics.\nSuggestions of similarities between Indian and European languages began to be made by European visitors to India in the 16th century. In 1583, Thomas Stephens S.J. an English Jesuit missionary in Goa, India, noticed similarities between Indian languages and Greek and Latin and included them included in a letter to his brother, but it was not published until the 20th century.\nThe first account to mention Sanskrit is from Filippo Sassetti. Born in Florence, Italy, in 1540, he was a merchant who was among the first Europeans to study the Sanskrit. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian such as \"deva\u1E25\"/\"dio\" \"God\", \"sarpa\u1E25\"/\"serpe\" \"serpent\", \"sapta\"/\"sette\" \"seven\", \"a\u1E63\u1E6Da\"/\"otto\" \"eight\", \"nava\"/\"nove\" \"nine\"). However, neither observation led to further scholarly inquiry.\nIn 1647, Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among Indo-European languages and supposed that they derived from a primitive common language. He included in his hypothesis Dutch, Greek, Latin, Persian, and German and later added Slavic, Celtic and Baltic languages. However, his suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.\nGaston Coeurdoux and others had made similar observations. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek conjugation<nowiki/>s in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship between the languages. Similarly, Mikhail Lomonosov compared different languages groups of the world, including Slavic, Baltic, Iranian, Finnish, Chinese, Hottentot and others.\nThe hypothesis reappeared in 1786, 20 years after Coeurdoux, when Sir William Jones lectured on the striking similarities between three of the oldest languages known in his time: Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. He later tentatively added Gothic, Celtic, and Old Persian but made some errors and omissions in his classification.\nIn 1813, Thomas Young was first to use the term \"Indo-European\". It became the standard scientific term except in Germany through Franz Bopp's \"Comparative Grammar\". Appearing between 1833 and 1852, it was the starting point of Indo-European studies as an academic discipline.\nSome 20th-century scholars thought Indo-European languages started in Armenia or India, but most think that it was in Eastern Europe or Anatolia. Recent studies support an origin in northern Iran and Armenia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"Linguist","offset":69},{"uri":"Proto-Indo-European_language","surface_form":"Proto-Indo-European","offset":125},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":187},{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"family","offset":270},{"uri":"List_of_Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"languages and dialects","offset":304},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":362},{"uri":"Iranian_plateau","surface_form":"Iranian plateau","offset":374},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":395},{"uri":"Anatolia","surface_form":"Anatolia","offset":464},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":477},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":538},{"uri":"Anatolia","surface_form":"Anatolia","offset":552},{"uri":"Mycenaean","surface_form":"Mycenaean","offset":566},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":576},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":637},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":901},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":910},{"uri":"Hindi","surface_form":"Hindi","offset":919},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":926},{"uri":"Bengali_language","surface_form":"Bengali","offset":938},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":947},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":956},{"uri":"Sindhi_language","surface_form":"Sindhi","offset":964},{"uri":"Punjabi_language","surface_form":"Punjabi","offset":972},{"uri":"Marathi_language","surface_form":"Marathi","offset":981},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":990},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":1002},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1050},{"uri":"Latin_script","surface_form":"Latin script","offset":1182},{"uri":"Devanagari","surface_form":"Devanagari","offset":1215},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic","offset":1227},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1240},{"uri":"Jesuit","surface_form":"Jesuit","offset":1469},{"uri":"Goa","surface_form":"Goa","offset":1490},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1495},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":1744},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1754},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":2123},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":2323},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":2330},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":2337},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":2344},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":2357},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":2380},{"uri":"Celtic_languages","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":2388},{"uri":"Baltic_languages","surface_form":"Baltic languages","offset":2399},{"uri":"Conjugation","surface_form":"conjugation","offset":2635},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":3057},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":3064},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":3075},{"uri":"Gothic_language","surface_form":"Gothic","offset":3112},{"uri":"Celtic_languages","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":3120},{"uri":"Old_Persian_language","surface_form":"Old Persian","offset":3132},{"uri":"Thomas_Young","surface_form":"Thomas Young","offset":3211},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":3549},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":3597}]}
