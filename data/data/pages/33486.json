{"id":33486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico","text":"The Gulf of Mexico is a round sea, called a gulf. Land in North America is around much of it. The United States of America, Mexico, and Cuba are the countries around it. The Straits of Florida connect to the Atlantic Ocean, and the Yucat\u00E1n Channel connects to the Caribbean Sea.\nPetroleum is found near the north and west coast of this gulf. Many hurricanes hit this area, for example, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hurt many of the oil wells in 2005 in the United States. There is also a big fishing industry in the gulf.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":30},{"uri":"Gulf","surface_form":"gulf","offset":44},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":58},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":98},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":124},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":136},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":149},{"uri":"Straits_of_Florida","surface_form":"Straits of Florida","offset":174},{"uri":"Connection","surface_form":"connect","offset":193},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":208},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Channel","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Channel","offset":232},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":264},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"Petroleum","offset":279},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":322},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"hurricanes","offset":347},{"uri":"Hurricane_Katrina","surface_form":"Hurricane Katrina","offset":386},{"uri":"Hurricane_Rita","surface_form":"Hurricane Rita","offset":408},{"uri":"Oil_well","surface_form":"oil well","offset":440},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":453},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":500}]}
