{"id":3351,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River","text":"The Missouri River is a river in the western United States. It is a tributary of the Mississippi River. It is longer than the Mississippi River. It is, in fact, the longest river in North America.\nGeography.\nFor most of its course, the Missouri flows across the Great Plains, one of the driest parts of North America.\nThe source of the Missouri River is in the Rocky Mountains, in the state of Montana. The Missouri flows eastward, across Montana, south of the border with Canada. It enters the state of North Dakota and then it turns south. It flows through South Dakota. Then it flows past Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas.\nNear the city of Kansas City, Missouri, the Missouri turns eastward into the state of Missouri. It flows eastward across the state of Missouri. It joins the Mississippi just north of the city of Saint Louis, Missouri.\nThe Missouri has many important tributaries, including the Yellowstone River, the Platte River, and the Kansas River.\nHistory.\nThe Missouri was very important for the Native Americans who lived on the Great Plains. It was also very important in the history of the United States. The Missouri was used as the route of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804-1806. In the 19th century, the Missouri was very important in the North American fur trade and for transportation of army troops and supplies as well as general transportation and trade as the West was settled.\nNicknames.\nThe nickname of the Missouri is \"Big Muddy\", because it has a lot of silt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":24},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":45},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":68},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":85},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":182},{"uri":"Great_Plains","surface_form":"Great Plains","offset":262},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":303},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":361},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":394},{"uri":"North_Dakota","surface_form":"North Dakota","offset":504},{"uri":"South_Dakota","surface_form":"South Dakota","offset":559},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":592},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":598},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":608},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":622},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City, Missouri","offset":647},{"uri":"Saint_Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Saint Louis, Missouri","offset":825},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":880},{"uri":"Yellowstone_River","surface_form":"Yellowstone River","offset":907},{"uri":"Platte_River","surface_form":"Platte River","offset":930},{"uri":"Kansas_River","surface_form":"Kansas River","offset":952},{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":1015},{"uri":"Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition","surface_form":"Lewis and Clark Expedition","offset":1169},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1217},{"uri":"Fur_trade","surface_form":"North American fur trade","offset":1270},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":1321},{"uri":"Silt","surface_form":"silt","offset":1495}]}
