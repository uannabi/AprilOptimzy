It can also be used as a preservative, it has the E number 284. Boric acid is a by-product of the production of certain forms of glass, porcelain and vitreous enamel. It is also used as a Flame retardant. Dissolved in water, it acts as a neutron absorber in nuclear power plants.\nBoric acid is toxic. Damage is done from absorbing or ingesting about 50\u00A0mg, per kg of body weight.\nBoric acid is one of the chemicals on the REACH list of the European Union. In 2010, the European Chemicals Agency listed it as a Substance of very high concern. Boric acid causes birth defects; it is a teratogen. This is also true for mixtures that contain boric acid in a concentration of at least 5.5%.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":17},{"uri":"Boron","surface_form":"Boron","offset":25},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":36},{"uri":"Borate","surface_form":"Borate","offset":53},{"uri":"Disinfectant","surface_form":"disinfectant","offset":86},{"uri":"Preservative","surface_form":"preservative","offset":125},{"uri":"E_number","surface_form":"E number","offset":150},{"uri":"By-product","surface_form":"by-product","offset":180},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":229},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":236},{"uri":"Vitreous_enamel","surface_form":"vitreous enamel","offset":250},{"uri":"Flame_retardant","surface_form":"Flame retardant","offset":288},{"uri":"Neutron_absorber","surface_form":"neutron absorber","offset":338},{"uri":"Nuclear_power_plant","surface_form":"nuclear power plant","offset":358},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":394},{"uri":"Registration%2C_Evaluation%2C_Authorisation_and_Restriction_of_Chemicals","surface_form":"REACH","offset":522},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":540},{"uri":"European_Chemicals_Agency","surface_form":"European Chemicals Agency","offset":569},{"uri":"Substance_of_very_high_concern","surface_form":"Substance of very high concern","offset":610},{"uri":"Birth_defect","surface_form":"birth defect","offset":660},{"uri":"Teratogen","surface_form":"teratogen","offset":683}]}
