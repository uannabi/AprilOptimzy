{"id":33552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet","text":"Ballet is a type of dance. It is only done by dancers who have had special training. The dancers are employed by a dance company, and they perform in theatres. The first reference to ballet is found in a work of Domenico da Piacenza, who lived in the early 14th century. The ballet's first complete United States performance was on 24 December 1944, by the San Francisco Ballet.\nBallet involves the creation of the dance itself, often a type of imaginary story.The story is told with the help of dance and mime. Ballet is a form of expression. It presents a story in a new form to the audience. The creation of dance is called choreography set by professional dancers. The choreography is learnt by the dancers under the supervision of a trainer, called a ballet master or mistress. Ballet is always performed to music, and in many cases the music was specially composed for a particular ballet. Ballet is a major part of theatre, and a popular example is \"The Nutcracker which was fist performed on the 24th of December by the San Francisco ballet company.\"\nEarly stages.\nBallet grew out of Renaissance spectacles which, rather like big pop music events today, used every type of performance art. These Italian ballets were further developed in France. \"Le Ballet Comique de la Reine\" (The Queen's Ballet Comedy) was performed in Paris in 1581. It was staged by Balthazar de Beaujoyeux, a violinist and dancing master at the court of Catherine de Medici. It was danced by amateurs in a hall. The royal family were watching at one end and the others in galleries on three sides. Poetry and songs came with the dances.\nThe basis of classical ballet was formed in the Court of Louis XIV in France, in the 17th century.p40 Even his title (the 'Sun King') came from a role he danced in a ballet. Louis founded the first ballet company, the Ballet de l'Opera de Paris. Many of the ballets presented at his court were created by the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully and the choreographer Pierre Beauchamp. Also during this time, the playwright Moli\u00E8re invented the comedie-ballet.\nModern technique begins.\nIn the early 19th century ballet technique was codified (sorted out and written down) by Carlo Blasis (1797\u20131878) of Naples. His dance classes, four hours long, were famous for being the toughest training there was at that time. 'Romantic ballet' flourished in France in the first half of the 19th century.\nBallet with a more athletic style was developed in Imperial Russia of the late 19th century. This company performed in the Mariinsky Theatre at St. Petersburg. The three famous Tchaikovsky ballets, \"Swan Lake\", \"The Sleeping Beauty\", and \"The Nutcracker\", date from that time. The next stage was the Diaghilev ballet. Diageilev was a great impresario (showman). In 1909 he founded Les Ballets Russes de Sergei Diaghilev, considered by many to be the greatest ballet company of all time.\nHis dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial primaballerina Karsavina; also Pavlova, Danilova and Spessivtseva. His choreographers included Fokine, Massine and Balanchine; his composers included Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Ravel and Debussy; his set designers included Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Utrillo, Bakst and Braque; and the ballets created changed the course of ballet history.\nLater in the 20th century, permanent ballet companies were set up in English-speaking countries. The Royal Ballet in London was started, and in New York a company called the \"Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo\" was founded (1938\u20131962).\nTechnique.\nTechnique is the physical ability to perform whatever steps a dance may need. Specific methods for refining technique are named after the ballet master or mistress who started them, such as the Vaganova method after Agrippina Vaganova, the Balanchine method after George Balanchine, and the Cecchetti method after Enrico Cecchetti.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":20},{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"training","offset":75},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":150},{"uri":"Domenico_da_Piacenza","surface_form":"Domenico da Piacenza","offset":212},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th century","offset":257},{"uri":"Mime","surface_form":"mime","offset":506},{"uri":"Choreography","surface_form":"choreography set by professional dancers","offset":627},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":813},{"uri":"The_Nutcracker","surface_form":"The Nutcracker","offset":957},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":1092},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1246},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1331},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":1390},{"uri":"Catherine_de_Medici","surface_form":"Catherine de Medici","offset":1435},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":1473},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":1675},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1688},{"uri":"Ballet_de_l%27Opera_de_Paris","surface_form":"Ballet de l'Opera de Paris","offset":1836},{"uri":"Jean-Baptiste_Lully","surface_form":"Jean-Baptiste Lully","offset":1936},{"uri":"Pierre_Beauchamp","surface_form":"Pierre Beauchamp","offset":1978},{"uri":"Moli%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Moli\u00E8re","offset":2034},{"uri":"Carlo_Blasis","surface_form":"Carlo Blasis","offset":2185},{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":2213},{"uri":"Imperial_Russia","surface_form":"Imperial Russia","offset":2454},{"uri":"Mariinsky_Theatre","surface_form":"Mariinsky Theatre","offset":2526},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":2547},{"uri":"Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Tchaikovsky","offset":2580},{"uri":"Swan_Lake","surface_form":"Swan Lake","offset":2602},{"uri":"Sleeping_Beauty","surface_form":"Sleeping Beauty","offset":2619},{"uri":"The_Nutcracker","surface_form":"The Nutcracker","offset":2642},{"uri":"Diaghilev","surface_form":"Diaghilev","offset":2703},{"uri":"Impresario","surface_form":"impresario","offset":2743},{"uri":"Les_Ballets_Russes_de_Sergei_Diaghilev","surface_form":"Les Ballets Russes de Sergei Diaghilev","offset":2784},{"uri":"Nijinsky","surface_form":"Nijinsky","offset":2925},{"uri":"Ballerina","surface_form":"ballerina","offset":2956},{"uri":"Karsavina","surface_form":"Karsavina","offset":2966},{"uri":"Pavlova","surface_form":"Pavlova","offset":2982},{"uri":"Danilova","surface_form":"Danilova","offset":2991},{"uri":"Spessivtseva","surface_form":"Spessivtseva","offset":3004},{"uri":"Fokine","surface_form":"Fokine","offset":3046},{"uri":"Massine","surface_form":"Massine","offset":3054},{"uri":"Balanchine","surface_form":"Balanchine","offset":3066},{"uri":"Stravinsky","surface_form":"Stravinsky","offset":3101},{"uri":"Prokofiev","surface_form":"Prokofiev","offset":3113},{"uri":"Ravel","surface_form":"Ravel","offset":3124},{"uri":"Debussy","surface_form":"Debussy","offset":3134},{"uri":"Picasso","surface_form":"Picasso","offset":3170},{"uri":"Cezanne","surface_form":"Cezanne","offset":3179},{"uri":"Henri_Matisse","surface_form":"Matisse","offset":3188},{"uri":"Utrillo","surface_form":"Utrillo","offset":3197},{"uri":"Bakst","surface_form":"Bakst","offset":3206},{"uri":"Braque","surface_form":"Braque","offset":3216},{"uri":"Royal_Ballet","surface_form":"Royal Ballet","offset":3387},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":3403},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":3430},{"uri":"Agrippina_Vaganova","surface_form":"Agrippina Vaganova","offset":3742},{"uri":"George_Balanchine","surface_form":"George Balanchine","offset":3790},{"uri":"Cecchetti_method","surface_form":"Cecchetti method","offset":3817},{"uri":"Enrico_Cecchetti","surface_form":"Enrico Cecchetti","offset":3840}]}
