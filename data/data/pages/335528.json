{"id":335528,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paquita","text":"\"Paquita\" is a romantic ballet in two acts and three scenes. Its story was written by Joseph Mazilier and Paul Foucher. The music was composed by Edouard Deldevez. It was originally choreographed by Joseph Mazilier. \"Paquita\" was first performed in the Salle Le Peletier by the Paris Opera Ballet on 1 April 1846. It starred Carlotta Grisi and Lucien Petipa. \"Paquita\" remained in the repertory of the Op\u00E9ra until 1851.\nThe story takes place in Spain during the occupation of Napoleon's army. The heroine is the young Gypsy girl, Paquita. She is really of noble birth. She was abducted by Gypsies when she was an infant. She saves the life of a young French officer, Lucien d'Hervilly. He is the target of a Spanish governor who desires to have him killed by I\u00F1igo, a Gypsy chief. Paquita discovers that she is of noble birth. She is in fact the cousin of Lucien. She and Lucien marry.\nIn 1847, \"Paquita\" was staged for the first time in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa and Pierre-Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Malevergne. It was Petipa's first ballet staged in Russia. In 1881, Petipa produced a revival of the ballet. He added new pieces specially composed by Ludwig Minkus. This included the \"Pas de trois\" (aka the Minkus Pas de trois or Paquita Pas de trois) for the first act, and the Paquita \"Grand pas classique\" and the \"Mazurka des enfants\" (Children's mazurka) for the last act. Petipa's version of \"Paquita\" remained in the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre until 1926.\nMarius Petipa's 1881 additions for \"Paquita\" survived long after the full-length ballet left the stage. Today these pieces, particularly the \"Grand pas classique\", are major cornerstones of the traditional classical ballet repertory. They have been staged by ballet companies throughout the world.\nIn 2001, the Ballet Master Pierre Lacotte produced a revival of the full-length, two act \"Paquita\" for the Paris Opera Ballet. Although Lacotte re-choreographed most of the ballet himself, he restored Joseph Mazilier's original mime sequences and mise-en-sc\u00E8ne, as well as Marius Petipa's 1881 additions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["ballet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romantic_ballet","surface_form":"romantic ballet","offset":15},{"uri":"Salle_Le_Peletier","surface_form":"Salle Le Peletier","offset":253},{"uri":"Carlotta_Grisi","surface_form":"Carlotta Grisi","offset":325},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":476},{"uri":"Marius_Petipa","surface_form":"Marius Petipa","offset":990},{"uri":"Ludwig_Minkus","surface_form":"Ludwig Minkus","offset":1175}]}
