Quito is the second largest city in Ecuador after Guayaquil. The Historic Center of Quito, Ecuador is one of the largest, least-changed and best-preserved historic centers in the Americas. Quito was designated a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1978. It is the first city to be honored in such a way.\nThe Historic Centre of Quito is located in the center south of the capital on an area of 320 hectares (790 acres), and is thought of as one of the most important historic areas in Latin America. There are about 130 monumental buildings (which have a variety of pictorial art and sculpture, mostly of religious inspired in a range of schools and styles) and 5,000 properties registered in the municipal inventory of heritage properties.\nPresidential Palace.\nCarondelet Palace (Spanish: \"Palacio de Carondelet\") is the seat of government of the Republic of Ecuador, located in the historical center of Quito. Axis is the nerve of the public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colonial name), around which were built in addition the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace, the Hotel Plaza Grande and the Metropolitan Cathedral. The history of this symbolic building dates back to colonial times, around 1570, with the acquisition of the former royal houses located in the city of Quito.\nDuring the Republican era, almost all of the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have dispatched from this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador. In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which they live the President and his family. Rafael Correa, president since 2007, thinking that Carondelet Palace and its offices are Ecuadoran heritages, converted the presidential compound into a museum accessible to all who wish to visit it. To this end, areas were organized to place objects within their cultural contexts, to make them accessible to the world, which used several rooms and spaces within the palace.\nChurch of La Compa\u00F1\u00EDa de Jes\u00FAs.\nConstruction began in 1605, with Mastrilli laying the first stone. The building was not completed until 1765. La Compa\u00F1\u00EDa is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches \u2014 the Chiesa del Ges\u00F9 and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola \u2014 La Compa\u00F1\u00EDa is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America.\nIndependence Square.\nAlso known as Big Square (Spanish: Plaza de la Independencia, Plaza Grande).

Construction of the building began a few weeks after the founding of the city in 1534 and ended in 1604. The founder of the church was Franciscan missionary Jodoco Ricke.\nThe building's construction began around 1550, sixteen years after Quito was founded by Spanish conquistadors, and was finished in approximately 1680. The building was officially inaugurated in 1605. It is not known who designed the original plans for the complex, though the most-accepted theory is that they were sent from Spain, based on the topographical study of Ricke and Gosseal. It is also possible that architects came from Spain for the construction of the monastery, or that Ricke and Gosseal managed the entire construction.\nChurch of El Sagrario.\nIn colonial times, the Church of El Sagrario was one of the largest architectural marvels of Quito. The construction is of the Italian Renaissance style and was built in the late 17th century. It has a screen that supports its sculptures and decorations. This structure was built by Bernardo de Legarda. Its central arch leads to a dome decorated with frescoes of biblical scenes featuring archangels, work by Francisco Alb\u00E1n. The altarpiece was gilded by Legarda. It is located on Calle Garc\u00EDa Moreno, near the Cathedral.\nChurch of Santo Domingo.\nAlthough they arrived in Quito in 1541, in 1580 the Dominicans started to build their temple, using the plans and direction of Francisco Becerra.

This was placed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mud\u00E9jar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is composed of a pair and knuckle frame, coated inside by pieces of tracery.

As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (\"mestizaje\") and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.\nThe Quito School (\"Escuela Quite\u00F1a\") is an artistic tradition that developed in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, from Pasto and Popay\u00E1n in the north to Piura and Cajamarca in the south, during the colonial period (1542-1824). This artistic production was one of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito.\nThe major artists of the Quito School are the sculptors Bernardo de Legarda, Manuel Chili (Caspicara) and Miguel Angel Tejada Zambrado and the painters Fray Pedro Gosseal, Fray Pedro Bed\u00F3n, Nicol\u00E1s Javier Gor\u00EDbar, Hernando de la Cruz, Miguel de Santiago, Manuel de Samaniego\nBasilica del Voto Nacional.\nThe Basilica of the National Vow is a Roman Catholic church in the historic center of Quito. It is sometimes also called the Catedral Consagraci\u00F3n de Jes\u00FAs or the Bas\u00EDlica de San Juan. It is the largest neo-Gothic basilica in the Americas.\nThe basilica arose from the idea, proposed by father Julio Matovelle in 1883, of building a monument as a perpetual reminder of the consecration of Ecuador to the Sacred Heart, President Luis Cordero issued the decree on July 23, 1883, and it was carried out by president Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa Pl\u00E1cido Caama\u00F1o on March 5, 1884. The congress, in accordance with the year's budget, designated 12,000 pesos for the construction - 1,000 pesos per month, beginning in 1884. By the decree of July 3, 1885, the fourth Quitense Provincial Council turned the construction of the basilica into a religious commitment in the name of the country. The basilica remains technically \"unfinished.\" & local legend says that when the Bas\u00EDlica is completed, the end of the world will come.\nMetropolitan Cathedral.\nConstruction began in 1562, seventeen years after the diocese of Quito was created (1545) and located in the heart of the historic city and its status as the main church of the city, is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city.\nChurch of San Agust\u00EDn.\nIt is one of the seven monumental churches of the 16th and 17th centuries whose main portico was built on stone in the Spanish Baroque-architecture style.\nThe church includes a small atrium (decorated by a large stone cross), an inside yard with a large garden and a large session hall where the frayers held dissertations or \"capitulations\" of faith.\nThe cloister and convent have a separate entrance which leads to the garden. The bell tower reaches a high of twenty-two meters (seventy feet) and houses two bronze bells of the period.\nGu\u00E1pulo, Quito.\nGu\u00E1pulo is a district of Quito, Ecuador, also called an electoral parish (\"parroquia electoral urbana\"). The parish was established as a result of the October 2004 political elections when the city was divided into 19 urban electoral parishes. Set behind Hotel Quito, the neighborhood of Gu\u00E1pulo runs down the winding Camino de Orellana, from Gonz\u00E1lez Su\u00E1rez to Calle de los Conquistadores, the main road out of Quito and to the neighboring suburbs.\nOften considered an artsy, bohemian neighborhood of Quito, Gu\u00E1pulo is home to many local artists and a couple of hippy caf\u00E9s/bars. Every year on September 7 the guapule\u00F1os honor their neighborhood with the Fiestas de Gu\u00E1pulo, a fantastic celebration complete with costumes, parade, food, drink, song, dance, and fireworks.\nGu\u00E1pulo Park is a 19.5 hectares, 48 acre public park.
