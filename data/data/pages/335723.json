It lives in the dry regions of southwest Madagascar.\nThis lemur weighs between. It can live up to 20 years. It is a mid-sized lemur. The striped tail makes it easy to recognize. Its behaviour is somewhat unusual for lemurs: it is active during the day, and spends much time on the ground. Ring-tailed lemurs live in groups of 12 to 15 animals. Each group is led by a female. Ring-tailed lemurs eat both meat and plants, but they mainly eat fruit. They live only in Madagascar. The main threats to ring-tailed lemurs are destroying the places where it lives and hunting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":43},{"uri":"Lemur","surface_form":"lemur","offset":69},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":133},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":274},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":459},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":532},{"uri":"Hunt","surface_form":"hunt","offset":653}]}
