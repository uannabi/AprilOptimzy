{"id":33576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages","text":"The Uralic languages are a language family. They were originally spoken in Eastern Europe and Asia but originated somewhere in eastern Siberia near Lake Baikal.\nThere are two modern main kinds: the Samoyedic languages and the Finno-Ugric languages.\nOrigin.\nThe proto-Uralic languages and the early Uralic people originated somewhere in eastern Siberia or possibly Northeast Asia. They were closely related to other Siberian and East Asian but also Inuit people. They migrated into central Siberia and then about 3,000 years ago started to migrate to the Baltic region in northeastern Europe. They assimilated many Paleo-European tribes. Genetic and anthropologic studies show that the early Uralic people were similar to various Siberian and East Asian people (Mongoloids).\nExternal relations.\nSeveral linguists and geneticists suggest that the Uralic languages are related to various Siberian languages and possibly also some languages of northern Native Americans. A proposed family is named Uralo-Siberian. It includes Uralic, Yukaghir, Eskimo\u2013Aleut (Inuit), possibly Nivkh and Chukotko-Kamchatkan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"language family","offset":27},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":75},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":94},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":135},{"uri":"Lake_Baikal","surface_form":"Lake Baikal","offset":148},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"Northeast Asia","offset":364},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Inuit","offset":448},{"uri":"Baltic_states","surface_form":"Baltic region","offset":554},{"uri":"Mongoloid_(race)","surface_form":"Mongoloids","offset":761},{"uri":"Uralo-Siberian","surface_form":"Uralo-Siberian","offset":994}]}
