It passes the cities of Wausau and Stevens Point.\nIn southern Wisconsin, the river meets a moraine. The moraine was made during the last ice age. The river enters a beautiful gorge, called the Wisconsin Dells. North of the city of Madison, the river turns to the west. It flows west through the hills of southwest Wisconsin. It joins the Mississippi 15 km south of the city of Prairie du Chien.\nThe river is an important source of hydroelectric power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":38},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":51},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":74},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":91},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":140},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":316},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":401},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":425},{"uri":"Wausau%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wausau","offset":458},{"uri":"Stevens_Point%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Stevens Point","offset":469},{"uri":"Moraine","surface_form":"moraine","offset":525},{"uri":"Wisconsin_Dells","surface_form":"Wisconsin Dells","offset":627},{"uri":"Madison%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Madison","offset":665},{"uri":"Prairie_du_Chien%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Prairie du Chien","offset":811},{"uri":"Hydroelectric_power","surface_form":"hydroelectric power","offset":865}]}
