{"id":3361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska","text":"Alaska (), officially the State of Alaska, is a state in the United States. It is in the Northwest corner of the continent of the United States West Coast. Alaska does not touch other US states. It has borders with Canada, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Bering Sea, and the Bering Strait.\nAlaska is the biggest state in the United States. It is the 3rd least populated state. It has the lowest population density of all the states. About half of the population of Alaska lives in the Anchorage metropolitan area. As of the 2011 census, 722,718 people live in Alaska.\nThe United States bought Alaska from Russia on March 30, 1867. This was called the Alaska Purchase. It cost $7.2 million. Today, that would be $120 million. The price was about $0.02 per acre ($4.74/km2). Alaska became an organized (or incorporated) territory on May 11, 1912. It became the 49th state on January 3, 1959.\nThe name \"Alaska\" comes from the Aleut word \"alaxsaq\". This means \"the mainland\" or \"the object towards which the action of the sea is directed.\" The land is also called Alyeska, which is another Aleut word that means \"the great land.\" The Russian name was \u0410\u043B\u044F\u0441\u043A\u0430.\nGeography.\nThe capital city is Juneau, but the biggest city is Anchorage. Alaska is the biggest state in the United States, but it almost has the least people. Alaska has almost 20% of all the land in the U.S., but only about 0.2% of the people. It is not connected to any other states by American land, but it is connected to Canada.\nAlaska has many glaciers, some of which are can be seen from passing cruise ships. Some are coastal, and others are not by the ocean. It is a popular tourist destination, as there is a very rich culture along with beautiful scenery. There are many wild animals in Alaska. Some of them are the brown bear, the moose, and the wolf.\nThere are some important industries in Alaska, like oil, fishing, mining, and forestry. Oil is the biggest industry in Alaska.
