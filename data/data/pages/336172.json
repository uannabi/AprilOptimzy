There are 80 provinces at present. The provinces are divided into cities and municipalities. The National Capital Region, as well as independent cities, are separate from any provincial government. Each province has a governor.\nThe provinces are grouped into seventeen regions based on geographical, cultural, and ethnological characteristics. Fourteen of these regions are designated with numbers corresponding to their geographic location in order from north to south. The National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao do not have numerical designations.\nEach province is member to the League of Provinces of the Philippines, an organization which aims to address issues affecting provincial and metropolitan government administrations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Philippines","surface_form":"the Philippines","offset":88},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":323},{"uri":"Metro_Manila","surface_form":"National Capital Region","offset":580},{"uri":"Cordillera_Administrative_Region","surface_form":"Cordillera Administrative Region","offset":605},{"uri":"Autonomous_Region_in_Muslim_Mindanao","surface_form":"Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao","offset":643}]}
