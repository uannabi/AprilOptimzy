{"id":336176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsway_(London)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kingsway is a major road in central London in the United Kingdom, designated as part of the A4200. It runs from High Holborn, at its north end in the London Borough of Camden, and meets Aldwych in the south in the City of Westminster at Bush House. It was built in the 1900s. Together Kingsway and Aldwych form one of the major north-south routes through central London linking the ancient east-west routes of High Holborn and Strand.\nHistory.\nThe road was built as part of a redevelopment of the area in the 1900s. Its route cleared away the maze of small streets in Holborn such as Little Queen Street and the surrounding dwellings. However Holy Trinity Church, which was built in Little Queen Street was spared. Whereas the Sardinian Embassy Chapel, an important Roman Catholic church attached to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sardinia, was demolished to make way for the new street.\nPlans were published by London County Council in 1898 and the road was formally opened in 1905. It is one of the broadest streets in central London at wide.\nIt was unique in containing below it a tunnel for a tramway, which started just north of Southampton Row, passed beneath Aldwych and continued to the Thames Embankment: this Kingsway tramway subway joined the North and South London tram systems. In 1958 the disused tunnel was reopened at the southern end to make a new connection, the Strand Underpass, for light traffic between Waterloo Bridge and Kingsway on order to reduce congestion. Also beneath Kingsway was a branch of the Piccadilly tube line from Holborn to Aldwych. It is now closed with no service but the platform at Holborn used for the branch is used for TV and film sets that require underground scenes. During WW2 the branch was used to store art treasures from the British Museum, including the Elgin Marbles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":779},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Sardinia","offset":832},{"uri":"London_County_Council","surface_form":"London County Council","offset":924},{"uri":"Kingsway_tramway_subway","surface_form":"Kingsway tramway subway","offset":1231},{"uri":"British_Museum","surface_form":"British Museum","offset":1791},{"uri":"Elgin_Marbles","surface_form":"Elgin Marbles","offset":1821}]}
