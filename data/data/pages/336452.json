{"id":336452,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Pacific","text":"e=\"preserve\">Asia-Pacific or Asia Pacific (abbreviated as Asia-Pac, Asia Pac, Apac, APAC, APNIC, APJ, JAPA or JAPAC) is the part of the world in or near the Western Pacific Ocean. The region varies in size. It typically includes much of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.\nThe term may also include Russia (on the North Pacific) and countries in North and South America which are on the coast of the Eastern Pacific Ocean; the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), for example, includes Canada, Chile, Russia, Mexico, Peru, and the United States.\nThe term sometimes includes all of Asia and Australasia as well as the many Pacific island nations.\nEven though imprecise, the term has become popular since the late 1980s in commerce, finance and politics. It is popular even though the economies within the region are not the same.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":165},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":237},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":248},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":268},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":303},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":412},{"uri":"Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation","surface_form":"Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation","offset":431},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":495},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":503},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":518},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":526},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":540},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":599}]}
