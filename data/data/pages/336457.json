{"id":336457,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Island_Developing_States","text":"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are low-lying coastal countries. They share similar problems because of their size. Some of these problems are: small but growing populations, limited resources, and long distances from other countries.\nThe SIDS were first seen as a distinct group of developing countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992. The Barbados Programme of Action was made in 1994 to help the SIDS to develop.\nList of SIDS.\nCurrently, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs lists 44 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the Caribbean; the Pacific; and Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS). Each of these regions has a regional organisation for cooperation: the Caribbean Community, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Indian Ocean Commission.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"low-lying","offset":42},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":52},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":60},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":168},{"uri":"Natural_resource","surface_form":"resources","offset":189},{"uri":"Developing_countries","surface_form":"developing countries","offset":289},{"uri":"Earth_Summit_(1992)","surface_form":"United Nations Conference on Environment and Development","offset":317},{"uri":"Barbados_Programme_of_Action","surface_form":"Barbados Programme of Action","offset":392},{"uri":"United_Nations_Department_of_Economic_and_Social_Affairs","surface_form":"United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs","offset":496},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":651},{"uri":"Pacific","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":666},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":679},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":687},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":701},{"uri":"South_China_Sea","surface_form":"South China Sea","offset":719},{"uri":"Cooperation","surface_form":"cooperation","offset":797},{"uri":"Caribbean_Community","surface_form":"Caribbean Community","offset":814},{"uri":"Pacific_Islands_Forum","surface_form":"Pacific Islands Forum","offset":839},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean_Commission","surface_form":"Indian Ocean Commission","offset":869}]}
