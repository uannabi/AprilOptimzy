{"id":336492,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bodies_of_Azerbaijan","text":"Below is a list of the water bodies of Azerbaijan, which include rivers and lakes. Canals which are artificial rivers and reservoirs which are artifical lakes are also a part of Azerbaijan's water systems.\nThe hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea drainage basin.\nKur and Aras.\nThe Kur and Aras are the longest rivers in Azerbaijan. The rivers directly flow into the Caspian Sea. They come from the north-eastern slope of the Greater Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands.\nThe Kur River drainage basin area (86,000 km\u00B2) up to the junction with the Aras River is smaller than the Aras drainage basin (101,937 km\u00B2). The river is still called Kur on the junction because the water level of the Kura is twice as high as that of the Aras River.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":39},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":65},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":76},{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"Canal","offset":83},{"uri":"Artificial","surface_form":"artificial","offset":100},{"uri":"Reservoirs","surface_form":"reservoirs","offset":122},{"uri":"Hydrography","surface_form":"hydrography","offset":210},{"uri":"Caspian_Sea","surface_form":"Caspian Sea","offset":261},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":273},{"uri":"Slope","surface_form":"slope","offset":438},{"uri":"Greater_Caucasus","surface_form":"Greater Caucasus","offset":451},{"uri":"Talysh_Mountains","surface_form":"Talysh Mountains","offset":472},{"uri":"Junction","surface_form":"junction","offset":601}]}
