{"id":336495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulme","text":"Hulme is an inner city area and electoral ward of Manchester, England which is south of Manchester city centre and divided from it by the River Medlock. Historically a part of Lancashire, the name Hulme comes from the Old Norse word for a small island, or land surrounded by water or marsh, showing that it was probably settled by Norse invaders during the period of the Danelaw.\nThe part of Hulme nearest to Old Trafford is known as Cornbrook from the Corn Brook, a tributary of the River Irwell. The Bridgewater Canal passes through Hulme. Chorlton-on-Medlock is to the east, Moss Side to the south and Old Trafford to the west.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":50},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":62},{"uri":"River_Medlock","surface_form":"River Medlock","offset":138},{"uri":"Historic_counties_of_England","surface_form":"Historically","offset":153},{"uri":"Lancashire","surface_form":"Lancashire","offset":176},{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":218},{"uri":"Danelaw","surface_form":"Danelaw","offset":371},{"uri":"Old_Trafford%2C_Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Old Trafford","offset":409},{"uri":"River_Irwell","surface_form":"River Irwell","offset":484},{"uri":"Bridgewater_Canal","surface_form":"Bridgewater Canal","offset":502},{"uri":"Chorlton-on-Medlock","surface_form":"Chorlton-on-Medlock","offset":542},{"uri":"Moss_Side","surface_form":"Moss Side","offset":578}]}
