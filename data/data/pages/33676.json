{"id":33676,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche","text":"Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (15 October 1844 \u2013 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher and writer. At first, he was a professor at the University of Basel. He worked in a part of classical studies called classical philology. He later wrote several books of philosophy. And is now known as one of the most important thinkers of modern times.\nBeliefs.\nNietzsche wrote a lot about how people make decisions and about how they live their lives. He attacked most of the moral ideas that were popular at the time because he did not believe that there are any real facts about what is right or wrong. He thought people should create their own facts about morality.\nHe also often attacked the ideas of the Christian religion - he believed that the Christian idea that one should feel pity when one sees weakness was unhelpful. According to him, weak people rely on other people's love as a way of protecting themselves. Nietzsche believed that people should be stronger than that.\nHe thought that people should be very aware of their body and of the real world in which they actually live. He told his readers not to live in a daydream or make decisions based on unrealistic thoughts. He believed that ideas of heaven came from an inability to cope with life in the world.\nNietzsche considered the world to be one connected thing, including mankind and nature. He invented the idea of the \"will to power\". This idea is that everyone and everything is trying to overcome itself, or defeat or take control from itself. Therefore, if the world is just one thing, this is the force that makes the world.\nNietzsche thought that human beings would be successful at overcoming themselves, and he thought that when they did, they would be different and better. He named the person who would do this someday a \"superman\" (or \u00DCbermensch\" in German). He thought that the supermen would be stronger than normal humans, and not restricted by other people's ideas of right and wrong.\nInfluence.\nAdolf Hitler, the German Chancellor and leader of the Nazis in World War II, read Nietzsche's work. Some people say that Hitler did not understand Nietzsche's ideas, but he used them to try to show that his actions were right. Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the term \"\u00FCbermensch\" to refer to the Aryan race. However he was not popular among all fascists.\nNietzsche wrote in a very fiery and exciting way. However, what he wrote later in his life became more and more odd. When he was forty years old, Nietzsche went insane. Supposedly, one day in the city of Turin, Italy, he saw a horse being whipped by its owner and ran to save it, hugging it around the throat. After this, Nietzsche never wrote again and could not look after himself. This illness may have been caused by the disease syphillis, or a brain tumour.\nHis writing and ideas are still popular and of interest to academics and intellectuals.\nIn the late 1880s Georg Brandes developed a philosophy called \"aristocratic radicalism\" inspired by Nietzsche's idea of the \"overman.\"\nNietzsche is associated with anarchism, but his writing seems to have a negative opinion of anarchists. Anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman was deeply influenced by his work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":76},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":92},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":119},{"uri":"University_of_Basel","surface_form":"University of Basel","offset":136},{"uri":"Classical_studies","surface_form":"classical studies","offset":180},{"uri":"Philology","surface_form":"philology","offset":215},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"morality","offset":649},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":699},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":709},{"uri":"Higher_worlds","surface_form":"heaven","offset":1204},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":1974},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":2212},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":2535},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":2542},{"uri":"Syphillis","surface_form":"syphillis","offset":2764},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":2780},{"uri":"Tumour","surface_form":"tumour","offset":2786},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":2853},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectual","offset":2867},{"uri":"Georg_Brandes","surface_form":"Georg Brandes","offset":2900},{"uri":"Anarchism","surface_form":"anarchism","offset":3046},{"uri":"Feminist","surface_form":"feminist","offset":3129},{"uri":"Emma_Goldman","surface_form":"Emma Goldman","offset":3138}]}
