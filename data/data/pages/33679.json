{"id":33679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_screen","text":"A movie screen is a surface on which a movie projector plays a movie. They are sometimes a wall, sometimes a cloth, and sometimes paper. Theaters have movie screens, and some people have them at home. Movable movie screens are made to be used where there is not a movie screen already. Screens are white or grey so that the movie shows up nicely on the screen. This lets the people watching the movie see it easily.\nModern day movie screens are made from PVC sheets that are joined together by welding in such a way that the screen appears to be in a single piece.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Movie_projector","surface_form":"movie projector","offset":39},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":63},{"uri":"Wall","surface_form":"wall","offset":91},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":109},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":130},{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"Theater","offset":137}]}
