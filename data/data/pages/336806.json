{"id":336806,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transuranium_element","text":"=\"preserve\">Every transuranium element is a chemical element with an atomic number greater than the atomic number of Uranium. These elements have atomic numbers greater than 92.\nThe word \"transuranium\" is made of two parts. The Greek prefix \"trans-\" means \"beyond\" or \"across\". The second part of the word is the name of the element \"uranium\".\nMany transuranium elements are unstable and are not found in nature. An element that is unstable will split into two or more other elements. The process of fission occurs when an element splits into pieces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":44},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":69},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"Uranium","offset":117},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":228},{"uri":"Fission","surface_form":"fission","offset":500}]}
