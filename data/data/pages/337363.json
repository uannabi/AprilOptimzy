The main town on the island shares the name. It has been a resort since the time of the Roman Republic. The Emperor Tiberius lived here from 26\u201331 AD.\nFeatures of the island are the Belvedere of Tragara (a high panoramic promenade lined with villas), the limestone crags called sea stacks that project above the sea (the \"Faraglioni\"), the town of Anacapri, the Blue Grotto (\"Grotta Azzurra\"), and the ruins of the Imperial Roman villas.\nCapri is part of the region of Campania, Province of Naples. Most people on the island live in the town of Capri. The island has two harbours, Marina Piccola and Marina Grande (the main port of the island).
