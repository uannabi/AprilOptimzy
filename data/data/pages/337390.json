The seamounts are in the northern end of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR). The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900\u00A0km from the eastern end of the or \"Bungo\" strait\" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southwest in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.\nThe Saikaid\u014D underwater mountain chain is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu.\nThis seabed feature is named after \"Saikaid\u014D\", which was the name given to the southern region of Japan during the Asuka period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippine_Sea","surface_form":"Philippine Sea","offset":52},{"uri":"Seamount","surface_form":"seamount","offset":72},{"uri":"Kyushu-Palau_Ridge","surface_form":"Kyushu-Palau Ridge","offset":113},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":246},{"uri":"Kyushu","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":266},{"uri":"Shikoku","surface_form":"Shikoku","offset":277},{"uri":"Palau","surface_form":"the island of Palau","offset":371},{"uri":"Extinct_volcano","surface_form":"extinct volcano","offset":412},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":502},{"uri":"Saikaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Saikaid\u014D","offset":565},{"uri":"Asuka_period","surface_form":"Asuka period","offset":644}]}
