{"id":337458,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demchok","text":"Demchok or \"New Demchok\" is a small village and military encampment in the Indian-administered part of the disputed Demchok sector south of Aksai Chin, in the Ladakh district of Kashmir. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) passes along the southeast side of the village, following a wadi just upstream from the nearby Indus River. Across the wadi, less than a kilometer away, is the Chinese-administered village, called D\u00EAmqog, in the Ngari Prefecture within Tibet. This village was on an old route linking Ladakh and Tibet, currently closed. The village lies 36.5\u00A0km east of Ukdungle.\nThough the Kailash Mansarovar is 300\u00A0km away, the route there is mostly through plains and there is demand to improve and open a road linking China and Northern Pakistan through Demchok. Islamabad says that this is part of China, however India rejects this and claims the territory to be part of New Delhi's administration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aksai_Chin","surface_form":"Aksai Chin","offset":140},{"uri":"Ladakh","surface_form":"Ladakh","offset":159},{"uri":"Line_of_Actual_Control","surface_form":"Line of Actual Control","offset":191},{"uri":"Indus_River","surface_form":"Indus River","offset":315},{"uri":"D%C3%AAmqog%2C_Ngari_Prefecture","surface_form":"D\u00EAmqog","offset":417},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":456},{"uri":"Ukdungle","surface_form":"Ukdungle","offset":573}]}
