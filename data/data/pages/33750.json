{"id":33750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi","text":"The okapi (\"Okapia johnstoni\") is an even-toed ungulate mammal from central Africa. With the giraffe they form the family Giraffidae.\nAppearance.\nThe okapi has a reddish brown body, a whitish gray face, and white and black stripes on its legs. The okapi has a few features that show its link to giraffes. Its height is not as large as giraffes.\nLife.\nOkapis live in the rainforests of central Africa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThey are mostly active during the day. Okapis eat mostly leaves and buds from trees, but also grass, ferns, fruit, and fungi.\nOkapis usually live alone. After 420 to 450 days of pregnancy the mother gives birth to one baby okapi, which drinks milk for up to 6 months. Okapis become mature when they are 4-5 years old. In captivity, okapis can live for 30 years or so.\nOther information.\nThe okapi was unknown and a mystery to western researchers for a long time. In the past, scientists thought that the okapi was a mix between the giraffe and the zebra.\nThe \"International Society for Cryptozoology\" uses the okapi as its symbol, because the okapi was unknown for a long time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Even-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"even-toed ungulate","offset":37},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":56},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":76},{"uri":"Giraffe","surface_form":"giraffe","offset":93},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":115},{"uri":"Giraffidae","surface_form":"Giraffidae","offset":122},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":370},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":393},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":408},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":499},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":520},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":536},{"uri":"Fern","surface_form":"fern","offset":543},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":550},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":561},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":620},{"uri":"Giraffe","surface_form":"giraffe","offset":974},{"uri":"Zebra","surface_form":"zebra","offset":990},{"uri":"Cryptozoology","surface_form":"Cryptozoology","offset":1028},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1065}]}
