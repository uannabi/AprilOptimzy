{"id":337535,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_species_concept","text":"e=\"preserve\">The biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form (speciation). A biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together (panmixia). However, they cannot breed with other groups. In other words, the group is reproductively isolated from other groups.\nAccording to Ernst Mayr, a new species forms when an existing species splits. A similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by Moritz Wagner. Dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species. Once a species lives in two different areas, the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop. Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well. Eventually, each group becomes a 'good' biological species, because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together.\nThis is still considered the most common reason for species splitting, and has the technical name of allopatric speciation. It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area.\nIts role in taxonomy.\nWhat this is saying is that, in practice, the biological species concept is not sufficient by itself to decide on the classification of animals.\nJohn Ray.\nIn 1686 John Ray introduced a non-evolutionary biological concept. To him, species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.\nThe idea of a species as a physical type of organism had a long history. This survives as the concept of a type specimen in taxonomy. It was the way Linnaeus worked in his binomial classification, and is still useful for amateur naturalists today.\nCharles Darwin.\nIn the \"Origin\", Charles Darwin said that species were labels which experts gave on the basis of their observations.\nBut twenty years before, he had a much better idea. He thought of species as maintained by reproductive isolation. He even says \"Hence species may be good ones and differ scarcely at all in any external character\". Here he quotes the two sibling species of leaf warbler discovered in England by Gilbert White in 1768. At this early stage in his career, Darwin came very close to the modern biological species concept.p266\nModern era.\nIn the last 70 years two ideas have dominated the way professional biologists think about species.\nThe first is the population genetics concept. This is where a species is seen as a group which can mate together even though they are all to some extent different. It amounts to saying that a species is a gene pool.\nThe second is the use of DNA sequence analysis to show whether similar-looking species are genetically different from each other. This is especially useful when it is not practical to do breeding experiments.\nSibling species.\nSibling species are often called cryptic (hidden) species because their differences can only be seen by analysing their DNA. They are very common in the marine environment.\nMany cryptic species exist in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan \"Celleporella hyalina\", DNA sequence analysis was used to show that more than ten ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many millions of years.\nEvidence from the identification of cryptic species means that older estimates of global species richness are too low. For example, mitochondrial DNA research suggests there are at least 11 genetically distinct populations of giraffes. Similarly, the Amazonian frog \"Eleutherodactylus ockendeni\" is at least three different species which diverged over 5 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Explanation","surface_form":"explanation","offset":53},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":72},{"uri":"Speciation","surface_form":"speciation","offset":86},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":155},{"uri":"Panmixia","surface_form":"panmixia","offset":171},{"uri":"Ernst_Mayr","surface_form":"Ernst Mayr","offset":313},{"uri":"Moritz_Wagner","surface_form":"Moritz Wagner","offset":435},{"uri":"Dobzhansky","surface_form":"Dobzhansky","offset":450},{"uri":"Reproductive_isolation","surface_form":"reproductive isolation","offset":483},{"uri":"Geographical_isolation","surface_form":"geographical isolation","offset":588},{"uri":"Allopatric_speciation","surface_form":"allopatric speciation","offset":986},{"uri":"Sympatric_speciation","surface_form":"sympatric speciation","offset":1031},{"uri":"John_Ray","surface_form":"John Ray","offset":1317},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1343},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":1638},{"uri":"Type_specimen","surface_form":"type specimen","offset":1651},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":1668},{"uri":"Linnaeus","surface_form":"Linnaeus","offset":1693},{"uri":"Biological_classification","surface_form":"binomial classification","offset":1716},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":1765},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":1773},{"uri":"The_Origin_of_Species","surface_form":"Origin","offset":1816},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":1825},{"uri":"Sibling_species","surface_form":"sibling species","offset":2163},{"uri":"Leaf_warbler","surface_form":"leaf warbler","offset":2182},{"uri":"Gilbert_White","surface_form":"Gilbert White","offset":2220},{"uri":"Population_genetics","surface_form":"population genetics","offset":2475},{"uri":"Gene_pool","surface_form":"gene pool","offset":2663},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":2699},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"sequence analysis","offset":2703},{"uri":"Bryozoa","surface_form":"bryozoa","offset":3131},{"uri":"Mitochondrial_DNA","surface_form":"mitochondrial DNA","offset":3436},{"uri":"Giraffe","surface_form":"giraffe","offset":3530}]}
