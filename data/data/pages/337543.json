At the northern end is the Japanese island of Kyushu. At the southern end is the Pacific island nation of Palau.\nThe seabed ridge begins in an area about 900\u00A0km from the eastern end of the or \"Bungo\" strait\" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southeast in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.\nKPR is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu.\nHistory.\nKPR was created by movement at the northern edges of the Philippine Plate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippine_Sea","surface_form":"Philippine Sea","offset":58},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":139},{"uri":"Kyushu","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":158},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":193},{"uri":"Borderless_country","surface_form":"island nation","offset":201},{"uri":"Palau","surface_form":"Palau","offset":218},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":332},{"uri":"Kyushu","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":352},{"uri":"Shikoku","surface_form":"Shikoku","offset":363},{"uri":"Palau","surface_form":"the island of Palau","offset":457},{"uri":"Extinct_volcano","surface_form":"extinct volcano","offset":498},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":553},{"uri":"Philippine_Plate","surface_form":"Philippine Plate","offset":646}]}
