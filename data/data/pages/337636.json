{"id":337636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooch_Behar_(princely_state)","text":"=\"preserve\">Cooch Behar (1586\u20141949; also spelled Koch Bihar) was a small kingdom located south of the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, west of the upper Brahmaputra valley Ahom Kingdom, and north-east of the Ganges plain and Bengal.\nUntil 1949, Cooch Behar was a princely state subject to British rule. In 1949, it was merged with India; now free from the British. It later became a part of West Bengal. However, if Cooch Behar had become part of East Pakistan, then India would not have had as much land access towards the north-east. Also the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) would have land borders with Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayan","offset":102},{"uri":"Bhutan","surface_form":"Bhutan","offset":123},{"uri":"Brahmaputra_River","surface_form":"Brahmaputra","offset":149},{"uri":"Ganges","surface_form":"Ganges","offset":204},{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":221},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":285},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":327},{"uri":"West_Bengal","surface_form":"West Bengal","offset":387},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":567},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":608},{"uri":"Sikkim","surface_form":"Sikkim","offset":626}]}
