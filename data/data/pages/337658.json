{"id":337658,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning","text":"Planning is the way most organizations work to do big projects. It is thinking about what needs to happen, and then making a detailed plan.\nAll humans plan to some extent: it is a fundamental property of intelligent behaviour. In big organisations and government planning is a main activity. It combines forecasting developments with scenarios of how to react to them.\nForecasting is predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future \"should\" look like.\nThe \"nuts and bolts\" of planning are the documents, diagrams, and meetings, the objectives and the strategy to be followed. Beyond this, planning has a different meaning depending on the context in which it is used.\nThe counterpart to planning is self-organization, when order emerges spontaneously out of seeming chaos.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":25},{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":54},{"uri":"Thought","surface_form":"thinking","offset":70},{"uri":"Detail","surface_form":"detailed","offset":125},{"uri":"Plan","surface_form":"plan","offset":134},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"intelligent behaviour","offset":204},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":252},{"uri":"Forecasting","surface_form":"forecasting","offset":304},{"uri":"Scenario","surface_form":"scenario","offset":334},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":530},{"uri":"Diagram","surface_form":"diagram","offset":541},{"uri":"Meeting","surface_form":"meeting","offset":555},{"uri":"Objective","surface_form":"objectives","offset":569},{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategy","offset":588},{"uri":"Context","surface_form":"context","offset":676},{"uri":"Counterpart","surface_form":"counterpart","offset":709},{"uri":"Self-organization","surface_form":"self-organization","offset":736},{"uri":"Order","surface_form":"order","offset":760},{"uri":"Spontaneous","surface_form":"spontaneously","offset":774},{"uri":"Chaos","surface_form":"chaos","offset":803}]}
