Japan was divided into regions (\"[http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/languagesofsecurity/2011/05/27/japanese-region/ chih\u014D] \"). A regional council (\"chih\u014D gy\u014Dsei ky\u014Dgisai\") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping. The council also included regional chiefs of central government ministries.\nIn this time, political development is marked by persistent loyalty to region and locality.\nKansai region.\nThe Kansai region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.\nKinai.\nSince the late-7th century, the \"Kinai\" region, also known as \"Go-Kinai\", included the \"Five Home Provinces\" which surrounded the old capital city of Kyoto.
