{"id":337803,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokurikud%C5%8D","text":"is a Japanese term for an ancient division of the country and the main road running through the region.\nHistory.\n\"Hokurikud\u014D\" was one of the main circuits of the Gokishichid\u014D system. It was first established during the Asuka period. Over centuries, the government functions of the \"Gokishichido\" became less important. However, the traditional eight regions, including \"Hokurikud\u014D\", remained cultural markers.\nThe \"Hokurikud\u014D\" road connected the capitals of the provinces in this region.\nGeography.\nWhen the Gokishichid\u014D system was initially established after the Taika reforms, the region consisted of just two provinces: Wakasa and Koshi. During the reign of Emperor Temmu, Koshi was divided into three provinces: Echizen, Etch\u016B and Echigo and Sado Island was added as a fifth province. Later, Noto and Kaga were carved out of Echizen.\n\"Hokurikud\u014D\" has parts of seven ancient provinces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circuit_(political_division)","surface_form":"circuits","offset":146},{"uri":"Gokishichid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gokishichid\u014D","offset":162},{"uri":"Asuka_period","surface_form":"Asuka period","offset":219},{"uri":"Gokishichid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gokishichid\u014D","offset":508},{"uri":"Taika_reforms","surface_form":"Taika reforms","offset":564},{"uri":"Wakasa_Province","surface_form":"Wakasa","offset":623},{"uri":"Koshi_Province","surface_form":"Koshi","offset":634},{"uri":"Emperor_Temmu","surface_form":"Emperor Temmu","offset":661},{"uri":"Echizen_Province","surface_form":"Echizen","offset":716},{"uri":"Etch%C5%AB_Province","surface_form":"Etch\u016B","offset":725},{"uri":"Echigo_Province","surface_form":"Echigo","offset":735},{"uri":"Sado_Island","surface_form":"Sado Island","offset":746},{"uri":"Noto_Province","surface_form":"Noto","offset":796},{"uri":"Kaga_Province","surface_form":"Kaga","offset":805},{"uri":"Echizen_Province","surface_form":"Echizen","offset":829},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Japan","surface_form":"ancient provinces","offset":870}]}
