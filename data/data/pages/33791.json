{"id":33791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal","text":"Pascal is a programming language.\nIt was created in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth, to help people learn how to make computer programs.\nDevelopment.\nNow, there are many different dialects of the language, some of which support object-oriented programming.\nIn 1990 the \u201CPascal\u201D and \u201CExtended Pascal\u201D standards were registered with the International Organization for Standardization.\nDescription.\nEvery variable has to be declared before it is used.\nEvery variable has a data type.\nYou are only allowed to assign values to the variable that are valid for the data type.\nThis ensures that the programmer does not make unintentional mistakes.\nPascal is a imperative language.\nThe language distinguishes between procedures and functions.\nA <syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\" inline>function</syntaxhighlight> returns a value, a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\" inline>procedure</syntaxhighlight> does not.\nAs such, a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\" inline>function</syntaxhighlight> call appears in an expression, whereas a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\" inline>procedure</syntaxhighlight> invocation is a statement.\nCode samples.\nThis code calculate factorial of a positive integer, using recursion.\nfactorial:= n * factorial(n - 1);","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":12},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":52},{"uri":"Niklaus_Wirth","surface_form":"Niklaus Wirth","offset":60},{"uri":"Object-oriented_programming","surface_form":"object-oriented programming","offset":218},{"uri":"International_Organization_for_Standardization","surface_form":"International Organization for Standardization","offset":325},{"uri":"Data_type","surface_form":"data type","offset":460},{"uri":"Imperative_programming","surface_form":"imperative language","offset":642},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":713},{"uri":"Factorial","surface_form":"factorial","offset":1130},{"uri":"Recursion","surface_form":"recursion","offset":1169}]}
