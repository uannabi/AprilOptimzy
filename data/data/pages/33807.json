Bartholin's glands secrete relatively minute amounts (one or two drops) of fluid when a woman is sexually aroused.\nSometimes, the Bartholin's glands become infected and can be swollen or painful. This can be treated by a doctor with antibiotics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":31},{"uri":"Left","surface_form":"left","offset":70},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"right","offset":79},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":107},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":117},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":162},{"uri":"Danish_people","surface_form":"Danish","offset":183},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomist","offset":190},{"uri":"Caspar_Bartholin_the_Younger","surface_form":"Caspar Bartholin the Younger","offset":201},{"uri":"1655","surface_form":"1655","offset":231},{"uri":"1738","surface_form":"1738","offset":236},{"uri":"Secrete","surface_form":"secrete","offset":263},{"uri":"Mucus","surface_form":"mucus","offset":271},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":285},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infected","offset":468},{"uri":"Swelling","surface_form":"swollen","offset":488},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":499},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":533},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":545}]}
