It is a vascular plant subdivision of the plant kingdom. Its earliest fossils are from 428\u2013410 million years ago.p99\nThe Lycopods include some of the most primitive (basal) living species. They reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations. Members of Lycopodiophyta have a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant.\nLycopods differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vein rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":68},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":101},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":135},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":141},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":259},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":309},{"uri":"Alternation_of_generations","surface_form":"alternation of generations","offset":337},{"uri":"Protostele","surface_form":"protostele","offset":398},{"uri":"Sporophyte","surface_form":"sporophyte","offset":418},{"uri":"Microphyll","surface_form":"microphyll","offset":510},{"uri":"Fern","surface_form":"fern","offset":613},{"uri":"Seed_plants","surface_form":"seed plants","offset":623}]}
