{"id":338243,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%921_(number)","text":"In mathematics, \u22121 is the additive inverse of 1. That is, if it is added to 1, the result is 0. It is the negative integer greater than negative two (\u22122) and less than\u00A00.\nNegative one has some similar properties as positive one. But some are different.\nNegative one is related to Euler's identity. This is because the identity states formula_1\nIn computer science, \u22121 is a common initial value for integers. It is also used to show that a variable has no useful information.\nAlgebraic properties.\nMultiplying a number by \u22121 is the same as changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the distributive law and the axiom at 1 is the multiplicative identity, that is, a number multiplied by 1 is the number itself. So, for x real, we have\nwhere we used the fact that 0 multiplied by any real number x equals 0, shown by cancellation from the equation\nso (\u22121)\u00A0\u00B7\u00A0\"x\" or\u00A0\u2212\"x\" is the arithmetic inverse of \"x\".\nSquare of \u22121.\nThe square of \u22121, i.e. \u22121 multiplied by \u22121, equals 1. So, a square of negative real numbers is positive.\nTo prove this with algebra, start with the equation\nThe first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of \u22121 as additive inverse of 1, that is, when added to 1, it gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that\nThe second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity, that is: formula_1. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation means\nThe above arguments hold in any ring. Ring is a concept of abstract algebra generalizing integers and real numbers.\nSquare roots of \u22121.\nThe complex number \"i\" satisfies \"i\"2 = \u22121. So it is a square root of \u22121. The only other complex number \"x\" for which the equation \"x\"2 = \u22121 holds is \u2212\"i\". In the algebra of quaternions, which has the complex plane, the equation \"x\"2 = \u22121 has an infinity of solutions.\nExponentiation to negative integers.\nA non-zero real number can have a negative number as its power. We define that \"x\"\u22121 = 1/\"x\". This means a number raised to a power of \u22121 is equal to the reciprocal of that number. The exponential law \"x'a'x'b\" = \"x\"(\"a\" + \"b\") for a,b non-zero real numbers is true even if a or b is negative.\nComputer representation.\nThere are many ways that \u22121 (and negative numbers in general) can be represented in computer systems. The most common is as two's complement of their positive form. In standard binary representation, this can also represent a positive integer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Additive_inverse","surface_form":"additive inverse","offset":26},{"uri":"1_(number)","surface_form":"1","offset":46},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"added","offset":67},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":106},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":115},{"uri":"0_(number)","surface_form":"0","offset":168},{"uri":"Euler%27s_identity","surface_form":"Euler's identity","offset":280},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":347},{"uri":"Distributive_law","surface_form":"distributive law","offset":601},{"uri":"Axiom","surface_form":"axiom","offset":626},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real","offset":735},{"uri":"Cancellation_property","surface_form":"cancellation","offset":830},{"uri":"Square_(algebra)","surface_form":"square","offset":935},{"uri":"Follow","surface_form":"follows","offset":1107},{"uri":"Ring_(mathematics)","surface_form":"ring","offset":1482},{"uri":"Abstract_algebra","surface_form":"abstract algebra","offset":1509},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":1590},{"uri":"Imaginary_unit","surface_form":"i","offset":1606},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":1641},{"uri":"Quaternion","surface_form":"quaternion","offset":1760},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"power","offset":1949},{"uri":"Reciprocal_(mathematics)","surface_form":"reciprocal","offset":2046},{"uri":"Two%27s_complement","surface_form":"two's complement","offset":2335}]}
