When he was alive, he was often called \"Da Cadore\", after his place of birth.\nWhen he was active, the Republic of Venice had a Golden Age, and was well-off economically. Aged nine, Titian went to Venice. The brothers Gentile and Giovanni Bellini taught him how to paint. In 1513, he opened his own shop, and developed into a successful painter, known all over Europe. In 1533, Charles V made him a nobleman. He also obtained a job as a painter at the court of Charles V. In 1545, Pope Paul III invited him to come to Rome, in 1548 and 1550, Titian accompanied Charles V and his son, Philip II to the Diet of Augsburg.
