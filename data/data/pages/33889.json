The urban area of Porto, which extends beyond the administrative limits of the city, has a population of 2.4 million\u00A0(2011)\u00A0in an area of 389\u00A0km2(150\u00A0sq\u00A0mi),\u00A0making it the second-largest urban area in Portugal.\u00A0It is recognized as a\u00A0gamma+ level global city\u00A0by the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group,\u00A0the only Portuguese city besides Lisbon to be recognised as a global city.\nLocation.\nLocated along the\u00A0Douro river estuary\u00A0in Northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest\u00A0European\u00A0centres, and its historical core was proclaimed a\u00A0World Heritage Site\u00A0by\u00A0UNESCO\u00A0in 1996. The western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the\u00A0Atlantic Ocean. Its settlement dates back many centuries, when it was an outpost of the\u00A0Roman Empire. Its combined\u00A0Celtic-Latin\u00A0name,\u00A0Portus Cale,\u00A0has been referred to as the origin of the name \"Portugal\", based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin. In Portuguese, the name of the city is spelled with a\u00A0definite article\u00A0(\"o Porto\"; English:\u00A0\"the port\"). Consequently, its English name evolved from a misinterpretation of the oral pronunciation and referred to as\u00A0\"Oporto\"\u00A0in modern literature and by many speakers.\nAttractions.\nOne of Portugal's internationally famous exports,\u00A0port wine, is named after Porto, since the metropolitan area, and in particular the\u00A0cellars\u00A0of\u00A0Vila Nova de Gaia, were responsible for the packaging, transport and export of the fortified wine.\u00A0In 2014 and 2017, Porto was elected\u00A0\"The Best European Destination\"\u00A0by the Best European Destinations Agency.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":106},{"uri":"Lisbon","surface_form":"Lisbon","offset":121},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":168},{"uri":"Global_city","surface_form":"global city","offset":565},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":618},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":734},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":757},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":767},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":840},{"uri":"Settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":860},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":928},{"uri":"Transliteration","surface_form":"transliteration","offset":1055},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1095},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":1283},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":1335},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":1422},{"uri":"Port_wine","surface_form":"port wine","offset":1431},{"uri":"Cellar","surface_form":"cellar","offset":1515},{"uri":"Packaging","surface_form":"packaging","offset":1570},{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"transport","offset":1581},{"uri":"2014","surface_form":"2014","offset":1628},{"uri":"2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":1637}]}
