Later it became capital of Roman Aquitaine. In the 400s the city was looted by the Vandals, Visigoths, and Franks.\nAfter the Battle of Poitiers, Duke Eudes was able to hold only a small part of Aquitaine where Bordeaux was located. It became one of the last cities to fall under King Pepin the Short.\nBordeaux once again became an important city after the marriage of Duchess El\u00E9onore of Aquitaine with Count Henri Plantagenet. He became King Henry II of England only months after their marriage.\nIn 1653 Bordeaux was added to the Kingdom of France, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\nIn 1870 the French government moved to Bordeaux for a time. This was at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia. The temporary move happened again during World War I and again very briefly during the World War II.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UNESCO World Heritage Site","World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gironde","surface_form":"Gironde","offset":26},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":34},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":48},{"uri":"Garonne","surface_form":"Garonne","offset":69},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":92},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":180},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":190},{"uri":"Koeppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koeppen climate classification","offset":218},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":268},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":340},{"uri":"Monuments_historiques","surface_form":"monuments historiques","offset":425},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":498},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":505},{"uri":"List_of_Celtic_tribes","surface_form":"Celtic tribe","offset":584},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":633},{"uri":"Gallia_Aquitania","surface_form":"Roman Aquitaine","offset":704},{"uri":"Looting","surface_form":"looted","offset":746},{"uri":"Vandals","surface_form":"Vandals","offset":760},{"uri":"Visigoths","surface_form":"Visigoths","offset":769},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Franks","offset":784},{"uri":"Battle_of_Tours","surface_form":"Battle of Poitiers","offset":802},{"uri":"Odo_the_Great","surface_form":"Duke Eudes","offset":822},{"uri":"Aquitaine","surface_form":"Aquitaine","offset":871},{"uri":"Pepin_the_Short","surface_form":"Pepin the Short","offset":961},{"uri":"Eleanor_of_Aquitaine","surface_form":"El\u00E9onore","offset":1053},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Aquitaine","surface_form":"Aquitaine","offset":1065},{"uri":"Henry_II_of_England","surface_form":"Henry II","offset":1120},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"England","offset":1132},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_France","surface_form":"Kingdom of France","offset":1208},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":1244},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_war","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian war","offset":1365},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":1393},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1443},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1489}]}
