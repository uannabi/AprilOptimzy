{"id":33941,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg","text":"Strasbourg is a city in eastern France, the prefecture of Grand Est. Today, about 275,000 people live there (with around 780,000 in the metropolitan area). It lies on the left bank of the Rhine, opposite the German city of Kehl.\nStrasbourg is the seat Council of Europe, of the European Court of Human Rights and of the European Parliament. A lot of people also consider Strasbourg to be the capital of the European Union.\nHistory.\nIts old town, la Grande \u00CEle (\"Grand Island\") has been classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nThe city was founded in 12 BC by Drusus, the brother of Tiberius. Its Celtic name was \"Argentorate\" (which the Romans called \"Argentoratum\"). People think this name is linked to the river Ill (that flows into the Rhine near Strasbourg).\nAt that time, it was on the Limes, a fortification the Romans built across Europe (to keep out the Germanic tribes). There was a fortification (named \"castella drusi\", \"drusus fort\") at that spot. Soldiers need to live from something, so a local civilian settlement developed there. Later, the Limes was pushed farther east.\nClimate.\nStrasbourg has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\" in the Koeppen climate classification).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":16},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":32},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":44},{"uri":"Grand_Est","surface_form":"Grand Est","offset":58},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":136},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":188},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":208},{"uri":"Kehl","surface_form":"Kehl","offset":223},{"uri":"Council_of_Europe","surface_form":"Council of Europe","offset":252},{"uri":"European_Court_of_Human_Rights","surface_form":"European Court of Human Rights","offset":278},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":320},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":407},{"uri":"Old_town","surface_form":"old town","offset":436},{"uri":"Grande_%C3%8Ele","surface_form":"Grande \u00CEle","offset":449},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":502},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":525},{"uri":"12_BC","surface_form":"12 BC","offset":557},{"uri":"Drusus","surface_form":"Drusus","offset":566},{"uri":"Tiberius","surface_form":"Tiberius","offset":589},{"uri":"Celt","surface_form":"Celt","offset":603},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":644},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":715},{"uri":"Limes","surface_form":"Limes","offset":798},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":1122},{"uri":"Koeppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koeppen climate classification","offset":1152}]}
