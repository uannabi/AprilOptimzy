{"id":339756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance","text":"Tap dancing is a type of dance. Its main feature is the sound made by tap shoes hitting the floor. Tap dancers wear special shoes with metal pieces on the bottom. There is one metal piece at the toe, and another at the heel.\nThere are two main types of tap dance: rhythm (Jazz) tap and Broadway tap. Broadway tap is more about the dance. It is often done in musical theater. Rhythm tap is more about the sound of the tapping.\nIn tap dancing dancers use their shoes to tap the floor like drummers. Tap shoes have metal taps on the bottom of the shoe to make a sound. The sound you get from the tap shoe depends on how hard you hit the floor, and what part of your foot you use.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":25},{"uri":"Shoes","surface_form":"shoes","offset":124},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":135},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"Jazz","offset":272},{"uri":"Broadway","surface_form":"Broadway","offset":286}]}
