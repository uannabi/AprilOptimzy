{"id":34013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language","text":"The M\u0101ori language (, shortened to Te Reo) is the language of the M\u0101ori and an official language of New Zealand. It is an Austronesian language.\nAlthough it's an official language, not many people speak it fluently. In the 2013 census, about 149,000 people, (3.7% of the population) said that they could have a conversation in M\u0101ori about a lot of everyday things.\nThe language can be seen everywhere throughout New Zealand, as many of the placenames are M\u0101ori, such as Whangarei, Rotorua, and Timaru. Lots of government or city buildings use te reo on their signs as well as English, and most of the public schools have a M\u0101ori name as well as an English one.\nTe Reo M\u0101ori did not have a writing system until the Europeans arrived. In 1817, a Ng\u0101puhi chief, T\u012Btori, and his relative Tui worked with Professor Samuel Lee and prepared a writing system for \"te reo\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":50},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":66},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":79},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":100},{"uri":"Austronesian_languages","surface_form":"Austronesian language","offset":122}]}
