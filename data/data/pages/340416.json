The Riversleigh site is part of the Lawn Hill National Park.\nThe sites are important for their extinct marsupials. The fossils show the evolution of mammals in Australia over the last 20 million years. The Naracoorte site is part of the Naracoorte Caves National Park. Its fossils show the way marsupials adapted to the great climate changes that have affected the world over the last 170,000 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":42},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":49},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":72},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":87},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":155},{"uri":"Cainozoic","surface_form":"Cainozoic","offset":172},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":182},{"uri":"Riversleigh%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Riversleigh","offset":203},{"uri":"Narcoorte%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Naracoorte","offset":261},{"uri":"Lawn_Hill_National_Park","surface_form":"Lawn Hill National Park","offset":356},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":423},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":456},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":469},{"uri":"Naracoorte_Caves_National_Park","surface_form":"Naracoorte Caves National Park","offset":557},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":614},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":646}]}
