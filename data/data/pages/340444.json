It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe site covers and includes the Bungle Bungle Ranges. The ranges are made from Devonian era sandstone and have been eroded over 20 million years into shapes like towers and cones. The sandstone has horizontal stripes of orange coloured by iron oxide which dry out quickly, and dark strips where bacteria are growing in damp layers of stone. Other areas of the park include the sand plains which surround the Bungle Bungles; the Ord River valley, and limestone ridges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UNESCO World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":30},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":41},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":76},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":103},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":110},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":211},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":224},{"uri":"Eroded","surface_form":"eroded","offset":248},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":330},{"uri":"Iron_oxide","surface_form":"iron oxide","offset":371},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":427},{"uri":"Ord_River","surface_form":"Ord River","offset":560},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":582}]}
