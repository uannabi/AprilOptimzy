{"id":34047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonorrhea","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gonorrhea is a disease. It is transmitted by having sex. It is among the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases. Gonorrhea is also sometimes called \"the clap.\" Gonorrhea can be cured using antibiotics but the entire course of antibiotics must be used.\nIts presence was found up to 700 years ago. At that time, this disease was described by coming from the \"Le Clapiers\" part of the city of Paris. This part of the city was known to be where prostitutes lived.\nCleanup.\nIt is caused by a bacterium, \"Neisseria gonorrheae\". Since it is caused by a bacterium, it can be treated with antibiotics. The use of latex condoms when having sex can prevent it from spreading. Sometimes antibiotics do not cure gonorrhea. This is because the bacterium is becoming immune or resistant to the medicine. When this happens, the infection is more difficult to cure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":28},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":65},{"uri":"Sexually_transmitted_disease","surface_form":"sexually transmitted disease","offset":102},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":209},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":507},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":600},{"uri":"Latex","surface_form":"latex","offset":624},{"uri":"Condom","surface_form":"condom","offset":630}]}
