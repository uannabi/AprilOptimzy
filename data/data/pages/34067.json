{"id":34067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavo_(genus)","text":"The Asiatic peafowl is a kind of bird. They are the genus \"Pavo\" from the Phasianidae family. They originate from Southeast Asia.\nThe male is called a \"peacock\", the female a \"peahen\".\nThe males are very colorful, and they have very long \"train feathers\" (or \"tail feathers\"), which they can move up like a fan. Females are less colorful, and do not have the long train-feathers. Both the male and the female have a little \"crown\" of feathers on their head.\nMales show their train feathers to court a female peafowl, or to scare other animals away by making them afraid.\nPeafowl are omnivorous and eat plant parts, flower petals, seeds, insects, and small vertebrates, like reptiles and amphibians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peafowl","surface_form":"peafowl","offset":12},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":33},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":52},{"uri":"Phasianidae","surface_form":"Phasianidae","offset":74},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":86},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":114},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":245},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":307},{"uri":"Omnivorous","surface_form":"omnivorous","offset":583},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":602},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":630},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":637},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":656},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":674},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":687}]}
