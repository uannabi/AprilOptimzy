{"id":34069,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozen","text":"A dozen is a unit of measurement. It means twelve (12) items of something. The term goes back to \"duodecim\", which means 12 in Latin. Humans might have started to count on a base 12 because there are approximately 12 cycles of the moon in one cycle of the sun. In other words, a solar year has 12 months. The first to have used the unit were probably the Mesopotamians.\n12 dozen (144 items) are a gross. 12 gross (1728 items) are called a \"great gross\".\nA great hundred is 120 or ten dozen (a dozen for each finger on both hands).\nThe dozen is convenient because its multipliers and multiples are convenient: 12 = 3 \u00D7 2 \u00D7 2, and 360 = 30 \u00D7 12. The French word \"douzaine\" means \"about twelve\" and is part of a family of words with similar meanings, e.g. \"vingtaine\" \u2013 \"about 20\" \"centaine\" \u2013 \"about 100\" etc. A baker's dozen, also known as a long dozen, is thirteen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":127},{"uri":"Cycle","surface_form":"cycle","offset":217},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":231},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":256},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":355},{"uri":"Gross_(unit)","surface_form":"gross","offset":397},{"uri":"Great_gross","surface_form":"great gross","offset":440},{"uri":"Great_hundred","surface_form":"great hundred","offset":456},{"uri":"French_Language","surface_form":"French","offset":648},{"uri":"Baker%27s_dozen","surface_form":"baker's dozen","offset":810},{"uri":"Thirteen","surface_form":"thirteen","offset":856}]}
