There are Marxist pictures.\nIn the center is a machete and hoe. These show the revolution through which the nation gained independence, and the importance of agricultural workers. Above both emblems is a red star. The red star is often in many socialist images. The rising sun is the normal symbol of a new beginning. The half cog-wheel is for the industrial workers. The half vine of coffee and cotton leaves is for the coffee and cotton industry.\nAt the bottom is an open book that is for education. A banner reads \"Republic of Angola\" at the bottom, in Portuguese.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":14},{"uri":"Marxism","surface_form":"Marxist","offset":99},{"uri":"Machete","surface_form":"machete","offset":136},{"uri":"Red_star","surface_form":"red star","offset":293},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":474},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":485},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":645}]}
