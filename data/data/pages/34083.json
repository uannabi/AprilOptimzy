{"id":34083,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampedusa","text":"Lampedusa is the largest of the Pelagie Islands. Sicily is 205\u00A0km to the north, Tunisia is 113\u00A0km to the south. There are no sources of freshwater on the island, so those living there collect rainwater. Fauna and Flora, as well as the climate is similar to what can be found in North Africa.\nThere is a NATO base on the island. It is also a popular destination for refugees who try to enter the European Union that way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pelagie_Islands","surface_form":"Pelagie Islands","offset":32},{"uri":"Sicily","surface_form":"Sicily","offset":49},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":80},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":136},{"uri":"Rainwater","surface_form":"rainwater","offset":192},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"Fauna","offset":203},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"Flora","offset":213},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":278},{"uri":"North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation","surface_form":"NATO","offset":303},{"uri":"Refugee","surface_form":"refugee","offset":365},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":395}]}
