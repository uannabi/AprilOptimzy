{"id":34089,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_speaker","text":"e=\"preserve\">A native speaker is someone who learned to speak a language as part of his or her childhood development. A native speaker's language is usually the language their parents speak and/or the language of their country of origin. It is the only language of a monolingual person, and likely the first language of a multilingual person which is acquired naturally in their native environment. It may serve as the basis for their sociolinguistic identity.\nMany people who hire language teachers prefer native speakers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":64},{"uri":"Parents","surface_form":"parents","offset":176},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":219},{"uri":"Multilingual","surface_form":"multilingual","offset":322}]}
