It tells the story of an Army Captain who is sent on a boat deep into the Cambodian jungle to capture a Special Forces colonel who, it is suggested, has gone insane. It was partly based on Joseph Conrad's novel about a journey down the Congo River, \"Heart of Darkness\".\nIt is now thought to be a great movie, but in the making it ran into problems. Its key star Martin Sheen, is on the screen for almost all the movie. He had a breakdown, and a heart attack. Editing the mile plus of film took years. It was unfinished when it was shown in the Cannes Film Festival.\n\"Apocalypse Now\" is today considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards at the 52nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Coppola), and Best Supporting Actor for Robert Duvall. It went on to win for Best Cinematography and Best Sound. It ranked #14 in \"Sight & Sound\"s greatest films poll in 2012, and #6 in the Director's Poll of greatest films of all time.\nThe film as now shown on streaming channels is the Director's \"Final Cut\". This was first shown in 2019 at the Tribeca Film Festival. It runs for 3 hours, 3 minutes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":27},{"uri":"Epic","surface_form":"epic","offset":36},{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama movie","offset":41},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":53},{"uri":"Francis_Ford_Coppola","surface_form":"Francis Ford Coppola","offset":65},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":98},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":156},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":243},{"uri":"Insane","surface_form":"insane","offset":327},{"uri":"Joseph_Conrad","surface_form":"Joseph Conrad","offset":358},{"uri":"Congo_River","surface_form":"Congo River","offset":405},{"uri":"Heart_of_Darkness","surface_form":"Heart of Darkness","offset":419},{"uri":"Martin_Sheen","surface_form":"Martin Sheen","offset":531},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":614},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":640},{"uri":"Cannes_Film_Festival","surface_form":"Cannes Film Festival","offset":713},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":842},{"uri":"52nd_Academy_Awards","surface_form":"52nd Academy Awards","offset":864},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture","surface_form":"Best Picture","offset":895},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Director","surface_form":"Best Director","offset":909},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor","surface_form":"Best Supporting Actor","offset":938},{"uri":"Robert_Duvall","surface_form":"Robert Duvall","offset":964},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography","surface_form":"Best Cinematography","offset":1001},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Sound_Mixing","surface_form":"Best Sound","offset":1025},{"uri":"Sight_%26amp%3B_Sound","surface_form":"Sight & Sound","offset":1055},{"uri":"Tribeca_Film_Festival","surface_form":"Tribeca Film Festival","offset":1272}]}
