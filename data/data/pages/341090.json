{"id":341090,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Bridge","text":"The Iron Bridge was the first arch bridge in the world to be made out of cast iron.\nThe bridge crosses the River Severn at the Ironbridge Gorge, by the village of Ironbridge, in Shropshire, England.\nIt is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is maintained by English Heritage who launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2017 to support a conservation project which began in 2018. As well as repairing rusted parts of the bridge, it was painted red to match a painting from 1777 showing how the Iron Bridge looked soon after it was finished.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cast_iron","surface_form":"cast iron","offset":73},{"uri":"River_Severn","surface_form":"River Severn","offset":107},{"uri":"Ironbridge_Gorge","surface_form":"Ironbridge Gorge","offset":127},{"uri":"Ironbridge","surface_form":"Ironbridge","offset":163},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":178},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":190},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":215},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":222},{"uri":"English_Heritage","surface_form":"English Heritage","offset":263}]}
