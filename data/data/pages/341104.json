{"id":341104,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_of_July_Movement","text":"The 26th of July Movement was the name of the political party led by Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution. In Spanish, it is called Movimiento 26 de Julio, it is often abbreviated M-26-7. The name comes from the date of the attack on the Moncada Barracks, in Santiago de Cuba, which was carried out on 26th July 1953. The participants were condemned to long prison terms, but were freed at an amnesty in 1955. After this, they formed the movement. Their strategy was armed resistance, in small cells, that were spread all over the country, and were kept secret. Frank Pa\u00EDs was made the leader of the resistance in Cuba, other activists were Ra\u00FAl Pujol, Celia S\u00E1nchez, Hayd\u00E9e Santamar\u00EDa, Aldo Santamar\u00EDa and Vilma Esp\u00EDn.\nFidel castro and other Moncadistas went into exile. Castro went to Mexico, where he met Ernesto Guevara. In 1956, Fidel and Raul Castro, Juan Almeida Bosque, Ramiro Vald\u00E9s Men\u00E9ndez, Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos went back to Cuba to support the cells there. After two years of guerilla fighting, Fulgencio Batista fled from Cuba, in 1959.\nUntil the fall of Batista, the forces did not have a Marxist ideology, rather they were different people collaborating to overturn the Batista regime. Later they started to work together with the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1961, they merged with the Communist Party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":69},{"uri":"Cuban_Revolution","surface_form":"Cuban Revolution","offset":93},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":114},{"uri":"Moncada_Barracks","surface_form":"Moncada Barracks","offset":242},{"uri":"Santiago_de_Cuba","surface_form":"Santiago de Cuba","offset":263},{"uri":"Amnesty","surface_form":"amnesty","offset":397},{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategy","offset":458},{"uri":"Frank_Pa%C3%ADs","surface_form":"Frank Pa\u00EDs","offset":566},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":618},{"uri":"Ra%C3%BAl_Pujol","surface_form":"Ra\u00FAl Pujol","offset":645},{"uri":"Celia_S%C3%A1nchez","surface_form":"Celia S\u00E1nchez","offset":657},{"uri":"Hayd%C3%A9e_Santamar%C3%ADa","surface_form":"Hayd\u00E9e Santamar\u00EDa","offset":672},{"uri":"Aldo_Santamar%C3%ADa","surface_form":"Aldo Santamar\u00EDa","offset":691},{"uri":"Vilma_Esp%C3%ADn","surface_form":"Vilma Esp\u00EDn","offset":711},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":769},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":791},{"uri":"Che_Guevara","surface_form":"Ernesto Guevara","offset":812},{"uri":"Raul_Castro","surface_form":"Raul Castro","offset":848},{"uri":"Juan_Almeida_Bosque","surface_form":"Juan Almeida Bosque","offset":861},{"uri":"Ramiro_Vald%C3%A9s_Men%C3%A9ndez","surface_form":"Ramiro Vald\u00E9s Men\u00E9ndez","offset":882},{"uri":"Camilo_Cienfuegos","surface_form":"Camilo Cienfuegos","offset":919},{"uri":"Guerilla","surface_form":"guerilla","offset":1002},{"uri":"Fulgencio_Batista","surface_form":"Fulgencio Batista","offset":1021},{"uri":"Marxism","surface_form":"Marxist","offset":1117},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideology","offset":1125},{"uri":"Regime","surface_form":"regime","offset":1207},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"Communist Party of Cuba","offset":1260}]}
