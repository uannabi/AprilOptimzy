{"id":341510,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Information asymmetry is a concept in economics and contract theory. It says that in any given contract the two parties of the contract do not have the same information. Information economics is a field of science that looks at some of the problems that result from this bias. Neoclassical economics assumes there is perfect information: all the actors know all the states of their environment; they can also observe what all the other actors do. Information is free -it has no cost in the economic sense. This is also true for the ability to observe the other parties.\nModel.\nA model called New institutional economics changes this: information is no longer free, there are costs associated with obtaining information.\nHistory.\nIn 2001, the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz \"for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":40},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":51},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":108},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":170},{"uri":"Information_economics","surface_form":"Information economics","offset":183},{"uri":"Bias","surface_form":"bias","offset":284},{"uri":"Neoclassical_economics","surface_form":"Neoclassical economics","offset":290},{"uri":"Cost","surface_form":"cost","offset":491},{"uri":"New_institutional_economics","surface_form":"New institutional economics","offset":605},{"uri":"Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Economics","offset":755},{"uri":"George_Akerlof","surface_form":"George Akerlof","offset":795},{"uri":"Michael_Spence","surface_form":"Michael Spence","offset":811},{"uri":"Joseph_E._Stiglitz","surface_form":"Joseph E.
