{"id":341519,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Argentina","text":"The coat of arms of Argentina was used in its current form in 1944. It started in the seal of the General Constituent Assembly of 1813.\nIt is not known who made the coat of arms. At the top is the gold-yellowed Sun of May, also found on the flag of Argentina. The rising sun is for the rising of Argentina. In the center, there are two shaking hands. This is for the unity of the Provinces of Argentina. The hands come together to hold a pike. This shows power and willingness to defend freedom. The Phrygian cap is on the top of the spear.\nThe blue and white colors are for the Argentine people. They are the same colors of the Argentine flag. The blue half is for the sky and the white is for the R\u00EDo de la Plata.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":20},{"uri":"Sun_of_May","surface_form":"Sun of May","offset":211},{"uri":"Flag_of_Argentina","surface_form":"flag of Argentina","offset":241},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Argentina","surface_form":"Provinces of Argentina","offset":380},{"uri":"Pike","surface_form":"pike","offset":438},{"uri":"Phrygian_cap","surface_form":"Phrygian cap","offset":500},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata","surface_form":"R\u00EDo de la Plata","offset":699}]}
