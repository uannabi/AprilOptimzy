It has some of the most dramatic landscapes on Earth. It has the southern section of the Andes mountains to the southwest towards the Pacific ocean.\nGeography.\nIt follows south through the Colorado River towards Carmen de Patagones in the Atlantic Ocean. To the west, it includes the Valdivia through Tierra del Fuego archipelago.\nThe name Patagonia is from the word \"patag\u00F3n\" used by Magellan in 1520. The word was for the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. Now people think the Patagons were actually Tehuelches. They had an average height of 180\u00A0cm (~5\u203211\u2033) compared to the 155\u00A0cm (~5\u20321\u2033) average for Spaniards of the time.\nAnimals.\nThe guanaco, the cougar, the Patagonian fox, the Patagonian hog-nosed skunk, and the Magellanic Tuco-tuco are the most common mammals of the Patagonian plains. There are also many birds. Southern Caracara, Austral parakeets, and Green-backed Firecrowns are some. Waterfowl include Chilean Flamingo, Upland Goose, and steamer ducks.\nFamous marine fauna include the southern right whale, the Magellanic Penguin, the orca and elephant seals. The Vald\u00E9s Peninsula is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its importance as a nature reserve.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":36},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":72},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":86},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":182},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_Colorado_(Argentina)","surface_form":"Colorado River","offset":282},{"uri":"Carmen_de_Patagones","surface_form":"Carmen de Patagones","offset":305},{"uri":"Valdivia","surface_form":"Valdivia","offset":377},{"uri":"Tierra_del_Fuego","surface_form":"Tierra del Fuego","offset":394},{"uri":"Patagon","surface_form":"patag\u00F3n","offset":461},{"uri":"Ferdinand_Magellan","surface_form":"Magellan","offset":478},{"uri":"Tehuelche_people","surface_form":"Tehuelches","offset":617},{"uri":"Guanaco","surface_form":"guanaco","offset":754},{"uri":"Cougar","surface_form":"cougar","offset":767},{"uri":"South_American_gray_fox","surface_form":"Patagonian fox","offset":779},{"uri":"Humboldt%27s_hog-nosed_skunk","surface_form":"Patagonian hog-nosed skunk","offset":799},{"uri":"Magellanic_Tuco-tuco","surface_form":"Magellanic Tuco-tuco","offset":835},{"uri":"Southern_Caracara","surface_form":"Southern Caracara","offset":937},{"uri":"Austral_parakeet","surface_form":"Austral parakeet","offset":956},{"uri":"Green-backed_Firecrown","surface_form":"Green-backed Firecrown","offset":979},{"uri":"Chilean_Flamingo","surface_form":"Chilean Flamingo","offset":1031},{"uri":"Upland_Goose","surface_form":"Upland Goose","offset":1049},{"uri":"Steamer_duck","surface_form":"steamer duck","offset":1067},{"uri":"Southern_right_whale","surface_form":"southern right whale","offset":1114},{"uri":"Magellanic_Penguin","surface_form":"Magellanic Penguin","offset":1140},{"uri":"Orca","surface_form":"orca","offset":1164},{"uri":"Elephant_seal","surface_form":"elephant seal","offset":1173},{"uri":"Valdes_Peninsula","surface_form":"Vald\u00E9s Peninsula","offset":1193},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":1215},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":1222}]}
