{"id":341825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture","text":"The Kepler conjecture is a problem in math. It wants to know the best way to put spheres together so there will be only a little bit of room between the spheres. That means the spheres are put together very tightly, meaning they are dense.\nDetails.\nThe Kepler conjecture is about Sphere packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is named after Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who first had this idea. Kepler supposed that the ways to pack spheres of equal size that result in the packing with the highest density are face-centered cubic or hexagonal packings. Those two things are crystal structures, meaning ways to put things together in a repeating pattern. These packings have a density of slightly over 74 percent, this means that they fill about 74 percent of space available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conjecture","surface_form":"problem","offset":27},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"math","offset":38},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":81},{"uri":"Dense","surface_form":"dense","offset":233},{"uri":"Sphere_packing","surface_form":"Sphere packing","offset":280},{"uri":"Eucliean_geometry","surface_form":"Euclidean","offset":316},{"uri":"Johannes_Kepler","surface_form":"Johannes Kepler","offset":351},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":442},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":508},{"uri":"Cubic_crystal_system","surface_form":"face-centered cubic","offset":520},{"uri":"Hexagonal_crystal_system","surface_form":"hexagonal","offset":543}]}
