{"id":341826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing","text":"In geometry, Sphere packing refers to a number of problems that try to arrange spheres in space. Very often, the spheres all have the same size, and the space used is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. The problem is part of packing problems. When it is generalised, not all the spheres need to have the same size, and spaces can be n-dimensional Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space.\nA typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":79},{"uri":"Euclidean_space","surface_form":"Euclidean space","offset":193},{"uri":"Packing_problem","surface_form":"packing problem","offset":233},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_space","surface_form":"hyperbolic space","offset":375},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":768},{"uri":"Asymptotic","surface_form":"asymptotic","offset":779}]}
