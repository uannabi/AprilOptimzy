It is an estuary made from the Uruguay River and the Paran\u00E1 River. These rivers are on the border between Argentina and Uruguay. It is about long.\nThe R\u00EDo de la Plata widens from about at the inner part to about at its mouth. Buenos Aires is on its western shore. Montevideo is on its northern shores.\nThe R\u00EDo de la Plata is home for the loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, the rare La Plata dolphin, and many species of fish.\nBattle of the River Plate (1939).\nThe first naval battle of the Second World War was fought near the River Plata. The Kriegsmarine \"pocket battleship\" \"Admiral Graf Spee\" was engaged by the Royal Navy cruisers, and off the estuary of the River Plate in December 1939.\nThe German ship retired up the estuary with a crippled fuel system and put into port at Montevideo. A few days later, rather than fight outgunned against the British, she was scuttled in the estuary. This engagement was part of the early Battle of the Atlantic skirmishes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":42},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":72},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":92},{"uri":"Uruguay_River","surface_form":"Uruguay River","offset":114},{"uri":"Paran%C3%A1_River","surface_form":"Paran\u00E1 River","offset":136},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":203},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":309},{"uri":"Montevideo","surface_form":"Montevideo","offset":347},{"uri":"Loggerhead_sea_turtle","surface_form":"loggerhead sea turtle","offset":421},{"uri":"Green_sea_turtle","surface_form":"green sea turtle","offset":444},{"uri":"Leatherback_sea_turtle","surface_form":"leatherback sea turtle","offset":462},{"uri":"La_Plata_dolphin","surface_form":"La Plata dolphin","offset":495},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":603},{"uri":"Kriegsmarine","surface_form":"Kriegsmarine","offset":657},{"uri":"Battleship","surface_form":"battleship","offset":678},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":729},{"uri":"Cruiser","surface_form":"cruiser","offset":740},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":762},{"uri":"Montevideo","surface_form":"Montevideo","offset":895},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Atlantic","surface_form":"Battle of the Atlantic","offset":1045}]}
