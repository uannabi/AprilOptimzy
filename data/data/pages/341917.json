{"id":341917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourr%C3%A9e","text":"=\"preserve\">The Bourr\u00E9e is a quick double time dance of French origins. It is similar to a Gavotte, but has a 1 beat anacruis (upbeat), where the gavotte has a 2 beat anacrusis.\nIt often has a rhythm with a strong beat followed by two weaker ones. For example, an accented crochet followed by two quavers. This is called dactylic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":47},{"uri":"Gavotte","surface_form":"Gavotte","offset":91},{"uri":"Anacrusis","surface_form":"anacrusis","offset":167},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":193}]}
