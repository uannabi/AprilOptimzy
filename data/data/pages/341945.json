{"id":341945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_Collegiate_School","text":"North London Collegiate School is an independent school for girls between the ages of 4-18. It is located in Harrow, London. It was established by Frances Mary Buss in 1850. Frances Mary Buss originally opened the school in her own home in Camden Town, London. It later moved to Canons, Edgware in the 1930s. It is thought to be the first girls' school in the United Kingdom, and the first to give girls the same chances to learn things as boys were given.\nGirls travel from all over London to attend the school. Famous women who were pupils there include Anna Wintour, Susie Orbach, and Rachel Weisz.\nIn September 2011 NLCS opened a new school in Jeju, South Korea. NLCS Jeju is a mixed school.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Harrow","surface_form":"Harrow","offset":109},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":117},{"uri":"Frances_Mary_Buss","surface_form":"Frances Mary Buss","offset":147},{"uri":"Camden_Town","surface_form":"Camden Town","offset":240},{"uri":"Edgware","surface_form":"Edgware","offset":287},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":360},{"uri":"Anna_Wintour","surface_form":"Anna Wintour","offset":556},{"uri":"Susie_Orbach","surface_form":"Susie Orbach","offset":570},{"uri":"Rachel_Weisz","surface_form":"Rachel Weisz","offset":588},{"uri":"Jeju-do","surface_form":"Jeju","offset":648},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":654}]}
