{"id":341961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Taylor_(mathematician)","text":"Richard Lawrence Taylor (born 19 May 1962) is a British mathematician. He works in number theory. He was a former research student of Andrew Wiles. He returned to Princeton to help Wiles complete the proof of Fermat's last theorem.\nTaylor received the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences. This for his work on the Langlands program. He did this work with Robert Langlands.\nCareer.\nTaylor received his B.A. from Clare College, Cambridge. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1988. From 1995 to 1996 he held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford University. He was also a Fellow of New College, Oxford. Currently, he is the Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University.\nHe received the Whitehead Prize in 1990, the Fermat Prize and the Ostrowski Prize in 2001. He also got the Cole Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 2002, and the Shaw Prize for Mathematics in 2007. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1995.\nWork.\nThere are two papers which have the complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. One of them was written by Taylor with Andrew Wiles.\nIn his later work, Taylor (along with Michael Harris) proved the local Langlands conjectures. A simpler proof was suggested almost at the same time by Guy Henniart.\nLater, together with Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, and Fred Diamond, he completed proving the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture, by performing very difficult computations.\nRecently, Taylor, following the ideas of Michael Harris, developed on his work with Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, and Nick Shepherd-Barron. He has announced that he proved the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture, for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant. This partial proof of the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture uses a theorem of Wiles.\nPersonal life.\nTaylor is married to Christine Taylor. She is a mathematical biologist. They have two children: Jeremy and Chloe. He is also the son of British physicist, John C. Taylor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":48},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":56},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":83},{"uri":"Andrew_Wiles","surface_form":"Andrew Wiles","offset":134},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton","offset":163},{"uri":"Fermat%27s_last_theorem","surface_form":"Fermat's last theorem","offset":209},{"uri":"Shaw_Prize","surface_form":"Shaw Prize","offset":257},{"uri":"Langlands_program","surface_form":"Langlands program","offset":319},{"uri":"Robert_Langlands","surface_form":"Robert Langlands","offset":360},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"B.A.","offset":406},{"uri":"Clare_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Clare College, Cambridge","offset":416},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":458},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton University","offset":469},{"uri":"Savilian_chair_of_geometry","surface_form":"Savilian Chair of Geometry","offset":529},{"uri":"Oxford_University","surface_form":"Oxford University","offset":559},{"uri":"New_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"New College, Oxford","offset":602},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":686},{"uri":"Whitehead_Prize","surface_form":"Whitehead Prize","offset":722},{"uri":"Fermat_Prize","surface_form":"Fermat Prize","offset":751},{"uri":"Ostrowski_Prize","surface_form":"Ostrowski Prize","offset":772},{"uri":"Cole_Prize","surface_form":"Cole Prize","offset":813},{"uri":"American_Mathematical_Society","surface_form":"American Mathematical Society","offset":831},{"uri":"Shaw_Prize","surface_form":"Shaw Prize","offset":878},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"Fellow of the Royal Society","offset":936},{"uri":"Andrew_Wiles","surface_form":"Andrew Wiles","offset":1095},{"uri":"Michael_Harris_(mathematician)","surface_form":"Michael Harris","offset":1147},{"uri":"Local_Langlands_conjectures","surface_form":"local Langlands conjectures","offset":1174},{"uri":"Guy_Henniart","surface_form":"Guy Henniart","offset":1260},{"uri":"Christophe_Breuil","surface_form":"Christophe Breuil","offset":1295},{"uri":"Brian_Conrad","surface_form":"Brian Conrad","offset":1314},{"uri":"Fred_Diamond","surface_form":"Fred Diamond","offset":1332},{"uri":"Taniyama%E2%80%93Shimura_conjecture","surface_form":"Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture","offset":1371},{"uri":"Laurent_Clozel","surface_form":"Laurent Clozel","offset":1527},{"uri":"Nick_Shepherd-Barron","surface_form":"Nick Shepherd-Barron","offset":1563},{"uri":"Sato%E2%80%93Tate_conjecture","surface_form":"Sato\u2013Tate conjecture","offset":1621},{"uri":"Elliptic_curve","surface_form":"elliptic curve","offset":1647},{"uri":"J-invariant","surface_form":"j-invariant","offset":1681},{"uri":"Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology","surface_form":"mathematical biologist","offset":1829},{"uri":"John_C._Taylor_(physicist)","surface_form":"John C.
