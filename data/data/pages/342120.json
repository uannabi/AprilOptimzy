{"id":342120,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma","text":"e=\"preserve\">False dilemma, also called the either-or fallacy, us vs. them fallacy, black-or-white fallacy, false dichotomy, or the fallacy of false choice, is a mistake in logic that allows only two possibilities when more than two exist.\nFor example, there is \"either-or fallacy\" in saying that an apple must be green or red. The premise is that the apple is either one color or another; but this beginning is a mistake because some apples\u2014not most\u2014are other colors. In other words, most apples are red or green, but some are also yellow.\nA \"fallacy of false choice\" may hide a deliberate attempt to eliminate agreement on an issue. Eldridge Cleaver used this tactic when he said: \"You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.\"\nA false dilemma may also be used for comedic effect. Stephen Colbert used this tactic when he asked guests on The Colbert Report: \"George Bush... great president or the greatest president?\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":173},{"uri":"Premise","surface_form":"premise","offset":332},{"uri":"Agreement","surface_form":"agreement","offset":612},{"uri":"Eldridge_Cleaver","surface_form":"Eldridge Cleaver","offset":635},{"uri":"Tactic","surface_form":"tactic","offset":662}]}
