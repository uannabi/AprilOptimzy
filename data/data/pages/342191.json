{"id":342191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Revolution","text":"The May Revolution happened from May 18 to 25, 1810, in Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires was the capital of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00EDo de la Plata. It was a Spanish colony that included roughly the territories of present-day Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. The result was the removal of Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and the forming of a local government now called the \"Primera Junta\". In Argentina this is now celebrated as \"May Week\" ().\nThe May Revolution was a direct reaction to Spain's Peninsular War of the previous two years. In 1808, King Ferdinand\u00A0VII of Spain abdicated in favor of Napoleon. Napoleon gave the throne to his brother, Joseph Bonaparte.\nThe May Revolution began the Argentine War of Independence. No formal declaration of independence was made. The Primera Junta continued to govern in the name of the deposed king, Ferdinand\u00A0VII. The Argentine Declaration of Independence was made at the Congress of Tucum\u00E1n on July 9, 1816.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":56},{"uri":"Viceroyalty_of_the_R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata","surface_form":"Viceroyalty of the R\u00EDo de la Plata","offset":106},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":219},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":230},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":239},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":252},{"uri":"Viceroy","surface_form":"Viceroy","offset":291},{"uri":"Baltasar_Hidalgo_de_Cisneros","surface_form":"Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros","offset":299},{"uri":"Peninsular_War","surface_form":"Peninsular War","offset":504},{"uri":"Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain","surface_form":"Ferdinand\u00A0VII of Spain","offset":560},{"uri":"Abdicated","surface_form":"abdicated","offset":583},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":605},{"uri":"Joseph_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Joseph Bonaparte","offset":656},{"uri":"Argentine_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"Argentine War of Independence","offset":703},{"uri":"Argentine_Declaration_of_Independence","surface_form":"Argentine Declaration of Independence","offset":872},{"uri":"Congress_of_Tucum%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Congress of Tucum\u00E1n","offset":926}]}
