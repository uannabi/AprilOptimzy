{"id":34233,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin","text":"Idi Amin Dada (17 August 1925 \u2013 16 August 2003) was a repressive dictator of the African country of Uganda. The President of Tanzania at the time, Julius Nyerere, invaded Uganda to save the country from Amin.\nAmin was famous for sending all Asians, mainly from India and Pakistan, out of Uganda. He threw them out because he believed they were taking the jobs of Ugandans. Many of the Asians that left Uganda came back after Amin was thrown out.\nHe was a convert to Islam. He supported the cause of Palestine freedom. This caused the hijacking of an Air France flight that landed in Entebbe, Uganda.\nAmin became known as a very brutal leader and in the 1970s he was compared to historical persons such as Caligula, Hitler, Beria and Himmler. In several of the neighboring countries he was stamped as \"sadist, murderer, fascist and oppressor.\"\nIn 2003, Amin died in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from kidney failure at age 77. He lived in Saudi Arabia after being thrown out of Uganda, he was barred from ever returning since he left. He died one day before his 78th birthday.\nHe was put on life support on July 18, but when his organs began to fail, life support mechanism was disconnected by his family. He was buried without any memorial in a simple grave without headstone.\n\"The Last King of Scotland\" (2006) is a movie about Amin's government. Forest Whitaker won an Academy Award for best actor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":65},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":81},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":89},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":100},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":112},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":125},{"uri":"Julius_Nyerere","surface_form":"Julius Nyerere","offset":147},{"uri":"Asians","surface_form":"Asians","offset":241},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":261},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":271},{"uri":"Convert","surface_form":"convert","offset":455},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":466},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":499},{"uri":"Hijacking","surface_form":"hijacking","offset":534},{"uri":"Air_France","surface_form":"Air France","offset":550},{"uri":"Entebbe","surface_form":"Entebbe","offset":583},{"uri":"Caligula","surface_form":"Caligula","offset":705},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":715},{"uri":"Beria","surface_form":"Beria","offset":723},{"uri":"Himmler","surface_form":"Himmler","offset":733},{"uri":"Sadism","surface_form":"sadist","offset":801},{"uri":"Murderer","surface_form":"murderer","offset":809},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"fascist","offset":819},{"uri":"Oppression","surface_form":"oppressor","offset":831},{"uri":"Jeddah","surface_form":"Jeddah","offset":865},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":873},{"uri":"Kidney_failure","surface_form":"kidney failure","offset":891},{"uri":"Life_support","surface_form":"life support","offset":1081},{"uri":"The_Last_King_of_Scotland","surface_form":"The Last King of Scotland","offset":1269},{"uri":"Forest_Whitaker","surface_form":"Forest Whitaker","offset":1339},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":1362},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":1385}]}
