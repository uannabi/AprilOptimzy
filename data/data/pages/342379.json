{"id":342379,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3","text":"=\"preserve\">The ISO 639-3 is the third version of a set of international standards that lists short codes for language names. Such codes are also known as language codes. Before this version was out, there was already ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2, but due to the increase in languages being added to the database, ISO639-3 was therefore released, and all language codes have three letters, unlike the previous two, which allowed two letters in the code.\nEach known language has a 3 letter code, and requests to add additional languages into the database can be made at the SIL International website. The standard was published by ISO on 2007-02-05.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_standard","surface_form":"international standard","offset":59},{"uri":"ISO_639-1","surface_form":"ISO 639-1","offset":218},{"uri":"ISO_639-2","surface_form":"ISO 639-2","offset":232}]}
