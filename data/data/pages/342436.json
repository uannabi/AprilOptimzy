{"id":342436,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Myanmar","text":"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) people in Myanmar face legal challenges and discrimination not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal within the Union of Myanmar and punishable by fines and imprisonment for ten years to life. The past authoritarian nature of the government made it difficult to obtain accurate information about the legal or social status of LGBT citizens of Myanmar. However, along with the ongoing political reforms, improvements in media and civil freedoms have allowed LGBT people to gain more and more recognition in the country.\nDuring the Military regime, no organised Bangladeshi LGBT political or social life was able to exist. Burma's social mores about human sexuality have been described as being \"extremely conservative.\" Aung Myo Min is an openly gay man and has been involved in the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF). In 2005 he talked about his coming out process and the homophobia that exists, even with the pro-democracy opposition. Today he is involved with exile Burma human rights organizations, including the Campaign for Lesbian Gay Rights in Burma. In 2003, Focus Asia (Star TV) aired a story about the Nat Kadaws. The \"Utopia Guide to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar & Vietnam\" references \"Transgender shaman channelling spirits at Myanmar sacred festivals.\" Yet, within Burma itself, no formal gay bars or LGBT human rights organisations exist as of yet. There are only some unconfirmed reports that certain nightclubs in the cities that are a reputation for both heterosexual and LGBT clientele. Burma also celebrated its first gay pride in several cities around the country in 2012, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":37},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":53}]}
