{"id":342652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_rifle","text":"Usually, an automatic rifle is a rifle that continuously fires bullet as long as the trigger is pressed. Cartridge shells are ejected and new cartridges are loaded into the chamber automatically. However, most automatic rifles are designed to give both semi- and fully automatic fire. This is called selective fire. They also rifle bullets from a magazine. These features makes them different from other automatic firearms like the machine gun and submachine gun.\nUse.\nSoldiers in the United States Army who carry the M249 SAW are called \"automatic riflemen\". The weapon is also called an \"automatic rifle\". However, it is a fully automatic firearm. These are normally called squad automatic weapons (SAW) or light machine guns.\nAn assault rifle is quite similar to an automatic rifle. However, it uses less powerful bullets than the machine gun or battle rifle. This allows the soldier using it to control the recoil of the weapon without using a bipod or something similar. Bullets like these are called \"intermediate\" bullets. For example, the AK-47 assault rifle often uses a 7.62x39mm bullet. The bullet is the same diameter. However, it is smaller and less powerful compared to the 7.62x54mmR. The 7.62x54mmR was what was being used with rifles when the AK-47 was brought in to service.\nHistory.\nThe very first automatic rifle was the Mexican Mondrag\u00F3n rifle. It was designed by General Manuel Mondrag\u00F3n. He began working on the weapon in 1882. He patented it in 1887. In the 20th century, automatic rifles go back to World War I. This is where the Browning Automatic Rifle (B.A.R.) and Huot were first used. They were supposed to be used like light machine guns to help soldiers attack. However, only the Mondrag\u00F3n rifle and the B.A.R. were used in World War I.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":63},{"uri":"Eject","surface_form":"eject","offset":126},{"uri":"Chamber_(firearms)","surface_form":"chamber","offset":173},{"uri":"Semi-automatic_firearm","surface_form":"semi","offset":253},{"uri":"Fully_automatic_firearm","surface_form":"fully","offset":263},{"uri":"Automatic_firearm","surface_form":"selective fire","offset":300},{"uri":"Magazine_(firearms)","surface_form":"magazine","offset":347},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":432},{"uri":"Submachine_gun","surface_form":"submachine gun","offset":448},{"uri":"Soldiers","surface_form":"Soldiers","offset":469},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":485},{"uri":"M249_Squad_Automatic_Weapon","surface_form":"M249 SAW","offset":518},{"uri":"Fully_automatic_firearm","surface_form":"fully automatic firearm","offset":625},{"uri":"Squad_automatic_weapon","surface_form":"squad automatic weapon","offset":676},{"uri":"Light_machine_gun","surface_form":"light machine gun","offset":709},{"uri":"Assault_rifle","surface_form":"assault rifle","offset":732},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":834},{"uri":"Battle_rifle","surface_form":"battle rifle","offset":849},{"uri":"Recoil","surface_form":"recoil","offset":911},{"uri":"Bipod","surface_form":"bipod","offset":948},{"uri":"AK-47","surface_form":"AK-47","offset":1047},{"uri":"7.62_x_39mm","surface_form":"7.62x39mm","offset":1080},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":1121},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":1341},{"uri":"Mondrag%C3%B3n_rifle","surface_form":"Mondrag\u00F3n rifle","offset":1349},{"uri":"Manuel_Mondrag%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Manuel Mondrag\u00F3n","offset":1393},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":1454},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1524},{"uri":"Browning_Automatic_Rifle","surface_form":"Browning Automatic Rifle","offset":1555},{"uri":"Huot_automatic_rifle","surface_form":"Huot","offset":1593},{"uri":"Light_machine_gun","surface_form":"light machine gun","offset":1650}]}
