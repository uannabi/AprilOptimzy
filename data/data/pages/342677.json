It was passed on 11 December 1931. The Act gave equality to the self-governing dominions of the British Empire. It is still law in each of the Commonwealth realms.\nThe Statute is important because it gave legislative freedom to these countries. Its current relevance is that it sets the basis for the continuing relationship between the Commonwealth realms and the Crown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Act","offset":38},{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Parliament of the United Kingdom","offset":49},{"uri":"Equality","surface_form":"equality","offset":131},{"uri":"Dominion","surface_form":"dominion","offset":162},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":179},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Commonwealth realm","offset":226},{"uri":"Legislative","surface_form":"legislative","offset":288},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Commonwealth realm","offset":420},{"uri":"The_Crown","surface_form":"the Crown","offset":444}]}
