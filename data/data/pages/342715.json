He was one of the leading figures of early colonial New South Wales. He was the first native-born Australian to get a reputation overseas. He wanted self-government for the Australian colonies.\nEarly life.\nIn 1796 Wentworth arrived in Sydney. It was then a poor prison settlement. The family lived at Parramatta. His father became a prosperous landowner. In 1802 he was sent to England. He went to a school in London. He returned to Sydney in 1810. He was appointed acting Provost-Marshall by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He was given a land grant of on the Nepean River.\nOn 15 October 1810, at Hyde Park, Wentworth won the first official horse races on Australian soil.\nCrossing the Blue Mountains.\nIn 1813 Wentworth, along with Gregory Blaxland and William Lawson, led the trip which found a route across the Blue Mountains. The town of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains is named for him. As a reward he was given another.\nStudying in England.\nWentworth returned to England in 1816. There he was admitted to the bar, travelled in Europe, and studied at Cambridge University.\nIn 1819 Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: \"A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America\". He said there should be an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts.\nPolitical life.\nWentworth returned to Sydney in 1824. He was joined by Robert Wardell. His father died in 1827 and William inherited his property. This made him one of the wealthiest men in the colony.\nWentworth became Vice-President of the Australian Patriotic Association and founded a newspaper, \"The Australian\". It was the colony's first privately owned paper.\nHe was elected to the Council in 1843 and soon became the leader of the conservative party. He was against the liberals led by Charles Cowper. In 1853 Wentworth chaired the committee to draft a new constitution for New South Wales. In 1856 Wentworth retired from the Council and settled in England.\nHe died in England, but at his request his body was returned to Sydney for burial.\nRecognition.\nThe towns of Wentworth and Wentworth Falls, the federal Division of Wentworth, an electorate in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, the Wentworth Falls waterfall, and Wentworth Avenue which runs through the suburb of Kingston in Canberra, were named after him.\nIn 1963 he was honoured, together with Blaxland and Lawson, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post showing the Blue Mountains crossing. Another stamp was issued again in 1974 on the anniversary of the first newspaper publication.\nThe Wentworth Building, where University of Sydney Union resides, was named after William Wentworth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":66},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"journalist","offset":93},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":172},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":355},{"uri":"Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Parramatta","offset":421},{"uri":"Governor_of_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Governor","offset":613},{"uri":"Lachlan_Macquarie","surface_form":"Lachlan Macquarie","offset":622},{"uri":"Nepean_River","surface_form":"Nepean River","offset":677},{"uri":"Hyde_Park%2C_Sydney","surface_form":"Hyde Park","offset":714},{"uri":"Gregory_Blaxland","surface_form":"Gregory Blaxland","offset":849},{"uri":"William_Lawson_(explorer)","surface_form":"William Lawson","offset":870},{"uri":"Blue_Mountains_(New_South_Wales)","surface_form":"Blue Mountains","offset":930},{"uri":"Wentworth_Falls","surface_form":"Wentworth Falls","offset":958},{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge University","offset":1178},{"uri":"Robert_Wardell","surface_form":"Robert Wardell","offset":1810},{"uri":"Charles_Cowper","surface_form":"Charles Cowper","offset":2232},{"uri":"Wentworth%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wentworth","offset":2513},{"uri":"Wentworth_Falls%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wentworth Falls","offset":2527},{"uri":"Division_of_Wentworth","surface_form":"Division of Wentworth","offset":2556},{"uri":"Wentworth_Falls_(waterfall)","surface_form":"Wentworth Falls","offset":2626},{"uri":"Wentworth_Avenue%2C_Canberra","surface_form":"Wentworth Avenue","offset":2657},{"uri":"Kingston%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory","surface_form":"Kingston","offset":2707},{"uri":"Canberra","surface_form":"Canberra","offset":2719},{"uri":"Postage_stamp","surface_form":"postage stamp","offset":2816},{"uri":"Australia_Post","surface_form":"Australia Post","offset":2840},{"uri":"University_of_Sydney_Union","surface_form":"University of Sydney Union","offset":3016}]}
