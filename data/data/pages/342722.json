{"id":342722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt","text":"In some rules of football, a punt is a play in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it touches the ground. A punt is in contrast to a drop kick, in which the ball touches the ground before being kicked.\nIn American and Canadian football, the ball is kicked downfield to the opposing team, usually on the final down, with the hope of giving the receiving team a field position that is more helpful to the kicking team when possession changes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":17},{"uri":"Drop_kick","surface_form":"drop kick","offset":147},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American","offset":219},{"uri":"Canadian_football","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":232},{"uri":"Down_(football)","surface_form":"down","offset":323}]}
