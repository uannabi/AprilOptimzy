{"id":342869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_McCullough","text":"Colleen McCullough-Robinson, AO, (1 June 1937 \u2013 29 January 2015) was an Australian author. She was famous world-wide.\nLife.\nMcCullough was born in 1937. Her parents were James and Laurie McCullough. Her mother was a New Zealander of part-M\u0101ori descent. During her childhood, her family moved many times. She read a lot. She attended Holy Cross College.\nMcCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian, and journalist. In her first year of medical studies at the University of Sydney she suffered dermatitis. She was told not to be a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to neuroscience and worked in Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.\nIn 1963, McCullough moved to the United Kingdom for four years. At Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, she met the chairman of the neurology department at Yale University. He offered her a research associate job at Yale. McCullough spent ten years from April 1967 to 1976 researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. It was while at Yale that she wrote her first two books.\nBecause these books were successful, McCullough stopped being a doctor. In the late 1970s, she lived in London and Connecticut, USA. She finally picked Norfolk Island in the Pacific. There she met her husband, Ric Robinson (then 33 years old). They married on 13 April 1983 (she was 46 years old).\nIn 1984 a portrait of McCullough, painted by Wesley Walters, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is for the \"best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics\".\nMcCullough did a lot of historical research for the novels on ancient Rome. This led to her getting a Doctor of Letters degree by Macquarie University in 1993.\nMcCullough was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She now lives in Sydney.\nSome people did not like McCullough's 2008 novel \"The Independence of Miss Mary Bennett\". She changed some of the characters in Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\".\nMcCullough died on 29 January 2015 at the age of 77 on Norfolk Island from renal failure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Australia","surface_form":"AO","offset":29},{"uri":"Australians","surface_form":"Australian","offset":72},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":238},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"journalist","offset":409},{"uri":"University_of_Sydney","surface_form":"University of Sydney","offset":465},{"uri":"Dermatitis","surface_form":"dermatitis","offset":499},{"uri":"Neuroscience","surface_form":"neuroscience","offset":577},{"uri":"Royal_North_Shore_Hospital","surface_form":"Royal North Shore Hospital","offset":604},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":675},{"uri":"Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital","surface_form":"Great Ormond Street Hospital","offset":709},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":741},{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurology","offset":777},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":801},{"uri":"Yale_Medical_School","surface_form":"Yale Medical School","offset":981},{"uri":"New_Haven%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"New Haven, Connecticut","offset":1004},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1028},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1204},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":1215},{"uri":"Norfolk_Island","surface_form":"Norfolk Island","offset":1252},{"uri":"Pacific","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":1274},{"uri":"List_of_Archibald_Prize_winners","surface_form":"Archibald Prize","offset":1481},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Rome","offset":1694},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Letters","surface_form":"Doctor of Letters","offset":1734},{"uri":"Macquarie_University","surface_form":"Macquarie University","offset":1762},{"uri":"New_York_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"New York Academy of Sciences","offset":1823},{"uri":"American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","surface_form":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","offset":1877},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":1947},{"uri":"The_Independence_of_Miss_Mary_Bennett","surface_form":"The Independence of Miss Mary Bennett","offset":2005},{"uri":"Jane_Austen","surface_form":"Jane Austen","offset":2083},{"uri":"Pride_and_Prejudice","surface_form":"Pride and Prejudice","offset":2098},{"uri":"Norfolk_Island","surface_form":"Norfolk Island","offset":2175},{"uri":"Renal_failure","surface_form":"renal failure","offset":2195}]}
