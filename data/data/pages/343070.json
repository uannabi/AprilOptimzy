{"id":343070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language","text":"=\"preserve\">Spoken language is language in its spontaneous form. It is different from written language. Many spoken languages have no written form. The term \"spoken language\" is sometimes used for \"oral language\". This is not quite right because sign language is also sometimes said to be 'spoken'.\nChildren get their first language from whichever language is spoken around them. Usually this comes from their mothers. Spoken language is much richer than written language. Spoken language can have different rules than written language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":31},{"uri":"Spontaneous","surface_form":"spontaneous","offset":47},{"uri":"Written_language","surface_form":"written language","offset":86},{"uri":"Oral_language","surface_form":"oral language","offset":198},{"uri":"Sign_language","surface_form":"sign language","offset":246},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":318}]}
