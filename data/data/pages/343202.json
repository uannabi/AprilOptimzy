{"id":343202,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace","text":"Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace is a former imperial 1,441-room Rococo summer residence in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most important cultural monuments in the country. Since the 1960s it has been one of the major tourist attractions in Vienna. The palace and gardens show the tastes and interests of Habsburg monarchs.\nEarly history.\nIn the year 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river. It was between Meidling and Hietzing. The emperor had the area to be fenced and put game there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar. This was the court's recreational hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, \"exotic\" birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept. Fishponds were built, too.\nThe name \"Sch\u00F6nbrunn\" (meaning \"beautiful spring\") is from an artesian well from which water was consumed by the court.\nDuring the next century, the area was used as a hunting and recreation ground. Eleonora Gonzaga, who loved hunting, spent much time there. She was given the area as her widow's residence after the death of her husband, Ferdinand II. From 1638 to 1643, she added a palace to the Katterburg mansion. In 1642 it was called \"Sch\u00F6nbrunn\" for the first time. The start of the Sch\u00F6nbrunn orangery seem to go back to Eleonora Gonzaga as well.\nGardens.\nThe sculpted garden space between the palace and the \"Sun Fountain\" is called the \"Great Parterre\". The French garden, a big part of the area, was planned by \"Jean Trehet\" in 1695. It has a maze.\nWestern parts were turned into English garden style in 1828\u20131852. At the outmost western edge, a botanical garden was made in 1828.\nSculptures.\nLining the Great Parterre are 32 sculptures, which represent deities and virtues.\nRecent history.\nAfter the end of the monarchy in 1918, the new Austrian Republic became the owner of Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace. They made it a museum.\nLater it was used for important events such as the meeting between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.\nUNESCO catalogued Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace on the World Heritage List in 1996, together with its gardens, as a remarkable Baroque ensemble and example of synthesis of the arts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UNESCO World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rococo","surface_form":"Rococo","offset":50},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":77},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":85},{"uri":"House_of_Habsburg","surface_form":"Habsburg","offset":293},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Holy Roman Emperor","offset":345},{"uri":"Maximilian_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Maximilian II","offset":364},{"uri":"Floodplain","surface_form":"floodplain","offset":396},{"uri":"Wien_River","surface_form":"Wien river","offset":414},{"uri":"Meidling","surface_form":"Meidling","offset":441},{"uri":"Hietzing","surface_form":"Hietzing","offset":454},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":510},{"uri":"Pheasant","surface_form":"pheasant","offset":529},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":540},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":547},{"uri":"Boar","surface_form":"boar","offset":556},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"turkey","offset":673},{"uri":"Peafowl","surface_form":"peafowl","offset":685},{"uri":"Artesian_well","surface_form":"artesian well","offset":793},{"uri":"Eleonore_Gonzaga_(1598-1655)","surface_form":"Eleonora Gonzaga","offset":930},{"uri":"Ferdinand_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Ferdinand II","offset":1070},{"uri":"Orangery","surface_form":"orangery","offset":1232},{"uri":"Formal_garden","surface_form":"French garden","offset":1399},{"uri":"Maze","surface_form":"maze","offset":1485},{"uri":"English_garden","surface_form":"English garden","offset":1522},{"uri":"Botanical_garden","surface_form":"botanical garden","offset":1588},{"uri":"Sculptures_in_the_Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Garden","surface_form":"32 sculptures","offset":1665},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
