{"id":34327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_language","text":"Khmer is the official language of Cambodia. Its script was the base for the Thai script, although Thai does not use subscript consonants. One thing that makes it particularly difficult for many foreigners to learn is that Khmer words are not separated in a sentence and the sounds are quite hard for foreigners to replicate. But still each word in the sentence can be distinguished. Also, there is not much material on Khmer, although this situation is changing.\nWriting.\nThe Khmer script is based on an ancient Indian alphabet. It is written from left to right. There are 35 consonants, some of which are written under other consonants. Vowels are combined with the consonants.\nGrammar.\nThe language has a subject-verb-object order. Pronouns change based on who you are speaking to.\nExamples.\n\"Do you want to go to Siem Reap?\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":34},{"uri":"Khmer_script","surface_form":"script","offset":48},{"uri":"Thai_script","surface_form":"Thai script","offset":76}]}
