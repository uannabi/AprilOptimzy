{"id":34328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","text":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (), commonly referred to as DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa or the DRC, is a country in central Africa. It was known as Za\u00EFre from 1971 to 1997. It is the second largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 71 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous Francophone (French-speaking) country.\nDRC borders the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo, the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9\u00A0km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa.\nHistory.\nWhen the Belgian Congo became independent, its leaders fought each other. The Soviet Union and later the United Nations helped destroy the groups who wanted independence from the new country.\nThe Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated the country. It involved nine African nations and some twenty armed groups. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues in the east of the country. There, the prevalence of rape and other sexual violence is described as the worst in the world. The war is the world's deadliest conflict since World War II, killing 5.4 million people since 1998. The vast majority died from conditions of malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly, in chronological order, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-L\u00E9opoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire (\"Za\u00EFre\" in French). Though it is in the Central African United Nations subregion, the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\nGeography.\nThe country is bordered by Angola, the South Atlantic Ocean, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika, and Zambia.\nThe capital of the CAR is Kinshasa.\nWorld Heritage Sites in the Democratic Republic of Congo include Virunga National Park (1979), Garamba National Park (1980),\nKahuzi-Biega National Park (1980), Salonga National Park (1984) and Okapi Wildlife Reserve (1996).\nProvinces.\nThe country is divided into twenty six provinces. The provinces are then divided into districts. The districts are divided into territories.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_Africa","surface_form":"central Africa","offset":118},{"uri":"Za%C3%AFre","surface_form":"Za\u00EFre","offset":150},{"uri":"Central_African_Republic","surface_form":"Central African Republic","offset":520},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"South Sudan","offset":549},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":575},{"uri":"Rwanda","surface_form":"Rwanda","offset":583},{"uri":"Burundi","surface_form":"Burundi","offset":595},{"uri":"Zambia","surface_form":"Zambia","offset":616},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":627},{"uri":"Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Republic of the Congo","offset":652},{"uri":"Cabinda_Province","surface_form":"Cabinda","offset":698},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":764},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":776},{"uri":"Muanda","surface_form":"Muanda","offset":884},{"uri":"Congo_River","surface_form":"Congo River","offset":930},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Guinea","surface_form":"Gulf of Guinea","offset":963},{"uri":"Belgian_Congo","surface_form":"Belgian Congo","offset":1061},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1130},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1157},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":1209},{"uri":"Second_Congo_War","surface_form":"Second Congo War","offset":1248},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":1490},{"uri":"Sexual_violence","surface_form":"sexual violence","offset":1505},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":1704},{"uri":"Diarrhea","surface_form":"diarrhea","offset":1713},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":1723},{"uri":"Malnutrition","surface_form":"malnutrition","offset":1737},{"uri":"Congo_Free_State","surface_form":"Congo Free State","offset":1830},{"uri":"Belgian_Congo","surface_form":"Belgian Congo","offset":1848},{"uri":"Republic_of_the_Congo_(L%C3%A9opoldville)","surface_form":"Congo-L\u00E9opoldville","offset":1863},{"uri":"Zaire","surface_form":"Zaire","offset":1903},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1966},{"uri":"Southern_Africa","surface_form":"Southern Africa","offset":2055},{"uri":"Southern_African_Development_Community","surface_form":"Southern African Development Community","offset":2090},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":2175},{"uri":"Republic_of_Congo","surface_form":"Republic of Congo","offset":2213},{"uri":"Central_African_Republic","surface_form":"Central African Republic","offset":2236},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"South Sudan","offset":2262},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":2275},{"uri":"Rwanda","surface_form":"Rwanda","offset":2283},{"uri":"Burundi","surface_form":"Burundi","offset":2291},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":2300},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":2316},{"uri":"Zambia","surface_form":"Zambia","offset":2337},{"uri":"Kinshasa","surface_form":"Kinshasa","offset":2371},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":2381},{"uri":"Virunga_National_Park","surface_form":"Virunga National Park","offset":2446},{"uri":"Garamba_National_Park","surface_form":"Garamba National Park","offset":2476},{"uri":"Kahuzi-Biega_National_Park","surface_form":"Kahuzi-Biega National Park","offset":2506},{"uri":"Salonga_National_Park","surface_form":"Salonga National Park","offset":2541},{"uri":"Okapi_Wildlife_Reserve","surface_form":"Okapi Wildlife Reserve","offset":2574}]}
