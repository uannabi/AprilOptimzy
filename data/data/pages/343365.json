It premiered on 18 June 1821 at the Schauspielhaus Berlin. The title is usually translated as \"The Marksman\", or \"The Freeshooter\".\nThe opera is the first important German Romantic opera, especially in its national identity and stark emotionality.\nThe plot is based on the German folk legend of the Freisch\u00FCtz and many of its tunes were inspired by German folk music. Its unearthly portrayal of the supernatural in the famous Wolf's Glen scene has been described as \"the most expressive rendering of the gruesome that is to be found in a musical score\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":23},{"uri":"Carl_Maria_von_Weber","surface_form":"Carl Maria von Weber","offset":46},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":74},{"uri":"Johann_Friedrich_Kind","surface_form":"Friedrich Kind","offset":86},{"uri":"Schauspielhaus_Berlin","surface_form":"Schauspielhaus Berlin","offset":138},{"uri":"Romantische_Oper","surface_form":"Romantic opera","offset":274},{"uri":"Freisch%C3%BCtz","surface_form":"Freisch\u00FCtz","offset":401},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":458}]}
