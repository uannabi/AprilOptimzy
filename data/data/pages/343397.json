They controlled most of northwestern Persia, eastern Transcaucasia, including Arran, most of Azerbaijan, and Djibal. At their biggest, the land they had was about most of north-western and upper-central modern Iran, most of the regions of modern Azerbaijan and smaller portions in modern Armenia, Turkey and Iraq.\nAtabeg means \"father lord\" in Turkic languages. It was the title given to the Turkic officers of Seljuq dynasty. Atabegs were not only vice-regents, but also de-facto rulers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkic","offset":116},{"uri":"Kipchak_people","surface_form":"Kipchak","offset":134},{"uri":"Transcaucasia","surface_form":"Transcaucasia","offset":203},{"uri":"Arran_(Caucasus)","surface_form":"Arran","offset":228},{"uri":"Iranian_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":243},{"uri":"Persian_Iraq","surface_form":"Djibal","offset":259},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":360},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":396},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":438},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":447},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":458},{"uri":"Atabeg","surface_form":"Atabeg","offset":464},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic languages","offset":494},{"uri":"Seljuq_dynasty","surface_form":"Seljuq","offset":561}]}
