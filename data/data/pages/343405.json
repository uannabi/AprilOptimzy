{"id":343405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_manat","text":"The Manat is the national money used in Azerbaijan. It is divided into 100 \"q\u0259pik\". The word \"manat\" comes from the Russian word \"moneta\" which means coin. Manat was also the name of the Soviet ruble in both the Azerbaijani and Turkmen languages.\nThe Azerbaijani manat symbol, is not easily typed on computers, so \"m\" or \"man.\" can be used instead.\nAzerbaijani manat is also written as AZN. In Azerbaijan people can only use manats. Azebaijani manats are more valuable than the United States dollar and almost as valuable as the Euro.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National","surface_form":"national","offset":17},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":26},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":40},{"uri":"Q%C9%99pik","surface_form":"q\u0259pik","offset":76},{"uri":"Manat","surface_form":"manat","offset":94},{"uri":"Soviet_ruble","surface_form":"Soviet ruble","offset":187},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_language","surface_form":"Azerbaijani","offset":212},{"uri":"Turkmen_language","surface_form":"Turkmen","offset":228},{"uri":"Value","surface_form":"valuable","offset":460},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"United States dollar","offset":478},{"uri":"Euro","surface_form":"Euro","offset":529}]}
