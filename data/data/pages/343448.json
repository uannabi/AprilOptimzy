{"id":343448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council","text":"The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is in the United Nations System. The UNHRC took the place of the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR). It was established by the United Nations General Assembly.\nThe General Assembly made the UNHRC on 15 March 2006. This was to replace the previous CHR. People did not like the CHR because they allowed countries with poor human rights records to be members.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson have not liked that the council acts for politics instead of human rights. Several people have said the council focuses too much on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. The United States did not take part in the Council when George W. Bush was president. They changed when Barack Obama became President.\nOn 18 June 2007, the UNHRC made a plan for future work. They will assess the human rights in all 192 UN Member States. They will also allow people and organizations to bring complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the Council.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Nations_System","surface_form":"United Nations System","offset":58},{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"United Nations General Assembly","offset":195},{"uri":"Ban_Ki_Moon","surface_form":"Ban Ki Moon","offset":446},{"uri":"United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights","surface_form":"United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights","offset":469},{"uri":"Mary_Robinson","surface_form":"Mary Robinson","offset":519},{"uri":"Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict","surface_form":"Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict","offset":669},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
