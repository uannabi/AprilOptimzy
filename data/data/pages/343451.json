Large Georgian communities are also present throughout Russia, European Union, United States, and South America.\nThe majority of Georgians are Eastern Orthodox Christian. They mostly go by the national autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church, which started in the 4th century. There are also Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities in Tbilisi and Adjara. Located in Caucasus at the edge of Europe, the Georgian people have tried to keep their Christian identity. There is a lot of pressure from the neighboring Muslim empires.\nThe Georgian language is the official language of the country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caucasian","surface_form":"Caucasian","offset":20},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":30},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":58},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":122},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":130},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":146},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":165},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Christian","offset":210},{"uri":"Autocephaly","surface_form":"autocephalous","offset":269},{"uri":"Georgian_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Georgian Orthodox Church","offset":283},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":367},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":380},{"uri":"Tbilisi","surface_form":"Tbilisi","offset":402},{"uri":"Adjara","surface_form":"Adjara","offset":414},{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucasus","offset":433},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":457},{"uri":"Georgian_language","surface_form":"Georgian language","offset":598},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":623}]}
