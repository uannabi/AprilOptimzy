{"id":343501,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrations","text":"e=\"preserve\">Celebrations are a chocolate collection made by Mars, Incorporated. They were started in 1997. They are miniature versions of Mars-produced chocolate bars. With the tagline \"Share the joy\", Celebrations were the first mixed box of chocolates to bring together confectionery which had been already released in one box or tin. This was different than having new, especially-created candy. Celebrations are most popular around holidays, such as Christmas, Halloween and Easter.\nContents.\nTwix replaced Galaxy Truffle in 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":32},{"uri":"Mars%2C_Incorporated","surface_form":"Mars, Incorporated","offset":61},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":455},{"uri":"Halloween","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":466},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":480}]}
