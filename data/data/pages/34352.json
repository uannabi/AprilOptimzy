{"id":34352,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardwolf","text":"The aardwolf (\"Proteles cristata\") is a small, insectivorous mammal, native to East Africa and Southern Africa. Its name means \"earth wolf\" in the Afrikaans / Dutch language. It is also called \"maanhaar jackal\" in Afrikaans, or \"civet hyena\", based on the secretions (civet) from their anal glands.\nThe aardwolf is in the same family as the hyenas. Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats insects, mainly termites \u2013 one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky tongue to capture them.\nThe aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa \u2013 these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. The aardwolf is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and coming out at night to eat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Insectivore","surface_form":"insectivorous","offset":47},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":61},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":79},{"uri":"Southern_Africa","surface_form":"Southern Africa","offset":95},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":147},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch language","offset":159},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":214},{"uri":"Anal_gland","surface_form":"anal gland","offset":286},{"uri":"Hyena","surface_form":"hyena","offset":341},{"uri":"Carnivora","surface_form":"Carnivora","offset":391},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":435},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":497},{"uri":"Termite","surface_form":"termite","offset":513},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":616},{"uri":"Scrubland","surface_form":"scrubland","offset":666},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":786},{"uri":"Burrow","surface_form":"burrow","offset":808}]}
