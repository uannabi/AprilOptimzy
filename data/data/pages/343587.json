It is also called an instruction manual.\nA computer usually has a user guide to tell people how to use it.

It also helps to put many pictures into the user guide.\nIf there are pictures, people who read or speak a different language can still understand what to do with the equipment or software.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Instruction","surface_form":"instruction","offset":84},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":172},{"uri":"Software_developer","surface_form":"person","offset":257},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":525},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":575},{"uri":"Computer_software","surface_form":"software","offset":588}]}
