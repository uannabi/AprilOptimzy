{"id":343680,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinchi","text":"\"Akinchi\", also written as \"Ekinchi\" (/ \u0627\u06A9\u064A\u0646\u0686\u064A) was an Azerbaijan newspaper. It was made in Baku It was the first newspaper fully printed in the Azerbaijani language. It was also the first newspaper in Russia printed in a Turkic language. The name means \"The Ploughman\".\nHistory.\nHasan bey Zardabi started the newspaper. He was a journalist, teacher and scientist. \"Akinchi\" was thought to be almost revolutionary because of the language it was made in and that so many people could read it. Zardabi used a simpler form of the Azeri language so more people could read the paper.\nThe Russian governor of the Caucasus Dmitry Staroselsky liked Zardabi's plans. Staroselsky supported him in starting \"Akinchi\". He was also the one to name the newspaper. He thought the name would make the authorities think that \"Akinchi\" was non-political and about agriculture. In addition to agriculture articles Zardabi wrote about medicine and biology. There were also stories about the social and cultural state of Muslims in the Caucasus. The first issue of \"Akinchi\" was printed on 22 July 1875.\nPartly because Staroselsky left, the paper ended on 29 September 1877. There was also little money and few readers. There were only 300 constant readers. The paper helped there be more journalism in Azerbaijan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":55},{"uri":"Baku","surface_form":"Baku","offset":92},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":114},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_language","surface_form":"Azerbaijani language","offset":145},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":202},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic language","offset":222},{"uri":"Plough","surface_form":"Plough","offset":259},{"uri":"Hasan_bey_Zardabi","surface_form":"Hasan bey Zardabi","offset":280},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"journalist","offset":330},{"uri":"Revolutionary","surface_form":"revolutionary","offset":400},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":591},{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucasus","offset":607},{"uri":"Dmitry_Staroselsky","surface_form":"Dmitry Staroselsky","offset":616},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":846},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":915},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":928},{"uri":"Muslims","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":1000},{"uri":"Journalism","surface_form":"journalism","offset":1268},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":1282}]}
