{"id":343711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_spider","text":"A spitting spider is a spider in the family \"Scytodidae\". There are more than 150 species of spitting spider in the world. Spitting spiders are related to the recluse spiders in the \"Sicariidae\" family.\nThe name \"spitting spider\" comes from the way these spiders hunt. The spider spits a sticky and poisonous liquid at its prey. The liquid congeals (becomes solid) around the target. When the prey is trapped, the spider bites it to kill it with venom. It then wraps the prey in spider silk like many other spiders do.\nA spitting spider attack is very fast. It takes about 1/700th of a second. This kind of spider can spit. The spider spits in a Z pattern and criss-crosses its prey in sticky liquid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":23},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":82},{"uri":"Recluse_spider","surface_form":"recluse spider","offset":159},{"uri":"Sicariidae","surface_form":"Sicariidae","offset":183},{"uri":"Spit","surface_form":"spit","offset":280},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":323},{"uri":"Congeal","surface_form":"congeal","offset":340},{"uri":"Trap","surface_form":"trap","offset":401},{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venom","offset":446},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":486},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":537}]}
