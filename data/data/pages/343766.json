There is also an Absheron Peninsula, but they are not in the same area.\nAbsheron was started in 1963 by the Soviet government. There are lots of historical monuments in Absheron. For example, in the village A\u015Fa\u011F\u0131 G\u00FCzd\u0259k there are agricultural tools from the 19th century. In Goradile village, there is Abdurrahman mosque from the 19th century. Mosques from the 18th century are in M\u0259mm\u0259dli. Ancient wells which provided water supply to people living in this territory are still used in A\u015Fa\u011F\u0131 G\u00FCzd\u0259k and Xirdalan. Tombs from 8th - 18th centuries are also kept: in Fatmai, Digah, Masazir, H\u00F6km\u0259li and Saray.\nThe name Absheron comes from the words 'ap shuran'.
