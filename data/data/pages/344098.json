Born to parents Joseph and Emma Kildal, Gary studied math at the University of Washington (UW) because he wanted to become a math teacher. However, he began getting in computer technology. Joseph was the creator of the M operating system and the founder of Digital Research, Inc. (DRI). Kildall was one of the first people to see microprocessors as fully capable computers rather than equipment controllers and to organize a company around this concept.\nHe also co-hosted the PBS TV show \"The Computer Chronicles\". Although his career in computing spanned for more than 20 years, he is most known in connection with IBM's unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to license CP/M for the IBM PC. Gary died from alcoholism and hitting his head in 1994 at the age of 52.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_scientist","surface_form":"computer scientist","offset":56},{"uri":"Entrepreneur","surface_form":"entrepreneur","offset":93},{"uri":"University_of_Washington","surface_form":"University of Washington","offset":172},{"uri":"M","surface_form":"M","offset":326},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":328},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":470},{"uri":"Public_Broadcasting_Service","surface_form":"PBS","offset":583},{"uri":"IBM","surface_form":"IBM","offset":723}]}
