{"id":344349,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_glue","text":"Super glue, or cyanoacrylate, is the general name for a family of fast-acting adhesives with industrial, medical and household uses. It usually comes in a small tube, and is often sold as \"Super Glue\" or \"Krazy Glue\".\nThey are extremely strong glues. However, the glue is not so good at resisting shear (sideways stress).\nThere are different versions for medical and veterinary use, developed to be non-toxic and less irritating to skin tissue.\nCyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known as instant glues.\nSafety.\nSuper glue will stick to human skin instantly. You can glue your fingers together, or to an object, accidentally. If this happens, it can be removed with acetone, commonly found in nail polish remover. Medical grade super glue is sometimes used to seal small cuts, scrapes, and mild wounds. Never use in deep or puncture wounds.\nSuper glue will burn if it comes in contact with cotton, including cotton clothing, cotton gloves, and cotton swabs. The severity of this reaction can range from a small amount of heat and smoke to starting a fire, depending on the amount of glue and/or cotton involved.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adhesive","surface_form":"adhesive","offset":78},{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":161},{"uri":"Glue","surface_form":"glue","offset":244},{"uri":"Veterinary","surface_form":"veterinary","offset":367},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":403},{"uri":"Acetone","surface_form":"acetone","offset":669},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":893},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":982},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":1024},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoke","offset":1033},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":1053}]}
