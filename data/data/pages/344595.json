{"id":344595,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Island%2C_Bahamas","text":"Cat Island is in the central Bahamas. It is one of the Districts of the Bahamas. Mount Alvernia is the countries highest point.\nThe first European settlers were Loyalists who fled the American Revolution. They arrived in 1783. The island may have been named after Arthur Catt, a pirate. Or the name may be for the one-time large population of feral cats.\nHistorically, the island gained wealth from cotton plantations. Now slash and burn farming is the main way of life for Cat Islanders. An economic crop is cascarilla bark. It is gathered and shipped to Italy. There it becomes a main ingredient in medicines, scents and Campari.\nNew Bight Airport and Arthur's Town Airport serve the island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":29},{"uri":"Mount_Alvernia","surface_form":"Mount Alvernia","offset":81},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":138},{"uri":"Loyalist_(American_Revolution)","surface_form":"Loyalists","offset":161},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"American Revolution","offset":184},{"uri":"Pirate","surface_form":"pirate","offset":279},{"uri":"Feral","surface_form":"feral","offset":343},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":349},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":399},{"uri":"Slash_and_burn","surface_form":"slash and burn","offset":423},{"uri":"Cascarilla","surface_form":"cascarilla","offset":509},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":556},{"uri":"Campari","surface_form":"Campari","offset":623},{"uri":"New_Bight_Airport","surface_form":"New Bight Airport","offset":632},{"uri":"Arthur%27s_Town_Airport","surface_form":"Arthur's Town Airport","offset":654}]}
