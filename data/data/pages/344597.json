The Berry Islands has about thirty islands and over one hundred small islands or cays. It is often called \"The Fish Bowl of the Bahamas.\" There are about 700 people. Most of the people are on Great Harbour Cay. The islands were settled in 1836 by Governor Colebrook and a group of freed slaves.\nThe main attraction is big game fishing. Some of the fish that can be found there are billfish, tuna, grouper, tiger fish, yellowtail snapper, wahoo, king mackerel, and many more. There are also great spots for snorkeling and scuba diving.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":63},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":107},{"uri":"Cay","surface_form":"cay","offset":153},{"uri":"Great_Harbour_Cay","surface_form":"Great Harbour Cay","offset":264},{"uri":"Governor_Colebrook","surface_form":"Governor Colebrook","offset":319},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slaves","offset":359},{"uri":"Game_fishing","surface_form":"game fishing","offset":394},{"uri":"Billfish","surface_form":"billfish","offset":453},{"uri":"Tuna","surface_form":"tuna","offset":463},{"uri":"Grouper","surface_form":"grouper","offset":469},{"uri":"Tiger_fish","surface_form":"tiger fish","offset":478},{"uri":"Lutjanidae","surface_form":"yellowtail snapper","offset":490},{"uri":"Wahoo","surface_form":"wahoo","offset":510},{"uri":"King_mackerel","surface_form":"king mackerel","offset":517},{"uri":"Snorkeling","surface_form":"snorkeling","offset":578},{"uri":"Scuba_diving","surface_form":"scuba diving","offset":593}]}
