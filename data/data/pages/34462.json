{"id":34462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet","text":"Dwarf planet is the name used to classify some objects in the solar system. This definition was made on August 24, 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and can be described as; \"a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the Sun that is big enough to round itself by its own gravity, but has not cleared its orbital path of other rival bodies\". At the same meeting the IAU also defined the term planet for the first time. Some astronomers think that the term \"dwarf planet\" is too confusing and needs to be changed.\nThe dwarf planets, unlike the terrestrial and gas giant planets, are in more than one region of the solar system. Ceres is in the asteroid belt. The high orbital eccentricity of Pluto puts it mostly outside Neptune's orbit, but partly inside. The others are in the trans-Neptune region.\nNASA's \"Dawn\" and \"New Horizons\" missions reached Ceres and Pluto, respectively, in 2015. \"Dawn\" had already orbited and observed Vesta in 2011.\nThere are many other dwarf planets in the solar system. Most of them are also Kuiper belt objects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":62},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":127},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":231},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":401},{"uri":"Terrestrial_planet","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":552},{"uri":"Gas_giant","surface_form":"gas giant planets","offset":568},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":622},{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"asteroid belt","offset":652},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"orbital eccentricity","offset":676},{"uri":"Trans-Neptunian_object","surface_form":"trans-Neptune region","offset":787},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":809},{"uri":"Dawn_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Dawn","offset":817},{"uri":"New_Horizons","surface_form":"New Horizons","offset":828},{"uri":"4_Vesta","surface_form":"Vesta","offset":939},{"uri":"Kuiper_belt","surface_form":"Kuiper belt","offset":1032}]}
