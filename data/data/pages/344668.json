{"id":344668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviraptorosaur","text":"Oviraptorosaurs are a group of feathered maniraptoran dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period of what are now Asia and North America. They have short, beaked, parrot-like skulls, with or without bony head crests. They ranged in size from \"Caudipteryx\", which was the size of a turkey, to the 8 meter long, 1.4 ton \"Gigantoraptor\". The most complete oviraptorosaur specimens have been found in Asia. The North American oviraptorosaur record is sparse.\nThe group (and all maniraptoran dinosaurs) is close to the ancestry of birds. Oviraptorosaurs might be primitive flightless birds. On the other hand, they might just be close relatives of the birds.\nThe earliest and most basal (\"primitive\") known oviraptorosaurs are \"Protarchaeopteryx robusta\" and \"Incisivosaurus gauthieri\", both from the lower Yixian Formation of China, dating to about 125 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous. Some fragmentary species, such as \"Calamospondylus oweni\" and \"Thecocoelurus daviesi\", may have been even earlier members of the Oviraptorosauria. A tiny neck vertebra from England shares some features in common with oviraptorosaurs. It may represent an earlier occurrence of this group, at about 140 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Maniraptora","surface_form":"maniraptora","offset":41},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":54},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":73},{"uri":"Period_(geology)","surface_form":"period","offset":84},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":107},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":116},{"uri":"Caudipteryx","surface_form":"Caudipteryx","offset":236},{"uri":"Gigantoraptor","surface_form":"Gigantoraptor","offset":312},{"uri":"Maniraptora","surface_form":"maniraptora","offset":467},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":519},{"uri":"Protarchaeopteryx","surface_form":"Protarchaeopteryx","offset":716},{"uri":"Incisivosaurus","surface_form":"Incisivosaurus","offset":748},{"uri":"Yixian_Formation","surface_form":"Yixian Formation","offset":795},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":815},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":867},{"uri":"Calamospondylus","surface_form":"Calamospondylus","offset":920},{"uri":"Thecocoelurus","surface_form":"Thecocoelurus","offset":948},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1058}]}
