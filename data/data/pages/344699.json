{"id":344699,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Liberation_Movement","text":"The Croatian Liberation Movement (, HOP) is a minor far-right political party in Croatia. HOP was formed by Croatians in exile. Usta\u0161e was movement with nationalistic ideas. It also had fascist tendencies. After the Second World War, there were some fights concerning the leadership of Usta\u0161e. In 1956, Ante Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Liberation Movement in Buenos Aires. The goal of HOP was to control the original Usta\u0161e organization. Because of its roots, HOP is widely seen as a successor of the Usta\u0161e. In the early 1990s, the state of Yugoslavia disintegrated, and the parts it was made of became independent republics. In 1991, HOP moved to Zagreb; and the organization was registered as a political party. In 1997, HOP came into public limelight for paying a requiem mass for the Usta\u0161e leader Paveli\u0107 in the Church of Saint Dominic in Split.\nMission.\nOne of the goals of the Croatian Liberation Movement is to re-establish the state of Croatia with the borders it had during the Second World War. At that time, the state also included Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHistory.\nCroatian Liberation Movement was founded by Ante Paveli\u0107 in Buenos Aires in 1956. In 1957, after some people tried to kill Paveli\u0107, he and his family moved to Spain. Paveli\u0107 died on 28 December 1959, at the German hospital in Madrid. After Paveli\u0107's death, his son-in-law Sre\u010Dko P\u0161eni\u010Dnik took over HOP. In 1960, he moved its operations from Buenos Aires to Toronto, Canada.\nAnother part of the HOP was established in Australia in 1963. The leaders of this group were Sre\u0107ko Rover (from 1963 to 1967) and Stjepan Hefer (from 1967 to 1973). Many of this group's members were also members of the Australian Liberal Party. Some of them were said to have gone on military training exercises with the Australian Army Reserve, using the army's base at Wodonga in Victoria. Several members of the opposition Labor Party, including Justin O'Byrne, said that the HOP were using their status in the Liberal Party to hide many of these activities. When the Labour Party became the government in 1972, the Attorney-General gave the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) permission to spy on Sre\u0107ko Rover and a few of the group's other members. This was because they thought they might be recruiting insurgents for an overseas war.\nWhen Yugoslavia was dissolved in the early 1990s, this organization moved to Zagreb, Croatia, where it was officially registered as a political party in 1991.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Far-right","surface_form":"far-right","offset":52},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":62},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":81},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":121},{"uri":"Usta%C5%A1e","surface_form":"Usta\u0161e","offset":128},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalistic","offset":153},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"fascist","offset":186},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":216},{"uri":"Ante_Paveli%C4%87","surface_form":"Ante Paveli\u0107","offset":303},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":359},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":542},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":616},{"uri":"Zagreb","surface_form":"Zagreb","offset":649},{"uri":"Requiem","surface_form":"requiem mass","offset":768},{"uri":"Usta%C5%A1e","surface_form":"Usta\u0161e","offset":789},{"uri":"Split","surface_form":"Split","offset":845},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":989},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":1045},{"uri":"Ante_Paveli%C4%87","surface_form":"Ante Paveli\u0107","offset":1122},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":1138},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1237},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":1304},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":1436},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1445},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_(Australia)","surface_form":"Australian Liberal Party","offset":1672},{"uri":"Australian_Army_Reserve","surface_form":"Australian Army Reserve","offset":1774},{"uri":"Wodonga%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Wodonga","offset":1824},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":1835},{"uri":"Labor_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Labor Party","offset":1879},{"uri":"Justin_O%27Byrne","surface_form":"Justin O'Byrne","offset":1902},{"uri":"Attorney-General","surface_form":"Attorney-General","offset":2072},{"uri":"Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation","surface_form":"Australian Security Intelligence Organisation","offset":2098},{"uri":"Recruit","surface_form":"recruiting","offset":2269},{"uri":"Guerilla_warfare","surface_form":"insurgents","offset":2280},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":2317},{"uri":"Zagreb","surface_form":"Zagreb","offset":2389},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":2397}]}
