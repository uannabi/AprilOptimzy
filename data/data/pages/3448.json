{"id":3448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question","text":"e=\"preserve\">A question is what someone asks, usually when there is something that he or she does not know. In writing, a question mark (\"?\") comes at the end of a question. However, just because a question is asked does not mean there is an answer.\nTypes of question.\nSometimes a question has a simple answer like \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nSometimes a question has a more complicated answer like \"Maybe\", or \"I don't know\". There are so many types of questions and so many ways of answering questions.\nExamples of these questions.\nPeople may give a short answer. People may give a long answer. It depends on the question.\nTypes.\nDifferent kinds of why questions need different kinds of answers. A question like \"Why did you do that?\" clearly asks for an explanation. What that explanation might be depends on context. This kind of explanation is not right or wrong: it all depends on circumstance. The question and answer may also have to do with \"who\", \"what\", \"when\" and \"where\".\nMany kinds of explanations are made up of more than one type.\nAn explanation can be valid or invalid or a combination of both. Some explanations may appear reasonable, but they turn out to be misleading or wrong.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Question_mark","surface_form":"question mark","offset":122},{"uri":"Context_(language)","surface_form":"context","offset":799},{"uri":"Circumstance","surface_form":"circumstance","offset":874},{"uri":"Valid","surface_form":"valid","offset":1056},{"uri":"Invalid","surface_form":"invalid","offset":1065},{"uri":"Combination","surface_form":"combination","offset":1078}]}
