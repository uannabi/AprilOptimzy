{"id":344808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1259)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Treaty of Paris was a treaty between Louis IX of France and Henry III of England, agreed to on December 4, 1259. It is also known as Treaty of Albeville. It was mainly about territories that England had obtained in 1180, in Normandy. Philip II of France had conquered many of these territories. England lost the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, and was weakened on the European mainland. Louis VII of France strengthened this position. The English were left with Gascony and Bordeaux. The treaty also gave the Channel Islands to England. Henry gave up control of Maine, Anjou and Poitou, which had been lost under the reign of King John but remained Duke of Aquitaine and was able to keep the lands of Gascony and parts of Aquitaine but only as a vassal to Louis.\nIn exchange, Louis withdrew his support for English rebels. He also ceded to Henry the bishoprics and cities of Limoges, Cahors and P\u00E9rigueux and was to pay an annual rent for possession of Agenais.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":39},{"uri":"Louis_IX_of_France","surface_form":"Louis IX of France","offset":54},{"uri":"Henry_III_of_England","surface_form":"Henry III of England","offset":77},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":241},{"uri":"Philip_II_of_France","surface_form":"Philip II of France","offset":251},{"uri":"Battle_of_Bouvines","surface_form":"Battle of Bouvines","offset":329},{"uri":"Louis_VII_of_France","surface_form":"Louis VII of France","offset":400},{"uri":"Gascony","surface_form":"Gascony","offset":475},{"uri":"Bordeaux","surface_form":"Bordeaux","offset":487},{"uri":"Channel_Islands","surface_form":"Channel Islands","offset":522},{"uri":"Maine_(province_of_France)","surface_form":"Maine","offset":575},{"uri":"Anjou","surface_form":"Anjou","offset":582},{"uri":"Poitou","surface_form":"Poitou","offset":592},{"uri":"John_of_England","surface_form":"John","offset":644},{"uri":"Duke_of_Aquitaine","surface_form":"Duke of Aquitaine","offset":662},{"uri":"Gascony","surface_form":"Gascony","offset":714},{"uri":"Aquitaine","surface_form":"Aquitaine","offset":735},{"uri":"Vassal","surface_form":"vassal","offset":759},{"uri":"Limoges","surface_form":"Limoges","offset":888},{"uri":"Cahors","surface_form":"Cahors","offset":897},{"uri":"P%C3%A9rigueux","surface_form":"P\u00E9rigueux","offset":908},{"uri":"Agenais","surface_form":"Agenais","offset":966}]}
