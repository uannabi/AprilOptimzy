{"id":344855,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bahrain","text":"The national flag of Bahrain is a white band on the left, with a red area on the right split by five triangles.\nRed is the traditional colour for flags of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The five points are for the five pillars of Islam.\nIt is very similar to the flag of Qatar.\nHistory.\nThe oldest known flags of Bahrain were plain red. In 1820, Bahrain made a treaty with the United Kingdom. A white stripe was added to show the truce. In 1932, a serrated edge was added to make the flag of Bahrain different from its neighbours.\nThe flag first had twenty-eight white points. This was changed to eight in 1972. In 2002 the number was changed to five. This was so that each of the points could stand for one of the Five Pillars of Islam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bahrain","surface_form":"Bahrain","offset":21},{"uri":"Persian_Gulf","surface_form":"Persian Gulf","offset":178},{"uri":"Flag_of_Qatar","surface_form":"flag of Qatar","offset":269},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":367},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":383},{"uri":"Serrate","surface_form":"serrate","offset":454},{"uri":"Five_Pillars_of_Islam","surface_form":"Five Pillars of Islam","offset":721}]}
