{"id":344867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Constitutional Monarchy is a form of government, in which a king or queen is the official head of state, although their powers are limited by a constitution and often lack much real power, as the legislative branch is the primary governing body. A constitutional monarchy differs from an absolute monarchy in that in an absolute monarchy the monarch is able to rule with unchecked power, and are able to change the laws at their whim.\nCreation.\nConstitutional Monarchy first emerged in England. Initally the British monarchy was absolute, however, the nobility under King John felt that the king had abused his power, and had forced him to sign a document called the Magna Carta. This document limited the powers of the king and made and made him somewhat responsible for the wellbeing of his subjects. The document, however was more focused on maintaining the ability of the nobles to have a say in what the king did.\nContemporary constitutional monarchies include the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms, Belgium, Bhutan, Bahrain, Cambodia, Denmark, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Eswatini, Sweden, and Thailand.\nList of current reigning monarchies.\nThe following is a list of reigning monarchies. Except where noted, monarch selection is hereditary as directed by the state's constitution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":105},{"uri":"Absolute_monarchy","surface_form":"absolute monarchy","offset":303},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":501},{"uri":"John_of_England","surface_form":"King John","offset":582},{"uri":"Magna_Carta","surface_form":"Magna Carta","offset":682},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":985},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realms","surface_form":"Commonwealth realms","offset":1004},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":1025},{"uri":"Bhutan","surface_form":"Bhutan","offset":1034},{"uri":"Bahrain","surface_form":"Bahrain","offset":1042},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":1051},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":1061},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1070},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":1077},{"uri":"Kuwait","surface_form":"Kuwait","offset":1085},{"uri":"Liechtenstein","surface_form":"Liechtenstein","offset":1093},{"uri":"Lesotho","surface_form":"Lesotho","offset":1108},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":1117},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":1129},{"uri":"Monaco","surface_form":"Monaco","offset":1139},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":1147},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":1160},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1173},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1181},{"uri":"Eswatini","surface_form":"Eswatini","offset":1188},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":1198},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":1210}]}
