{"id":345071,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Arquette","text":"David James Arquette is an American actor, movie director, and producer. He was born in Winchester, Virginia to actor Lewis Arquette (1935-2001) and poet Mardi (n\u00E9e Nowak, died 1997). He is best known for his role as Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley in the \"Scream\" movies.\nArquette played a wrestling fan in the movie \"Ready to Rumble\". To market this movie, WCW hired Arquette to appear on their TV show and win their world title. Arquette argued he should not win the belt because he is not a real wrestler but WCW talked him into it. The attention received was only negative and the backlash eventually caused WCW to go out of business. The movie was also a critical disaster that ruined the careers of some of the actors in it, like Oliver Platt.\nBecause Arquette is also a wrestling fan in real life, he regretted making a mockery of wrestling and donated the money he made from WCW to families of dead wrestlers Owen Hart and Brian Pillman and also to Darren Drozdov, who was paralyzed in a wrestling match.\nArquette was a contestant on the 13th season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" in fall 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arquette","surface_form":"Arquette","offset":12},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":27},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":36},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"movie director","offset":43},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":63},{"uri":"Winchester%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Winchester, Virginia","offset":88},{"uri":"Lewis_Arquette","surface_form":"Lewis Arquette","offset":118},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":149},{"uri":"Deputy","surface_form":"Deputy","offset":217},{"uri":"Sheriff","surface_form":"Sheriff","offset":224},{"uri":"Dewey_Riley","surface_form":"Dewey Riley","offset":232},{"uri":"Scream_(movie_series)","surface_form":"\"Scream\" movies","offset":251},{"uri":"Wrestling","surface_form":"wrestling","offset":286},{"uri":"Ready_to_Rumble","surface_form":"Ready to Rumble","offset":314},{"uri":"Marketing","surface_form":"market","offset":335},{"uri":"WCW","surface_form":"WCW","offset":354},{"uri":"Oliver_Platt","surface_form":"Oliver Platt","offset":732},{"uri":"Donate","surface_form":"donate","offset":848},{"uri":"Owen_Hart","surface_form":"Owen Hart","offset":913},{"uri":"Brian_Pillman","surface_form":"Brian Pillman","offset":927},{"uri":"Darren_Drozdov","surface_form":"Darren Drozdov","offset":953},{"uri":"Contestant","surface_form":"contestant","offset":1024},{"uri":"Dancing_with_the_Stars","surface_form":"Dancing with the Stars","offset":1058}]}
