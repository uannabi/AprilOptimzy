{"id":34513,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism","text":"Existentialism is a way of thinking that focuses on what it means for people to exist. It is a philosophical movement. It became well-known in books and movies of the 19th and 20th centuries. Existentialism is known for dealing with nihilistic problems, but is generally still a kind of. It says that humans have will and consciousness, but they live in a world that does not. The premise that people must make choices about their life while knowing they are mortal is what existentialism is all about.\nIt was started by the Danish philosopher S\u00F8ren Kierkegaard (18131855).\nKierkegaard was a very religious man, but existentialism in the 20th century became more and more atheistic. Most of its main thinkers and writers were in mainland Europe. For example, Jean-Paul Sartre spent most of the Second World War in a German prison camp, reading the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. When he came out he gave a lecture called \"Existentialism and Humanism\". This early lecture may be easier to read than his later work.\nMany religions and philosophies (ways of thinking about the world) say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). But people who believe in existentialism think that the world and human life have \"no meaning unless people give them meaning\": \u2018existence precedes [is before] essence\u2019. This means that we find ourselves existing in the world, and then we give ourselves meaning, or 'essence'. As Sartre said, \"We are condemned to be free\". This means that we have no choice but to choose, and that we have full responsibility for our choices. Another way to put it is that we are always making choices even if we don't realize it.\nExistentialists believe that our human 'essence' or 'nature' (way of being in the world) is simply our 'existence' (being in the world). More simply put, the 'essence' of a human, or what makes a human a 'human', is not due to nature or uncontrollable circumstances; rather, human essence is really just what we choose to make it. This means that the only nature we as humans have is the nature we make for ourselves. As a result of this, existentialists think that the actions or choices that a person makes are very important. They believe that every person has to decide for themselves what is right and wrong, and what is good and bad.\nPeople who believe in existentialism ask questions like \u2019what is it like to be a human (a person) in the world?\u2019 and \u2019how can we understand human freedom (what it means for a person to be free)?\u2019 Existentialism is often connected with negative emotions, such as anxiety (worrying), dread (a very strong fear), and mortality (awareness of our own death). Some existentialists, like Sartre and Heidegger, think that thinking about these emotions help people to choose the way that they want to live their lives.\nExistentialism is sometimes confused with nihilism. It is different from nihilism, but there is a similarity. Nihilists believe that human life \"does not\" have a meaning (or a purpose) at all; existentialism says that people must choose their own purpose.\nExistentialism in books.\nMany of the main sources for existentialism were written in other languages and only later translated, mostly after the 1950s.\nExistentialism in movies.\nIngmar Bergman made a movie called \"The Seventh Seal\" in 1957. It shows the doom and gloom of the late Middle Ages caused by the Black Plague, famine, the Hundred Years' War between France and England, and papal schism.\nThe movie \"Taxi Driver\" (which has the actor Robert De Niro) from 1976 has existential ideas in it. The main character feels sad and lonely, because he cannot understand the world.\nJean-Luc Godard's \"Vivre sa vie (film)\" and Federico Fellini's 2 are prime examples of the Existentialism fashion in the European early 50's that influenced American films such as Easy Rider or The Graduate in the 1960s.\nI Heart Huckabees is a 2004 film directed by David O. Russell. The movie revolves around a man who hires two existential detectives to find out about his \"coincidence.\" He meets his \"other\" and is tempted with the dark side of existentialism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Existence","surface_form":"exist","offset":80},{"uri":"Philosophical_movement","surface_form":"philosophical movement","offset":95},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th","offset":167},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th centuries","offset":176},{"uri":"Nihilism","surface_form":"nihilistic","offset":233},{"uri":"Free_will","surface_form":"will","offset":313},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":322},{"uri":"Premise","surface_form":"premise","offset":381},{"uri":"Mortal","surface_form":"mortal","offset":459},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":525},{"uri":"S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard","surface_form":"S\u00F8ren Kierkegaard","offset":544},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheistic","offset":672},{"uri":"Continental_Europe","surface_form":"mainland Europe","offset":729},{"uri":"Jean-Paul_Sartre","surface_form":"Jean-Paul Sartre","offset":759},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":794},{"uri":"German_prison_camp","surface_form":"German prison camp","offset":816},{"uri":"Martin_Heidegger","surface_form":"Martin Heidegger","offset":862},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":1020},{"uri":"Meaning_of_life","surface_form":"meaning","offset":1108},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":2549},{"uri":"Fear","surface_form":"fear","offset":2590},{"uri":"Existential_crisis","surface_form":"awareness of our own death","offset":2612},{"uri":"Nihilism","surface_form":"nihilism","offset":2839},{"uri":"Ingmar_Bergman","surface_form":"Ingmar Bergman","offset":3231},{"uri":"The_Seventh_Seal","surface_form":"The Seventh Seal","offset":3267},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":3334},{"uri":"Black_Plague","surface_form":"Black Plague","offset":3360},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":3374},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":3386},{"uri":"Papal","surface_form":"papal","offset":3437},{"uri":"Schism","surface_form":"schism","offset":3443},{"uri":"Taxi_Driver","surface_form":"Taxi Driver","offset":3462},{"uri":"Robert_De_Niro","surface_form":"Robert De Niro","offset":3496},{"uri":"Jean-Luc_Godard","surface_form":"Jean-Luc Godard","offset":3632},{"uri":"Vivre_sa_vie_(film)","surface_form":"Vivre sa vie (film)","offset":3651},{"uri":"Federico_Fellini","surface_form":"Federico Fellini","offset":3676},{"uri":"2","surface_form":"2","offset":3695},{"uri":"Easy_Rider","surface_form":"Easy Rider","offset":3812},{"uri":"The_Graduate","surface_form":"The Graduate","offset":3826},{"uri":"I_Heart_Huckabees","surface_form":"I Heart Huckabees","offset":3853},{"uri":"David_O._Russell","surface_form":"David O.
