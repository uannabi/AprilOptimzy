{"id":345199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairlift","text":"=\"preserve\">A stairlift or stair lift is a special type of chair. The user sits in the chair and it moves him or her up the stairs. Stairlifts are often used by people who are handicapped or cannot walk up the stairs.\nStairlifts travel on rails that are bolted to the staircase, not the wall. Most stairlifts have a battery-powered motor. The battery allows the user to ride the lift even if the power goes out.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chair","surface_form":"chair","offset":59},{"uri":"Stairs","surface_form":"stairs","offset":124},{"uri":"Handicap","surface_form":"handicap","offset":176},{"uri":"Walking","surface_form":"walk","offset":198}]}
