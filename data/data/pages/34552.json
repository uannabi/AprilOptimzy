{"id":34552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(business)","text":"A bar is a building or business where alcoholic drinks (such as beer, wine, or liquor) are served. Bars are also found in pubs and nightclubs. They may also serve snack food. In most countries, bars are regulated and licenced by the regional or local governments, which establish laws regarding the opening hours and serving policies. In Canada and the United States, a liquor tax is placed on the sales of alcoholic beverages.\nDrink coasters are used in bars and restaurants to protect the table surface from alcohol.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":11},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":23},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":38},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":48},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":64},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":70},{"uri":"Liquor","surface_form":"liquor","offset":79},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pubs","offset":122},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":131},{"uri":"Snack","surface_form":"snack","offset":163},{"uri":"Licence","surface_form":"licence","offset":217},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":280},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":377},{"uri":"Drink_coaster","surface_form":"Drink coaster","offset":428},{"uri":"Restaurants","surface_form":"restaurants","offset":464},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":510}]}
