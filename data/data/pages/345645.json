{"id":345645,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesak","text":"Ves\u0101kha or Vesak is a holy day. It is observed traditionally by Buddhists in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and the South East Asian countries of Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Burma, and Indonesia. Sometimes it is called \"Buddha's Birthday\". It is basically Buddha's birthday and actually includes the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101na), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\nThe exact date of Ves\u0101kha varies according to the lunar calendars used in different traditions. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on a full moon Uposatha day. This is typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month. Ves\u0101kha Day in China is on the eighth of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The date varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar. It usually falls in April or May. In leap years Ves\u0101kha is celebrated in June.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":64},{"uri":"South_East_Asia","surface_form":"South East Asia","offset":121},{"uri":"Buddha%27s_Birthday","surface_form":"Buddha's Birthday","offset":253},{"uri":"Nirvana","surface_form":"nirv\u0101na","offset":355},{"uri":"Parinirvana","surface_form":"Parinirv\u0101na","offset":383},{"uri":"Gautama_Buddha","surface_form":"Gautama Buddha","offset":399},{"uri":"Buddhist_calendar","surface_form":"Buddhist calendar","offset":548},{"uri":"Chinese_lunar_calendar","surface_form":"Chinese lunar calendar","offset":719},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":792}]}
