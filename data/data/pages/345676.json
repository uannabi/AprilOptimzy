{"id":345676,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model","text":"A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality. Scientific models are used as a basis for scientific work. They can be used to explain, predict, and test, or to develop computer programs or mathematical equations.\nAn example of a complex model is the software used for weather forecasts. The program is based on equations for the variables which affect weather. Meteorological data is fed in, and the program produces predictions (graphs and data) of future weather patterns.\nA scientific model represents complex objects, events, and physical processes in a logical way.\nToxic waste.\nFor instance, to dump toxic waste in a river will harm others down the river. But without models of nature we do not know who, and cannot say how much is harmed or harmful.\nEffects.\nModels of nature affect human decision-making. They are very important to human health, wellness and economics. They also matter in ethics, since most people wish to reduce harm done by their decisions. They matter in law because harms can be proven to have been done in a court.\nForests.\nA forest is very hard to bring back to life, once it is degraded. Smaller models of bits of nature help to understand how much must be left, so future generations can use nature too.\nPreservation.\nTo preserve nature, ecology movement activists now cooperate in a global power network. It includes not just parties in politics but also NGOs like Greenpeace, Earth First or World Wide Fund for Nature.\nEffects on maps.\nOne model of nature they have agreed on is a map that shows ecoregions, which are the natural borders of ecology maps. According to this map, there are 867 regions divided into 8 ecozones - plus others which are in the ocean.\nEffects on language.\nMost anthropologists agree that aboriginal languages have a small model of local nature in them. For instance, there will be more words to describe snow in an Arctic language, and more words to describe shades of green in a rainforest. This is part of the reason to use ecology borders in politics, since people who do not live inside the border do not see or make the same distinctions about nature.\nEffects on humans.\nEconomists study nature's services to see how hard it would be to replace what nature does for humans. They showed in 1995 that the services nature performed for humans were more valuable than all services humans perform for each other all over the world. The value of Earth as a living thing was much more than we could ever afford to replace with our own technology. There has been no real disagreement about any of this.\nPricing all the value of Earth to humans gives a huge number - which proves the pricing is right, since, we must put a high price on anything we have no way to replace.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reality","surface_form":"reality","offset":62},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":226},{"uri":"Weather_forecast","surface_form":"weather forecast","offset":292},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":353},{"uri":"Meteorology","surface_form":"Meteorological","offset":385},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graph","offset":454},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":465},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":582},{"uri":"Toxic_waste","surface_form":"toxic waste","offset":630},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":647},{"uri":"Decision-making","surface_form":"decision-making","offset":820},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":870},{"uri":"Wellness","surface_form":"wellness","offset":878},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":891},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":922},{"uri":"Reduce_harm","surface_form":"reduce harm","offset":956},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1008},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":1063},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1081},{"uri":"Ecology_movement","surface_form":"ecology movement","offset":1296},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":1313},{"uri":"Power_network","surface_form":"power network","offset":1349},{"uri":"NGO","surface_form":"NGO","offset":1414},{"uri":"Greenpeace","surface_form":"Greenpeace","offset":1424},{"uri":"Earth_First","surface_form":"Earth First","offset":1436},{"uri":"World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature","surface_form":"World Wide Fund for Nature","offset":1451},{"uri":"Ecoregion","surface_form":"ecoregion","offset":1556},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":1590},{"uri":"Ecozone","surface_form":"ecozone","offset":1675},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":1715},{"uri":"Anthropology","surface_form":"anthropologists","offset":1748},{"uri":"Aboriginal_language","surface_form":"aboriginal language","offset":1775},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":1891},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":1902},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":1956},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":1967},{"uri":"Nature%27s_services","surface_form":"nature's services","offset":2180},{"uri":"Value_of_Earth","surface_form":"value of Earth","offset":2423},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":2520},{"uri":"Pricing","surface_form":"Pricing","offset":2587},{"uri":"Value_of_Earth","surface_form":"value of Earth","offset":2603}]}
