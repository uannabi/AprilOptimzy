{"id":345681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skadi","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ska\u00F0i\u00A0(sometimes anglicized as Skadi or Skathi) is the goddess of hunting, the wild, mountains, and skiing in Norse mythology. She was born a j\u00F6tunn, daughter of the late Thjazi. She is the wife of Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r, whom she married as part of the compensation provided to her by the \u00C6sir for killing her father. Her marriage to Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r was an unhappy one, however, ultimately ending in their separation, as Ska\u00F0i then took the god Ullr (the stepson of Thor) for her lover. In addition to being Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r\u2019s wife, Ska\u00F0i is the stepmother of his twin children, Freyr and Freyja.\nMarriage to Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r.\nThe gods were celebrating their slaying of the giant (j\u00F6tunn) Thjazi and the simultaneous return of the youth-giving goddess\u00A0I\u00F0unn when Ska\u00F0i arrived, ready to avenge the death of Thjazi, her father. The gods were patient with the giantess, and convinced Ska\u00F0i to ultimately accept a form of compensation instead of seeking vengeance.\nFirst,\u00A0Odin\u00A0took Thjazi\u2019s eyes and cast them into the night sky, where they became stars.\nSecond, the gods were to make Ska\u00F0i laugh. After many feats were tried, none succeeded in bringing a smile to the j\u00F6tunn's face. At last,\u00A0Loki\u00A0tied one end of a rope to a goat and the other around his testicles as he began a game of tug of war with the creature.\nEach screeched and howled in turn, until at last Loki fell over into Ska\u00F0i's lap. The giantess could not help but chuckle. Third, Ska\u00F0i was to be given a god of her choosing in marriage, but she was to select him by the sight of his feet alone. She picked the fairest pair of feet she could see, thinking them to be those of\u00A0Baldr. However, as it turned out, they were those of the sea god, Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":123},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tunn","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunn","offset":155},{"uri":"Nj%C3%B6r%C3%B0r","surface_form":"Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r","offset":211},{"uri":"%C3%86sir","surface_form":"\u00C6sir","offset":287},{"uri":"Ull","surface_form":"Ullr","offset":434},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":455},{"uri":"Freyr","surface_form":"Freyr","offset":558},{"uri":"Freyja","surface_form":"Freyja","offset":568},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tunn","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunn","offset":650},{"uri":"I%C3%B0unn","surface_form":"I\u00F0unn","offset":721},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":938},{"uri":"Loki","surface_form":"Loki","offset":1159},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":1609}]}
