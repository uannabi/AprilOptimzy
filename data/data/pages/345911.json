She was born in Rome.\nMussolini tried to escape to Switzerland, with some of his helpers. After being captured Petacci was given an opportunity to flee, which she declined. She was shot, with the other prisoners. It is possible that Petacci was raped before her death. The bodies were then hung head down in Milan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mistress_(lover)","surface_form":"mistress","offset":62},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":74},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":132},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":361},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":424}]}
