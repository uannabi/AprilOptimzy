{"id":345919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law","text":"Natural law is the idea that there are forms of law that exist by themselves in nature, regardless of whether people exist or recognise them or not. Unlike other forms of law (called \"positive laws\") that have been agreed on by society, such laws would be given to all, and would not be possible to go against. Such rights are called natural. In modern times, human rights are often seen as coming from natural law, but the idea goes back to Ancient Greece.\nImportant philosophers who developed natural law include Aristotle, Plato, Seneca the Younger, Thomas Aquinas, and Immanuel Kant. People who criticized this approach include Jeremy Bentham and Hans Kelsen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":48},{"uri":"Natural_rights","surface_form":"natural","offset":334},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":360},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":442},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":515},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":526},{"uri":"Seneca_the_Younger","surface_form":"Seneca the Younger","offset":533},{"uri":"Thomas_Aquinas","surface_form":"Thomas Aquinas","offset":553},{"uri":"Immanuel_Kant","surface_form":"Immanuel Kant","offset":573},{"uri":"Jeremy_Bentham","surface_form":"Jeremy Bentham","offset":632},{"uri":"Hans_Kelsen","surface_form":"Hans Kelsen","offset":651}]}
