{"id":3460,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway","text":"Norway is a country in the north of Europe. It is the western part of the Scandinavian peninsula. The mainland of Norway is surrounded by the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean on the west side, and borders Russia, Finland, and Sweden to the east. The southern coast touches the Oslofjord, Skagerrak, and the North Sea.\nThe Monarchy of Norway has been independent since 1814. Its head of state is a king - Harald the 5th (as of 2017). The national day is May 17, which celebrates Norway's constitution of 1814. The parliament is called \"Stortinget\" and its members are elected by the people every 4 years.\nAbout 5 million people live in Norway. The capital is the city of Oslo.\nNorwegian is the national language. There are two official written versions of Norwegian called \"Bokm\u00E5l\" and \"Nynorsk\".\nThe Northern Sami language is spoken by around 90% of those who speak one of Norway's 3 Sami languages. Northern Sami is also an official language in a number of municipalities.\nHistory.\nThe battle of Hafrsfjord (872 A.D.) resulted in small kingdoms becoming one larger kingdom, ruled by Harald Fairhair. After the king's death, again there were smaller kingdoms, inside Norway.\nStockfish (or fish that has been freeze-dried, outside in cold weather) has been traded and exported; this happened as early as either the 9th century, 10th century, or 11th century until 1066. Other sources say that the exporting was happening as early as the 12th century; stockfish is one of the country's oldest [type of] things to be sold for export.\nIn 1349 half of the Norwegian people died, getting sick from the bubonic plague (or Black Death).\nWhen a Norwegian king died in 1387, there was no Norwegian king until the 20th century.\nIn 1397, Denmark, Norway and Sweden began the Kalmar Union.\nThe first [known] map, where Norway is drawn, was made in 1482.\nSweden left the Kalmar Union in 1523. From 1536/1537, Denmark and Norway formed a personal union that by 1660 became the state called Denmark\u2013Norway; Norway was the weaker part of the union with Denmark. That union lasted until 1814, when the Treaty of Kiel said that Norway be ceded (or given) to Sweden; Denmark did not cede the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland\nThe Norwegian constitution was written in 1814 and signed on 17th May that year. However, Denmark, on the losing side of the Napoleon wars, lost Norway to Sweden, on the winning side.\nA Swedish\u2013Norwegian War started on 26 July 1814. It ended on 14 August, because of an agreement, called the Convention of Moss.\nThe union with Sweden: It started on 14 August 1814, when the Convention of Moss (en) was signed; the union went on for 90 years.\nThe results of the election in 1882, led to parlamentarism becoming part of Norway's political system; the votes of the \"swamp men\" decided the outcome of the election; they included teachers, artists and craftsmen who were not poor but also did not own land; ownership of land or a contract to use land was necessary to get voting rights; the \"swamp men\" had bough cheap land which was nearly useless, except for getting a right to vote.\nThe right to vote in [national and local] elections, was given to the public (or the general public) in 1898.\nThe end of the Union of Sweden and Norway, was on 7 June 1905, when Norway got its independence.\nIn 1905 Prince Carl of Denmark was elected King of Norway. His name as a king, was King Haakon VII.\nIn World War I, Norway was neutral and served as a trading nation.\nNorway tried to stay neutral in World War II, but was occupied by German forces from 9 April 1940 to 8 May 1945.\nIn 1952 Norway became a member of NATO.\nOil was found in Norway's part of the North Sea, during the 1960s; the oil was found under the sea floor.\nRoyal family since 1905.\nKing Haakon VII was already married, before he came to Norway (in 1905). His wife, Princess Maud, became Queen Maud. Their son, Prince Alexander of Denmark, became Crown Prince Olav and followed after his father as King Olav V in 1957. Olav and his wife, Crown Princess M\u00E4rtha, had three children; Princess Ragnhild, Princess Astrid and Prince Harald (later Crown Prince Harald and in 1991 he followed his father as King Harald V).\nKing Harald is the first king born in Norway in over 600 years. He has two children; Princess M\u00E4rtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus.\nMinistry of Defence.\nThe Government has Norwegian soldiers working in Syria (as of 2017) and Afghanistan, together with soldiers from other countries that belong to NATO.\nEconomy.\nnatural gas, oil, hydroelectric power, and fish.\nOther natural resources are agriculture, forests, and minerals.\nThe government collects much money from various sources, and has policies intended to spread this wealth among Norwegians. This spread of wealth, is done both directly and indirectly.\nEthnicity.\nMost people in Norway are ethnic Norwegians. They speak a language that is related to German and English. Swedish and Danish are so close to Norwegian that most Norwegians understand them. Across Norway, many different dialects are spoken. Norwegians disagree on how to make one correct written language. Therefore, there are two standard languages, Bokm\u00E5l and Nynorsk. Nynorsk is used in writing in most of the western areas and in the central mountains. Bokm\u00E5l is written by most people in the rest of the country.\nA native population of Norway, the Sami people, has its home in the northern parts of the country. Their language is not at all related to Norwegian. In some parishes in the far north, they make up the majority of people. Many Sami now live outside the Sami homeland, mostly in Oslo and other big cities. Earlier, Sami people were forced to speak Norwegian in school. Now Sami is taught as the first language in school for Sami children, and Norwegian is the first foreign language.\nMany immigrants have come to Norway in the last 30\u201340 years. They mostly live in and around Oslo, and in the other big cities. Many immigrants come from nearby countries, like Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Russia. There are also many from countries far away, such as Pakistan, Somalia, Iraq and Vietnam.\nTraditionally, all Norwegians were Lutherans, a variety of the Protestant faith. Still, more than 80% of Norwegians are Lutherans. Other important faiths include Islam, other Protestant groups and Catholicism.\nTourism.\nAmong tourists to Norway, more come from Germany than from any other country. There are also many Swedes, Danes, British, Dutch and Italians visiting Norway. The Swedes and Danes often come in winter to go skiing. The others mainly come in summer. Many people visit Norway to see the Northern Lights, also known as the 'Aurora Borealis'.\nMedia.\nThe largest national newspapers in Norway are Verdens Gang (VG), Aftenposten and Dagbladet.\nCulture.\nNorwegian culture can be compared to English culture in the way that it is considered a bad thing to show off, as opposed to the US, where this is more acceptable. This is a big aspect of Norwegian culture, and it is related to the philosophy of egalitarianism. Because of this, people will understate things, for example if a Norwegian says something is good or nice, it can mean that it's really great.\nItems from the Viking Age (in Norway), are shown in museums: One item is the Gokstad ship.\nMuseums in Norway includes The Ibsen Museum - named after Henrik Ibsen.\nThe farmers' culture (\"bondekulturen\") was brutal.\nUnwanted babies were \"placed in the forest\" (\"sette barn p\u00E5 skogen\") to die, until the nineteenth century; in the end, the [rural] police authority - consisting of individuals called lensmann (en) - were able to control [and stop] these crimes.\nModern, cambered skis were invented in the Norwegian province of Telemark in the early 19th century.\nPolitics.\nIn Norway power is shared among three branches: The justice sector, the government and the parliament (Stortinget). Norway also has a king, Harald V, but he does not have any real power and acts as a symbol and ambassador. This form of government is called a constitutional monarchy. Elections are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition of parties that gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, the winners work together to find out who the prime minister should be, as well as who the other ministers should be.\nThe Conservative Party and the Progress Party are currently working together in a coalition government, after getting elected in the 2013 elections. It's also a minority government, so it has to work together with the other parties in the parliament to make change.\nLargest cities.\nThe city with the most people living there (or inhabitants) is Oslo. The city of Bergen has 251,000 people living there; the city of Trondheim has 172,000 people in its population.\nSome claim that Bergen and Trondheim, each had their time, as Norway's capital during the Middle Ages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":12},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":36},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":74},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":87},{"uri":"Mainland","surface_form":"mainland","offset":102},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North
