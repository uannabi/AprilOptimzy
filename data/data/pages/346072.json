{"id":346072,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder","text":"The adder, \"Vipera berus\" is a venomous viper that can be found throughout most of Western Europe and all the way to East Asia. It is the only venomous snake in the British Isles.\nThey are not highly dangerous: the snake is not aggressive and usually only bites when alarmed or disturbed. Bites can be very painful, but they are rarely fatal. The snake is not threatened, though it is protected in some countries.\nDescription.\nAdults grow to about 60 centimeters (24\u00A0in) in length. The largest, at around 90\u2013104 (35\u201341\u00A0in), are found in Scandinavia. In France and Great Britain, the maximum size is 80\u201387 centimeters (31\u201334\u00A0in), weighing from 50 grams (1.8\u00A0oz) to about 180 grams (6.3\u00A0oz).\nUnusually for snakes, the sexes can be seen by their colour. Females are usually brownish with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings.\nThe species has two morphs. The common pattern is the one with dark stripe with crossbars along the back, on a lighter body. The melanistic morph is very dark all over. The dark morph is more common in females. Polymorphism is usually maintained by natural selection.\nThe adder has a wide range. It lives in across Eurasian.\nIn several European countries it is the only native venomous snake.\nThe adder's diet is mainly small mammals such as mice, voles, shrews and even weasels and moles. Sometimes, they eat slow worms and lizards. They feed on amphibia, such as frogs, newts, and salamanders. There have been reports of adders eating birds, especially nestlings and eggs. Adders are ovoviviparous. Once they reach about 30\u00A0cm (1\u00A0ft) in length, their diet becomes adult.\nThey are protected by law in the U.K., (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981), and by the Berne Convention (the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). It is an offence to harm them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"venomous","offset":31},{"uri":"Viper","surface_form":"viper","offset":40},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":83},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":117},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":165},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":537},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":553},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":564},{"uri":"Polymorphism","surface_form":"morphs","offset":871},{"uri":"Polymorphism","surface_form":"Polymorphism","offset":1062},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":1100},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":1277},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":1293},{"uri":"Vole","surface_form":"vole","offset":1299},{"uri":"Shrew","surface_form":"shrew","offset":1306},{"uri":"Weasel","surface_form":"weasel","offset":1322},{"uri":"Mole","surface_form":"mole","offset":1334},{"uri":"Slow_worm","surface_form":"slow worm","offset":1361},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":1376},{"uri":"Amphibia","surface_form":"amphibia","offset":1398},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":1416},{"uri":"Newt","surface_form":"newt","offset":1423},{"uri":"Salamander","surface_form":"salamander","offset":1434},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1488},{"uri":"Ovoviviparous","surface_form":"ovoviviparous","offset":1537},{"uri":"U.K.","surface_form":"U.K.","offset":1657},{"uri":"Wildlife_and_Countryside_Act_1981","surface_form":"Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981","offset":1664},{"uri":"Berne_Convention","surface_form":"Berne Convention","offset":1711}]}
