{"id":34619,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacosis","text":"=\"preserve\">Psittacosis is a bacterial disease that can be caught from birds such as parrots, pigeons, and parakeets. The disease is not common, with only 50 reported cases in the United States each year.\nPsittacosis usually gives flu-like symptoms, such as fevers, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and a dry cough. The disease can also look like pneumonia on an x-ray. In rare cases, Psittacosis can cause endocarditis - swelling of joints, and swelling of the cornea.\nPsittacosis can be easily treated with antibiotics, especially with Tetracycline. The disease rarely kills people, with only 1% of those who get the disease dying.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacterial","offset":29},{"uri":"Parrots","surface_form":"parrots","offset":85},{"uri":"Pigeons","surface_form":"pigeons","offset":94},{"uri":"Parakeets","surface_form":"parakeets","offset":107},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":180},{"uri":"Flu","surface_form":"flu","offset":231},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":258},{"uri":"Headache","surface_form":"headache","offset":274},{"uri":"Muscle_aches","surface_form":"muscle aches","offset":285},{"uri":"Cough","surface_form":"cough","offset":309},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":347},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"x-ray","offset":363},{"uri":"Endocarditis","surface_form":"endocarditis","offset":407},{"uri":"Cornea","surface_form":"cornea","offset":462},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":509},{"uri":"Tetracycline","surface_form":"Tetracycline","offset":538}]}
