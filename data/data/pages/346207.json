{"id":346207,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome","text":"e=\"preserve\">Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most prevalent female endocrine health matters. PCOS is a complex and heterogeneous problem of uncertain etiology, although there is major evidence that the PCOS can be classified as a genetic health problem. This condition produces symptoms in between five percent to ten percent of females during the reproducing ages. Problems include although are not limited to hormones resulting in acne, hirsutism, resistance to insulin (which then results in diabetes mellitus, in particular Type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults), overweight and (in some women) high cholesterol levels. The symptoms and severity vary greatly among affected women.\nTreatments include weight reduction, low-dose oral contraceptive pills, medroxyprogesterone and spironolactone. Clomiphene can be used as the treatment for those women who wish to get pregnant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":68},{"uri":"Etiology","surface_form":"etiology","offset":158},{"uri":"Genetic","surface_form":"genetic","offset":238},{"uri":"Acne","surface_form":"acne","offset":441},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":472},{"uri":"Diabetes_mellitus","surface_form":"diabetes mellitus","offset":503},{"uri":"Type_2_diabetes","surface_form":"Type 2 diabetes","offset":536},{"uri":"Overweight","surface_form":"overweight","offset":594},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":630}]}
