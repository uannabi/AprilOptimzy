{"id":346400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoflash_capacitor","text":"=\"preserve\">A photo flash capacitor is a capacitor used in the flashes of cameras.\nA camera flash works by applying short bursts of high voltage to a type of gas in a glass tube. The electrical energy required is small, but it has to be given very fast because since the flash doesn't last long. An ordinary battery cannot give such a high voltage or give it so fast, so a photo flash capacitor is used. An electronic circuit increases the battery voltage, and charges a capacitor. When the button is pressed, the capacitor releases the stored energy in about a thousandth of a second and makes a bright flash.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capacitor","surface_form":"capacitor","offset":41},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":74},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":137},{"uri":"Electrical_energy","surface_form":"electrical energy","offset":183},{"uri":"Battery","surface_form":"battery","offset":308}]}
