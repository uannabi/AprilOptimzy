{"id":34642,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_extension","text":"e=\"preserve\">A file extension or filename extension is a suffix at the end of a filename. It is used to show the type of a computer file. This suggests what program can understand it. For example, MYWORDS.TXT is a plain text file and may be opened by a text editor. Filename extensions come after the name of the file, and many of them are three letters long.\nThere are many other commonly used file extensions.\nYou can change the program defaults so that the computer knows which program to open each type of file extension with.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":57},{"uri":"Filename","surface_form":"filename","offset":80},{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"computer file","offset":123},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"program","offset":157},{"uri":"Text_editor","surface_form":"text editor","offset":253}]}
