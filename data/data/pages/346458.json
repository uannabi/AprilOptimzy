{"id":346458,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, Gaussian elimination (also called row reduction) is a method used to solve systems of linear equations. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, a famous German mathematician who wrote about this method, but did not invent it.\nThe goal of Gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in \"row-echelon form\". If a matrix is in row-echelon form, that means that reading from left to right, each row will start with at least one more zero term than the row above it. Some definitions of Gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in \"reduced row-echelon form\". That means that the matrix is in row-echelon form and the only non-zero term in each row is 1. Gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row-echelon matrix result is sometimes called Gauss-Jordan elimination.\nExample.\nSuppose the goal is to find the answers to this system of linear equations.\nThen, row operations can be done on the augmented matrix to simplify it. The table below shows the row reduction process on the system of equations and on the augmented matrix.\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. This is also called \"triangular form\".\nThe matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form. Reading this matrix tells us that the solutions for this system of equations occur when x = 2, y = 3, and z = -1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"System_of_linear_equations","surface_form":"systems of linear equations","offset":104},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":151},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":189},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definitions","offset":493}]}
