{"id":3466,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal","text":"Portugal is a country in Southern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal is the westernmost country of Europe and part of the Mediterranean. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south and by Spain to the north and east. It has been a member of the European Union since 1986. It was under a dictatorship between 1926 and 1974. It has since prospered but was hit hard by the 2007-2008 recession.\nIt has a football team and won the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 meaning it hosts the event for the first time ever in 2018.\nIt once had an empire and was a powerful maritime nation from 1500s\u20131800s, the 10th-largest empire with a maximum land area of 10.4 million km\u00B2 which included Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, East Timoa, S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe, Portuguese Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and even Macau in China (until 2002).\nThree groups of islands in the Atlantic Ocean are also part of Portugal: the Azores (\"A\u00E7ores\"), Madeira and the Savage Isles (\"Ilhas Selvagens\"). The Savage Isles are a small group of uninhabited islands, administered by Madeira.\nPortugal claims that Oliven\u00E7a is also part of its territory, but it is controlled by Spain.\nIt's a popular holiday destination but, is sometimes overlooked in favour of larger countries like France, Spain and Italy. The Algarve region in the south and capital Lisbon are the most popular.\nHistory.\nPortugal became its own kingdom in 1139 but was not officially recognized until 1143. Portugal has had links with England since the 1100s via a treaty. The border with Spain has been almost the same since the 13th century. Fishing and trade with other countries are important here.\nPortugal was important in world exploration for two reasons. Henry the Navigator, a prince from Portugal, was very interested in exploration. Inventions in navigation led to a bigger knowledge of geography.\nThis world exploration began the Portuguese Empire. Portugal was a world power during the 15th and 16th centuries. It tried to colonize Canada in the 16th century. However, it lost a lot of money soon after this. Portugal and Spain were in the Iberian Union from 1580 to 1640. The city of Lisbon was destroyed in an earthquake in 1755. The country was occupied during the Napoleonic Wars. It lost its largest colony, Brazil, in 1822.\nIn 1910, Portugal became a Republic, and in 1926, a military group took control of the country from the Portuguese 1st Republic. This began a time of rule by authoritarian governments. During World War II they were neutral but friendly to Britain. In 1974 a peaceful left-wing army coup, called the \"Carnation Revolution\", happened. The coup changed how the country was run.\nThe next year, Portugal allowed its colonies in Africa to be on their own: Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe.\nEast Timor in Asia declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975, and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later.\nPortugal went into the European Union in 1986. Another Asian colony, Macau, became part of China\nThe main language of Portugal is Portuguese.\nSome famous Portuguese people are D. Afonso Henriques, Henry the Navigator, Bartolomeu Dias, Vasco da Gama, Pedro \u00C1lvares Cabral, Ferdinand Magellan, Lu\u00EDs de Cam\u00F5es, Fernando Pessoa, Am\u00E1lia Rodrigues, \u00C1lvaro Siza Vieira, Eduardo Souto de Moura.\nLu\u00EDs de Cam\u00F5es wrote the national poem of Portugal. It is called \"Os Lus\u00EDadas\" and was written in 1572.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":14},{"uri":"Southern_Europe","surface_form":"Southern Europe","offset":25},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":166},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":210},{"uri":"Eurovision_Song_Contest_2017","surface_form":"Eurovision Song Contest 2017","offset":448},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":696},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":793},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":858},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":873},{"uri":"Azores","surface_form":"Azores","offset":919},{"uri":"Madeira_Islands","surface_form":"Madeira","offset":938},{"uri":"Savage_Isles","surface_form":"Savage Isles","offset":954},{"uri":"Olivenza","surface_form":"Oliven\u00E7a","offset":1093},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":1394},{"uri":"1139","surface_form":"1139","offset":1405},{"uri":"1143","surface_form":"1143","offset":1450},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1538},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":1579},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"Fishing","offset":1593},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":1605},{"uri":"Exploration","surface_form":"exploration","offset":1684},{"uri":"Henry_the_Navigator","surface_form":"Henry the Navigator","offset":1713},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"Invention","offset":1794},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":1808},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":1848},{"uri":"Portuguese_Empire","surface_form":"Portuguese Empire","offset":1892},{"uri":"World_power","surface_form":"world power","offset":1926},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th","offset":1949},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th centuries","offset":1958},{"uri":"Iberian_Union","surface_form":"Iberian Union","offset":2103},{"uri":"Lisbon","surface_form":"Lisbon","offset":2148},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":2175},{"uri":"1755","surface_form":"1755","offset":2189},{"uri":"Occupation","surface_form":"occupied","offset":2211},{"uri":"Napoleonic_Wars","surface_form":"Napoleonic Wars","offset":2231},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":2268},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":2276},{"uri":"1822","surface_form":"1822","offset":2287},{"uri":"1910","surface_form":"1910","offset":2296},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"Republic","offset":2320},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":2337},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":2345},{"uri":"Portuguese_1st_Republic","surface_form":"Portuguese 1st Republic","offset":2397},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":2443},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":2465},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":2485},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":2532},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":2560},{"uri":"Coup","surface_form":"coup","offset":2575},{"uri":"Carnation_Revolution","surface_form":"Carnation Revolution","offset":2593},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":2716},{"uri":"Mozambique","surface_form":"Mozambique","offset":2743},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":2755},{"uri":"Guinea-Bissau","surface_form":"Guinea-Bissau","offset":2763},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":2778},{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":2793},{"uri":"East_Timor","surface_form":"East Timor","offset":2816},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":2830},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":2930},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":2988},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":3006},{"uri":"Asian","surface_form":"Asian","offset":3020},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":3034},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":3056},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":3095},{"uri":"Afonso_I_of_Portugal","surface_form":"D.
