{"id":346610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term psychological warfare is used to describe methods that military use in war-time. We may understand it as an attempt to influence the behavior/beliefs of enemy armed forces and/or foreign civilian populations. Psychological warfare has many similarities with propaganda messages.\nTerm.\nThe term \"pychological warfare\" has always been considered problematic and offensive. The use of military power is increasingly not any more on the level of an local armored conflict, but on the global basis using mass media. The NATO uses the term \"psychological operation\" (PSYOP).\nPeople are trying not to use the term \"psychological warfare\". They would rather use terms like \"stabilisation\" or \"satisfaction\".\nHistory.\nPsychological warfare has mostly been introduced in the second world war. Both Axis Powers and Allied used it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":77},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":93},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":209},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":280},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"mass media","offset":521},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":537},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"second world war","offset":787},{"uri":"Axis_Powers","surface_form":"Axis Powers","offset":810},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allied","offset":826}]}
