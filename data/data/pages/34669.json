{"id":34669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hiragana are part of the Japanese writing system. Japanese writing normally consists of kanji which are used for the main words in a sentence, usually content words, and hiragana which are used for the little words that make up the grammar (in English these would be words like \u201Cfrom\u201D and \u201Chis\u201D) called particles. Hiragana is also used for the endings of some of the words.\nHiragana is a syllabary, which means that each hiragana character stands for a syllable. It is therefore different from a language such as English which uses an alphabet in which most of the letters stand for one bit of sound (phoneme). There is also another syllabary called katakana which is mostly used for foreign words and names. The two kana systems are quite easy to learn, but kanji takes years of practice. In contrast, the kana systems can be learnt in two weeks.\nIn the past hiragana was considered as women's writing, while men wrote in kanji. Since kanji suit well in Chinese but poorly in Japanese, it was the women who wrote the first Japanese books, poems and songs. Later the Buddhist clerics, such as Rennyo (d. 1498), wrote in hiragana to make the religious message easy to understand so that everyone could read it.\nSometimes the whole of a text may be written in hiragana to make it easy. This would be used in books for young children, or for students starting to learn Japanese, or when writing the lyrics for songs underneath the music where it is important to show how the words fit the music. Some rare or strange kanji may also have so-called \"furigana\" characters above it. They are hiragana which show how the kanji is to be pronounced.\nIn Hiragana each character (kana) is either a vowel (such as \"a\": \u3042); a consonant followed by a vowel (such as \"ka\": \u304B); or, at the end of a syllable, an \"n\": (\u3093), although sometimes this sounds more like an \u201Cm\u201D or \u201Cng\u201D.\nAs an example of how the grammatical endings are used we can take the verb \u201Cto eat\u201D which is\u98DF\u3079\u308B (taberu). Here the main part of the word \u201Ceat\u201D (pronounced \u201Cta\u201D in this case) is the kanji \u98DF. The other two syllables: \u201Cbe-ru\u201D are in hiragana (\u3079\u308B). To say \u201CI ate\u201D or \u201Cyou ate\u201D etc. you would say \u201Ctabemashita\u201D, written\u98DF\u3079\u307E\u3057\u305F (\u201Cbe-ma-shi-ta\u201D is written in hiragana).\nTable of hiragana.\nThe main hiragana characters are shown in this table.\nNotice that the sound \u201Chu\u201D is unknown in Japanese, so \u3075 is pronounced \u201Cfu\u201D with an \u201Cf\u201D which is blown lightly, like someone blowing out a candle.\nTo write the voiced sounds for \u201Cg\u201D, \u201Cd\u201D, \u201Cz\u201D and \u201Cb\u201D two little lines called a dakuten (\u309B) are added after a character starting with the unvoiced sounds \u201Ck\u201D, \u201Ct\u201D, \u201Cs\u201D and \u201Ch\u201D. A circle, (\u309C), is added after a \u201Ch\u201D for the sound \u201Cp\u201D. For example: \u306F gives the sound \u201Cha\u201D; \u3070 gives the sound \u201Cba\u201D; \u3071 gives the sound \u201Cpa\u201D.\nSometimes when words are joined together to make compound words, the first sound of the second part changes from unvoiced to voiced. For example: \u201Chana\u201D: \u306F\u306A (nose) + \u3061\u201Cchi\u201D (blood) becomes \u306F\u306A\u3062 \u201Chanaji\u201D (nosebleed)\nSome Japanese syllables which have sliding sounds add a small version of the hiragana for \"ya\", \"yu\" or \"yo\" (\u3083, \u3085 and \u3087) This is called \u201Cy\u014Don\u201D. For example: \u201Csha\u201D sounds like \u201Cshi\u201D+\u201Dya\u201D so \u201Cdensha\u201D (a tram) is written \u3067\u3093\u3057\u3083. A small \u201Ctsu\u201D \u3063 called a \u201Csokuon\u201D shows a doubled consonant: \u201CNippon\u201D (Japan) is written \u306B\u3063\u307D\u3093. Without the small \u201Ctsu\u201D the first syllable would sound like the word \u201Cknee\u201D.\nA student starting to learn to write Japanese can start with hiragana or with katakana. Hiragana is the basis of learning Japanese script. However, for someone who is about to visit Japan and just wants to be able to recognize a few words, katakana will be more useful as it will help to read many of the road signs, shop names and the names of things on restaurant menus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":38},{"uri":"Kanji","surface_form":"kanji","offset":101},{"uri":"Content_word","surface_form":"content words","offset":164},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":245},{"uri":"Particles_in_Japanese","surface_form":"particles","offset":316},{"uri":"Syllabary","surface_form":"syllabary","offset":401},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":548},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":614},{"uri":"Katakana","surface_form":"katakana","offset":663},{"uri":"Kanji","surface_form":"kanji","offset":772},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"women's","offset":900},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"men","offset":923},{"uri":"Kanji","surface_form":"kanji","offset":936},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":968},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":990},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clerics","offset":1089},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":1699},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":1944}]}
