It is administered by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nThe prize is for \"international basic research in the disciplines Astronomy, Mathematics, Geosciences, and Biosciences, with particular emphasis on ecology, and rheumatoid arthritis\" (the disease from which Holger severely suffered in his last years). According to the Academy, \"these disciplines are chosen so as to complement those for which the Nobel Prizes are awarded.\"\nOnly one award is given each year, according to a rotating scheme \u2013 astronomy and mathematics; then geosciences; then biosciences. A Crafoord Prize is only awarded for arthritis when a committee decides that substantial progress in the field has been made. On Crafoord Day in April, the prize is presented by the King of Sweden, who also presents the Nobel Prize Awards at the ceremony in December.
