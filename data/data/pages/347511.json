{"id":347511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huxley","text":"Sir Andrew Huxley OM FRS (Andrew Fielding Huxley, 22 November 1917 \u2013 30 May 2012) was an English physiologist and biophysicist.\nHuxley was born in Hampstead, London. He was the youngest son of writer and editor Leonard Huxley by his second wife Rosalind Bruce. He was the half-brother of writer Aldous Huxley and fellow biologist Julian Huxley, and grandson of biologist T H. Huxley. He studied Natural Sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge.\nHuxley won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alan Hodgkin and John Eccles for his experimental and mathematical work with Alan Hodgkin on the basis of nerve action potentials. These are the electrical impulses that make nerve fibres work, and so the whole central nervous system.\nHodgkin and Huxley shared the prize that year with Sir John Eccles, who was cited for research on nerve synapses. Hodgkin and Huxley's findings led the pair to suggest the existence of ion channels, which were found only decades later.\nHuxley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 17 March 1955. He was President of the Royal Society from 1980 to 1985, and Master of Trinity from 1984\u20131990. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 November 1974, and appointed to the Order of Merit on 11 November 1983.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Merit_(Commonwealth)","surface_form":"OM","offset":18},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":21},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":89},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiologist","offset":97},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"biophysicist","offset":114},{"uri":"Hampstead","surface_form":"Hampstead","offset":147},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":158},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":193},{"uri":"Editor","surface_form":"editor","offset":204},{"uri":"Leonard_Huxley_(writer)","surface_form":"Leonard Huxley","offset":211},{"uri":"Aldous_Huxley","surface_form":"Aldous Huxley","offset":295},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":320},{"uri":"Julian_Huxley","surface_form":"Julian Huxley","offset":330},{"uri":"Grandson","surface_form":"grandson","offset":349},{"uri":"Thomas_Henry_Huxley","surface_form":"T H.
