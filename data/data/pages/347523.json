{"id":347523,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose","text":"Professor Satyendra Nath Bose laid down the basics for the Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. The boson, a kind of particle of matter, is named in his honor. He was a member of the Royal Society and was awarded India's second highest civilian award (called the Padma Vibhushan) in 1954.\nBose\u2019s works helped statistical mechanics, the electromagnetic properties of the ionosphere, the theories of X-ray crystallography, and unified field theory. This work also led Einstein to work with him.\nBose was interested in many subjects including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature and music. He worked on many research and development projects for India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_statistics","surface_form":"Bose\u2013Einstein statistics","offset":59},{"uri":"Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate","surface_form":"Bose\u2013Einstein condensate","offset":106},{"uri":"Boson","surface_form":"boson","offset":136},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":219},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":249},{"uri":"Padma_Vibhushan","surface_form":"Padma Vibhushan","offset":299},{"uri":"Statistical_mechanics","surface_form":"statistical mechanics","offset":345},{"uri":"Electromagnetic","surface_form":"electromagnetic","offset":372},{"uri":"Ionosphere","surface_form":"ionosphere","offset":406},{"uri":"X-ray_crystallography","surface_form":"X-ray crystallography","offset":434},{"uri":"Unified_field_theory","surface_form":"unified field theory","offset":461},{"uri":"Einstein","surface_form":"Einstein","offset":502}]}
