{"id":347570,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier","text":"A rectifier is a device that can convert Alternating current (AC) to Direct current (DC). This is a process called rectification. Many rectifiers in the 20th century were made of metals like copper, iron, and silver. Nowadays most are semiconductor<nowiki/>s.\n\"Half-wave rectifiers\" only have one side of a waveform, while the \"full-wave rectifiers\" use both sides of a waveform. The left-hand side of the full-wave rectifier circuit consists of four diodes: a diode bridge. Half-wave current is a current that can only flow in alternate current, a full-wave current can flow both alternating current and direct current.\nDiode bridge is electrical circuit that consists of four diodes. It acts as a full wave rectifier to convert alternating current to direct current.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alternating_current","surface_form":"Alternating current","offset":41},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"Direct current","offset":69},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":235},{"uri":"Electrical_circuit","surface_form":"electrical circuit","offset":637},{"uri":"Diode","surface_form":"diode","offset":678}]}
