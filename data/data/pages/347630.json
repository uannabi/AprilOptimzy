{"id":347630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Belarus","text":"=\"preserve\">Country Code: +375\nInternational Call Prefix: 00 (was 8~10)\nBelarus began using its own country code +375 in 1995. Before that it was part of the +7 international country code. The local numbering plan came from USSR. It has changed little.\nGeographic area codes were made based on previous 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead \"0\". Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country_Code","surface_form":"Country Code","offset":12},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":72},{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"USSR","offset":224}]}
