A salt holder or a salt cellar is placed on top of the bread loaf or secured in a hole on the top of the loaf.\nIn modern Russia, on official occasions, the \"bread and salt\" is presented by young women dressed in national costumes (e.g., sarafan and kokoshnik).\nWhen this tradition is observed in spaceflight, small packages of bread and salt are used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":20},{"uri":"Greeting","surface_form":"greeting","offset":35},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":72},{"uri":"Guest","surface_form":"guest","offset":116},{"uri":"Loaf","surface_form":"loaf","offset":148},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":156},{"uri":"Rushnik","surface_form":"rushnik","offset":175},{"uri":"Embroidered","surface_form":"embroidered","offset":185},{"uri":"Towel","surface_form":"towel","offset":197},{"uri":"Salt_cellar","surface_form":"salt cellar","offset":224},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":326},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":400},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":426},{"uri":"Sarafan","surface_form":"sarafan","offset":442},{"uri":"Kokoshnik","surface_form":"kokoshnik","offset":454},{"uri":"Human_spaceflight","surface_form":"spaceflight","offset":501}]}
