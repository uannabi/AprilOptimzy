{"id":347708,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Castle_Complex","text":"The Mirsky Castle Complex is a UNESCO World Heritage site in Belarus. It is in the town of Mir.\nThe building of the castle began at the end of the 15th century. It is in the Gothic architecture style. Building of the castle was completed by Duke Ilinich in the early 16th century. Around 1568 the Mir Castle was owned by Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"the Orphan\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142. He finished building the castle in the Renaissance style. A three-storey palace was built along the eastern and northern walls of the castle.\nAfter being not lived in for nearly a century, and having severe damage during the Napoleonic period, the castle was restored at the end of the 19th century. In 1813, after the death of Dominik Hieronim Radziwi\u0142\u0142, his daughter Stefania got the castle. She married Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The castle later went to their daughter Maria, who married Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00FCrst.\nTheir son, Maurice Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00FCrst sold the castle to Nikolai Sviatopolk-Mirski in 1895. Nikolaj's son Michail began to rebuild the castle according to the plans of architect Teodor Bursze. The Sviatopolk-Mirski family owned the castle up to 1939.\nDuring WWII, it came under Nazi control. It was a ghetto for the local Jewish population. Between 1944 and 1956, the castle was used as a housing facility. This partly damaged the castle's inside.\nIn December, 2000, the Mir Castle was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":31},{"uri":"World_Heritage_site","surface_form":"World Heritage site","offset":38},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":61},{"uri":"Mir%2C_Belarus","surface_form":"Mir","offset":91},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":116},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic architecture","offset":174},{"uri":"Miko%C5%82aj_Krzysztof_%26quot%3Bthe_Orphan%26quot%3B_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82","surface_form":"Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"the Orphan\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142","offset":321},{"uri":"Renaissance_architecture","surface_form":"Renaissance style","offset":402},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleonic period","offset":588},{"uri":"Dominik_Hieronim_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82","surface_form":"Dominik Hieronim Radziwi\u0142\u0142","offset":691},{"uri":"Ludwig_zu_Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg","surface_form":"Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg","offset":769},{"uri":"Chlodwig%2C_Prince_of_Hohenlohe-Schillingsf%C3%BCrst","surface_form":"Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00FCrst","offset":874},{"uri":"Maurice_Hohenlohe-Schillingsf%C3%BCrst","surface_form":"Maurice Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00FCrst","offset":921},{"uri":"Nikolai_Ivanovitch_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","surface_form":"Nikolai Sviatopolk-Mirski","offset":974},{"uri":"Michail_Sviatopolk-Mirski","surface_form":"Michail","offset":1023},{"uri":"Teodor_Bursze","surface_form":"Teodor Bursze","offset":1095},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":1413},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":1425}]}
