{"id":347710,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesvizh_Castle","text":"Nesvizh Castle or Niasvizh Castle is a castle of the Radziwill family in Nesvizh in Belarus.\nHistory.\nThe estate was owned by the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Belarus magnate family starting in 1533. It was given to Miko\u0142aj Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and his brother Jan Radziwi\u0142\u0142 after the Kiszka family died. Since the Radziwills were one of the most important and rich clans of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it was there that the Lithuanian Archive was moved in 1551. In 1586 the estate was made into an \"ordynacja\".\nIn 1582 Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"Sierotka\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142 started to build a large square three-storey chateau. Building was completed by 1604. They added several galleries half a century later. The ch\u00E2teau's corners had four octagonal towers.\nIn 1706, during the Great Northern War, Charles XII's army sacked the castle. The destroyed its fortifications. Several decades later, the Radziwills asked some German and Italian architects to fix and enlarge the chateau. Antoni Zaleski decorated its yellow facades with baroque stucco work. The 16th-century castle gates were also reconstructed. It was at this time that the three separate buildings surrounding the central courtyard were joined into a single structure.\nThe most important building in Nesvizh is the Corpus Christi Church. It is connected with the castle by a dam over a ditch. It has coffins of 72 members of the Radziwill family, each in a simple coffin made of birch and marked with Tr\u0105by Coat of Arms. Designed by the Italian architect Gian Maria Bernardoni, the church is said to be the first Jesuit temple patterned after Il Ges\u00F9 in Rome. It is the first domed basilica with Baroque facade in the world and the first baroque piece of architecture in Eastern Europe.\nIn 1770 the castle was taken by Russian forces. The Radziwill family was removed. The Lithuanian Archive was moved to Saint Petersburg (where it remains). The works of art in the palace were given to various Russian nobles. The Russian army left. The palace slowly fell into disrepair. It was restored by the Radziwills. Between 1881 and 1886 the castle's insides were fixed by Prince Anton Radizwill and his French wife, Marie de Castellane. They also made a landscape park in English style. With an area of more than one square kilometre, the park is one of the biggest in Europe.\nIn 1939, the Radziwill family was removed from the castle by the invading Red Army. In Soviet times, the chateau was used a sanatorium.\nIn 1994, the castle complex was made a national historical and cultural reserve. Twelve years later, the castle complex was added on the World Heritage List.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radziwill","surface_form":"Radziwill","offset":53},{"uri":"Nesvizh","surface_form":"Nesvizh","offset":73},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":84},{"uri":"Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82","surface_form":"Radziwi\u0142\u0142","offset":130},{"uri":"Magnate","surface_form":"magnate","offset":148},{"uri":"Miko%C5%82aj_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82","surface_form":"Miko\u0142aj Radziwi\u0142\u0142","offset":197},{"uri":"Jan_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82","surface_form":"Jan Radziwi\u0142\u0142","offset":231},{"uri":"Kiszka_(family)","surface_form":"Kiszka","offset":255},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Lithuania","offset":349},{"uri":"Lithuanian_Archive","surface_form":"Lithuanian Archive","offset":397},{"uri":"Ordynat","surface_form":"ordynacja","offset":472},{"uri":"Miko%C5%82aj_Krzysztof_%26quot%3BSierotka%26quot%3B_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82","surface_form":"Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"Sierotka\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142","offset":492},{"uri":"Chateau","surface_form":"chateau","offset":576},{"uri":"Great_Northern_War","surface_form":"Great Northern War","offset":737},{"uri":"Charles_XII_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Charles XII","offset":757},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":813},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":897},{"uri":"Antoni_Zaleski","surface_form":"Antoni Zaleski","offset":940},{"uri":"Stucco","surface_form":"stucco","offset":997},{"uri":"Corpus_Christi_Church","surface_form":"Corpus Christi Church","offset":1236},{"uri":"Tr%C4%85by_Coat_of_Arms","surface_form":"Tr\u0105by Coat of Arms","offset":1422},{"uri":"Gian_Maria_Bernardoni","surface_form":"Gian Maria Bernardoni","offset":1476},{"uri":"Jesuit","surface_form":"Jesuit","offset":1534},{"uri":"Il_Ges%C3%B9","surface_form":"Il Ges\u00F9","offset":1564},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1575},{"uri":"Basilica","surface_form":"basilica","offset":1603},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"baroque","offset":1659},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg","offset":1826},{"uri":"Radziwills","surface_form":"Radziwills","offset":2017},{"uri":"Marie_de_Castellane","surface_form":"Marie de Castellane","offset":2130},{"uri":"Landscape_garden","surface_form":"landscape park","offset":2168},{"uri":"Red_Army","surface_form":"Red Army","offset":2365},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":2378},{"uri":"Sanatorium","surface_form":"sanatorium","offset":2415},{"uri":"World_Heritage_List","surface_form":"World Heritage List","offset":2564}]}
