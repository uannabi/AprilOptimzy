It is a control memory in which stored information can be altered, but not as easily as in ordinary memory.\nA PROM that is able to be erased and rewritten is called an EPROM (standing for erasable programmable read-only memory). A PROM that is able to erased and rewritten only using electricity is called an EEPROM (standing for electrically erasable programmable read-only memory).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Read-only_memory","surface_form":"read-only memory","offset":50},{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"programmed","offset":85},{"uri":"EPROM","surface_form":"EPROM","offset":318},{"uri":"EEPROM","surface_form":"EEPROM","offset":459}]}
