{"id":348129,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermestidae","text":"Dermestidae are a family of Coleoptera. They are also known as skin beetles, larder beetles, hide beetles, leather beetles, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are 500 to 700 species of dermestids. They can be up to 112 mm in length. Adults have round oval-shaped bodies covered in scales or setae.\nMost dermestids are scavengers that feed on dry animal or plant material. This includes skin or pollen, animal hair, feathers, dead insects, and natural fibers. Dermestids can be found living in dead animals and feeding on them. Others can be found living in mammal, bird, bee, or wasp nests. \"Thaumaglossa\" only lives in the egg cases of mantids. Many \"Trogoderma\" species are pests that eat grain.\nThe beetles found living in dead animals are studied in criminal investigations (forensic entomology). Many species are pests which can damage natural fibers in homes and businesses. Dermestids are sometimes used by natural history museums to clean animal skeletons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coleoptera","surface_form":"Coleoptera","offset":28},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":181},{"uri":"Oval","surface_form":"oval","offset":258},{"uri":"Setae","surface_form":"setae","offset":298},{"uri":"Scavengers","surface_form":"scavengers","offset":325},{"uri":"Pollen","surface_form":"pollen","offset":401},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":437},{"uri":"Fiber","surface_form":"fiber","offset":458},{"uri":"Wasp","surface_form":"wasp","offset":586},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":591},{"uri":"Thaumaglossa","surface_form":"Thaumaglossa","offset":599},{"uri":"Mantid","surface_form":"mantid","offset":644},{"uri":"Trogoderma","surface_form":"Trogoderma","offset":659},{"uri":"Pests","surface_form":"pests","offset":683},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":698},{"uri":"Forensic_entomology","surface_form":"forensic entomology","offset":786},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"natural history","offset":921},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":937},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":961}]}
