{"id":348172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylidae","text":"Hylidae is a family of tree frogs. Some of the Hylids are semi-aquatic while others will be terrestrial frogs.\nCharacteristics.\nMost hylids has forward-facing eyes that gives them binocular vision. These hylids are arboreal species, meaning they live in trees. Non-aboreal species do not have any of these advantages. The \"Cyclorana\" species are burrowing frogs. They spend most of their time underground. Hylids will eat insects and other invertebrates. Larger species can eat small vertebrates.\nHylids lay their eggs in ponds. Some lay their eggs in puddles that in holes inside trees. Others lay their eggs on plants, if water is near. The tadpoles will drop from the plants and into the pond when they hatch. In South America, female hylids carry the eggs on their backs until they hatch.\nSpecies.\nThe European tree frog (\"Hyla arborea\") lives in middle and Southern Europe. They can also be found in Asia and North Africa. These species are noisy during a rainstorms. Many Hylidae live in North America, for example \"Hyla versicolor\" (Grey Tree Frog) and \"Hyla cinerea\" (American Green Tree Frog). The spring peeper (\"Pseudacris crucifer\") can also be found in the eastern United States. The spring peeper makes loud noises during the spring and summer.\nThe word \"tree frog\" is a popular term for many Hylidae. For example, \"Hyla versicolor\" is the name of the changeable tree frog, \"Trachycephalus lichenatus\" is the name of the lichened tree frog, and \"Trachycephalus marmoratus\" is the marbled tree frog. However, the name \"tree frog\" is not unique to this family. \"Tree frog\" is used more often for many species in Rhacophoridae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":13},{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":23},{"uri":"Semi","surface_form":"semi","offset":58},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":63},{"uri":"Terrestrial","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":92},{"uri":"Eyes","surface_form":"eyes","offset":159},{"uri":"Binocular","surface_form":"binocular","offset":180},{"uri":"Vision","surface_form":"vision","offset":190},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":215},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":224},{"uri":"Cyclorana","surface_form":"Cyclorana","offset":323},{"uri":"Burrow","surface_form":"burrow","offset":346},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":422},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":440},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":484},{"uri":"Pond","surface_form":"pond","offset":522},{"uri":"Puddle","surface_form":"puddle","offset":552},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":581},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":643},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":716},{"uri":"European_tree_frog","surface_form":"European tree frog","offset":806},{"uri":"Southern_Europe","surface_form":"Southern Europe","offset":862},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":905},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":914},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":961},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":965},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":994},{"uri":"Grey_Tree_Frog","surface_form":"Grey Tree Frog","offset":1040},{"uri":"American_Green_Tree_Frog","surface_form":"American Green Tree Frog","offset":1076},{"uri":"Spring_peeper","surface_form":"spring peeper","offset":1107},{"uri":"Eastern_United_States","surface_form":"eastern United States","offset":1170},{"uri":"Changeable_tree_frog","surface_form":"changeable tree frog","offset":1366},{"uri":"Lichened_tree_frog","surface_form":"lichened tree frog","offset":1435},{"uri":"Marbled_tree_frog","surface_form":"marbled tree frog","offset":1494},{"uri":"Unique","surface_form":"unique","offset":1550},{"uri":"Rhacophoridae","surface_form":"Rhacophoridae","offset":1624}]}
