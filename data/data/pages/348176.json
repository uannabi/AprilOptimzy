{"id":348176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugality","text":"Frugality is a quality of spending money very carefully and in limited amounts. This decision can be made for various reasons. Some are: to save money, make costs smaller and get the most possible value from purchases.\nExamples.\nSome ways of attempting to be frugal could be to make less waste, stop doing things (such as travel or entertainment) with high costs and having control over spending desires. Also, being careful to get all the use out of an item before replacing it and not agreeing with customs that have high costs. More ways could be using zero cost choices, using barter (trading without money), and having a good knowledge of prices.\nSome people will use a discount store to find low cost things. Some will buy things used by other people in thrift stores, garage sales, flea markets, or from classified advertising in a newspaper or on the internet from a site similar to Craigslist.\nPhilosophy.\nFrugality in some philosophies is when a person does not agree with experts who say they know what is good for everybody. This is a special use of the word for philosophers.\nMany religions think frugality is important and good. The Quakers and Puritans are two examples of Christian religions that put high value on frugality. The base of this idea is that people should store money to use when any person (not only friends) needs help.\nEnvironmentalists think that being frugal is good. They think because ancient humans did not need many things and were able to get happiness from nature it is more natural to be frugal than to agree with the customs of modern living.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":501},{"uri":"Barter","surface_form":"barter","offset":581},{"uri":"Discount_store","surface_form":"discount store","offset":675},{"uri":"Thrift_store","surface_form":"thrift store","offset":760},{"uri":"Garage_sale","surface_form":"garage sale","offset":775},{"uri":"Flea_market","surface_form":"flea market","offset":789},{"uri":"Classified_advertising","surface_form":"classified advertising","offset":811},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":839},{"uri":"Craigslist","surface_form":"Craigslist","offset":891},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophies","offset":933},{"uri":"Quakers","surface_form":"Quakers","offset":1147},{"uri":"Puritans","surface_form":"Puritans","offset":1159},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":1188},{"uri":"Environmentalism","surface_form":"Environmentalists","offset":1352},{"uri":"Hunter-gatherer","surface_form":"ancient humans","offset":1422},{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":1560}]}
