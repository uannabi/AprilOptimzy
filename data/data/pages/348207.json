He traveled a lot, mostly in France, and to Mexico. He sided with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-century. Carpentier was jailed and exiled for his leftist political philosophies.\nCarpentier studied and understood music. He wrote a book \"La m\u00FAsica en Cuba\" in the music of Cuba. He put in musical themes and literary techniques in his writing. Although Carpentier wrote many types of writing, such as journalism, radio drama, playwrighting, academic essays, opera and libretto, he is best known for his novels. He was among the first to use magical realism. He explored the fantastic quality of Latin American history and culture.\nCarpentier's writing style used the Baroque style which had become popular again. It was called \"New World Baroque\". It was a style that Latin American artists took from the European model. Carpentier also brought the Surrealist theory to Latin American literature.
