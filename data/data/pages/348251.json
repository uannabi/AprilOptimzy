{"id":348251,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_Space_Observatory","text":"The Herschel Space Observatory is a European Space Agency instrument. It is the largest infrared telescope ever put into orbit. Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel, the discoverer of the infrared spectrum, double stars, and planet Uranus.\nThe device is sensitive to the far infrared and submillimetre short wavebands. It has a single mirror of in diameter.\nThe observatory was carried into orbit in May 2009. It is at the second Lagrangian point (L2) of the Earth-Sun system. At these points, 1,500,000 kilometres (930,000 miles) from the Earth, gravity balances, so the object stays in place.\nThe Herschel Observatory can record ('see') the coldest and dustiest objects in space. For example, dusty galaxies just starting to form new stars. The United States, through NASA, is working with in the ESA-built and operated observatory. It is the fourth 'cornerstone' mission in the ESA science program, along with Rosetta, Planck, and the Gaia mission.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight"],"annotations":[{"uri":"European_Space_Agency","surface_form":"European Space Agency","offset":36},{"uri":"Instrument","surface_form":"instrument","offset":58},{"uri":"Infrared_telescope","surface_form":"infrared telescope","offset":88},{"uri":"William_Herschel","surface_form":"Sir William Herschel","offset":152},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":196},{"uri":"Uranus","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":240},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"far infrared","offset":279},{"uri":"Millimetre","surface_form":"millimetre","offset":299},{"uri":"Lagrangian_point","surface_form":"second Lagrangian point","offset":431},{"uri":"List_of_objects_at_Lagrangian_points","surface_form":"Earth-Sun system","offset":467},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":555},{"uri":"Dust","surface_form":"dust","offset":663},{"uri":"Galaxies","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":709},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":778},{"uri":"Rosetta_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Rosetta","offset":921},{"uri":"Planck_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Planck","offset":930},{"uri":"Gaia_mission","surface_form":"Gaia mission","offset":946}]}
