{"id":348261,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptodactylidae","text":"Leptodactylidae is a family of frogs. They are believed to have been on Earth since the Cenozoic era or at the end of the Mesozoic. There are 1,100 species in 50 genera. The \"Eleutherodactylus\" is the largest genus with over 700 different species. Leptodactylidae frogs lives in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The family includes terrestrial, burrowing, aquatic, and arboreal frogs.\nSome of the frogs lay their eggs in foam nests. They will lay their eggs in crevices, on the surface of water, or on the forest floors. For tadpoles that are laid on the forest floors will remain there until they become frogs. They will not eat anything. In the genus \"Elutherodactylus\", the eggs will automatically become small frogs. They will not go through the tadpole stage. Leptodactylids can be found in fossil records. One specimen, was found preserved and is thought to be 37 million years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":21},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":31},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":72},{"uri":"Cenozoic","surface_form":"Cenozoic","offset":88},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":122},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":148},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":162},{"uri":"Eleutherodactylus","surface_form":"Eleutherodactylus","offset":175},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":209},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":279},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":291},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central","offset":306},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":318},{"uri":"Terrestrial","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":353},{"uri":"Burrow","surface_form":"burrow","offset":366},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":377},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":390},{"uri":"Foam","surface_form":"foam nest","offset":442},{"uri":"Crevices","surface_form":"crevices","offset":482},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":510},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":527},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":546},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":817},{"uri":"Record","surface_form":"record","offset":824},{"uri":"Preserve","surface_form":"preserved","offset":857},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":891}]}
