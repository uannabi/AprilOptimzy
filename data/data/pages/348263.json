{"id":348263,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleutherodactylus","text":"Eleutherodactylus is a genus of frogs in the Eleutherodactylidae family. There are 185 species of \"Eleutherodactylus\". Many of them are commonly called \"rain frogs\" or \"robber frogs\". This is because of their sharp, high-pitched, and insect-like calls.\nThe common coqu\u00ED (\"Eleutherodactylus coqui\") is the best known species. They are a national symbol of Puerto Rico. They are also an invasive species in the US state of Hawaii. Two \"Eleutherodactylus\" species, \"E. limbatus\" and \"E. iberia\", belong to the smallest known frogs. They measure only 8\u00BD mm in length.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":23},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":32},{"uri":"Eleutherodactylidae","surface_form":"Eleutherodactylidae","offset":45},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":65},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":87},{"uri":"Sharp","surface_form":"sharp","offset":209},{"uri":"Pitch","surface_form":"pitch","offset":221},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":234},{"uri":"Common_coqu%C3%AD","surface_form":"common coqu\u00ED","offset":257},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"national symbol","offset":336},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":355},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive species","offset":385},{"uri":"US_state","surface_form":"US state","offset":409},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":421}]}
