{"id":348297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_volcano","text":"Submarine volcanoes are volcanoes which are under the surface of the world's oceans. These volcanoes occur in a range of forms. Many create cone-shaped seamounts or flat-topped guyots.\nVolcanoes in the ocean develop from cracks or holes in the earth's undersea surface. Changes in the ocean floor are caused when magma flows or erupts from a site which is under water.\nThe presence of water alters the characteristics of a volcanic eruption.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":10},{"uri":"Seamount","surface_form":"seamount","offset":152},{"uri":"Guyot","surface_form":"guyot","offset":177},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":244},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":313}]}
