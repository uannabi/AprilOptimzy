{"id":348316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Siberian_Sea","text":"The East Siberian Sea is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean. It is between the Arctic Cape to the north, the coast of Siberia to the south, the New Siberian Islands to the west and Cape Billings, close to Chukotka, and Wrangel Island to the east. This sea borders on the Laptev Sea to the west and the Chukchi Sea to the east.\nThis sea is one of the least studied in the Arctic area. It has severe climate, low water salinity, and little flora, fauna and human population. The depths are shallow (mostly less than 50 meters). There are slow sea currents, low tides (below 25\u00A0cm) and frequent fogs, especially in summer. The ice fields only fully melt in August\u2013September. The sea shores were lived on for thousands of years by tribes of Yukaghirs, Chukchi and then Evens and Evenks.\nThe largest city and port is Pevek, the northernmost city of mainland Russia.\nThe most important of the rivers flowing into the East Siberian Sea are the Indigirka, the Alazeya, The Ujandina, the Chukochya River, the Kolyma, the Rauchua, the Chaun, and the Pegtymel. Only a few rivers are able to be travelled on. The coastline of the sea is 3,016\u00A0km long.\nFlora and fauna.\nThere are few flora and fauna due to the harsh climate. The summer plankton bloom is short. It makes 5 million tons of plankton in August and September. The yearly amount is 7 million tons.\nThe sea shores and icefields have ringed seals, bearded seals and walruses along polar bears. Birds include seagulls, uria and cormorants. Sea waters are often visited by bowhead whale, gray whale, beluga and narwhal. Major fish species are grayling and \"Coregonus\" (whitefishes), such as muksun, broad whitefish and omul. Also common are polar smelt, saffron cod, polar cod, flounder and arctic char.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marginal_sea","surface_form":"marginal sea","offset":27},{"uri":"Arctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Arctic Ocean","offset":47},{"uri":"Arctic_Cape","surface_form":"Arctic Cape","offset":79},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":118},{"uri":"New_Siberian_Islands","surface_form":"New Siberian Islands","offset":144},{"uri":"Cape_Billings","surface_form":"Cape Billings","offset":181},{"uri":"Chukchi_Peninsula","surface_form":"Chukotka","offset":205},{"uri":"Wrangel_Island","surface_form":"Wrangel Island","offset":219},{"uri":"Laptev_Sea","surface_form":"Laptev Sea","offset":271},{"uri":"Chukchi_Sea","surface_form":"Chukchi Sea","offset":302},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":398},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"salinity","offset":417},{"uri":"Sea_current","surface_form":"sea current","offset":541},{"uri":"Tide","surface_form":"tide","offset":559},{"uri":"Fog","surface_form":"fog","offset":592},{"uri":"Ice_field","surface_form":"ice field","offset":624},{"uri":"Yukaghirs","surface_form":"Yukaghirs","offset":737},{"uri":"Chukchi_people","surface_form":"Chukchi","offset":748},{"uri":"Evens","surface_form":"Evens","offset":765},{"uri":"Evenks","surface_form":"Evenks","offset":775},{"uri":"Pevek","surface_form":"Pevek","offset":812},{"uri":"Indigirka_River","surface_form":"Indigirka","offset":937},{"uri":"Alazeya_River","surface_form":"Alazeya","offset":952},{"uri":"Ujandina_River","surface_form":"Ujandina","offset":965},{"uri":"Chukochya_River","surface_form":"Chukochya River","offset":979},{"uri":"Kolyma_River","surface_form":"Kolyma","offset":1000},{"uri":"Rauchua_River","surface_form":"Rauchua","offset":1012},{"uri":"Chaun_River","surface_form":"Chaun","offset":1025},{"uri":"Pegtymel_River","surface_form":"Pegtymel","offset":1040},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":1171},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":1181},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":1224},{"uri":"Ringed_seal","surface_form":"ringed seal","offset":1381},{"uri":"Bearded_seal","surface_form":"bearded seal","offset":1395},{"uri":"Walrus","surface_form":"walrus","offset":1413},{"uri":"Uria","surface_form":"uria","offset":1465},{"uri":"Cormorant","surface_form":"cormorant","offset":1474},{"uri":"Bowhead_whale","surface_form":"bowhead whale","offset":1518},{"uri":"Gray_whale","surface_form":"gray whale","offset":1533},{"uri":"Beluga","surface_form":"beluga","offset":1545},{"uri":"Narwhal","surface_form":"narwhal","offset":1556},{"uri":"Grayling_(genus)","surface_form":"grayling","offset":1588},{"uri":"Coregonus","surface_form":"Coregonus","offset":1602},{"uri":"Muksun","surface_form":"muksun","offset":1636},{"uri":"Broad_whitefish","surface_form":"broad whitefish","offset":1644},{"uri":"Omul","surface_form":"omul","offset":1664},{"uri":"European_smelt","surface_form":"smelt","offset":1692},{"uri":"Saffron_cod","surface_form":"saffron cod","offset":1699},{"uri":"Polar_cod","surface_form":"polar cod","offset":1712},{"uri":"Flounder","surface_form":"flounder","offset":1723},{"uri":"Arctic_char","surface_form":"arctic char","offset":1736}]}
