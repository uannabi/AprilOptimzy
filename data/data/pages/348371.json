He was a pioneer of long-distance radio transmission. which he used to build up a radio telegraph system. Marconi is often named as the inventor of radio. He shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun.\nMuch of Marconi's work in radio transmission was built on previous experimentation, and work by others. When he was twenty years old, he learned of the experiments of Hertz, Popov, Lodge, Bose, and Tesla. He began his own experiments.\nAs an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company in Britain in 1897, Marconi became wealthy in the business of radio, mainly for ships at sea. In 1924, he was ennobled as Marchese Marconi. Back in Italy, he went on to become a member of the Grand Council of Fascism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":54},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":130},{"uri":"Radio_telegraph","surface_form":"radio telegraph","offset":178},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":270},{"uri":"Karl_Ferdinand_Braun","surface_form":"Karl Ferdinand Braun","offset":298},{"uri":"Heinrich_Hertz","surface_form":"Hertz","offset":487},{"uri":"Alexander_Stepanovich_Popov","surface_form":"Popov","offset":494},{"uri":"Sir_Oliver_Lodge","surface_form":"Lodge","offset":501},{"uri":"Jagadish_Chandra_Bose","surface_form":"Bose","offset":508},{"uri":"Nikola_Tesla","surface_form":"Tesla","offset":518},{"uri":"Marconi_Company","surface_form":"The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company","offset":603},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Britain","offset":646},{"uri":"Marchese","surface_form":"Marchese","offset":765},{"uri":"Grand_Council_of_Fascism","surface_form":"Grand Council of Fascism","offset":835}]}
