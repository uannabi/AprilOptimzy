{"id":348372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette","text":"Roulette is a casino game named after a French diminutive for \"little wheel\". In the game, players may choose to place bets on fields which include one or more numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even.\nTo determine the winning number and color, the game wheel is spun in one direction, then a ball is spun in the opposite direction around a track running around the wheel. The ball eventually slows down and falls on to the wheel and into one of 37 (in French/European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) colored and numbered pockets on the wheel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Casino","surface_form":"casino","offset":14},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":40},{"uri":"Diminutive","surface_form":"diminutive","offset":47}]}
