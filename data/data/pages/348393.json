{"id":348393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Sea","text":"The Labrador Sea (French: \"mer du Labrador\") is an arm of the North Atlantic Ocean between the Labrador Peninsula and Greenland. The sea is surrounded by continental shelves to the southwest, northwest, and northeast. It connects to the north with Baffin Bay through the Davis Strait. It has been described as a marginal sea of the Atlantic.\nThe Labrador Sea is about 3400 meters deep and wide where it joins the Atlantic Ocean. It becomes shallower, to less than towards Baffin Bay and passes into the Davis Strait.\nThe water temperature varies between in winter and in summer. The salinity is relatively low, at 31\u201334.9 parts per thousand. Two-thirds of the sea is covered in ice in winter.\nFauna.\nThe northern and western parts of the Labrador Sea are covered in ice between December and June. The drift ice serves as a breeding ground for seals in early spring. The sea is also a feeding ground for Atlantic salmon and several marine mammal species. Shrimp fisheries began in 1978, as well as cod fishing. The cod fishing quickly lessened the fish population in the 1990s and was stopped in 1992. Other fishery targets include haddock, Atlantic herring, lobster and several species of flatfish and pelagic fish such as sand lance and capelin. Bigger amounts are in the southern parts of the sea.\nThe sea has one of the two major stocks of Sei whales, the other one being the Scotian Shelf. Also common are minke and bottlenose whales.\nThe Labrador Duck was a common bird on the Canadian coast until 19th century, but is now extinct. Coastal animals include the Labrador Wolf, caribou, moose, black bear, red fox, arctic fox, wolverine, snowshoe hare, grouse, osprey, raven, ducks, geese, partridge and American wild pheasant.\nFlora.\nCostal vegetation includes black spruce, tamarack, white spruce, dwarf birch, aspen, willow, ericaceous shrubs, cottongrass, sedge, lichens and moss. Evergreen bushes of Labrador tea, which is used to make herbal tea, are common in the area, both on the Greenland and Canadian coasts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_Atlantic","surface_form":"North Atlantic","offset":62},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"Ocean","offset":77},{"uri":"Labrador_Peninsula","surface_form":"Labrador Peninsula","offset":95},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":118},{"uri":"Continental_shelf","surface_form":"continental shelves","offset":154},{"uri":"Baffin_Bay","surface_form":"Baffin Bay","offset":248},{"uri":"Davis_Strait","surface_form":"Davis Strait","offset":271},{"uri":"Marginal_sea","surface_form":"marginal sea","offset":312},{"uri":"Davis_Strait","surface_form":"Davis Strait","offset":503},{"uri":"Drift_ice","surface_form":"drift ice","offset":801},{"uri":"Atlantic_salmon","surface_form":"Atlantic salmon","offset":903},{"uri":"Shrimp_fishery","surface_form":"Shrimp fisheries","offset":954},{"uri":"Haddock","surface_form":"haddock","offset":1131},{"uri":"Atlantic_herring","surface_form":"Atlantic herring","offset":1140},{"uri":"Lobster","surface_form":"lobster","offset":1158},{"uri":"Flatfish","surface_form":"flatfish","offset":1189},{"uri":"Pelagic_fish","surface_form":"pelagic fish","offset":1202},{"uri":"Sand_lance","surface_form":"sand lance","offset":1223},{"uri":"Capelin","surface_form":"capelin","offset":1238},{"uri":"Sei_whale","surface_form":"Sei whale","offset":1343},{"uri":"Scotian_Shelf","surface_form":"Scotian Shelf","offset":1379},{"uri":"Minke_whale","surface_form":"minke","offset":1410},{"uri":"Bottlenose_whale","surface_form":"bottlenose whale","offset":1420},{"uri":"Labrador_Duck","surface_form":"Labrador Duck","offset":1443},{"uri":"Labrador_Wolf","surface_form":"Labrador Wolf","offset":1565},{"uri":"Caribou","surface_form":"caribou","offset":1580},{"uri":"Moose","surface_form":"moose","offset":1589},{"uri":"American_black_bear","surface_form":"black bear","offset":1596},{"uri":"Red_fox","surface_form":"red fox","offset":1608},{"uri":"Arctic_fox","surface_form":"arctic fox","offset":1617},{"uri":"Wolverine","surface_form":"wolverine","offset":1629},{"uri":"Snowshoe_hare","surface_form":"snowshoe hare","offset":1640},{"uri":"Grouse","surface_form":"grouse","offset":1655},{"uri":"Osprey","surface_form":"osprey","offset":1663},{"uri":"Black_spruce","surface_form":"black spruce","offset":1764},{"uri":"Tamarack","surface_form":"tamarack","offset":1778},{"uri":"White_spruce","surface_form":"white spruce","offset":1788},{"uri":"Dwarf_birch","surface_form":"dwarf birch","offset":1802},{"uri":"Aspen","surface_form":"aspen","offset":1815},{"uri":"Willow","surface_form":"willow","offset":1822},{"uri":"Cottongrass","surface_form":"cottongrass","offset":1849},{"uri":"Sedge","surface_form":"sedge","offset":1862},{"uri":"Labrador_tea","surface_form":"Labrador tea","offset":1907},{"uri":"Herbal_tea","surface_form":"herbal tea","offset":1943}]}
