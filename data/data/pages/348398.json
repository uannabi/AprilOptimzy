{"id":348398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara","text":"The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, is the inland sea that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea. It separates Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean. The Sea has an area of 11,350\u00A0km\u00B2 (280\u00A0km x 80\u00A0km) with the greatest depth reaching 1,370 m.\nGeography.\nThe salinity of the sea averages about 22 parts per thousand. This is slightly greater than that of the Black Sea but only about two-thirds that of most oceans. The water is much more saline at the sea-bottom, averaging salinities of around 38 parts per thousand \u2014 similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea. Water from the Susurluk, Biga (Granicus) and Gonen Rivers reduces the salinity of the sea.\nThere are two major island groups known as the Princes' and Marmara islands.\nThe south coast of the sea includes the Gulf of Izmit, the Gulf of Gemlik and the Gulf of Erdek.\nThe North Anatolian fault, which has started many major earthquakes in recent years, such as the \u0130zmit Earthquake of 1999, runs under the sea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":87},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":109},{"uri":"Aegean_Sea","surface_form":"Aegean Sea","offset":126},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":151},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":160},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":170},{"uri":"Bosphorus","surface_form":"Bosphorus","offset":190},{"uri":"Dardanelles","surface_form":"Dardanelles","offset":244},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"salinity","offset":386},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":486},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":535},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":670},{"uri":"Biga_%C3%87ay%C4%B1","surface_form":"Biga","offset":714},{"uri":"Granicus","surface_form":"Granicus","offset":720},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":800},{"uri":"Princes%27_Islands","surface_form":"Princes'","offset":827},{"uri":"Marmara_Island","surface_form":"Marmara","offset":840},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Gemlik","surface_form":"Gulf of Gemlik","offset":916},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Erdek","surface_form":"Gulf of Erdek","offset":939},{"uri":"North_Anatolian_fault","surface_form":"North Anatolian fault","offset":958},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1010},{"uri":"%C4%B0zmit_Earthquake","surface_form":"\u0130zmit Earthquake","offset":1051}]}
