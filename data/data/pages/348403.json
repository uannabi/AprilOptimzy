{"id":348403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargasso_Sea","text":"The Sargasso Sea is a region in the gyre in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Gulf Stream; on the north, by the North Atlantic Current; on the east, by the Canary Current; and on the south, by the North Atlantic Equatorial Current. This system of ocean currents forms the North Atlantic Gyre. All the currents deposit the marine plants and garbage they carry into this sea.\nThe Sargasso Sea is 700 statute miles wide and 2,000 statute miles long (1,100\u00A0km wide and 3,200\u00A0km long). Bermuda is near the western fringes of the sea. The Sargasso Sea is the only \"sea\" without shores. The ocean water in the Sargasso Sea is different for its deep blue color and exceptional clarity. Underwater visibility is up to.\nPortuguese sailors were among the first to discover this region in the 15th century. They named it after the \"Sargassum\" seaweed growing there.\nThe Sargasso Sea plays a major role in the migration of the European eel and the American eel. The larvae of both species hatch there and go to Europe or the East Coast of North America. Later in life, they try to return to the Sargasso Sea to lay eggs. It is also believed that after hatching, young Loggerhead Sea Turtles use currents, such as the Gulf Stream to travel to the Sargasso Sea, where they use the Sargassum as cover from predation until they are mature.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gyre","surface_form":"gyre","offset":36},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":68},{"uri":"Gulf_Stream","surface_form":"Gulf Stream","offset":117},{"uri":"North_Atlantic_Current","surface_form":"North Atlantic Current","offset":151},{"uri":"Canary_Current","surface_form":"Canary Current","offset":195},{"uri":"North_Equatorial_Current","surface_form":"North Atlantic Equatorial Current","offset":236},{"uri":"Ocean_current","surface_form":"ocean current","offset":286},{"uri":"North_Atlantic_Gyre","surface_form":"North Atlantic Gyre","offset":311},{"uri":"Statute_miles","surface_form":"statute miles","offset":437},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":520},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":749},{"uri":"Sargassum","surface_form":"Sargassum","offset":859},{"uri":"Fish_migration","surface_form":"migration","offset":936},{"uri":"European_eel","surface_form":"European eel","offset":953},{"uri":"American_eel","surface_form":"American eel","offset":974},{"uri":"Leptocephalus","surface_form":"larvae","offset":992},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":1141},{"uri":"Loggerhead_Sea_Turtle","surface_form":"Loggerhead Sea Turtle","offset":1194},{"uri":"Gulf_Stream","surface_form":"Gulf Stream","offset":1243}]}
