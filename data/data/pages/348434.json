{"id":348434,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Alaska","text":"The Gulf of Alaska is an arm of the Pacific Ocean. The borders are the southern coast of Alaska, stretching from the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island in the west to the Alexander Archipelago in the east, where Glacier Bay and the Inside Passage are found.\nThe entire shoreline of the Gulf is a combination of forest, mountain, and a number of tidewater glaciers. Alaska's largest glaciers, the Malaspina Glacier and Bering Glacier go out onto the coastal plain along the Gulf of Alaska. Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound are the two largest connected bodies of water. There is also Yakutat Bay and Cross Sound. Lituya Bay is the place of the largest recorded tsunami in history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":36},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":89},{"uri":"Alaska_Peninsula","surface_form":"Alaska Peninsula","offset":117},{"uri":"Kodiak_Island","surface_form":"Kodiak Island","offset":138},{"uri":"Alexander_Archipelago","surface_form":"Alexander Archipelago","offset":171},{"uri":"Glacier_Bay","surface_form":"Glacier Bay","offset":212},{"uri":"Inside_Passage","surface_form":"Inside Passage","offset":232},{"uri":"Tidewater_glacier","surface_form":"tidewater glacier","offset":345},{"uri":"Malaspina_Glacier","surface_form":"Malaspina Glacier","offset":396},{"uri":"Bering_Glacier","surface_form":"Bering Glacier","offset":418},{"uri":"Cook_Inlet","surface_form":"Cook Inlet","offset":489},{"uri":"Prince_William_Sound","surface_form":"Prince William Sound","offset":504},{"uri":"Yakutat_Bay","surface_form":"Yakutat Bay","offset":586},{"uri":"Cross_Sound","surface_form":"Cross Sound","offset":602},{"uri":"Lituya_Bay","surface_form":"Lituya Bay","offset":615},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":663}]}
