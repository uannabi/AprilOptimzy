{"id":348446,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Okhotsk","text":"The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean. It is between the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, the island of Hokkaid\u014D to the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a long stretch of eastern Siberian coast (including the Shantar Islands) along the west and north. The northeast corner is Shelikhov Gulf. It is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian town in the Far East.\nGeography.\nThe Sea of Okhotsk covers 611,000 sq.mi. (1,583,000\u00A0km2). The average depth is 2,818 feet (859 metres). Its maximum depth is 11,063 feet (3,372 metres). It is connected to the Sea of Japan on the west through the Sakhalin Gulf and the Gulf of Tartary; on the south, through the La P\u00E9rouse Strait.\nIn winter, travelling on the Sea of Okhotsk becomes difficult, or even impossible, due tolarge ice floes.\nExcept for Hokkaid\u014D, one of the Japanese home islands, the sea is surrounded on all sides by land of the Russian Federation. For this reason, it is generally said to be part of Russia.\nIslands.\nSome of the Sea of Okhotsk's islands are quite large. These include Japan's second largest island, Hokkaid\u014D, as well as Russia's largest island, Sakhalin. Iony Island is the only island in open waters. It belongs to the Khabarovsk Krai of the Russian Federation. Most of the sea's islands are have no people making them ideal breeding grounds for seals, sea lions, seabirds, and other sea island fauna.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marginal_sea","surface_form":"marginal sea","offset":24},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":52},{"uri":"Kamchatka_Peninsula","surface_form":"Kamchatka Peninsula","offset":85},{"uri":"Kuril_Islands","surface_form":"Kuril Islands","offset":122},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":158},{"uri":"Hokkaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Hokkaid\u014D","offset":168},{"uri":"Sakhalin","surface_form":"Sakhalin","offset":205},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":260},{"uri":"Shantar_Islands","surface_form":"Shantar Islands","offset":290},{"uri":"Shelikhov_Gulf","surface_form":"Shelikhov Gulf","offset":357},{"uri":"Okhotsk","surface_form":"Okhotsk","offset":391},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":410},{"uri":"Russian_Far_East","surface_form":"Far East","offset":430},{"uri":"Sea_of_Japan","surface_form":"Sea of Japan","offset":627},{"uri":"Sakhalin_Gulf","surface_form":"Sakhalin Gulf","offset":664},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Tartary","surface_form":"Gulf of Tartary","offset":686},{"uri":"La_P%C3%A9rouse_Strait","surface_form":"La P\u00E9rouse Strait","offset":729},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":751},{"uri":"Ice_floe","surface_form":"ice floe","offset":843},{"uri":"Hokkaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Hokkaid\u014D","offset":865},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":886},{"uri":"Japanese_Archipelago","surface_form":"home islands","offset":895},{"uri":"Iony_Island","surface_form":"Iony Island","offset":1203},{"uri":"Khabarovsk_Krai","surface_form":"Khabarovsk Krai","offset":1268},{"uri":"Russian_Federation","surface_form":"Russian Federation","offset":1291},{"uri":"Pinniped","surface_form":"seals","offset":1395},{"uri":"Sea_lions","surface_form":"sea lions","offset":1402},{"uri":"Seabirds","surface_form":"seabirds","offset":1413}]}
