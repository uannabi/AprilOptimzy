{"id":348457,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen_Sea","text":"The Amundsen Sea is an arm of the Southern Ocean off Marie Byrd Land in western Antarctica. It is bounded by Cape Flying Fish, the northwestern tip of Thurston Island to the east and Cape Dart on Siple Island to the west. East of Cape Flying Fish starts the Bellingshausen Sea. The sea is named for the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen.\nThe sea is mostly ice-covered. The ice sheet which drains into the Amundsen Sea averages about in thickness. It is roughly the size of the state of Texas. The area is known as the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE). It forms one of the three major ice drainage basins of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nPine Island Bay ==.\nPine Island Bay () is a bay about long and wide. The ice of the Pine Island Glacier at the southeast end of the Amundsen Sea flows into it. It was named for USS \"Pine Island\".\nRussell Bay.\nRussell Bay () is a rather open bay in southwestern Amundsen Sea. It goes along the north sides of Siple Island, Getz Ice Shelf and Carney Island, from Pranke Island to Cape Gates. It is named for Admiral James S. Russell, USN, Vice Chief of Naval Operations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Southern_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Ocean","offset":34},{"uri":"Marie_Byrd_Land","surface_form":"Marie Byrd Land","offset":53},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":80},{"uri":"Cape_Flying_Fish","surface_form":"Cape Flying Fish","offset":109},{"uri":"Thurston_Island","surface_form":"Thurston Island","offset":151},{"uri":"Cape_Dart","surface_form":"Cape Dart","offset":183},{"uri":"Siple_Island","surface_form":"Siple Island","offset":196},{"uri":"Bellingshausen_Sea","surface_form":"Bellingshausen Sea","offset":258},{"uri":"Roald_Amundsen","surface_form":"Roald Amundsen","offset":328},{"uri":"Ice_sheet","surface_form":"ice sheet","offset":379},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":492},{"uri":"West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet","surface_form":"West Antarctic Ice Sheet","offset":613},{"uri":"Pine_Island_Glacier","surface_form":"Pine Island Glacier","offset":723},{"uri":"USS_Pine_Island_(AV-12)","surface_form":"USS \"Pine Island\"","offset":816},{"uri":"Siple_Island","surface_form":"Siple Island","offset":947},{"uri":"Getz_Ice_Shelf","surface_form":"Getz Ice Shelf","offset":961},{"uri":"Carney_Island","surface_form":"Carney Island","offset":980},{"uri":"Pranke_Island","surface_form":"Pranke Island","offset":1000},{"uri":"Cape_Gates","surface_form":"Cape Gates","offset":1017},{"uri":"James_S._Russell","surface_form":"James S.
