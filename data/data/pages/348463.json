{"id":348463,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Sea","text":"The Ross Sea is a deep bay of the Southern Ocean in Antarctica between Victoria Land and Marie Byrd Land.\nDescription.\nThe Ross Sea was discovered by James Ross in 1841. In the west of the Ross Sea is Ross Island. In the east is Roosevelt Island. The southern part is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf. In the west of the Ross sea, McMurdo Sound is a port which is usually free of ice during the summer. The southernmost part of the Ross Sea is Gould Coast, which is about two hundred miles from the Geographic South Pole.\nAll land masses in the Ross Sea are claimed by New Zealand.\nA 10 metre (32.8\u00A0feet) long colossal squid weighing 495 kilograms (1,091\u00A0lb) was captured in the Ross Sea on February 22, 2007.\nEcological importance and conservation.\nThe flora and fauna are similar to other southern Antarctic marine regions. In summer there are a lot of plankton. They provide food for larger species, such as fish, seals, whales, and sea- and shore-birds.\nThe coastal parts of the sea have a number of rookeries of Ad\u00E9lie and Emperor penguins. They have been seen at a number of places around the Ross Sea, both towards the coast and outwards in open sea.\nThe Ross Sea is one of the last parts of seas on Earth that is mostly unaffected by human activities. Because of this, it is almost totally free from pollution, overfishing and the introduction of invasive species. Some people want to make the area a world marine reserve.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Headlands_and_bays","surface_form":"bay","offset":23},{"uri":"Southern_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Ocean","offset":34},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":52},{"uri":"Victoria_Land","surface_form":"Victoria Land","offset":71},{"uri":"Marie_Byrd_Land","surface_form":"Marie Byrd Land","offset":89},{"uri":"James_Clark_Ross","surface_form":"James Ross","offset":150},{"uri":"Ross_Island","surface_form":"Ross Island","offset":201},{"uri":"Roosevelt_Island%2C_Antarctica","surface_form":"Roosevelt Island","offset":229},{"uri":"Ross_Ice_Shelf","surface_form":"Ross Ice Shelf","offset":283},{"uri":"McMurdo_Sound","surface_form":"McMurdo Sound","offset":328},{"uri":"Gould_Coast","surface_form":"Gould Coast","offset":441},{"uri":"Geographic_South_Pole","surface_form":"Geographic South Pole","offset":496},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":566},{"uri":"Colossal_squid","surface_form":"colossal squid","offset":607},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":852},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":908},{"uri":"Pinniped","surface_form":"seal","offset":914},{"uri":"Whale","surface_form":"whale","offset":921},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":948},{"uri":"Ad%C3%A9lie_Penguin","surface_form":"Ad\u00E9lie","offset":1014},{"uri":"Emperor_Penguins","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":1025},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":1196},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":1204},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"pollution","offset":1305},{"uri":"Overfishing","surface_form":"overfishing","offset":1316},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive species","offset":1352}]}
