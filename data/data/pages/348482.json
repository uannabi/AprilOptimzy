The strait was named for the English explorer John Davis (1550\u20131605), who explored the area while seeking a Northwest Passage. It is the world's broadest strait.\nThe water depth is between one and two thousand meters. The strait is much shallower than the Labrador Sea to the south or Baffin Bay to the north. It is on the coast line of Canada.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Labrador_Sea","surface_form":"Labrador Sea","offset":38},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":78},{"uri":"Nunavut","surface_form":"Nunavut","offset":92},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":101},{"uri":"Baffin_Island","surface_form":"Baffin Island","offset":110},{"uri":"John_Davis_(English_explorer)","surface_form":"John Davis","offset":171},{"uri":"Northwest_Passage","surface_form":"Northwest Passage","offset":233},{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":347},{"uri":"Labrador_Sea","surface_form":"Labrador Sea","offset":381},{"uri":"Baffin_Bay","surface_form":"Baffin Bay","offset":410},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":462}]}
