It is also seen in Pernambuco and Alagoas. From southern Brazil, its range spreads through Uruguay, Paraguay, northern Argentina, Bolivia, and along the eastern slope of the Andes in Peru, as far north as the Amazonas Region.\nIt has many habitats, but most of it is found in foothills in north-eastern Brazil, and does not live in lands higher than 2600 meters (8500\u00A0ft).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":69},{"uri":"Thamnophilidae","surface_form":"Thamnophilidae","offset":81},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":117},{"uri":"Antbird","surface_form":"antbird","offset":176},{"uri":"Plumage","surface_form":"plumage","offset":207},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":450},{"uri":"Pernambuco","surface_form":"Pernambuco","offset":477},{"uri":"Alagoas","surface_form":"Alagoas","offset":492},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":549},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":558},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":577},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":632},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":641},{"uri":"Amazonas_Region","surface_form":"Amazonas Region","offset":667}]}
