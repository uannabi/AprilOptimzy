The name is used in two ways. It identifies the sea between Korea and Tsushima Island; and it is also used generally to describe the wider ocean area between Korea and the island of Kyushu.\nThe strait links the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Tsushima Island is between the western channel (Korea Strait) and the eastern channel (Tsushima Strait).\nGeography.\nThe northern shore of the strait is the southern coast of the Korean peninsula. Depending on usage, the southern shores of the strait may mean the western coast of Tsushima or it may mean the western coasts of Ky\u016Bsh\u016B and Honsh\u016B.\nThe strait is about wide and averages about 90 to 100\u00A0meters (300\u00A0ft) deep.\nThe western channel is deeper (up to 227\u00A0meters) and narrower than the eastern channel.\nA warm current (\"Tsushima-kairy\u016B\") runs through the straight from south to north.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tsushima_Strait","surface_form":"Tsushima Strait","offset":58},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":109},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":119},{"uri":"Tsushima_Island","surface_form":"Tsushima Island","offset":202},{"uri":"Kyushu","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":314},{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":326},{"uri":"East_China_Sea","surface_form":"East China Sea","offset":343},{"uri":"Sea_of_Japan","surface_form":"Sea of Japan","offset":366},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":396},{"uri":"Korean_peninsula","surface_form":"Korean peninsula","offset":589},{"uri":"Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"Ky\u016Bsh\u016B","offset":737},{"uri":"Honsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"Honsh\u016B","offset":748}]}
