To the north it joins the Celebes Sea. To the south it meets the Java Sea. The Mahakam River of Borneo empties into the strait.\nPorts along the strait include Balikpapan in Borneo, and Makassar and Palu in Sulawesi. The city of Samarinda is 48 km (30 mi) from the strait, along the Mahakam.\nThe strait is a common shipping route for ships too big to fit through the Straits of Malacca.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":33},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":63},{"uri":"Sulawesi","surface_form":"Sulawesi","offset":74},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":86},{"uri":"Celebes_Sea","surface_form":"Celebes Sea","offset":123},{"uri":"Java_Sea","surface_form":"Java Sea","offset":162},{"uri":"Mahakam_River","surface_form":"Mahakam River","offset":176},{"uri":"Balikpapan","surface_form":"Balikpapan","offset":256},{"uri":"Makassar","surface_form":"Makassar","offset":282},{"uri":"Palu","surface_form":"Palu","offset":295},{"uri":"Samarinda","surface_form":"Samarinda","offset":325},{"uri":"Straits_of_Malacca","surface_form":"Straits of Malacca","offset":463}]}
