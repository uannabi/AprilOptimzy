{"id":34887,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kingdom is the highest rank, after the domain, which is normally used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. Each kingdom is split into phyla.\nOverview.\nThe kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms. Sometimes entries in the table, which are next to each other, do not match perfectly. For example, Haeckel placed the red algae (Haeckel's Florideae; modern Rhodophyta) and blue-green algae (Haeckel's Archephyta; modern Cyanobacteria) in his Plantae, but in modern classifications they are considered protists and bacteria respectively. However, despite these differences, the table gives a useful summary.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":90},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":101},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":117},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phyla","offset":155},{"uri":"Red_algae","surface_form":"red algae","offset":395},{"uri":"Rhodophyta","surface_form":"Rhodophyta","offset":434},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"Cyanobacteria","offset":497}]}
