{"id":34895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum","text":"=\"preserve\">The jejunum is a section of the small intestine between the duodenum and the ileum. It is between 1 and 2 meters long.The term \"jejunum\" derives from the Latin \"jejunus,\" which means \"empty of food,\" \"meager,\" or \"hungry.\" The ancient Greeks noticed at death that this part of the intestine was always empty of food. Hence, the name the jejunum.\nThe Latin \"jejunus\" also gave rise to \"jejune\" means lacking in nutritive value and devoid of substance, significance or interest, that is dull. A jejune argument is one that is empty (like the jejunum) and totally devoid of interest.\nFamous quote...\"Have You Ever Been Punched in The Jejunum?\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Small_intestine","surface_form":"small intestine","offset":44},{"uri":"Duodenum","surface_form":"duodenum","offset":72},{"uri":"Ileum","surface_form":"ileum","offset":89},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"meters","offset":118}]}
