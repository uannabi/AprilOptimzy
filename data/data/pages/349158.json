That volcano has been dormant since its last eruption in 1707, but is also classified as active. The Geological Survey of Japan lists Mount Fuji as among the active volcanoes on the island of Honshu.\nMis-labeled as dormant or extinct.\nSome volcanoes may remain dormant for a long time; and an eruption is a surprise.\nBefore 79 AD, Vesuvius was considered dormant.\nBefore 1991, the Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines was labeled as dormant.\nBefore 1995, the Soufri\u00E8re Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat was dormant.\nBefore 1980, Mt. St. Helens in the United States was dormant.\nSelect list.\nThere are many examples of volcanoes which are considered dormant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanoe","offset":25},{"uri":"Mount_Fuji","surface_form":"Mount Fuji","offset":211},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":438},{"uri":"Vesuvius","surface_form":"Vesuvius","offset":577},{"uri":"Mount_Pinatubo","surface_form":"Pinatubo","offset":627},{"uri":"Soufri%C3%A8re_Hills","surface_form":"Soufri\u00E8re Hills","offset":704},{"uri":"Montserrat","surface_form":"Montserrat","offset":745},{"uri":"Mt._St._Helens","surface_form":"Mt.
