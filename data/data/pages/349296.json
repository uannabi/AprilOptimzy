It is in the Danville, Virginia metropolitan statistical area.\nChatham has the oldest continually used building in Pittsylvania County. The building was an 18th-century tavern. It is now a house used by Chatham Hall faculty.\nChatham is the county seat for Pittsylvania County. It became the county seat in 1777. There is a large U.S. Department of Agriculture office to help farmers in the area. There is also a small office of the U.S. Forestry Service. The State of Virginia built a new prison where there used to be a work-release camp. This caused improvements in fire and water services to support the increased population.\nThere were no battles in Chatham during the American Civil War. On Confederate Memorial Day each year, the Daughters of the Confederacy puts flowers at the statue of a Confederate soldier. There is a walking tour of the downtown historic district. There are several bed and breakfast places on Main Street in historic Greek Revival homes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"US_state","surface_form":"US state","offset":25},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":37},{"uri":"Danville%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Danville, Virginia","offset":106},{"uri":"Metropolitan_statistical_area","surface_form":"metropolitan statistical area","offset":125},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":333},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","surface_form":"U.S. Department of Agriculture","offset":422},{"uri":"United_States_Forestry_Service","surface_form":"U.S. Forestry Service","offset":525},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":582},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":766},{"uri":"Confederacy","surface_form":"Confederacy","offset":846},{"uri":"Historic_district","surface_form":"historic district","offset":951},{"uri":"Bed_and_breakfast","surface_form":"bed and breakfast","offset":988},{"uri":"Greek_Revival_architecture","surface_form":"Greek Revival","offset":1040}]}
