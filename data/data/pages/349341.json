{"id":349341,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbers_Army","text":"Timbers Army is a group of hardcore supporters of the Portland Timbers, a Major League Soccer franchise in Portland, Oregon.\nArtists, writers, doctors, vintners, tattoo artists, soccer moms, and more all support the Portland Timbers on match days. Traveling support is significant and it is estimated that 1,500 members of the Timbers Army would make the trip north for the Timbers v. Sounders Cascadia Cup match in October 2012.\nIn addition to game-day operations, Timbers Army contributes significantly to charitable causes both in Portland and well as around the world. In 2011 alone, members of Timbers Army donated more than $40,000 to its charitable endeavors as well as spending countless hours volunteering with Friends of Trees, Habitat for Humanity and the Oregon Food Bank. Recently, the Timbers Army committed to raising another $40,000 to put toward the completion of Harper's Playground.\nThe organizational arm of the Timbers Army, the 107 Independent Supporters Trust, has a paid membership of 2,300. However, as it has always been said: if you want to be Timbers Army, you already are.\nThe main identifier of a member of the Timbers Army is the green and white bar scarf which says \"Timbers Army\" on one side and \"No Pity\" on the other. The most recent version of the scarf also includes a rose (in tribute to Portland's identity as the City of Roses) superimposed over crossed axes as well as the number 107, the section of Jeld-Wen Field where the Army began.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portland_Timbers","surface_form":"Portland Timbers","offset":54},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland, Oregon","offset":107},{"uri":"Habitat_for_Humanity","surface_form":"Habitat for Humanity","offset":738}]}
