{"id":3494,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship","text":"e=\"preserve\">Citizenship is a legal relationship between a person and a country. Usually the country is the one they were born in, lives in, supports, and in return gets protection. A person is usually a citizen of the country where he or she is born, but sometimes a person will apply for naturalization, to become a citizen in another country. There are countries which allow dual (two) citizenship, and countries which do not.\nDefinitions.\nA citizen is a member of a sovereign group of people that have certain rights. Governments protect these rights or take advantage of them. Some Governments may exile people from citizenship laws on such matter vary between countries.\nCitizenship in Canada.\nPeople born in Canada become citizens of the country by \"Jus soli\" even if their parents are not citizens.\nIn 2018 the New York Times reported that 20% of babies born in Richmond Hospital in Richmond, British Columbia, were born to mothers involved in birth tourism. This means that the babies automatically acquire Canadian citizenship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":30},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":36},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":72},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":204},{"uri":"Naturalization","surface_form":"naturalization","offset":290},{"uri":"Sovereign","surface_form":"sovereign","offset":470},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"Government","offset":522},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":603},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":715},{"uri":"New_York_Times","surface_form":"New York Times","offset":819},{"uri":"Richmond_Hospital","surface_form":"Richmond Hospital","offset":870},{"uri":"Richmond","surface_form":"Richmond","offset":891},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":901},{"uri":"Birth_tourism","surface_form":"birth tourism","offset":952}]}
