It was formed on 31 May 1910 when the British Cape Colony and the Natal Colony unified with the defeated Boer republics of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. The provinces of the union were called, respectively, as the Cape Province, the Natal Province, the Transvaal Province, and the Orange Free State Province. Following World War I, the former German colony of German South-West Africa was put under administration of the Union of South Africa as a League of Nations mandate and was treated as if it were another province.\nThe Union of South Africa came to an end on 31 May 1961, when a new constitution came into effect, transforming the Union of South Africa into a republic, under the name 'Republic of South Africa'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Former Country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"Republic of South Africa","offset":72},{"uri":"British_Cape_Colony","surface_form":"British Cape Colony","offset":136},{"uri":"Natal_Colony","surface_form":"Natal Colony","offset":164},{"uri":"South_African_Republic","surface_form":"South African Republic","offset":225},{"uri":"Orange_Free_State","surface_form":"Orange Free State","offset":256},{"uri":"Cape_Province","surface_form":"Cape Province","offset":336},{"uri":"Natal_Province","surface_form":"Natal Province","offset":355},{"uri":"Transvaal_Province","surface_form":"Transvaal Province","offset":375},{"uri":"Orange_Free_State_Province","surface_form":"Orange Free State Province","offset":403},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":441},{"uri":"German_South-West_Africa","surface_form":"German South-West Africa","offset":482},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":570}]}
