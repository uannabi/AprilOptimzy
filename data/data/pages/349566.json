{"id":349566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Clark","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lawrence \"Larry\" Clark (born January 19, 1943) is an American movie director and producer. He has directed several controversial movies. These include \"Kids\", \"Ken Park\" and \"Bully\" (2001). The first was marked under an NC-17 rating. This caused Miramax (owned by Disney at the time) to sell it to someone else for its distribution. In addition, \"Ken Park\" was more explicit and violent: Australia would not allow this movie to be shown publicly, distributed or sold due to its explicit content.\nClark was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He often does his works based on the life of teenagers and young adults who involve themselves with illegal drugs and certain types of crime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":66},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"movie director","offset":75},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":94},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversial","offset":128},{"uri":"Kids_(movie)","surface_form":"Kids","offset":165},{"uri":"Ken_Park","surface_form":"Ken Park","offset":173},{"uri":"Bully_(movie)","surface_form":"Bully","offset":188},{"uri":"NC-17","surface_form":"NC-17","offset":233},{"uri":"Miramax_Films","surface_form":"Miramax","offset":259},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":277},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"distribution","offset":332},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":401},{"uri":"Tulsa%2C_Oklahoma","surface_form":"Tulsa, Oklahoma","offset":527},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":589},{"uri":"Illegal_drugs","surface_form":"illegal drugs","offset":644}]}
