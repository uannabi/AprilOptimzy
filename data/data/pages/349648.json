She was born at the Palace of Versailles. Sophie was the youngest of the four children of King Louis XVI of France and his Queen consort, Marie Antoinette. She was named after her deceased great-aunt, Princess Sophie of France. As the daughter of the king, Sophie ranked third in importance after her mother the queen and her older sister \"Madame Royale\" Marie Th\u00E9r\u00E8se. Sophie was legally titled \"Her Royal Highness\" Princess Sophie of France but was however known as \"Madame Sophie\")\nSophie was a very large baby. Her health was undermined by tuberculosis. She died in Versailles after five or six days of troubles caused by the cutting of new teeth. She was eleven months old. Her death caused much grief for her parents. When Marie Antoinette's foster-brother, Joseph Weber, attempted to comfort her with the fact that Sophie was very young and could not have formed a strong attachment for the mother. Marie Antoinette said only, \"Don't forget that she would have been my friend.\" This referred to her words after the birth of Sophie's older sister in 1778. Sophie was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis. This was north of Paris.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fils_de_France","surface_form":"Daughter of France","offset":42},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Palace of Versailles","offset":150},{"uri":"Louis_XVI_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XVI of France","offset":225},{"uri":"Queen_consort","surface_form":"Queen consort","offset":253},{"uri":"Marie_Antoinette","surface_form":"Marie Antoinette","offset":268},{"uri":"Princess_Sophie_of_France","surface_form":"Princess Sophie of France","offset":331},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":674},{"uri":"Royal_Basilica_of_Saint_Denis","surface_form":"Royal Basilica of Saint Denis","offset":1217},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1266}]}
