{"id":349838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folies_Berg%C3%A8re","text":"The Folies Berg\u00E8re is a nightclub in Paris which opened in 1869 as a music hall. It was at the height of its fame and popularity from the 1890s until the Second World War. It is still in business.\nHistory.\nIt opened on 2 May 1869 as the \"Folies Tr\u00E9vise\", offering operettas, comic opera, popular songs, and gymnastics. It became the \"Folies Berg\u00E8re\" on 13 September 1872, named after a nearby street, the rue Berg\u00E8re.\nIn 1882, \u00C9douard Manet painted the famous \"A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00E8re\".\nIn 1886, \u00C9douard Marchand thought up a new type of entertainment for the \"Folies Berg\u00E8re\": the music-hall review. Women would be the heart of Marchand's concept for the \"Folies\". In the early 1890s, the American dancer Lo\u00EFe Fuller starred at the \"Folies Berg\u00E8re\". In 1902, illness forced Marchand to leave after 16 years.\nIn 1918, Paul Derval (1880\u20131966) made his mark on the review. His reviews were to feature extravagant costumes, sets and effects, and his \"small nude women\". Derval's small nude women would become the hallmark of the \"Folies\". During his 48 years at the Folies, he launched the careers of many French stars including Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Fernandel and many others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":24},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":37},{"uri":"Music_hall","surface_form":"music hall","offset":69},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":154},{"uri":"Operetta","surface_form":"operetta","offset":264},{"uri":"Comic_opera","surface_form":"comic opera","offset":275},{"uri":"Gymnastics","surface_form":"gymnastics","offset":307},{"uri":"Rue_Berg%C3%A8re","surface_form":"rue Berg\u00E8re","offset":405},{"uri":"%C3%89douard_Manet","surface_form":"\u00C9douard Manet","offset":427},{"uri":"A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Berg%C3%A8re","surface_form":"A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00E8re","offset":461},{"uri":"%C3%89douard_Marchand","surface_form":"\u00C9douard Marchand","offset":500},{"uri":"Music-hall","surface_form":"music-hall","offset":586},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":694},{"uri":"Lo%C3%AFe_Fuller","surface_form":"Lo\u00EFe Fuller","offset":710},{"uri":"Paul_Derval","surface_form":"Paul Derval","offset":822},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":915},{"uri":"Nude","surface_form":"nude","offset":958},{"uri":"Maurice_Chevalier","surface_form":"Maurice Chevalier","offset":1130},{"uri":"Mistinguett","surface_form":"Mistinguett","offset":1149},{"uri":"Josephine_Baker","surface_form":"Josephine Baker","offset":1162},{"uri":"Fernandel","surface_form":"Fernandel","offset":1179}]}
