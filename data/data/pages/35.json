{"id":35,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ad hominem is a Latin word for a type of argument. It is a word often used in rhetoric. Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your ideas.\nTranslated to English, \"ad hominem\" means \"against the person\". In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are attacking the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.\nThe term comes from the Latin word \"homo\", which means human. \"Hominem\" is a gender neutral version of the word \"homo\". In ancient Rome it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.\nAd hominem can be a way to use reputation, rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening. When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative label to them, this can work more often.\nIt is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In courts and in diplomacy ad hominems are not appreciated.\nAd hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be trusted, things that they have said previously can be doubted.\nWhat an ad hominem argument looks like.\nIn logic, a proof is something that starts with premises, and goes through a few logical arguments, to reach a conclusion.\nAd hominem example.\nIn this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":29},{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":54},{"uri":"Rhetoric","surface_form":"rhetoric","offset":91},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":179},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":309},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":444},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":466},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":520},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":627},{"uri":"Rumor","surface_form":"rumor","offset":639},{"uri":"Hearsay","surface_form":"hearsay","offset":650},{"uri":"Social_network","surface_form":"social network","offset":712},{"uri":"Label","surface_form":"label","offset":792},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":902},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomacy","offset":916},{"uri":"Trust_(social_sciences)","surface_form":"trusted","offset":1050},{"uri":"Doubt","surface_form":"doubt","offset":1104},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":1156},{"uri":"Proof","surface_form":"proof","offset":1165},{"uri":"Premise","surface_form":"premise","offset":1201},{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":1242},{"uri":"Conclusion","surface_form":"conclusion","offset":1264}]}
