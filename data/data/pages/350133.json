Amongst his many discoveries were the structure of carbohydrates, and he was the first to get synthetic peptides. He studied the active principles of tea, coffee and cocoa, namely, caffeine and theobromine.\nFischer also proposed the lock & key model of enzyme action.\nFamily.\nFischer was married to Agnes Gerlach in Feb. 1888, but she died seven years after their marriage. They had three sons, named Hermann Otto Laurenz Fischer (16. Dec. 1888 - 09. Mar. 1960) Walter (05. Jul. 1891 \u2013 04. Nov. 1916) and Alfred (3. Oct. 1894 \u2013 29. Mar. 1917). Alfred was killed in World War I, Walter committed suicide at the age of 25 as a result of compulsory military training.\nHis eldest son Hermann Otto Laurenz Fischer, was Professor of Biochemistry in the University of California, Berkeley from 1948 until his death in 1960.\nDeath.\nAt the end, suffering from terminal cancer, he is thought to have committed suicide in 1919.\nEmil Fischer is burried at Friedhof Wannsee, Lindenstra\u00DFe and since 1956 named as grave of honor for extraordinary services or achievements in his lifetimes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":59},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemist","offset":66},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":86},{"uri":"Carbohydrates","surface_form":"carbohydrates","offset":190},{"uri":"Purine","surface_form":"purine","offset":205},{"uri":"Nucleoside","surface_form":"nucleoside","offset":217},{"uri":"Peptides","surface_form":"peptides","offset":230},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":243},{"uri":"Synthetic","surface_form":"synthetic","offset":347},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":403},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":408},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":419},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":434},{"uri":"Theobromine","surface_form":"theobromine","offset":447},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":506},{"uri":"Hermann_Otto_Laurenz_Fischer","surface_form":"Hermann Otto Laurenz Fischer","offset":654},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":818},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":848},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":1000},{"uri":"Friedhof_Wannsee%2C_Lindenstra%C3%9Fe","surface_form":"Friedhof Wannsee, Lindenstra\u00DFe","offset":1197},{"uri":"Grave_of_honor","surface_form":"grave of honor","offset":1252}]}
