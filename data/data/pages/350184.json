{"id":350184,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_plover","text":"The Egyptian plover is a wader. It is the only member of the genus \"Pluvianus\".\nIt is sometimes called the crocodile bird. This is because of a story dating to Herodotus. In the story the crocodiles lie on the shore with their mouths open. The plovers fly into the crocodiles' mouths to feed on bits of meat between the crocodiles' teeth. There is no evidence of this actually happening.\nThe Egyptian plover lives in tropical sub-Saharan Africa. It breeds on sandbars in large rivers. Its two or three eggs are buried in warm sand. It feeds by pecking for insects. The call is a high-pitched \"krrr-krrr-krrr\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wader","surface_form":"wader","offset":25},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":61},{"uri":"Herodotus","surface_form":"Herodotus","offset":160},{"uri":"Sahara_Desert","surface_form":"sub-Saharan","offset":426},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":438},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":502},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":556}]}
