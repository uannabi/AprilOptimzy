{"id":350395,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Revolution","text":"The Belgian Revolution was the secession of the Southern provinces from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. It made an independent Kingdom of Belgium.\nThe people of the southern part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands were mostly Roman Catholic and the elite was French-speaking. They did not like the Protestant King William I's rule, or that he had revoked certain special privileges granted to the Catholic Church.\nOn August 25, 1830 riots started in Brussels and shops were looted. There was an opera playing about liberty of the fatherland, and the theatre-goers joined the rioters. The King sent troops to stop the riots.\nA battle took place in Brussels. The French came to support the breakaway province of Belgium. Belgium won the battle and became an independent country. Leopold I was made \"King of the Belgians\" in 1831. It took until 1839 for the Dutch to say Belgium was independent. They signed the Treaty of London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Secession","surface_form":"secession","offset":31},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"United Kingdom of the Netherlands","offset":76},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Kingdom of Belgium","offset":134},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":239},{"uri":"William_I_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"King William I's","offset":322},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":463},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":674},{"uri":"Leopold_I_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Leopold I","offset":790},{"uri":"Treaty_of_London_(1839)","surface_form":"Treaty of London","offset":922}]}
