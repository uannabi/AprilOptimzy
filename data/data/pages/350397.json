{"id":350397,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","text":"The United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131839) is the unofficial name used for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This was after it was first made from part of the First French Empire and before the new Kingdom of Belgium split off from it in 1830. Most of it is still today the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was made up of the former Dutch Republic to the north, the former Austrian Netherlands to the south, and the former Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00E8ge. The House of Orange-Nassau were the monarchs.\nThe United Kingdom of the Netherlands ended after the 1830 Belgian Revolution. William I, King of the Netherlands did not recognize a Belgian state until 1839. He was made to sign the Treaty of London. Only at this time were borders agreed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"First_French_Empire","surface_form":"First French Empire","offset":164},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Kingdom of Belgium","offset":203},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Kingdom of the Netherlands","offset":279},{"uri":"Dutch_Republic","surface_form":"Dutch Republic","offset":336},{"uri":"Austrian_Netherlands","surface_form":"Austrian Netherlands","offset":376},{"uri":"Prince-Bishopric_of_Li%C3%A8ge","surface_form":"Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00E8ge","offset":426},{"uri":"House_of_Orange-Nassau","surface_form":"House of Orange-Nassau","offset":457},{"uri":"Belgian_Revolution","surface_form":"Belgian Revolution","offset":558},{"uri":"William_I_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"William I, King of the Netherlands","offset":578},{"uri":"Treaty_of_London_(1839)","surface_form":"Treaty of London","offset":683}]}
