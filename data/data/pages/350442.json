They played a major role in the political and economical affairs of their fiefs.\nThe Flemish cities gained powers over their county. When Louis II, Count of Flanders, died without a male heir, these cities (Bruges, Ypres and Ghent) arranged a marriage between his daughter and the Duke of Burgundy. By doing this, they set in motion events that led to the Burgundian and, in 1478, the Habsburg Netherlands.\nUnder Habsburg.\nPolitically the Burgundian and Habsburg periods were very important to the Dutch. This is because the various Dutch fiefs were now united politically into one single group. The period ended in great turmoil. There was the rise of Protestantism, the policies of the Habsburg Empire, and other factors resulted in the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years' War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fief","surface_form":"fief","offset":150},{"uri":"County_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Flemish cities","offset":161},{"uri":"Louis_II%2C_Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Louis II, Count of Flanders","offset":214},{"uri":"Bruges","surface_form":"Bruges","offset":283},{"uri":"Ypres","surface_form":"Ypres","offset":291},{"uri":"Ghent","surface_form":"Ghent","offset":301},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Burgundy","surface_form":"Duke of Burgundy","offset":357},{"uri":"Burgundian_Netherlands","surface_form":"Burgundian","offset":432},{"uri":"Habsburg_Netherlands","surface_form":"Habsburg Netherlands","offset":461},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestantism","offset":729},{"uri":"Habsburg_Empire","surface_form":"Habsburg Empire","offset":764},{"uri":"Dutch_Revolt","surface_form":"Dutch Revolt","offset":815},{"uri":"Eighty_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Eighty Years' War","offset":836}]}
