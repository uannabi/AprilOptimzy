In other words, purposeful action may create consequences which are\nThis concept is one of the building blocks of economics. The term was coined and popularised in the 20th century. Its use has expanded into a range of contexts.\nHistory.\nThe idea of unintended consequences dates back at least to the 18th century when Adam Smith wrote about men who are \"led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his invention\".\nAmerican sociologist Robert K.

It accounts for 30% of the world's trade of services, and 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also creates opportunities for employment in the services needed for tourism.\nWith increased tourism comes a variety of unlooked-for problems, such as increased illegal immigration.

Furthermore, many of these organisms are now resistant to most treatment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Outcome","surface_form":"outcome","offset":98},{"uri":"Anticipate","surface_form":"anticipated","offset":113},{"uri":"Foresee","surface_form":"foreseen","offset":128},{"uri":"Intend","surface_form":"intended","offset":207},{"uri":"Consequence","surface_form":"consequence","offset":262},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":331},{"uri":"Adam_Smith","surface_form":"Adam Smith","offset":536},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":652},{"uri":"Sociologist","surface_form":"sociologist","offset":661},{"uri":"Robert_K._Merton","surface_form":"Robert K.
