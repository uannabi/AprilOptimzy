It is about the difference between what someone intends to do and what they actually do. In other words, the road to failure is made easier by good intentions.\nHistory.\nIn the mid-12th century, Bernard of Clairvaux wrote, \"L'enfer est plein de bonnes volont\u00E9s et d\u00E9sirs\" (hell is full of good wishes and desires). The sentence has been repeated many times in other languages and contexts.\nIn 1775, Samuel Johnson commented on \"the unhappy failure of pious resolves\" when he is reported saying, \"Sir, hell is paved with good intentions.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idiom","surface_form":"idiom","offset":66},{"uri":"Proverb","surface_form":"proverb","offset":75},{"uri":"Intend","surface_form":"intends","offset":132},{"uri":"Intent","surface_form":"intentions","offset":232},{"uri":"Bernard_of_Clairvaux","surface_form":"Bernard of Clairvaux","offset":278},{"uri":"Samuel_Johnson","surface_form":"Samuel Johnson","offset":482},{"uri":"Pious","surface_form":"pious","offset":534}]}
