{"id":350656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Treaty of Paris, often called the Peace of Paris, or the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763, by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement. It ended the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War in North America. The British won over France and Spain. The treaty gave control of the northern part of North America which is now Canada to Britain. France was left with two small islands, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, for its cod fishery.\nThis started an era of British power outside Europe. The treaty did not include either Prussia or Austria. They signed a separate Treaty of Hubertusburg five days later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":141},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_France","surface_form":"France","offset":156},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":167},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":179},{"uri":"Seven_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Seven Years' War","offset":215},{"uri":"French_and_Indian_War","surface_form":"French and Indian War","offset":246},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":373},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":400},{"uri":"Saint-Pierre_and_Miquelon","surface_form":"Saint-Pierre and Miquelon","offset":459},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":594},{"uri":"Austrian_Empire","surface_form":"Austria","offset":605},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Hubertusburg","surface_form":"Treaty of Hubertusburg","offset":637}]}
