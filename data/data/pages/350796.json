Some people think it was Edwin Hubble, but that is not correct. Lema\u00EEtre was also the first to make the Hubble's law and the Hubble constant.\nLema\u00EEtre also started what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe. He called it his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":102},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":110},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":118},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":130},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":161},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":176},{"uri":"Leuven","surface_form":"Louvain","offset":199},{"uri":"Expansion_of_the_universe","surface_form":"Universe is growing","offset":243},{"uri":"Edwin_Hubble","surface_form":"Edwin Hubble","offset":289},{"uri":"Hubble%27s_law","surface_form":"Hubble's law","offset":368},{"uri":"Hubble_constant","surface_form":"Hubble constant","offset":389},{"uri":"Big_Bang","surface_form":"Big Bang","offset":453},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"Universe","offset":490},{"uri":"Primeval_atom","surface_form":"primeval atom","offset":536}]}
