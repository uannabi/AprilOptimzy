{"id":350936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ensor","text":"James Sidney Edouard, Baron Ensor (13 April 1860\u00A0\u2013 19 November 1949) was a Flemish-Belgian painter and printmaker, an important influence on expressionism and surrealism who lived in Ostend for almost his entire life. He was associated with the artistic group Les XX.\nFrom 1877 to 1880, he attended the Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. His only travels were three brief trips to Paris, London, and Holland.\nIn 1895 his painting \"The Lamp Boy\" (1880) was acquired by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. He had his first solo exhibition in Brussels. By 1920 he was the subject of major exhibitions. In 1929 he was named a Baron by King Albert. He was the subject of the Belgian composer Flor Alpaerts's \"James Ensor Suite\". In 1933 he was awarded the band of the L\u00E9gion d'honneur.\nAgainst the advice of friends, he remained in Ostend during World War II despite the risk of bombardment. In his old age he was an honored figure among Belgians. His daily walk made him a familiar sight in Ostend. He died there after a short illness, on 19 November 1949.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flemish_people","surface_form":"Flemish","offset":75},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":83},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":91},{"uri":"Printmaker","surface_form":"printmaker","offset":103},{"uri":"Expressionism","surface_form":"expressionism","offset":141},{"uri":"Surrealism","surface_form":"surrealism","offset":159},{"uri":"Ostend","surface_form":"Ostend","offset":183},{"uri":"Les_XX","surface_form":"Les XX","offset":260},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_des_Beaux-Arts","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts","offset":303},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":337},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":390},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":397},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":409},{"uri":"Royal_Museums_of_Fine_Arts_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium","offset":481},{"uri":"Baron","surface_form":"Baron","offset":650},{"uri":"Albert_I_of_Belgium","surface_form":"King Albert","offset":659},{"uri":"Flor_Alpaerts","surface_form":"Flor Alpaerts","offset":715},{"uri":"L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur","surface_form":"L\u00E9gion d'honneur","offset":791},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":869}]}
