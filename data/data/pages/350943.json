{"id":350943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Delvaux","text":"Paul Delvaux (23 September 1897 \u2013 20 July 1994) was a Belgian painter. He is known for his Surrealism, famous for his paintings of female nudes.\nDelvaux was born in Antheit. The young Delvaux took music lessons, studied Greek and Latin, and read the fiction of Jules Verne and the poetry of Homer. He studied at the Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. He studied architecture because his parents did not want him to be a painter. He went for his goal by taking painting classes taught by Constant Montald and Jean Delville. The painters Frans Courtens and Alfred Bastien also encouraged Delvaux. He completed about 80 paintings between 1920 and 1925. 1925 was the year of his first solo exhibition.\nHe was named director of the Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in 1965. In 1982 the Paul Delvaux Museum opened in Saint-Idesbald. Delvaux died in Veurne in 1994.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":54},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":62},{"uri":"Surrealism","surface_form":"Surrealism","offset":91},{"uri":"Antheit","surface_form":"Antheit","offset":165},{"uri":"Jules_Verne","surface_form":"Jules Verne","offset":261},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":291},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_des_Beaux-Arts","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts","offset":316},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":350},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":371},{"uri":"Constant_Montald","surface_form":"Constant Montald","offset":496},{"uri":"Jean_Delville","surface_form":"Jean Delville","offset":517},{"uri":"Frans_Courtens","surface_form":"Frans Courtens","offset":545},{"uri":"Alfred_Bastien","surface_form":"Alfred Bastien","offset":564},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_des_Beaux-Arts","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts","offset":736},{"uri":"Paul_Delvaux_Museum","surface_form":"Paul Delvaux Museum","offset":788},{"uri":"Saint-Idesbald","surface_form":"Saint-Idesbald","offset":818},{"uri":"Veurne","surface_form":"Veurne","offset":850}]}
