{"id":350945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamarenko","text":"Panamarenko (pseudonym of Henri Van Herwegen; 5 February 1940 \u2013 14 December 2019) was a famous assemblagist in Belgian sculpture. He is famous for his work with airplanes as theme. None of the airplanes are able to actually leave the ground.\nPanamarenko studied at the academy of Antwerp. Before 1968, his art was inspired by Pop art. Early on he became interested in planes and human powered flight. This interest is also shown in his name. It is supposed to be an acronym for \"Pan American Airlines and Company\".\nStarting in 1970, he developed his first models of imaginary vehicles, planes, balloons or helicopters. Many of his sculptures are modern versions of the myth of Icarus.\nIn 2003 Panamarenko married the 34 year younger Eveline Hoorens. At the opening of a large-scale overview exhibition of his work in Brussels in 2005, Panamarenko said he was retiring as an artist. He has since had his own coffee brand PanamaJumbo.\nOn 24 April 2009, VLM Airlines named one of its Fokker 50 aircraft in his honour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Assemblage_(art)","surface_form":"assemblagist","offset":95},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":111},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":119},{"uri":"Pop_art","surface_form":"Pop art","offset":326},{"uri":"Fixed-wing_aircraft","surface_form":"plane","offset":368},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":466},{"uri":"Balloon","surface_form":"balloon","offset":594},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":606},{"uri":"Icarus","surface_form":"Icarus","offset":677},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":688},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":817},{"uri":"VLM_Airlines","surface_form":"VLM Airlines","offset":951},{"uri":"Fokker_50","surface_form":"Fokker 50","offset":981}]}
