{"id":351047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_in_a_poke","text":"Pig in a poke is an English idiom which means a kind of deceptive trick. It is a blind bargain.\nThe phrase is about something which is offered for sale in a manner which hides its true value. The idiom means a purchase which turns out not to be what the seller claimed it was.\nHistory.\nThe term \"pig in a poke\" was first used in the Middle Ages. At this time, it was common to sell meat or small animals in cloth bags or sacks called a \"poke\".\nSometimes people simply bought the \"poke\" without looking inside; and sometimes people who thought they were buying pork or a small pig were surprised to find they had been sold something else.\nThe idiom \"pig in a poke\" is about what happens when someone does not look to see what is being bought or sold.\nMeaning.\nThe idiom \"pig in a poke\" is used to describe something which is purchased without the buyer being aware of its true nature or value.\nThe phrase can also be applied to accepting an idea or plan without a full understanding of it. In other words, it is about starting a course of action without knowing the relevant facts.\nMany other European languages have a version of this phrase, but many are translated as a warning not to buy a cat in a bag. -","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idiom","surface_form":"idiom","offset":28},{"uri":"Deceptive","surface_form":"deceptive","offset":56},{"uri":"Pig_in_a_poke","surface_form":"\"pig in a poke\"","offset":295},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":333}]}
