{"id":351091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte","text":"Ren\u00E9 Fran\u00E7ois Ghislain Magritte (21 November 1898 \u2013 15 August 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist. He was well known for a number of witty and thought-provoking images.\nEarly life and career.\nMagritte was born in Lessines, in the province of Hainaut. Little is known about Magritte's early life. He began lessons in drawing in 1910. On 12 March 1912, his mother committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre.\nMagritte's earliest paintings, which date from about 1915, were Impressionistic in style. From 1916 to 1918, he studied at the Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. He studied under Constant Montald. The paintings he made in the years 1918\u20131924 were influenced by Futurism and by the offshoot of Cubism practiced by Metzinger. Most of his works of this period are female nudes.\nIn 1922, Magritte married Georgette Berger From December 1920 until September 1921, Magritte was in the Belgian army Leopoldsburg. In 1922\u20131923, he worked as a draughtsman in a wallpaper factory. He was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926. In 1926, Magritte made his first surreal painting, \"The Lost Jockey\" (\"Le jockey perdu\"). His first exhibition was in Brussels in 1927. Critics did not like his paintings.\nIn 1927 he moved to Paris where he became friends with Andr\u00E9 Breton. He returned to Brussels in 1930 and resumed working in advertising. He and his brother, Paul, formed an agency which earned him a living wage.\nSurrealist patron Edward James let Magritte stay rent free in his London home and paint.\nDuring the German occupation of Belgium in World War II he stayed in Brussels. During 1947\u201348 he painted in a provocative and crude Fauve style. During this time, Magritte supported himself through making fake Picassos, Braques and Chiricos. Later he printed forged banknotes. At the end of 1948, he returned to the style and themes of his prewar surrealistic art.\nHis work was exhibited in the United States in New York in 1936. It was shown again at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992.\nMagritte died of pancreatic cancer in Brussels on 15 August 1967.\nMagritte Museum.\nThe Magritte Museum opened to the public on 30 May 2009 in Brussels. It is in the five-level neo-classical Hotel Altenloh. The museum shows about 200 original Magritte paintings, drawings and sculptures. The museum also includes Magritte\u2019s experiments with photography from 1920 on and the short surrealist movies he made from 1956 on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgians","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":74},{"uri":"Surrealist","surface_form":"surrealist","offset":82},{"uri":"Lessines","surface_form":"Lessines","offset":215},{"uri":"Hainaut_(province)","surface_form":"Hainaut","offset":244},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":374},{"uri":"Drowning","surface_form":"drowning","offset":385},{"uri":"Sambre","surface_form":"River Sambre","offset":409},{"uri":"Impressionism","surface_form":"Impressionistic","offset":487},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_des_Beaux-Arts","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts","offset":550},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":584},{"uri":"Constant_Montald","surface_form":"Constant Montald","offset":611},{"uri":"Futurism","surface_form":"Futurism","offset":693},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"Cubism","offset":725},{"uri":"Jean_Metzinger","surface_form":"Metzinger","offset":745},{"uri":"Georgette_Berger","surface_form":"Georgette Berger","offset":833},{"uri":"Leopoldsburg","surface_form":"Leopoldsburg","offset":924},{"uri":"Draughtsman","surface_form":"draughtsman","offset":967},{"uri":"Wallpaper","surface_form":"wallpaper","offset":984},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1250},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Breton","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Breton","offset":1285},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":1314},{"uri":"Edward_James","surface_form":"Edward James","offset":1460},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1574},{"uri":"Fauvism","surface_form":"Fauve","offset":1663},{"uri":"Picasso","surface_form":"Picasso","offset":1741},{"uri":"Georges_Braque","surface_form":"Braque","offset":1751},{"uri":"Giorgio_de_Chirico","surface_form":"Chirico","offset":1763},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":1943},{"uri":"Museum_of_Modern_Art","surface_form":"Museum of Modern Art","offset":1987},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art","surface_form":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","offset":2028},{"uri":"Pancreatic_cancer","surface_form":"pancreatic cancer","offset":2081},{"uri":"Magritte_Museum","surface_form":"Magritte Museum","offset":2151},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":2274}]}
