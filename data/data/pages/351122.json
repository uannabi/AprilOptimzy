{"id":351122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex_(band)","text":"The Belgian synthpop group Telex was formed in 1978 by Marc Moulin, Dan Lacksman, and Michel Moers. They mixed disco, punk and experimental electronic music.\nLike Kraftwerk, Telex built its music entirely from electronic instruments.\nIn 1980 Telex's manager asked the group to enter the Eurovision Song Contest. The group entered and were sent to the finals. The group's song \"Euro-Vision\" was a cheerful bleepy song with deliberately banal lyrics about the contest itself. The Eurovision audience seemed unsure how to react to the performance. After the band stopped playing, there was mostly stunned silence. Michel Moers took a photograph of the bewildered audience. The band walked off to sounds of muttering. When vote-counting began, and Greece awarded Belgium three points. The announcer thought she misheard and tried to award the points to the Netherlands.\nFor its third album, Telex got the help of US group Sparks to help write the lyrics. However, the band still would not play live. This is common practice for techno music artists, but unusual in 1981. The fourth Telex album, \"Wonderful World\", was barely distributed.\nIn 1986, Atlantic Records signed Telex. At this time the band was using sampling and a more up-tempo humorous style.\nIn 1989, Telex revisited all of its old tracks and remixed them to be like house music.\nAfter almost two decades of silence, Telex made a comeback in March 2006 with \"How Do You Dance\" on EMI Records. It had five original songs as well as five covers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":4},{"uri":"Synthpop","surface_form":"synthpop","offset":12},{"uri":"Marc_Moulin","surface_form":"Marc Moulin","offset":55},{"uri":"Disco","surface_form":"disco","offset":111},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk","offset":118},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic music","offset":140},{"uri":"Kraftwerk","surface_form":"Kraftwerk","offset":163},{"uri":"Synthesizer","surface_form":"electronic instruments","offset":210},{"uri":"1980_Eurovision_Song_Contest","surface_form":"1980","offset":237},{"uri":"Talent_manager","surface_form":"manager","offset":250},{"uri":"Eurovision_Song_Contest","surface_form":"Eurovision Song Contest","offset":287},{"uri":"Euro-Vision","surface_form":"Euro-Vision","offset":377},{"uri":"Banal","surface_form":"banal","offset":435},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":489},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":744},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":853},{"uri":"Sparks_(band)","surface_form":"Sparks","offset":918},{"uri":"Techno_music","surface_form":"techno music","offset":1024},{"uri":"Atlantic_Records","surface_form":"Atlantic Records","offset":1143},{"uri":"Sampling_(music)","surface_form":"sampling","offset":1206},{"uri":"House_music","surface_form":"house music","offset":1326},{"uri":"EMI","surface_form":"EMI Records","offset":1439}]}
