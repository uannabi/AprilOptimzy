{"id":35123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototheria","text":"The Prototheria is a former subclass of mammals, now no longer in use. The name comes from Greek \"pr\u014Dtos\" means 'first', and \"th\u0113r\", 'beast'. The only surviving animals in this subclass are the Monotremes.\nThere are two other subclasses, the Metatheria and the Eutheria. Metatheria contains the marsupials. All the other mammals are Eutherian.\nEvidence is accumulating that the Prototheria is not a natural group, but alternative suggestions are not yet agreed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":40},{"uri":"Monotreme","surface_form":"Monotreme","offset":194},{"uri":"Metatheria","surface_form":"Metatheria","offset":242},{"uri":"Eutheria","surface_form":"Eutheria","offset":261},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":295}]}
