{"id":351234,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_white_rhinoceros","text":"The Northern white rhinoceros, or the Northern square-lipped rhinoceros (\"Ceratotherium simum cottoni\"), is one of the two subspecies of the white rhinoceros. These animals are extinct in the wild, but there are currently seven left in captivity. These seven lived in the Dv\u016Fr Kr\u00E1lov\u00E9 Zoo in the Czech Republic. Four of the seven rhinoceroses were transported to Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, Africa, where scientists hope they will successfully breed and save this subspecies from extinction. One of three remaining in the Czech Republic died in late May 2011. The two other rhinoceroses now live at the San Diego Zoo's Safari Park in California.\nIn March 2018, Sudan, the last male white rhinoceros, died after being euthanized.\nDiet.\nThe northern white rhinoceros eats mainly grass, and other low lying vegetation. They can live for around 40 to 65 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":123},{"uri":"White_rhinoceros","surface_form":"white rhinoceros","offset":141},{"uri":"Dv%C5%AFr_Kr%C3%A1lov%C3%A9_Zoo","surface_form":"Dv\u016Fr Kr\u00E1lov\u00E9 Zoo","offset":272},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":296},{"uri":"Ol_Pejeta_Conservancy","surface_form":"Ol Pejeta Conservancy","offset":363},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":388},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":395},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":409},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":484},{"uri":"San_Diego_Zoo%27s_Safari_Park","surface_form":"San Diego Zoo's Safari Park","offset":607},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":638},{"uri":"Sudan_(rhinoceros)","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":665},{"uri":"Euthanasia","surface_form":"euthanized","offset":721}]}
