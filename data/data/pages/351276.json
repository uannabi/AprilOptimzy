{"id":351276,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Nativity","text":"The Church of the Nativity is a church in Bethlehem. It is one of the oldest churches in the world. It is built over the cave that tradition marks as the birthplace of Jesus. It is considered very sacred to Christians and Muslims.\nThe main basilica is maintained by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Underneath the building is a cave or grotto. It is where Jesus is said to have been born. On Christmas Eve, crowds gather to sing Christmas carols outside the church in an area called Manger Square. The crowds also go to celebrate midnight mass at the Church of Saint Catherine, a Roman Catholic church next door to the basilica. It is performed by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.\nThe basilica has been reported to be not very well preserved. The Palestinian government started restoring the buildings in 2010. It was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2012. It is the first World Heritage Site listed under Palestine. It was listed as being in danger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["religious building"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":32},{"uri":"Bethlehem","surface_form":"Bethlehem","offset":42},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":131},{"uri":"Virgin_birth_of_Jesus","surface_form":"birthplace","offset":154},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":168},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christians","offset":207},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":222},{"uri":"Basilica","surface_form":"basilica","offset":240},{"uri":"Greek_Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem","offset":270},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":338},{"uri":"Grotto","surface_form":"grotto","offset":346},{"uri":"Virgin_birth_of_Jesus","surface_form":"born","offset":393},{"uri":"Christmas_Eve","surface_form":"Christmas Eve","offset":402},{"uri":"Christmas_carols","surface_form":"Christmas carols","offset":439},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":590},{"uri":"Latin_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem","offset":662},{"uri":"Restoration","surface_form":"restoring","offset":789},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":836},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":859},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":929}]}
