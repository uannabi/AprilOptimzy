{"id":351295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_of_Hainault","text":"Philippa of Hainault (24 June 1313 15 August 1369) was the queen of Edward III of England.\nPhilippa was the daughter of William I, Count of Hainaut, nicknamed \"the Good\", and Joan of Valois, the granddaughter of Philip III of France.\nKing Edward II wanted an alliance with Flanders to benefit England. He sent Bishop Stapledon to choose a good wife for Prince Edward. He chose Philippa who was about nine years old at that time. Four years later Philippa was betrothed to Prince Edward.\nPhilippa married Edward at York Minster, on 24 January 1328. This was eleven months after he was made King. The real rulers of the kingdom were his mother, Queen Dowager Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. They jointly acted as his regents. The couple lived at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire. Philippa was crowned queen on 4 March 1330 at Westminster Abbey. She was almost six months pregnant. She gave birth to her first son, Edward, the following June just nine days before her seventeenth birthday.\nIn October 1330, King Edward began to rule. He ordered the arrest of his mother and Mortimer. Mortimer was killed for treason. Queen Dowager Isabella was sent to Castle Rising in Norfolk, where she spent the rest of her life.\nPhilippa went with Edward on his trips to Scotland, and the European continent in his early campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. She acted as regent in England on several times when her husband was away from his kingdom.\nOn 15 August 1369, Philippa died of an illness similar to dropsy in Windsor Castle at the age of fifty-six. By all accounts, her forty-year marriage to Edward had been happy. Even though he had an affair with her lady-in-waiting, Alice Perrers, during the later years.\nThe Queen's College, Oxford is named after Philippa. It was founded in 1341 by one of her chaplains, Robert de Eglesfield, in her honour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"queen","offset":59},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"Edward III of England","offset":68},{"uri":"William_I%2C_Count_of_Hainaut","surface_form":"William I, Count of Hainaut","offset":120},{"uri":"Joan_of_Valois_(1294-1352)","surface_form":"Joan of Valois","offset":175},{"uri":"Philip_III_of_France","surface_form":"Philip III of France","offset":212},{"uri":"Edward_II_of_England","surface_form":"Edward II","offset":239},{"uri":"Walter_de_Stapledon","surface_form":"Bishop Stapledon","offset":310},{"uri":"York_Minster","surface_form":"York Minster","offset":514},{"uri":"Queen_Dowager","surface_form":"Queen Dowager","offset":643},{"uri":"Roger_Mortimer%2C_1st_Earl_of_March","surface_form":"Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March","offset":680},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":741},{"uri":"Woodstock_Palace","surface_form":"Woodstock Palace","offset":770},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":790},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":849},{"uri":"Edward%2C_the_Black_Prince","surface_form":"Edward","offset":937},{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":1130},{"uri":"Castle_Rising","surface_form":"Castle Rising","offset":1174},{"uri":"Norfolk","surface_form":"Norfolk","offset":1191},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":1280},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":1347},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":1380},{"uri":"Dropsy","surface_form":"dropsy","offset":1517},{"uri":"Windsor_Castle","surface_form":"Windsor Castle","offset":1527},{"uri":"Lady-in-waiting","surface_form":"lady-in-waiting","offset":1672},{"uri":"Alice_Perrers","surface_form":"Alice Perrers","offset":1689},{"uri":"The_Queen%27s_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"The Queen's College, Oxford","offset":1728},{"uri":"Robert_de_Eglesfield","surface_form":"Robert de Eglesfield","offset":1829}]}
