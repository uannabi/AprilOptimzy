She says that her mission is to be a bridge between the European and the African and bring the two cultures together with music. \"What I would like to do is bring sounds from Africa and bring it to the Western world, because I know that through sound and through beats, that people discover a new culture, a new people, a new world.\" They sing in French and English with deep African roots.\nZap Mama performed their first concert in 1989. In 1991, the group recorded their first record, \"Zap Mama\", at Studio Daylight in Brussels, Belgium. The album was released by Crammed Discs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":14},{"uri":"Marie_Daulne","surface_form":"Marie Daulne","offset":55},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":244},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":416},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":427},{"uri":"Music_of_Africa","surface_form":"African","offset":445},{"uri":"Crammed_Discs","surface_form":"Crammed Discs","offset":635}]}
