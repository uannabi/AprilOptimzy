The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan was established on May 28, 1918, during the first Republic of Azerbaijan.\nAfter Azerbaijan was occupied by the Red Army and became a part of the Soviet Union on 28 April, 1920 as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Azerbaijan SSR), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was abolished and was replaced by People's Foreign Affairs Commissariat (PFAC). The People's Foreign Affairs Commissariat, had little power because Azerbaijan was no longer independent and followed Soviet foreign policy. However, the Soviet government allowed the People's Foreign Affairs Commissariat of Azerbaijan to conduct certain ties with foreign countries.\nAfter the Soviet Union ended and Azerbaijan gained its independence in 1991, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established, again in charge of the foreign policy of Azerbaijan.\nElmar Mammadyarov is the current Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan since 2004.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":54},{"uri":"Ministry_(government_department)","surface_form":"ministry","offset":65},{"uri":"Management","surface_form":"manages","offset":80},{"uri":"Foreign_policy","surface_form":"foreign relations","offset":92},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":113},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"the first Republic of Azerbaijan","offset":211},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"occupied","offset":266},{"uri":"Red_Army","surface_form":"Red Army","offset":282},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"became a part","offset":295},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":316},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic","offset":354},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":614},{"uri":"Soviet","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":675},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":682},{"uri":"Elmar_Mammadyarov","surface_form":"Elmar Mammadyarov","offset":984},{"uri":"Minister","surface_form":"Minister","offset":1017}]}
