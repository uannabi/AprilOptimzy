It is named after a Keoladeo (Shiva) temple within its boundaries. The area is a natural low spot in the land. It was flooded by two rivers, the Gambhir and Banganga.\nThe area was a hunting ground for the maharajas of Bharatpur after 1850. The Viceroy of India hunted birds in this special park.\nKeoladeo was established as a national park on 10 March 1982.\nThe area was designated as a bird sanctuary on 13 March 1976.\nIn 1985, the Park was declared a World Heritage Site.\nGeography.\nKeoladeo (Bharatpur) National Park (27\u00B010'N, 77\u00B031'E) is in eastern Rajasthan. It is 2 kilometers (km) south-east of Bharatpur and 50\u00A0km west of Agra.\nThe Park is spread over approx 29 square kilometer area. One third of the Keoladeo National Park habitat is wetland. The uplands have grasslands (savannas) of tall species of grass together with scattered trees and shrubs present in varying density.\nIn an area characterized by sparse vegetation, the park is the only spot which has dense vegetation and trees..\nDykes divide the wetland into ten units. Each unit has a system of sluice gates to control its water level.\nScientific Research and Facilities.\nThe Bombay Natural History Society has done considerable work in the area.\nBetween December 1992 and January 1995, a collaborative project between the Governments of India and Russia, International Crane Foundation and Wild Bird Society of Japan was set up to save the Siberian crane.
