{"id":351743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyo","text":"Pierre Culliford (25 June 1928 \u2013 24 December 1992), known as Peyo, was a Belgian comics artist. He is best known for making \"The Smurfs\" comic strip.\nPeyo was born in 1928 in Brussels. He was the son of an English father and a Belgian mother. On Christmas Eve 1992, Peyo died of a heart attack in Brussels at age 64.\nCareer.\nHe went to the Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Peyo began work at the Compagnie Belge d'Animation (CBA), a small Belgian animation studio. There he met a few of his future colleagues, like Andr\u00E9 Franquin, Morris and Eddy Paape. He made his first comics for the newspaper \"La Derni\u00E8re Heure\" (The Latest Hour). From 1949 to 1952, he drew \"Poussy\", a stop comic about a cat, for \"Le Soir\". For the same newspaper, he also made \"Johan\".\nIn 1952, Franquin introduced Peyo to \"Le Journal de Spirou\". It was a children's comics magazine published by Dupuis which was first in Belgium in 1938. Peyo wrote and drew a lot of characters and storylines. His favourite was \"Johan et Pirlouit\" (translated into English as \"Johan and Peewit\"). Set in the Middle Ages in Europe, \"Johan et Pirlouit\" stars a brave young page to the king, and his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. Johan defends the meek on his trusty horse, while Peewit gallops behind on his goat, named Biquette.\nSmurfs.\nThe first smurf appeared in \"Johan and Peewit\" on 23 October 1958 in the album \"La Fl\u00FBte \u00E0 Six Schtroumpfs\" (\"The Six Smurfed Flute\"). As the smurfs became more popular, Peyo started a studio in the early 1960s. Many talented comic artists started to work. The most notable artists to come from this studio are Walth\u00E9ry, Wasterlain, Gos, Derib, Degieter, and Desorgher.\nIn 1959, the Smurfs got their own series. Many authors of the Marcinelle school worked together on the writing or as an artist. These include Willy Maltaite (aka 'Will'), Yvan Delporte, and Roger Leloup. Peyo became more of a businessman and supervisor. He let his son, Thierry Culliford, lead the studio. His daughter V\u00E9ronique was responsible for the merchandising.\nThe merchandising of the Smurfs began in 1959. The PVC figurines were the most important piece until the late 1970s. Then, with the success of the Smurf records by Father Abraham, the Smurfs got more international success. Some of the toys reached the United States. Hanna-Barbera made a Saturday morning animated series in 1981. Peyo was story supervisor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belgians","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":73},{"uri":"The_Smurfs","surface_form":"The Smurfs","offset":125},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comic strip","offset":137},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":175},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":206},{"uri":"Christmas_Eve","surface_form":"Christmas Eve","offset":246},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":281},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_des_Beaux-Arts","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts","offset":340},{"uri":"Compagnie_Belge_d%27Animation","surface_form":"Compagnie Belge d'Animation","offset":407},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Franquin","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Franquin","offset":526},{"uri":"Morris_(comics)","surface_form":"Morris","offset":542},{"uri":"Eddy_Paape","surface_form":"Eddy Paape","offset":553},{"uri":"La_Derni%C3%A8re_Heure","surface_form":"La Derni\u00E8re Heure","offset":609},{"uri":"Le_Soir","surface_form":"Le Soir","offset":715},{"uri":"Spirou_(magazine)","surface_form":"Le Journal de Spirou","offset":809},{"uri":"Franco-Belgian_comics_magazines","surface_form":"comics magazine","offset":852},{"uri":"Dupuis","surface_form":"Dupuis","offset":881},{"uri":"Johan_and_Peewit","surface_form":"Johan and Peewit","offset":1047},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":1078},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1093},{"uri":"Page_(servant)","surface_form":"page","offset":1141},{"uri":"Sidekick","surface_form":"sidekick","offset":1210},{"uri":"Johan_and_Peewit","surface_form":"Johan and Peewit","offset":1358},{"uri":"Comic_artist","surface_form":"comic artist","offset":1555},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Walth%C3%A9ry","surface_form":"Walth\u00E9ry","offset":1640},{"uri":"Wasterlain","surface_form":"Wasterlain","offset":1650},{"uri":"Roland_Goossens","surface_form":"Gos","offset":1662},{"uri":"Claude_de_Ribaupierre","surface_form":"Derib","offset":1667},{"uri":"Degieter","surface_form":"Degieter","offset":1674},{"uri":"Desorgher","surface_form":"Desorgher","offset":1688},{"uri":"The_Smurfs_(comics)","surface_form":"series","offset":1733},{"uri":"Marcinelle_school","surface_form":"Marcinelle school","offset":1761},{"uri":"Will_(comics)","surface_form":"Willy Maltaite","offset":1841},{"uri":"Yvan_Delporte","surface_form":"Yvan Delporte","offset":1870},{"uri":"Roger_Leloup","surface_form":"Roger Leloup","offset":1889},{"uri":"Pierre_Kartner","surface_form":"Father Abraham","offset":2231},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2319},{"uri":"Hanna-Barbera","surface_form":"Hanna-Barbera","offset":2334},{"uri":"The_Smurfs_(Hanna-Barbera_series)","surface_form":"Saturday morning animated series","offset":2355}]}
