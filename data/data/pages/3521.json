{"id":3521,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate","text":"=\"preserve\">A plate is a type of dish where food can be placed after being cooked for eating. Sometimes they are called dishes. They may be made out of ceramic, plastic, paper, or styrofoam.\nA plate is also one of the broken pieces of lithosphere of the Earth.\nAll plates have irregular shapes. They lie and float on the upper mantle. They move very slowly in different directions. Their movement is driven by the convection currents in the magma.\nA plate can contain both oceanic and continental crusts. Some contain oceanic crust only.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dish","surface_form":"dish","offset":33},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":44},{"uri":"Cook","surface_form":"cook","offset":75},{"uri":"Eat","surface_form":"eat","offset":86},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":152},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":161},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":170},{"uri":"Styrofoam","surface_form":"styrofoam","offset":180},{"uri":"Lithosphere","surface_form":"lithosphere","offset":235},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":254},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":287},{"uri":"Mantle_(geology)","surface_form":"mantle","offset":327},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":370},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"movement","offset":388},{"uri":"Convection_current","surface_form":"convection current","offset":414},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":441}]}
