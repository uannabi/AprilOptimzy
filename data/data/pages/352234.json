It is often not noticed: its color and texture are similar to the rocks on which it lives.\nIn the West Indies, these and other common intertidal chitons are known as \"curb\". The foot of the animal is eaten by people and is also used as bait for fishing.\nThis chiton occurs from southern Florida to Mexico, south to Panama, and in the West Indies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chiton","surface_form":"chiton","offset":49},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":84},{"uri":"Atlantic","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":130},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":238},{"uri":"Bait","surface_form":"bait","offset":376},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":427},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":438},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":455},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":474}]}
