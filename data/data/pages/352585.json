'How pure, Chile, is thy blue sky'), is the national anthem of Chile. It was composed by Ram\u00F3n Carnicer and first adopted in 1828. Later, the Chilean government wanted words for the song, so eventually, a poet by the name of Eusibio Lillo wrote the lyrics to the anthem in September 1847.\nHistory.\nAfter Chile won its independence from Spain, the Chilean government demanded that there be a national anthem with lyrics (words) and music. The first version of \"Canci\u00F3n Nacional\" was written by Eusebio Lillo in 1819, and Ram\u00F3n Carnicer composed the music a year later. While Carnicer was exiled in England, he composed the second (and current) version until he returned to Barcelona, Spain in 1827. A year later, Carnicer's new anthem premiered in Santiago, Chile. Then in 1847, Eusebio Lillo wrote the new lyrics, which was then revised (changed for the better) in 1909.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":308},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":327},{"uri":"Ram%C3%B3n_Carnicer","surface_form":"Ram\u00F3n Carnicer","offset":353},{"uri":"Eusibio_Lillo","surface_form":"Eusibio Lillo","offset":489},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":582},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":600},{"uri":"Eusebio_Lillo","surface_form":"Eusebio Lillo","offset":757},{"uri":"Ram%C3%B3n_Carnicer","surface_form":"Ram\u00F3n Carnicer","offset":784},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":936},{"uri":"Santiago","surface_form":"Santiago","offset":1011}]}
