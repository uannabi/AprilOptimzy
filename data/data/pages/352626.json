{"id":352626,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-tongued_skink","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Blue tongue lizard redirects here.\"\nBlue-tongued skinks make up the Australasian genus, \"Tiliqua\", which has some of the largest members of the skink family (Scincidae). They are also called blue-tongued lizards or simply blue-tongues, shinglebacks or the sleepy lizard in Australia. The main feature of the genus is a large blue tongue that can be used to scare away enemies.\nDistribution.\nBlue-tongued skinks are closely related to the genera \"Cyclodomorphus\" and \"Hemisphaeriodon\". All species are found on mainland Australia except \"Tiliqua gigas\" which lives in New Guinea and various islands of Indonesia. One subspecies of \"Tiliqua scincoides\" is also found on several small Indonesian islands between Australia and New Guinea. \"Tiliqua nigrolutea\" is the only species in Tasmania. With the exception of the pygmy blue-tongue, they are large lizards which can grow up to 45\u00A0cm total length. They are light-bodied, short-limbed, broad with a distinct head and dull teeth.\nEcology.\nMost species are diurnal ground-foraging omnivores, feeding on insects, gastropods, flowers, fruits and berries. The pygmy blue-tongue however mainly eats arthropods. The skinks give birth to live young. The litter sizes ranging from 1\u20134 in the pygmy blue-tongue and shingleback to 5\u201324 in the eastern and northern blue-tongues.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blue_tongue_lizard","surface_form":"Blue tongue lizard","offset":14},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasian","offset":82},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":95},{"uri":"Skink","surface_form":"skink","offset":158},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":164},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":287},{"uri":"Cyclodomorphus","surface_form":"Cyclodomorphus","offset":460},{"uri":"Hemisphaeriodon","surface_form":"Hemisphaeriodon","offset":481},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":581},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":615},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":630},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":737},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":793},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":1018},{"uri":"Omnivores","surface_form":"omnivores","offset":1042},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":1156}]}
