{"id":352635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felis","text":"\"Felis\" is a genus of small cats in the family Felidae. They include the familiar domestic cat and its closest wild relatives. The wild species are found in Europe, southern and central Asia, and Africa. The domestic cat, which may have its origin in North Africa, is now worldwide.\nMembers of the genus \"Felis\" are all small felines, rather similar to the domestic cat. The smallest species is the sand cat, which may be less than in length, while the largest is the jungle cat, which can reach. They live in many habitats: forests, grassland, swampland and deserts. They mostly feed on small rodents, supplementing their diet with birds and other small animals, depending on their local environment.\nGenetic studies indicate that the genus \"Felis\" first evolved around eight to ten million years ago, probably in the Mediterranean region.\nSpecies.\nThe genus \"Felis\" is currently considered to consist of six living species, although the domestic cat and Chinese mountain cat are sometimes considered subspecies of \"F. silvestris\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":13},{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"Felidae","offset":47},{"uri":"Domestic_cat","surface_form":"domestic cat","offset":82},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":157},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":186},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":196},{"uri":"Sand_cat","surface_form":"sand cat","offset":399},{"uri":"Jungle_cat","surface_form":"jungle cat","offset":468},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":525},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":534},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":545},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":559},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":594},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":633}]}
