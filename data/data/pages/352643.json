{"id":352643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_plant","text":"An aquatic plant is a plant that has adapted to live in the water. This can be either freshwater, such as in rivers and lakes, saltwater as in the sea, or brackish water, as in the estuary of a river.\nSome aquatic plants are partly submerged. Others are totally submerged. Common adaptations include leaves that float on the water, and special tissue that allows to transport air and other gases inside the plant.Some plants from the water can be adapted in land.\nAquatic plants require special adaptation for living in submerged water or at the water's surface.\nHydrophytes are the plants which live completely or partially submerged in fresh water. Such plants do not face the problem of water shortage. They have developed mechanisms for the removal of extra water from their cells. Hydrophytes have broad leaves with a large number of stomata on their upper surfaces. This characteristic helps them to remove extra amount of water. The most common example of such plants is Water Lily.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":22},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapted","offset":37},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":86},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":109},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":120},{"uri":"Saltwater","surface_form":"saltwater","offset":127},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":147},{"uri":"Brackish_water","surface_form":"brackish water","offset":155},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":181},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":300},{"uri":"Tissue_(biology)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":344},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":376},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":390},{"uri":"Nymphaea","surface_form":"Water Lily","offset":978}]}
