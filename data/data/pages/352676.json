{"id":352676,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Linda_Andersen","text":"e=\"preserve\">Linda Andersen was murdered by her two teenage daughters, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen, on January 18, 2003 in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The names in this article are aliases, for legal reasons.\nSandra and Elizabeth Andersen were each sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2005. Neither sister served their full-time prison sentence: Sandra Andersen was released to a halfway house in 2009 and Elizabeth Andersen was released in 2010. Since they were under-aged at the time of the murder, the Canadian government is protecting the sisters' true identities and has issued the Andersen sisters with aliases. Linda Andersen's murder case was broadcast on the television series \"Deadly Women\" in 2010, and was the subject of Bob Mitchell's book 'The Class Project: How to Kill a Mother: The True Story of Canada's Infamous Bathtub Girls'. In 2014, a crime drama, Perfect Sisters, was released, which was additionally based on the murder of Linda Andersen.\nAccording to police reports, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen, aged 16 and 15 respectively, had become irritated of their mother \"wasting. money on alcohol\". Linda also had abusive relationships with men which also caused unrest for the girls. They were also unhappy that their friends had \"better things like swimming pools and clothes\". Because of their discontent, the sisters began to search on the Internet for ways to kill their mother. Elizabeth and Sandra Andersen believed that by killing their mother, they would be entitled to insurance money. This compensation, the sisters resolved, would be spent on a trip to Europe with their friends as well as a large house, with a backyard filled with marijuana. The sisters decided to drown Linda Andersen, because they believed it would be \"fast and spectacular\".\nAfter formulating a murder plan, Elizabeth and Sandra Andersen informed their friends, who both encouraged the sisters and laughed at the idea of murdering Linda Andersen.\nMurder.\nDuring lunch time on January 18 2003, Sandra and Elizabeth began giving their mother liquor in order to get her drunk. Their plan was to make Linda fully inebriated so that she could not resist their attack. Linda was also given pain killers by her daughters, to slow down her heartbeat. Sandra and Elizabeth then waited for the drugs to work. While waiting, the sisters communicated with their friends online, one of whom ended their conversation with the phrase \"well good luck - wear gloves\".\nSandra and Elizabeth Andersen filled the family bathtub with water and took Linda Andersen to the bathroom. Linda had difficulty getting into the bathtub, because of the mixture of vodka and pills she had been given. After putting gloves on, Sandra and Elizabeth gave their mother a massage. Within minutes, according to police reports, Sandra Andersen instructed her mother to lay on her stomach so that she could scrub her back. Sandra Andersen instantly pulled her mother's head down and did not let go. After four minutes, Sandra Andersen released her mother's head and found Linda Andersen to be dead. After having killed their mother, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen went with their friends to a nearby restaurant where they celebrated their victory. Later that night, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen called 9-1-1 and informed them that they had found their mother laying in the bathtub.\nThe 9-1-1 operator told Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen to take their mother out of the bathtub and to perform CPR. The Andersen sisters cried over the phone, telling the operator that Linda Andersen could not be resuscitated. When police arrived, they believed Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen's story.\nArrest.\nA year after the murder, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen held a party. Sandra, who was drunk, told a male at the party about the murder of Linda Andersen that both she and Elizabeth had committed. She then told a guy that liked her that her mothers death might have not been an accident. He felt suspicious which later led him to the police to report what he was told. Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen were subsequently arrested, tried and sentenced to 10 years in prison. They were released in 2009 and 2010 respectively.\nLife after.\nThe older sister, Sandra Andersen, was released to a halfway house in 2009, whilst the younger sister, Elizabeth Andersen, was released a year later. The girls' father unsuccessfully attempted to have Elizabeth Andersen released earlier so that she could complete her sentence under house arrest in their hometown. Since both Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen were under the age of 18 at the time of the murder, their identities have been protected under Canadian law. After release, Sandra Andersen was accepted to the University of Waterloo with a $2000 scholarship; Elizabeth Andersen traveled to Ottawa with the intention of applying to university.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":32},{"uri":"Mississauga","surface_form":"Mississauga","offset":125},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":138},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":147},{"uri":"Pseudonym","surface_form":"aliases","offset":185},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":278},{"uri":"Halfway_house","surface_form":"halfway house","offset":383},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":671},{"uri":"Perfect_Sisters","surface_form":"Perfect Sisters","offset":874},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1588},{"uri":"Marijuana","surface_form":"marijuana","offset":1668},{"uri":"Drown","surface_form":"drown","offset":1702},{"uri":"Spectacular","surface_form":"spectacular","offset":1768},{"uri":"Analgesic","surface_form":"pain killers","offset":2191},{"uri":"Heartbeat","surface_form":"heartbeat","offset":2239},{"uri":"Vodka","surface_form":"vodka","offset":2639},{"uri":"Massage","surface_form":"massage","offset":2741},{"uri":"9-1-1","surface_form":"9-1-1","offset":3268},{"uri":"9-1-1","surface_form":"9-1-1","offset":3352},{"uri":"CPR","surface_form":"CPR","offset":3457},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":4636},{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":4781}]}
