{"id":352722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section","text":"In geometry, when a cone and a plane intersect, a conic section results.\nThere are three different types of sections, the parabola, the hyperbola and the ellipse. The circle is a special case of an ellipse. Sometimes the circle is mentioned as a fourth type, because calculating with a circle is easier than with an ellipse, most of the time.\nThe conic sections are known at least since 200 BC, when Apollonius of Perga (~262 BC to ~190 BC) studied of their properties. They came to more attention when mathematicians discovered that the solutions of the two-body problem were conic sections.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Cone","surface_form":"cone","offset":20},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":31},{"uri":"Parabola","surface_form":"parabola","offset":122},{"uri":"Hyperbola","surface_form":"hyperbola","offset":136},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"ellipse","offset":154},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":167},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":391},{"uri":"Apollonius_of_Perga","surface_form":"Apollonius of Perga","offset":400},{"uri":"Two-body_problem","surface_form":"two-body problem","offset":555}]}
