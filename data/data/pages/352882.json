It is also home to the all Volkswagen club event, 25 Hours of Spa, run by the Uniroyal Fun Cup. It is one of the most challenging race tracks in the world. This is mainly because of its fast, hilly and twisty nature. Spa is a favourite circuit of many racing drivers and fans.\nThe track was designed in 1920 by Jules de Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem. The first car race was held at the circuit in 1922. 1924 was the first running of the now famous 24 Hours of Francorchamps race. The circuit was first used for Grand Prix racing in 1925.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":53},{"uri":"Belgian_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Belgian Grand Prix","offset":65},{"uri":"Spa_24_Hours","surface_form":"Spa 24 Hours","offset":92},{"uri":"1000_km_Spa","surface_form":"1000 km Spa","offset":109},{"uri":"Uniroyal_Fun_Cup","surface_form":"Uniroyal Fun Cup","offset":216},{"uri":"Race_track","surface_form":"race track","offset":268},{"uri":"Jules_de_Their","surface_form":"Jules de Their","offset":449},{"uri":"Henri_Langlois_Van_Ophem","surface_form":"Henri Langlois Van Ophem","offset":468},{"uri":"Spa_24_Hours","surface_form":"24 Hours of Francorchamps","offset":591},{"uri":"Grand_Prix_motor_racing","surface_form":"Grand Prix","offset":654}]}
