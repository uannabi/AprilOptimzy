{"id":352919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_rattlesnake","text":"The timber rattlesnake (\"Crotalus horridus\") is a species of venomous Pit vipers. It lives in eastern United States of America. There are no subspecies currently recognized. It is the 2nd largest venomous snake found in the eastern United States.\nDescription.\nAdults usually grow up to the length of 91\u2013152\u00A0cm (35.8-59.8\u00A0in). The longest to be reported was 189.2\u00A0cm (74.5\u00A0in) long. The large timber rattlesnakes weigh about 4.5\u00A0kg (9.9 Ib), but most weigh about 580-900 g (20-32\u00A0oz). Their scales are usually yellowish-brown or gray with dark brown or black stripes.\nWhere they live.\nThey are found in woodlands and forests of eastern United States of America, from southern Minnesota and southern New Hampshire, south to east Texas and north Florida. During the summer pregnant females prefer open, rocky ledges, where the temperature is higher, while males and non-pregnant females spend more time in cooler woodlands with a closed forest canopy. Females usually bask in the sun before having babies in open rocky areas, known as \"basking knolls\". In the winter Timber Rattlesnakes hibernate in dens and caves.\nFeeding.\nThey mainly eat small mammals but they also eat birds, frogs, and other snakes like rattlesnakes. The most common snake they eat is the garter snake.\nVenom.\nThe timber rattlesnake is one of North America's most dangerous snakes. Before biting, they usually warn people by shaking their rattle at the end of their tail.\nIts venom contains a neurotoxin known as canebrake toxin, and is a phospholipase A2. It also contains a small basic peptide that works as a myotoxin, a fibrinogen-clotting enzyme that can produce defibrination syndrome, and a bradykinin-releasing enzyme.\nCroFab antivenom is used to treat envenomations from the timber rattlesnake.\nConservation status.\nThe timber rattlesnake is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\nThe timber rattlesnake is endangered in New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Hampshire, Indiana, and Ohio. It is threatened in New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas.\nTimber rattlesnakes are extinct in Maine and Rhode Island. Only one population remains in New Hampshire. They are protected in many of the Appalachian states but their populations are still declining.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venomous","offset":61},{"uri":"Pit_viper","surface_form":"Pit viper","offset":70},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":102},{"uri":"Venomous_snake","surface_form":"venomous snake","offset":196},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":232},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":602},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":616},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":635},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":675},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":698},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":727},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":743},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":770},{"uri":"Canopy","surface_form":"canopy","offset":941},{"uri":"Hibernate","surface_form":"hibernate","offset":1084},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":1144},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1170},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":1177},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":1194},{"uri":"Rattlesnake","surface_form":"rattlesnake","offset":1206},{"uri":"Garter_snake","surface_form":"garter snake","offset":1258},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1312},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snakes","offset":1343},{"uri":"Venom","surface_form":"venom","offset":1445},{"uri":"Neurotoxin","surface_form":"neurotoxin","offset":1462},{"uri":"Phospholipase_A2","surface_form":"phospholipase A2","offset":1508},{"uri":"Peptide","surface_form":"peptide","offset":1557},{"uri":"Myotoxin","surface_form":"myotoxin","offset":1581},{"uri":"Fibrinogen","surface_form":"fibrinogen","offset":1593},{"uri":"Coagulation","surface_form":"clotting","offset":1604},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":1613},{"uri":"Defibrination_syndrome","surface_form":"defibrination syndrome","offset":1637},{"uri":"Bradykinin","surface_form":"bradykinin","offset":1667},{"uri":"CroFab","surface_form":"CroFab","offset":1696},{"uri":"Antivenom","surface_form":"antivenom","offset":1703},{"uri":"Envenomation","surface_form":"envenomations","offset":1730},{"uri":"Least_concern","surface_form":"least concern","offset":1834},{"uri":"IUCN_Red_List","surface_form":"IUCN Red List","offset":1855},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":1896},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1910},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":1922},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":1931},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":1946},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":1956},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":1971},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":1984},{"uri":"Threatened_species","surface_form":"threatened","offset":1996},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":2010},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":2020},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":2033},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":2043},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":2058},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":2089},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":2100},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":2110},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":2155},{"uri":"Appalachia","surface_form":"Appalachian states","offset":2204}]}
