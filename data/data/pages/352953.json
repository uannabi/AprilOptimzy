{"id":352953,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewinder","text":"The Sidewinder rattlesnake (\"Crotalus cerastes\"), also known as the \"Horned Rattlesnake\", is a species of venomous pit viper. There are three subspecies. It is called a sidewinder because it uses sidewinding to move across sand.\nDescription.\nThe Sidewinder rattlesnake is a small species of snake, with adults measuring to about long. The females are larger than the males, which is unusual for most snakes. The color of this snake is usually cream or yellowish-brown, and the belly is white colored.\nWhere it lives.\nIn the southwestern United States of America it can be found in desert regions of eastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and western Arizona. In northwestern Mexico, it can be found in western Sonora and eastern Baja California.\nBehavior.\nThe Sidewinder is nocturnal in hot months and diurnal in cooler months. The Sidewinder uses its tail to attract lizards which it eats, but when it becomes an adult it stops eating lizards and starts eating desert rodents.\nReproduction.\nA female Sidewinder Rattlesnake gives birth to around 5 to 18 young at a time. For 7\u201310 days the young stay with their mother in a burrow, they then shed for the first time and then leave the burrow. Sidewinders mature at the age of 2 or 3, then mate in April and May and sometimes in the fall. The female then has its 5-18 babies in the late summer. These babies are born 6-8 inches long. Males live a little bit longer than females, males live to about 13 years old and females about 11 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venomous","offset":106},{"uri":"Pit_viper","surface_form":"pit viper","offset":115},{"uri":"Sidewinding","surface_form":"sidewinding","offset":196},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":291},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":537},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":581},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":607},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":628},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":649},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":666},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":691},{"uri":"Sonora","surface_form":"Sonora","offset":726},{"uri":"Baja_California_(state)","surface_form":"Baja California","offset":745},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":790},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":818},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":884},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":985},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"fall","offset":1297},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":1351}]}
