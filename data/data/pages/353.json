{"id":353,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body","text":"e=\"preserve\">The human body is the body of a person. It is the physical structure of a person.\nThe body is a thing that can be hurt or killed. Its functions are stopped by death. You need your muscles and your joints to move.\nStudy of the human body.\nSome people study the human body. They look at where it is different from or the same as other animals' bodies. These animals can be alive today. Or they can be extinct animals like other hominids. (Hominids are primates that are close to humans. Neanderthals and \"Homo erectus\" were hominids.) Some people study how the human body works and lives in its environment. Some people study what people think about their body. Artists study how to draw or paint the human body.\nFields of study.\nVarious organ systems give the body the ability to live and do things.\nThe human body and other animals.\nThe human body is like other animals. The skeleton, muscles and other parts are very much like those of other primates. Our body is also like other mammals, and somewhat like other vertebrates. DNA differences follow a similar pattern. The human genome is closer to that of other primates than to other vertebrates, and closest to chimpanzee.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":35},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":45},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":172},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"study","offset":263},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":346},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":412},{"uri":"Hominid","surface_form":"hominid","offset":439},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":463},{"uri":"Neanderthal","surface_form":"Neanderthal","offset":498},{"uri":"Homo_erectus","surface_form":"Homo erectus","offset":516},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":606},{"uri":"Organ_system","surface_form":"organ system","offset":749},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":888},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":898},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":956},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":994},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":1027},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":1040},{"uri":"Human_genome","surface_form":"human genome","offset":1086},{"uri":"Chimpanzee","surface_form":"chimpanzee","offset":1177}]}
