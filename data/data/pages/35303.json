{"id":35303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle","text":"In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1. The equation of the unit circle is formula_1. The unit circle is centered at the Origin, or coordinates (0,0). It is often used in Trigonometry.\nTrigonometric functions in the unit circle.\nIn a unit circle, where formula_1 is the angle desired, formula_1 and formula_1 can be defined as formula_1 and formula_1. Using the function of the unit circle, formula_1, another equation for the unit circle is found, formula_1. When working with trigonometric functions, it is mainly useful to use angles with measures between 0 and formula_1 radians, or 0 through 90 degrees. It is possible to have higher angles than that, however. Using the unit circle, two identities can be found: formula_1 and formula_1 for any integer formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":35},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":49},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":66},{"uri":"Trigonometry","surface_form":"Trigonometry","offset":193},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":772}]}
