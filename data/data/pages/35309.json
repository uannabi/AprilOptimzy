However, this was not possible. So a C-54 was converted into a civil aircraft and repainted with the \"El Al\" logo in order to bring back the President to Israel.\nEl Al became the official Israeli airline in 1948. The first international flight took place in 1949. It flew from Tel Aviv to Paris.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":26},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":37},{"uri":"Flag_carrier","surface_form":"flag carrier","offset":65},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":104},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":112},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":118},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":129},{"uri":"Airline_hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":190},{"uri":"Ben_Gurion_International_Airport","surface_form":"Ben Gurion International Airport","offset":195},{"uri":"Tel_Aviv","surface_form":"Tel Aviv","offset":231},{"uri":"Geneva","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":281},{"uri":"President_of_Israel","surface_form":"President of Israel","offset":299},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":361},{"uri":"C-54","surface_form":"C-54","offset":408},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":660}]}
