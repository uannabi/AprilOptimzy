{"id":353159,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_people","text":"Danish people or Danes are the nation and ethnic group that is born in Denmark, and who speak Danish.\nThe first mention of Danes within the Danish territory is on the Jelling Rune Stone which mentions how Harald Bluetooth converted the Danes to Christianity in the 10th century. Denmark has been continuously inhabited since this period and although much cultural and ethnic influence and immigration from all over the world has entered Denmark since then, Danes tend to see themselves as ethnic descendents of the early Danes mentioned in the sources.\nDemography.\nAccording to the Danish statistics institute, approximately five million people of Danish origin live in Denmark today. In this context \"Danish origin\" is defined as being born to parents who are Danish citizens, and the number is arrived at by subtracting from the total population (5,564,249) those who are born abroad to non-citizens who are themselves born abroad (called immigrants), and those who are born in Denmark to parents who are either immigrants or who have foreign citizenship.\nDanish citizenship is granted to anyone who has one parent of Danish citizenship, whether the child is born in or outside of Denmark. Citizens of Greenland and the Faroe islands are considered Danish citizens for all purposes. Those who do not achieve Danish citizenship by birth (or by Adoption) can only receive Danish citizenship through decree of law. Danish citizenship is automatically lost if one applies for foreign citizenship or when a 22 year old child of Danish citizens has never lived in Denmark and has not formally applied for Danish citizenship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":31},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":42},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":71},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":94},{"uri":"Harald_Bluetooth","surface_form":"Harald Bluetooth","offset":205},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":389},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":1204},{"uri":"Faroe_islands","surface_form":"Faroe islands","offset":1222},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1409}]}
