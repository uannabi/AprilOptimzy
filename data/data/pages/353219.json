There are sources that date the namimg in 1912 after Stanley H. Mitchell, Secretary-Treasurer of Alpine Club of Canada.\nThe peak is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 93. Stanley Glacier on the northeast face of the peak can be seen up close by following a hiking trail into a hanging valley between the peak and a southern outlier of Storm Mountain.\nStanley Peak can be ascended from a scrambling route by late summer but involves much route-finding among the many ledges and gullies on the north face. Climbing routes (UIAA III) travel the north and northeast faces.\nOther BC peaks.\nThere are another two peaks in British Columbia called Stanley Peak. One is 2,935 m high, located at the Squamish-Lillooet regional district (), 24\u00A0km north-west from Keyhole Falls and 62\u00A0km west from Gold Bridge.\nThe other is 2,030 m high, in the Stikine region () (90\u00A0km north-west from Skagway, Alaska).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":31},{"uri":"Ball_Range","surface_form":"Ball Range","offset":67},{"uri":"Kootenay_National_Park","surface_form":"Kootenay National Park","offset":110},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":146},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":163},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":182},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":248},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":256},{"uri":"Edward_Whymper","surface_form":"Edward Whymper","offset":265},{"uri":"Frederick_Stanley","surface_form":"Frederick Stanley","offset":287},{"uri":"Earl","surface_form":"Earl","offset":311},{"uri":"Derby","surface_form":"Derby","offset":319},{"uri":"Stanley_H._Mitchell","surface_form":"Stanley H.
