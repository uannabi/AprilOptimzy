{"id":353238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula","text":"The Sinai Peninsula or Sinai (\"S\u012Bn\u0101\"), is a triangular peninsula in Egypt. It is about in area. It is between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. This is because the Sinai is known as a land bridge between the two continents of Africa and Asia. There are approximately 500,000 people living there. Egyptians refer to it as the \"Land of Fayrouz\", based on the Ancient Egyptian \"Dumafkat\".\nThere have been several battles in the region. The Sinai has been under the rule by Egyptian governments, including the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, and the modern Egyptian republic. It was also controlled by the Ottoman Empire, and the United Kingdom from 1882 to 1956. Israel invaded and took over Sinai during the 1956 Suez Crisis (known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression) and during the 1967 Six Day War. On October 6, 1973, Egypt began the October War to allow the Sinai to be a free nation.\nIn 1982, after the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty of 1979, Israel left Sinai. Since Israel's departure, the region became a tourist destination. This was because of its natural setting, their coral reefs, and biblical history. Mount Sinai is a sacred place in Abrahamic religion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangular","offset":44},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":55},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":68},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":114},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":153},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":228},{"uri":"Land_bridge","surface_form":"land bridge","offset":274},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":302},{"uri":"Ancient_Egyptian","surface_form":"Ancient Egyptian","offset":447},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":500},{"uri":"Egypt_government","surface_form":"Egyptian governments","offset":560},{"uri":"Ayyubids","surface_form":"Ayyubids","offset":596},{"uri":"Mamluks","surface_form":"Mamluks","offset":610},{"uri":"Muhammad_Ali_Dynasty","surface_form":"Muhammad Ali Dynasty","offset":623},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":709},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":733},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":767},{"uri":"Suez_Crisis","surface_form":"Suez Crisis","offset":818},{"uri":"Tripartite_Aggression","surface_form":"Tripartite Aggression","offset":853},{"uri":"Six_Day_War","surface_form":"Six Day War","offset":896},{"uri":"October_War","surface_form":"October War","offset":945},{"uri":"Free_country","surface_form":"free nation","offset":984},{"uri":"Israel-Egypt_Peace_Treaty","surface_form":"Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty","offset":1016},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist destination","offset":1116},{"uri":"Coral_reefs","surface_form":"coral reefs","offset":1184},{"uri":"Biblical_studies","surface_form":"biblical history","offset":1201},{"uri":"Biblical_Mount_Sinai","surface_form":"Mount Sinai","offset":1219},{"uri":"Sacred","surface_form":"sacred","offset":1236},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religion","offset":1252}]}
