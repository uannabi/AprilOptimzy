It was published in the \"New York Native\". The newspaper is a gay daily newspaper for the LGBT community. It was believed to be one of the first major essays to be written about the AIDS crisis. The essay begins with the HIV death toll at the time. Many homosexuals did not like the essay. This was because the essay blamed them for the wide spread of the disease. Many others did not like it because Kramer was accused of being a 'self-hating gay man'. This was because of his novel \"Faggots\" which gave negative views on casual and anonymous sex.\nThe essay helped influence much of queer writing. It also helped Kramer's reputation as an gay rights advocate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essay","offset":38},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":64},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":77},{"uri":"Larry_Kramer","surface_form":"Larry Kramer","offset":88},{"uri":"New_York_Native","surface_form":"New York Native","offset":135},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":172},{"uri":"LGBT_community","surface_form":"LGBT community","offset":200},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS crisis","offset":292},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":331},{"uri":"Toll","surface_form":"death toll","offset":335},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":588},{"uri":"Faggots_(novel)","surface_form":"Faggots","offset":595},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":654},{"uri":"LGBT_rights","surface_form":"gay rights advocate","offset":750}]}
