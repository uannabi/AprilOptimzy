{"id":353273,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Steve","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Adam and Steve\" is a phrase that was created from a conservative Christian slogan \"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve\". It was created to summarize Judeo-Christian bible-based arguments against homosexual practices or homosexuality. The slogan also expresses that heterosexuality is the natural way of life for humanity.\nThe phrase appeared on a protest sign as early as 1977. It was mentioned in a \"New York Times\" report about a November 19 rally in Houston, Texas that year. In 1979, Jerry Falwell helped the phrase to become popular. This happened after a press conference he held for \"Christianity Today\". Many LGBT people have made movies and plays based on the phrase. Paul Rudnick wrote the play \"The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told\", which has a gay couple named Adam and Steve. In 2005, a gay movie was released with the title \"Adam & Steve\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"phrase","offset":35},{"uri":"Conservative","surface_form":"conservative","offset":66},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":79},{"uri":"Slogan","surface_form":"slogan","offset":89},{"uri":"Adam_and_Eve","surface_form":"Adam and Eve","offset":106},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judeo","offset":169},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":175},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"bible-based","offset":185},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":215},{"uri":"Heterosexuality","surface_form":"heterosexuality","offset":285},{"uri":"Humanity","surface_form":"humanity","offset":332},{"uri":"Protest_sign","surface_form":"protest sign","offset":367},{"uri":"New_York_Times","surface_form":"New York Times","offset":421},{"uri":"Rally","surface_form":"rally","offset":464},{"uri":"Houston%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Houston, Texas","offset":473},{"uri":"Jerry_Falwell","surface_form":"Jerry Falwell","offset":508},{"uri":"Christianity_Today","surface_form":"Christianity Today","offset":611},{"uri":"Paul_Rudnick","surface_form":"Paul Rudnick","offset":697},{"uri":"The_Most_Fabulous_Story_Ever_Told","surface_form":"The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told","offset":726},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":822},{"uri":"Adam_%26amp%3B_Steve_(movie)","surface_form":"Adam & Steve","offset":857}]}
