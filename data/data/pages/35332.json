He is the current host of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\". He was the host of \"The Colbert Report\" on Comedy Central from 2005 through 2014.

He was the youngest of eleven children in a Catholic family, and went to Northwestern University.\n\"The Colbert Report\".\nOn \"The Colbert Report\" (which he pronounces \"col-BEAR re-POAR\" to make the words sound the same), he pretends to be a right-wing talk show host. He likes to ask his guests very embarrassing questions that make it seem that he is a serious far right-wing conservative who is also not very smart. His TV personality centers on the idea that if enough people believe something, it will be true. This is largely based on conservative host Bill O'Reilly. He was granted a Super PAC for the South Carolina Republican Party primaries in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.\nMany famous American politicians and people in the news media agree to appear on his show because it is very popular.
