{"id":353342,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Ya_Collar","text":"\"Pop Ya Collar\" is a song by American singer Usher. It became a lead single from \"8701\" (2001). The song was leaked on the Internet as part of \"All About U\", an unreleased album by Usher.\nThe song reached number 60 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. It was more successful in the United Kingdom where it reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was about an upturned collar. It then became a popular culture \"buzzword\" at the time.\nThe catchphrase (or slang) helped the song to be released by other artists. These include \"Pop Yo Collar\" by MC Hammer (2000) and \"Poppin' My Collar\" by Three 6 Mafia (2006). However, the word originally came from the Bay Area artist E-40. Hammer's version (featuring Wee Wee) helped make \"The Phat Daddy Pop\", \"In Pop Nito\", \"River Pop\", \"Deliver The Pop\" and \"Pop'n It Up\" dance moves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Usher","surface_form":"Usher","offset":45},{"uri":"Lead_single","surface_form":"lead single","offset":64},{"uri":"8701","surface_form":"8701","offset":82},{"uri":"Leak_(music)","surface_form":"leaked","offset":109},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":222},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":279},{"uri":"UK_Singles_Chart","surface_form":"UK Singles Chart","offset":329},{"uri":"Collar","surface_form":"collar","offset":378},{"uri":"Popular_culture","surface_form":"popular culture","offset":403},{"uri":"Buzzword","surface_form":"buzzword","offset":420},{"uri":"Catchphrase","surface_form":"catchphrase","offset":447},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":463},{"uri":"Pop_Yo_Collar","surface_form":"Pop Yo Collar","offset":534},{"uri":"MC_Hammer","surface_form":"MC Hammer","offset":552},{"uri":"Poppin%27_My_Collar","surface_form":"Poppin' My Collar","offset":574},{"uri":"Three_6_Mafia","surface_form":"Three 6 Mafia","offset":596},{"uri":"Bay_Area","surface_form":"Bay Area","offset":661},{"uri":"E-40","surface_form":"E-40","offset":677},{"uri":"Wee_Wee","surface_form":"Wee Wee","offset":711},{"uri":"Dance_moves","surface_form":"dance moves","offset":818}]}
