He made major advances in the fields of probability theory and topology. Born in a Russian family in Tambov, he worked early in his career on intuitionistic logic, and Fourier series. He also worked on turbulence, classical mechanics, and information theory; and was a founder of algorithmic complexity theory which is often referred to as simply Kolmogorov complexity theory.\nKolmogorov worked at Moscow State University. He studied under Nikolai Luzin, earning his Ph.D. in 1929. In 1931 he became professor at this university. In 1939 he received the title of academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He died in Moscow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":115},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":122},{"uri":"Computer_scientist","surface_form":"computer scientist","offset":140},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":200},{"uri":"Topology","surface_form":"topology","offset":223},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russian","offset":243},{"uri":"Tambov","surface_form":"Tambov","offset":261},{"uri":"Intuitionistic_logic","surface_form":"intuitionistic logic","offset":302},{"uri":"Fourier_series","surface_form":"Fourier series","offset":328},{"uri":"Turbulence","surface_form":"turbulence","offset":362},{"uri":"Classical_mechanics","surface_form":"classical mechanics","offset":374},{"uri":"Information_theory","surface_form":"information theory","offset":399},{"uri":"Algorithmic_complexity_theory","surface_form":"algorithmic complexity theory","offset":440},{"uri":"Kolmogorov_complexity","surface_form":"Kolmogorov complexity theory","offset":507},{"uri":"Moscow_State_University","surface_form":"Moscow State University","offset":558},{"uri":"Nikolai_Luzin","surface_form":"Nikolai Luzin","offset":600},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":627},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":660},{"uri":"Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"USSR Academy of Sciences","offset":742},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":779}]}
