{"id":3538,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_scale","text":"The Richter scale is a scale of numbers used to tell the power (or magnitude) of earthquakes. Charles Richter developed the Richter Scale in 1935. His scale worked like a seismogram, measured by a particular type of \"seismometer\" at a distance of 100 kilometers (62 mi) from the earthquake.\nEarthquakes 4.5 or higher on the Richter scale can be measured all over the world. An earthquake a size that scores 3.0 is ten times the amplitude of one that scores 2.0. The energy that is released increases by a factor of about 32.\nEvery increase of 1 on the Richter scale corresponds to an increase in amplitude by a factor of 10 so therefore, it is a logarithmic scale.\nThe earthquake with the biggest recorded magnitude was the Great Chilean Earthquake. It had a magnitude of 9.5 on the Richter scale and occurred in 1960. Around 6,000 people died because of the earthquake. No earthquake has ever hit 10+ on the Richter Scale.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":81},{"uri":"Charles_Richter","surface_form":"Charles Richter","offset":94},{"uri":"Seismogram","surface_form":"seismogram","offset":171},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":367},{"uri":"Great_Chilean_Earthquake","surface_form":"Great Chilean Earthquake","offset":724}]}
