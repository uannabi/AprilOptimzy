{"id":353862,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_songs","text":"Nazi songs were songs made for the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Germany.\nSome songs used by the Nazis are very old, and so these songs are often thought of as to be a Nazi song. An example would be \"Deutschlandlied\", which was written in 1841. The Nazis used the \"Deutschlandlied\" with the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\". Same with the song \"Die Wacht am Rhein\", which at that time was almost 100 years old.\nNow in Germany, it is illegal to sing any of these songs, and if you do, the punishment might by up to 3 years in jail.\nHorst-Wessel-Lied.\nThe \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", also known as \"Die Fahne Hoch\" (The flag on high), was the anthem of the Nazi Party. The song was made by Horst Wessel, a SA leader, who was killed by a member of the Communist Party of Germany. The song, as with many Nazi songs, is banned in Germany.\nEs zittern die morschen Knochen.\n\"Es zittern die morschen Knochen\" was made by Hans Baumann, was a very popular Nazi song. The song was the official song of the Hitler Youth: which is why there are some attacks on the old people in the song. Many Germans know some of the song, but a lot don't know the full song.\nBelow is the order of how the full song would be sung.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"NSDAP","surface_form":"NSDAP","offset":47},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":57},{"uri":"Deutschlandlied","surface_form":"Deutschlandlied","offset":192},{"uri":"Horst-Wessel-Lied","surface_form":"Horst-Wessel-Lied","offset":284},{"uri":"Die_Wacht_am_Rhein","surface_form":"Die Wacht am Rhein","offset":324},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":397},{"uri":"Jail","surface_form":"jail","offset":504},{"uri":"Horst-Wessel-Lied","surface_form":"Horst-Wessel-Lied","offset":534},{"uri":"Horst-Wessel-Lied","surface_form":"Die Fahne Hoch","offset":569},{"uri":"Nazi_Party","surface_form":"Nazi Party","offset":627},{"uri":"Horst_Wessel","surface_form":"Horst Wessel","offset":660},{"uri":"Sturmabteilung","surface_form":"SA","offset":676},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Communist Party of Germany","offset":721},{"uri":"Hans_Baumann_(writer)","surface_form":"Hans Baumann","offset":885}]}
