It can have a few pure black spots on its belly and have orange with an hint of green. There are less than 10,000 Humboldt penguins in the wild. They are found in Chile and Peru.\nThey drink sea water and their favourite food is small fish. A female Humboldt penguin can weigh up to 4.5kg and the male can weigh up to 6kg. Their bodies are adapted to life in water and most Humboldt penguins can live up to 20 years. They get their name from a famous Prussian explorer, Alexander von Humboldt.\nThey have well dug burrows underground. In the past 100 years their droppings have been used as garden fertiliser. This dung is called \u201Cguano\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":234},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":244},{"uri":"Prussian","surface_form":"Prussian","offset":521},{"uri":"Alexander_von_Humboldt","surface_form":"Alexander von Humboldt","offset":540},{"uri":"Fertiliser","surface_form":"fertiliser","offset":667},{"uri":"Guano","surface_form":"guano","offset":700}]}
