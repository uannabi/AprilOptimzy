{"id":353901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-eyed_penguin","text":"The yellow-eyed penguin (\"Megadyptes antipodes\"), also known as the hoiho or tarakara, is an endangered species of penguin, and the third largest penguin in the world. The penguin gets its name from the yellow stripes on its head. They live and breed on the sea shore of New Zealand and some also in the Antarctic islands in the south. They have a high pitched call which can be heard very clearly.\nYellow-eyed penguins eat small to medium sized fish, red cod and squid.\nThey make their nests out of twigs, grass and leaves, carefully formed into a bowl shape. The chicks take 39 to 51 days to hatch and both parents share keeping the eggs warm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Penguin","surface_form":"penguin","offset":146},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":271},{"uri":"Antarctic","surface_form":"Antarctic","offset":304},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":464}]}
