{"id":3540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_the_Moon","text":"The phases of the Moon are the different ways the Moon looks from Earth over about a month.\nAs the Moon orbits around the Earth, the half of the Moon that faces the Sun will be lit up. The different shapes of the lit portion of the Moon that can be seen from Earth are known as phases of the Moon. Each phase repeats itself every 29.5 days.\nThe same half of the Moon always faces the Earth, because of tidal locking. So the phases will always occur over the same half of the Moon's surface.\nA phase is an angle of the moon to the earth so it appears differently every day.\nPhases.\nThe moon goes through 8 major phases.\nSuper Pink Moon.\nA supermoon or [https://amazingfact.co/spacefacts/super-pink-moon-2020/ Super Pink Moon] takes place when moon's orbit is at its closest to the Earth. Supermoon take place each year between March and May. As Moon is exceptionally close to Earth; full Moon appears up to 7% larger and 15% brighter than a typical full moon. Traditionally any full moon that occurred in April was called a pink moon because it marked the blooming of Moss pink a wildflower.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":50},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":66},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":85},{"uri":"Tidal_locking","surface_form":"tidal locking","offset":402}]}
