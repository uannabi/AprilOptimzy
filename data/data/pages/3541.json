{"id":3541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere","text":"A sphere is a shape in space that is like the surface of a ball. Most of the time, the terms ball and sphere are used as the same. But in mathematics, the precise (exact) definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically located at a fixed length called radius of the sphere.\nExamples of these are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls.\nA sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle.\nVolume.\nThe volume (V) of a sphere is given by the following formula\nwhere \"r\" is the radius of the sphere.\nSurface area.\nThe surface area (A) of a sphere is given by the following formula\nwhere \"r\" is the radius of the sphere.\nEquation of a sphere.\nformula_1\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":14},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":46},{"uri":"Ball","surface_form":"ball","offset":59},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":138}]}
