{"id":354126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder","text":"Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder in which a person fails to conform with socially accepted behavior. People with this disorder often disregard social norms or the rights of other people. Other names for the condition are sociopathy and dissocial personality disorder (DPD). However, because of the many definitions of sociopathy, that word is no longer used in a medical context.\nThe ASPD pattern begins in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. People with ASPD have no conscience or sense of morality, although the large majority know right from wrong. Those with ASPD often commit crimes, have legal problems, and show behavior that is aggressive and, in the large majority of cases, impulsive, reckless and destructive. About three percent of men and one percent of women have ASPD.\nDSM-IV criteria.\nB. To be diagnosed with ASPD, the person must be at least 18 years old.\nC. By age 15, he or she seemed to exhibit conduct disorder.\nD. The person's antisocial behavior is not caused by schizophrenia or a manic episode.\nASPD vs. psychopathy.\nASPD is not the same as psychopathy. The two are similar; people with both conditions may show similar behaviors. However, they are diagnosed differently. Using the DSM criteria, a diagnosis of ASPD is based on a person's behaviors. No official, agreed-upon definition or set of diagnostic criteria exists for psychopathy, but most tools that measure psychopathy focus on personality characteristics as well as behaviors.\nMost people who score highly on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R), the most popular measure of psychopathy, also qualify for ASPD. However, people with ASPD do not routinely score high on the PCL-R. This suggests that most psychopaths qualify for ASPD, but most people with ASPD do not qualify as psychopaths. The diagnosis of ASPD covers most psychopaths, as well as many more people who are not psychopaths. The diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners as the diagnosis of psychopathy does.\nSubtypes.\nMixed types also occur. There is a debate on the subtypes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Personality_disorder","surface_form":"personality disorder","offset":44},{"uri":"Adolescence","surface_form":"adolescence","offset":452},{"uri":"Conscience","surface_form":"conscience","offset":519},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"morality","offset":542},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":632},{"uri":"Aggression","surface_form":"aggressive","offset":687},{"uri":"Impulse","surface_form":"impulsive","offset":735},{"uri":"Conduct_disorder","surface_form":"conduct disorder","offset":966},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":1037},{"uri":"Mania","surface_form":"manic episode","offset":1056},{"uri":"Psychopathy","surface_form":"psychopathy","offset":1117}]}
