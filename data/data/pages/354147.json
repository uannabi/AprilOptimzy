{"id":354147,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allometry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape. In particular, it refers to the rate of growth of one part of the body compared to other parts. In most cases, the relative size of body parts changes as the body grows. Most allometric relationships are adaptive. For example, organs which depend on their surface area (such as the intestine) grow faster as the body weight increases.\nAlso, there are changes in allometry as a clade evolves. Allometry is an important way to describe changes in gross morphology (body shape) during evolution. Changes in time of development in an evolutionary series or clade are very common. The trend is known as heterochrony.\nwhere formula_1 is the scaling exponent of the law.\nOn being the right size.\nMany of his examples are based on the square-cube law. If an animal's length is doubled, its surface area will be squared and its weight cubed. This alone causes allometric changes in any evolutionary lineage where successive species get larger of smaller. There are many such lineages.\nThe bigger an animal gets, the more would they have to change their physical shape, but the weaker they would become.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":72},{"uri":"Growth","surface_form":"growth","offset":119},{"uri":"Adaptive","surface_form":"adaptive","offset":283},{"uri":"Intestine","surface_form":"intestine","offset":361},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":456},{"uri":"Morphology","surface_form":"morphology","offset":530},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":561},{"uri":"Heterochrony","surface_form":"heterochrony","offset":677}]}
