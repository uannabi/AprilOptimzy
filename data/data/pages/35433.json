{"id":35433,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_weapon","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A biological weapon is a weapon that delivers toxins or pathogens (like bacteria or viruses), with the goal of making people sick or killing them. Biological weapons are also called bio-weapons. Their use in war is called biological warfare.\nParts of a biological weapon.\nA biological weapon usually has two parts. The first is the biological agent (also called a bio-agent, biological threat agent, or biological warfare agent). This is the pathogen that is meant to make people sick. The second is the delivery system - how the biological agent is going to get to and expose the people it is supposed to infect.\nSome bio-agents can be \"weaponized\" - changed to make them more dangerous. For example, sometimes scientists can change a pathogen's genes so the pathogen is deadlier, and so it will not be killed by usual antidotes or treatments. Some bio-agents can be changed so they are easier to store, spread, or use as weapons.\nAs of 2016, there are more than 1,200 different kinds of bio-agents that could be made into weapons.\nExamples of biological agents.\nExamples of some biological agents and toxins are listed below. Experts have said that these pathogens could be used as biological weapons. A few already have been used, including anthrax, bubonic plague, smallpox, and ricin.\nExamples of biological weapons.\nA biological agent by itself is not enough to make a biological weapon. Neither is a delivery system by itself. A biological weapon has to have both: the bio-agent that is meant to make people sick, and a system to deliver that agent.\nHere are a few examples of biological weapons that have been used throughout history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":39},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":60},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":70},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":86},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":98},{"uri":"Biological_warfare","surface_form":"biological warfare","offset":236},{"uri":"Exposure_(toxicology)","surface_form":"expose","offset":584},{"uri":"Infectious_disease","surface_form":"infect","offset":620},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":726},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":761},{"uri":"Antidote","surface_form":"antidote","offset":834},{"uri":"Treatment","surface_form":"treatment","offset":847},{"uri":"Anthrax","surface_form":"anthrax","offset":1258},{"uri":"Bubonic_plague","surface_form":"bubonic plague","offset":1267},{"uri":"Smallpox","surface_form":"smallpox","offset":1283},{"uri":"Ricin","surface_form":"ricin","offset":1297}]}
