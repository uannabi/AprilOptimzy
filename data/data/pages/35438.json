When he comes back he is convinced he is the Son of God but nobody believes him. He turns day into night and everyone believes him then. He has a message from God to find the \"Third Message\". He finds from his friend July that the Third Message is her writings and one of her writings demands that he die. When Steve dies, he does not go to Heaven as it is destroyed, along with God, Satan and Hell. This is so humanity can work things out for itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":26},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":37},{"uri":"ITV","surface_form":"ITV","offset":52},{"uri":"Christopher_Eccleston","surface_form":"Christopher Eccleston","offset":66},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":172},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":232},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"Heaven","offset":521},{"uri":"Satan","surface_form":"Satan","offset":564},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":574}]}
