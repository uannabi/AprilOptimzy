{"id":354741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Mustard_Seed","text":"The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in three of the Gospels of the New Testament: Gospel of Matthew (13:31\u201332), Gospel of Mark (4:30\u201332), and Gospel of Luke (13:18\u201319). The differences among the three tellings are minor.\nIn Matthew and Luke, this parable is followed by the Parable of the Leaven. The Parable of the Leaven also has a theme about the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. A version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas 20.\nThe parable from Matthew reads: \"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.\" The parables from Mark and Luke are similar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gospels","surface_form":"Gospels","offset":93},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":108},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Matthew","surface_form":"Gospel of Matthew","offset":123},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Mark","surface_form":"Gospel of Mark","offset":153},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Luke","surface_form":"Gospel of Luke","offset":183},{"uri":"Parable_of_the_Leaven","surface_form":"Parable of the Leaven","offset":315},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Thomas","surface_form":"Gospel of Thomas","offset":498}]}
