{"id":354873,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptiliomorpha","text":"Reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians).\nUnfortunately, different experts have used the term in several different ways. It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians. It is best used for animals which lay cleidoic eggs, but are not synapsids. Otherwise precursors of reptiles (sauropsids) get lumped together with precursors of mammals (synapsids).\nIts only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from. But gradually, as with \"Seymouria\", it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":20},{"uri":"Amniotes","surface_form":"amniotes","offset":33},{"uri":"Tetrapods","surface_form":"tetrapods","offset":52},{"uri":"Lissamphibia","surface_form":"lissamphibia","offset":146},{"uri":"Cleidoic_egg","surface_form":"cleidoic egg","offset":335},{"uri":"Synapsids","surface_form":"synapsids","offset":362},{"uri":"Sauropsids","surface_form":"sauropsids","offset":407},{"uri":"Seymouria","surface_form":"Seymouria","offset":604}]}
