These settlements were created between roughly 8000 and 4600 BCE. In total, there are 31 settlements. The people who lived there were hunter-gatherers. They had also started agriculture. Bone points and a spatula have been discovered. They may have been used for making nets or textiles, along with various tools and containers shaped of shell; wood, bamboo, reeds, and bark are also believed to have been used in the tool industry.\nNo mummies have been found on the coast of Ecuador. The Las Vegas people had similarities with the people whose remains are preserved as the Chinchorro mummies of the north coast of Chile.They also lived at the same time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":99},{"uri":"Hunter-gatherer","surface_form":"hunter-gatherer","offset":242},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":282},{"uri":"Spatula","surface_form":"spatula","offset":313},{"uri":"Fishing_net","surface_form":"net","offset":378},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":386},{"uri":"Shell","surface_form":"shell","offset":446},{"uri":"Mummification","surface_form":"mummies","offset":544},{"uri":"Chinchorro_mummies","surface_form":"Chinchorro mummies","offset":682}]}
