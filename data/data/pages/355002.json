{"id":355002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib","text":"A rib is a bone that forms a structure around the thorax of vertebrates. This is known as the rib cage. Humans have 24 ribs, 12 on each side.\nIt is a common urban legend that male humans have one fewer pair of ribs than female humans. However, this is not true. This came from the Christian bible explaining the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":11},{"uri":"Thorax","surface_form":"thorax","offset":50},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":60},{"uri":"Rib_cage","surface_form":"rib cage","offset":94},{"uri":"Urban_legend","surface_form":"urban legend","offset":157},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":281},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"bible","offset":291},{"uri":"Eve","surface_form":"Eve","offset":324},{"uri":"Adam","surface_form":"Adam","offset":344}]}
