{"id":355109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perkins","text":"Charles Nelson Perkins, AO, (16 June 1936 \u2013 19 October 2000) was an Australian activist and Aboriginal leader. He was also a professional football player.\nPerkins grew up in Alice Springs. His mother was Arrernte, and his father was Kalkadoon. He later moved to Sydney, and graduated from the University of Sydney in 1965. He was the first indigenous Australian to graduate from a university.\nPerkins campaigned for Aboriginal land rights. In 1965, he was an important person in the Freedom Ride campaign, which aimed to raise public awareness of the standards of living, literacy and health conditions among the Aboriginal population. The group was famous for publicising acts of discrimination.\nPerkins was also important in the campaign for the referendum in 1967, which allowed Aboriginal people to be counted in censuses, and parliament to make special laws specifically for Aboriginal people. From 1969, Perkins worked as a public servant in the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. He was made permanent secretary of this department in 1981, which made him the first Aboriginal to become the permanent head of a federal government department. He served as secretary until 1988.\nPerkins died in October 2000 of kidney failure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Australia","surface_form":"AO","offset":24},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":79},{"uri":"Australian_Aborigine","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":92},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":138},{"uri":"Alice_Springs","surface_form":"Alice Springs","offset":174},{"uri":"Arrernte_people","surface_form":"Arrernte","offset":204},{"uri":"Kalkadoon","surface_form":"Kalkadoon","offset":233},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":262},{"uri":"University_of_Sydney","surface_form":"University of Sydney","offset":293},{"uri":"Aboriginal_land_rights_in_Australia","surface_form":"Aboriginal land rights","offset":416},{"uri":"Living_standards","surface_form":"standards of living","offset":551},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":572},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":585},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":681},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":748},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":817},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Australia","surface_form":"parliament","offset":831},{"uri":"Civil_service","surface_form":"public servant","offset":930},{"uri":"Aboriginal_Affairs","surface_form":"Aboriginal Affairs","offset":964},{"uri":"Kidney_failure","surface_form":"kidney failure","offset":1212}]}
