It dates to the Greek Archaic period, about 500 BC. The kylix's height with handles is 3 3/16 in. (8.1\u00A0cm) and its width with handles is 10 1/16 in. (25.5\u00A0cm).\nThe diameter of the bowl is 7 5/8 in. (19.3\u00A0cm). The kylix is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The figure is a symposiast playing a party game called kottabos. He is about to fling the last of the wine in his cup at a lamp stand in an attempt to knock the lamp stand's finial off. The winner was he who did so.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Red-figure","surface_form":"red-figure","offset":30},{"uri":"Terracotta","surface_form":"terracotta","offset":41},{"uri":"Kylix","surface_form":"kylix","offset":52},{"uri":"Kleophrades_Painter","surface_form":"Kleophrades Painter","offset":108},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":293},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art","surface_form":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","offset":377},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":407},{"uri":"Symposium","surface_form":"symposiast","offset":438},{"uri":"Kottabos","surface_form":"kottabos","offset":477}]}
