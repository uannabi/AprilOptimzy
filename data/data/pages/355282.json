{"id":355282,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maristes_Valldemia","text":"The Maristes Valldemia school (aka: Col\u00B7legi Maristes Valldemia, Col\u00B7legi Valldemia or Valldemia), is in Matar\u00F3, Province of Barcelona - Catalonia (Spain). It is a Catholic school run by Marist Brothers. It is dedicated to Our Lady the Virgin of the Candle. \"Fundaci\u00F3 Champagnat, Fundaci\u00F3 Privada\" owns the school.\nThe school was founded in 1855 by three Piarists related persons: the priest Ermengol Coll de Valldemia, Pelegr\u00ED Ferrer and Ramon Cuspinera. Its first name was \u00ABColegio de Catalu\u00F1a\u00BB, and it was on the land of a traditional Catalan manor named \"Can Miralpeix\". The school's aim was to provide a modern and Christian education. After 1858, the school was known as \u00AB\u00BB (in Catalan) or \u00AB\u00BB (in Spanish). In 1888 the school was given to the Marist Brothers to run.\nFrom 2012 the official name is Maristes Valldemia.\nThe main building was designed by the architect Jeroni Boada, and later improved in 1911 by Josep Goday i Casals (who used to be an student at the school, and founder member of the Alumni Association).\nThe school received its first international recognition at the Paris Exposition of 1900, a Gold Medal in recognition of quality education. During the convulsive years that marked the Spanish Civil War, Valldemia was converted into a hospital and blood bank.\nToday, the school has 1200 students from ages 3 to 18, who are taught by a staff of 90 teachers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["school"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Matar%C3%B3","surface_form":"Matar\u00F3","offset":105},{"uri":"Province_of_Barcelona","surface_form":"Province of Barcelona","offset":113},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonia","offset":137},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":148},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":164},{"uri":"Marist_Brothers","surface_form":"Marist Brothers","offset":187},{"uri":"Piarists","surface_form":"Piarists","offset":355},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":862},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1089},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":1209},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1259},{"uri":"Blood_bank","surface_form":"blood bank","offset":1272}]}
