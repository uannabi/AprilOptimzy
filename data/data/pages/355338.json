It may have lived as long as 140\u00A0million years ago. Because of that, it is sometimes called a living fossil. It is an animal carefully protected by the Chinese government. It is named a \"national treasure\" much like the Giant Panda.\nThe fish can be between in body length. It can weigh on average. A grown-up sturgeon measures up to long, and weighs over. This makes it the third biggest only to the White sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon.\nSturgeon are anadromous. This means they spawn in fresh water and migrate to salt water to mature.\nIt lives on the main streams of the Yangtze River and coastal regions of Qiantang River, Minjiang River and Pearl River.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acipenseridae","surface_form":"Acipenseridae","offset":104},{"uri":"Acipenseriformes","surface_form":"Acipenseriformes","offset":132},{"uri":"Living_fossil","surface_form":"living fossil","offset":309},{"uri":"Giant_Panda","surface_form":"Giant Panda","offset":435},{"uri":"White_sturgeon","surface_form":"White sturgeon","offset":615},{"uri":"Atlantic_sturgeon","surface_form":"Atlantic sturgeon","offset":634},{"uri":"Anadromous","surface_form":"anadromous","offset":666},{"uri":"Yangtze_River","surface_form":"Yangtze River","offset":788},{"uri":"Qiantang_River","surface_form":"Qiantang River","offset":825},{"uri":"Min_River_(Fujian)","surface_form":"Minjiang River","offset":841},{"uri":"Pearl_River_(China)","surface_form":"Pearl River","offset":860}]}
