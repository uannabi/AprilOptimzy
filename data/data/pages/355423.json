It is found in the desert areas near the borders of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. There are currently no subspecies recognized. The E. macmahonii is also known as the \"McMahon's Viper\", the \"Asian Sand Viper\", the \"Leaf-nosed Viper\", and the \"Whiskered Viper\".\nDescription.\nThe McMahon's Viper is a small species of snake, growing up to less than one meter. Males are smaller than females; males can grow up to the length of 22-40 cm, and females can grow up to the length of 28-72 cm. They are reddish-brown or yellowish brown in color.\nWhere they live.\nThe McMahon's Viper is found in the desert regions of Balochistan, near the borders of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\nBehavior.\nThe McMahon's Viper is said to be nocturnal, but some say it is crepuscular, meaning it is active during the early morning or late evening. It is able to sidewind on loose sand, and sometimes climbs into bushes. It is a aggressive snake, hissing very loudly when disturbed or annoyed, and sometimes it raising its head of the ground and starts striking aggressively. It is able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. When it sinks into the sand it leaves its eyes and snout sticking out of the sand.\nFeeding.\nThe McMahon's Viper eats small lizards, small rodents like mice, and sometimes birds.\nReproduction.\nThe McMahon's Viper is oviparous, meaning it lays eggs. It lays around a dozen eggs at a time, and these eggs take around 6-8 weeks to hatch. When the eggs hatch the young are about 6 inches (15 cm) long.\nVenom.\nNot much is known about the McMahon's Viper venom, but some say it is similar to the venom of the Echis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monotypic","surface_form":"monotypic","offset":18},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":28},{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venom","offset":47},{"uri":"Viper","surface_form":"viper","offset":56},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":106},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":139},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":145},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":159},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":406},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":681},{"uri":"Balochistan_(region)","surface_form":"Balochistan","offset":699},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":732},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":738},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":752},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":809},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"bushes","offset":979},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":1006},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":1329},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":1344},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":1357},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1377},{"uri":"Oviparous","surface_form":"oviparous","offset":1421},{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venom","offset":1654},{"uri":"Echis","surface_form":"Echis","offset":1708}]}
