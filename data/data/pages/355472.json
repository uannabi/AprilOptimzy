She is best known for her single \"More, More, More\". It was released in 1976. It peaked at #4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nCareer.\nTrue was born in Nashville, Tennessee as Andrea Marie Truden. She moved to New York City during her teenage years. She wanted to seek fame as a movie star or singer. True sang in clubs. She got minor roles in mainstream movies from time to time. She was in movies, such as \"The Way We Were\". But the fame she sought was fleeting. When some friends asked her to join them in a porn movie, True went along with the idea.\nTrue acted in porn movies in Scandinavia in the 1960s. By the end of the decade, she began appearing in American adult movies. In the 1970s and 1980s, she acted in more than 50 hardcore porn movies in the early New York.\nBy the time of her singing career, True said she was getting tired of porn.\nIn early 1977, True released another song, \"N.Y. You Got Me Dancing\" from her follow-up studio album \"White Witch\". The song was True's second biggest hit. It reached #27 on the American \"Billboard\" pop chart.\nTrue's third album, \"War Machine\" (1980), failed. When that happened, she tried to return to porn. But at almost 40, she was too old to return. She also could not go back to music due to a goiter that had developed on her vocal cords.\nDeath.\nAndrea True died of heart failure in Kingston, New York, where she was raised.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":95},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"porn","offset":104},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":120},{"uri":"Disco","surface_form":"disco","offset":136},{"uri":"Single_(song)","surface_form":"single","offset":186},{"uri":"More%2C_More%2C_More","surface_form":"More, More, More","offset":194},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":261},{"uri":"Nashville%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Nashville, Tennessee","offset":307},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":365},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":434},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":448},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":738},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":813},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York","offset":920},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":1094},{"uri":"Goitre","surface_form":"goiter","offset":1405},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":1478},{"uri":"Kingston%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Kingston, New York","offset":1495}]}
