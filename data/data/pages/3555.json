{"id":3555,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha","text":"A Buddha is the holiest type of being in Buddhism, a teacher of God's and humans. The word \"Buddha\" means \"enlightened one\" in Sanskrit or Fully Awakened One in P\u0101li.\nIt is also a title for Siddhartha Gautama. He was the man who started Buddhism. Sometimes people call him \"the Buddha\" or the \"Shakyamuni Buddha\". Other times, people call any person a Buddha if they have found enlightenment. If a person has not found enlightenment yet, but is very close to reaching it, then he is called bodhisattva.\nSummary.\nBuddhists believe that there are many Buddhas. The most recent one was Gautama Buddha. People who will become Buddhas someday are called \"bodhisattvas.\"\nBuddhists believe that the Buddha was enlightened, which means that he knew all about how to live a peaceful life and how to avoid suffering. He is said to have never argued with other people, but only said what was true and useful, out of compassion for others.\nSome Buddhists pray to Buddhas, but Buddhas are not gods. Buddhas are teachers who help the people who will listen. A Buddha is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the world works. This knowledge totally changes the person so that they can have a better life in the present and the future. A Buddha can also help a person achieve enlightenment.\nThere are ideas which are said to lead someone to enlightenment. They are called the \"Dharma\" (Sanskrit) or \"Dhamma\" (P\u0101li), meaning \"the way\" or \"the truth.\" Anyone can become a Buddha, but it is very difficult. He became Buddha under the peepal or \"bodhi\" tree at Bodhgaya in Bihar in what is now India.\nTypes of Buddhas.\nThere is a special type of Buddha called a \"pratyekabuddha\" or \"silent Buddhas\". These Buddhas reached \"enlightenment\" on their own, but they did not teach others.\nAnother type of Buddha is a \"samyaksambuddha\". This is the best kind of Buddha because he is able to teach all living beings.\nSeven Buddhas of the past.\nBuddhists believe that there have been many Buddhas in the past. There will also be many Buddhas in the future. Traditionally, seven Buddhas are given names.\nMaitreya will be the next Buddha.\n32 Signs of a Great Man.\nA Buddha is a person who has reached perfection. Some believe that there are 32 physical features of a Buddha; these are the 32 marks of a Great Man from Vedic brahmin folklore, but are mentioned in the P\u0101li canon. Some of these features are represented in art and sculpture. These are listed below.\nReferences.\n3. \u201CChapter 3 Buddhism.
