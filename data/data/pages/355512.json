{"id":355512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_acute-onset_neuropsychiatric_syndrome_(PANS)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is the name of a disease that normally begins in childhood. It causes Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics. The symptoms begin very suddenly. If it is not treated at the beginning the disease can be there also in adults. The reason for PANS can be a bacteria called \"Group A streptococcus\" (PANDAS type) or an immunologic reaction to other pathogens like certain bacteria or viruses. (PITANDS type).\nSimilar conditions.\nPANS shares symptoms with other diseases. Therefore diagnostic tests must be done to exclude other conditions like Sydenham's chorea, lupus erythematosus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Tourette syndrome. Proof of acute rheumatic fever would exclude a PANS classification.\nTreatment.\nThere is no direct treatment for PANS available yet. This means today only some of the symptoms can be treated. But scientists are already working to develop treatments with antibiotics and immune-based therapies that can heal the disease. Nevertheless early and consequent treatment of the symptoms seems to be important. Otherwise the disease can become a lifelong problem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":85},{"uri":"Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","surface_form":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder","offset":138},{"uri":"Immunology","surface_form":"immunologic","offset":389},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogens","offset":419},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":442},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"viruses","offset":454},{"uri":"Tourette_syndrome","surface_form":"Tourette syndrome","offset":696},{"uri":"Rheumatic_fever","surface_form":"rheumatic fever","offset":730}]}
