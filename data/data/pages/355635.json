{"id":355635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_a_Slave_4_U","text":"=\"preserve\">\"I'm a Slave 4 U\" is a song from Britney Spears' third album, \"Britney\". It was the first single off that album. It was released in late 2001. It was the only song from the album to hit the top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nThe song created controversy. That was partly because of the words, which could be seen as sexual. It was also partly because of her performance of the song on the MTV Video Music Awards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Britney_Spears","surface_form":"Britney Spears","offset":45},{"uri":"Britney_(album)","surface_form":"Britney","offset":75},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":216},{"uri":"MTV_Video_Music_Awards","surface_form":"MTV Video Music Awards","offset":401}]}
