A lot of snakes eat whatever they can find.\nVenom.\nCottonmouths are one of the most dangerous snakes in the world. Remember the rhyme: if it's white, stay away! If it's not, you'll live to see another day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pit_viper","surface_form":"pit viper","offset":140},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":198},{"uri":"Northern_water_snake","surface_form":"Northern water snakes","offset":305},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":441}]}
