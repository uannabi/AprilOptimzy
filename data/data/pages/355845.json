There are five disorders in the group. These disorders all slow down the rate a child learns to talk and listen to others, as well as cause other problems.\nThe first three of these disorders are also called autism spectrum disorders. The last two are not common.\nA child's parents might begin to notice signs of PDD when the child is a baby, and it usually appears before the child is three years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disorder","surface_form":"disorder","offset":68},{"uri":"Autism_spectrum","surface_form":"autism spectrum disorders","offset":286}]}
