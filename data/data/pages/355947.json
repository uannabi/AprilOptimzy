{"id":355947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave","text":"In quantum mechanics, a branch of physics, a matter wave is when you think of matter as a wave. The concept of matter waves was first introduced by Louis de Broglie. Matter waves are hard to visualize, because we are used to thinking of matter as a physical object. De Broglie revolutionized quantum mechanics by producing the equation for matter waves.\nWavelength of Matter.\nAs experiments on light revealed that photons possessed both wavelike and particular properties, they were considered at the time to have a dual nature as both particles and waves. De Broglie showed that matter might exhibit such a 'wave-particle duality' as well. Basing his formula on earlier formulas, he arrived at the equation below.\nformula_1\nWhere \u03BB is the wavelength of the object, \"h\" is Planck's constant, \"m\" is the mass of the object, and \"v\" is the velocity of the object. An alternate and also correct version of this formula is\nformula_1\nWhere \"p\" is the momentum. (Momentum is equal to mass times velocity). These equations merely say that matter exhibits a particle-like nature in some circumstances, and a wave-like characteristic at other times. Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger created an advanced equation based on this formula and the Bohr model, known as the Schr\u00F6dinger equation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":3},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":34},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":78},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":90},{"uri":"Louis_de_Broglie","surface_form":"Louis de Broglie","offset":148},{"uri":"%CE%BB","surface_form":"\u03BB","offset":731},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":740},{"uri":"Planck%27s_constant","surface_form":"Planck's constant","offset":773},{"uri":"Velocity","surface_form":"velocity","offset":838},{"uri":"Momentum","surface_form":"momentum","offset":946},{"uri":"Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger","surface_form":"Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger","offset":1141},{"uri":"Bohr_model","surface_form":"Bohr model","offset":1218},{"uri":"Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation","surface_form":"Schr\u00F6dinger equation","offset":1243}]}
