{"id":356001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermannsburg%2C_Northern_Territory","text":"Hermannsburg is an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is about southwest of Alice Springs. It is known in the local Arrernte language as Ntaria.\nIn the 2006 census, Hermannsburg had a population of 559. It was established as a Lutheran mission in 1877 by two missionaries from Germany. They named their new mission after Hermannsburg in Germany where they had trained. The missionaries left in 1891, but people still lived at the settlement. The mission land was given over to traditional ownership in 1982.\nThe famous painter Albert Namatjira was born at Hermannsburg in 1902. He painted landscapes in Western-style watercolours. Painting in this style came to be known as the Hermannsburg School of painting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian_Aborigine","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":19},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":47},{"uri":"Alice_Springs","surface_form":"Alice Springs","offset":105},{"uri":"Arrernte","surface_form":"Arrernte","offset":145},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":186},{"uri":"Lutheran","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":256},{"uri":"Mission_(Christianity)","surface_form":"mission","offset":265},{"uri":"Hermannsburg","surface_form":"Hermannsburg","offset":350},{"uri":"Aboriginal_land_rights_in_Australia","surface_form":"traditional ownership","offset":506},{"uri":"Albert_Namatjira","surface_form":"Albert Namatjira","offset":556},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":618},{"uri":"Hermannsburg_School","surface_form":"Hermannsburg School","offset":707}]}
