{"id":35601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban","text":"=\"preserve\">:\"For the policy on Wikipedia, see Blocks and bans.\"\nA ban is an action used to stop people from doing something, either bad or dangerous. Ban can also be made on products. For example, Singapore, a country, bans chewing gum. Ban may sometimes be made on the Internet, where an administrator or a moderator with higher powers than other members can stop vandals from causing harm to others. Sometimes, users of a website say that moderators or administrators have banhammers that they use to ban bad users.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blocks_and_bans","surface_form":"Blocks and bans","offset":47},{"uri":"Product_(consumer_goods)","surface_form":"products","offset":175},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":198},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":211},{"uri":"Chewing_gum","surface_form":"chewing gum","offset":225},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":271},{"uri":"Administrator","surface_form":"administrator","offset":290},{"uri":"Moderator","surface_form":"moderator","offset":309},{"uri":"Vandals","surface_form":"vandals","offset":366},{"uri":"Banhammers","surface_form":"banhammers","offset":476}]}
