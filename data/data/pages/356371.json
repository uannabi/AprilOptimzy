{"id":356371,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Valley%2C_Montana","text":"Paradise Valley is a major river valley of the Yellowstone River in southwestern Montana. It is just north of Yellowstone National Park in Park County, Montana. The Absaroka Range is on the east and the Gallatin Range on the west.\nThe Paradise Valley is separated from the Gallatin Valley and Bozeman, Montana by the Bozeman Pass. The valley lies mostly along a north-south axis. It is anchored to the north by Livingston, Montana and to the south by Yankee Jim Canyon which is about fifteen miles north of Gardiner, Montana.\nThe Paradise Valley was the original entrance to Yellowstone National Park. Today, the other entrances to the park are at West Yellowstone, Montana from the west, from the northeast at Cooke City-Silver Gate, Montana, from the east at Cody, Wyoming, and from the south at Grand Teton National Park and Jackson, Wyoming.\nThe Yellowstone River flows through the valley. It is noted for world-class fly fishing in the river and nearby spring creeks such as DePuy Spring Creek. The valley has other natural wonders such as several natural hot springs, including Chico Hot Springs near Emigrant, Montana, La Duke Hot Springs near Gardiner, and Hunter's Hot Springs near Livingston.\nEmigrant Peak is the largest peak near the valley. It is 10,921 feet in elevation. It is in the southern part of the valley on the eastern side of the river. It is in the Absaroka mountain range.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yellowstone_River","surface_form":"Yellowstone River","offset":47},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":81},{"uri":"Yellowstone_National_Park","surface_form":"Yellowstone National Park","offset":110},{"uri":"Park_County%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Park County, Montana","offset":139},{"uri":"Absaroka_Range","surface_form":"Absaroka Range","offset":165},{"uri":"Gallatin_Range","surface_form":"Gallatin Range","offset":203},{"uri":"Gallatin_Valley","surface_form":"Gallatin Valley","offset":273},{"uri":"Bozeman%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Bozeman, Montana","offset":293},{"uri":"Bozeman_Pass","surface_form":"Bozeman Pass","offset":317},{"uri":"Livingston%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Livingston, Montana","offset":411},{"uri":"Yankee_Jim_Canyon","surface_form":"Yankee Jim Canyon","offset":451},{"uri":"Gardiner%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Gardiner, Montana","offset":507},{"uri":"West_Yellowstone%2C_Montana","surface_form":"West Yellowstone, Montana","offset":648},{"uri":"Cooke_City-Silver_Gate%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Cooke City-Silver Gate, Montana","offset":711},{"uri":"Cody%2C_Wyoming","surface_form":"Cody, Wyoming","offset":761},{"uri":"Grand_Teton_National_Park","surface_form":"Grand Teton National Park","offset":798},{"uri":"Jackson%2C_Wyoming","surface_form":"Jackson, Wyoming","offset":828},{"uri":"Yellowstone_River","surface_form":"Yellowstone River","offset":850},{"uri":"Fly_fishing","surface_form":"fly fishing","offset":922},{"uri":"Spring_creek","surface_form":"spring creek","offset":958},{"uri":"DePuy_Spring_Creek","surface_form":"DePuy Spring Creek","offset":980},{"uri":"Emigrant%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Emigrant, Montana","offset":1107},{"uri":"Emigrant_Peak","surface_form":"Emigrant Peak","offset":1203}]}
