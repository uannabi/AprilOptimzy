{"id":356687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Creole","text":"Haitian Creole is a type of Creole language spoken by about 13 million people, mostly Haitians and the Haitian diaspora. This language is called Krey\u00F2l Ayisien by those who speak it.\nOrigins.\nThe language was made in Haiti by contact between colonizers who spoke French and black people they enslaved who spoke African languages. The African influences in Haitian Creole can be noticed in the sound, syntax, and some words. In Haiti, the upper classes have often disrespected Haitian Creole even though they speak it, but recently it is beginning to become more accepted. There are more books in Haitian Creole, and it was finally acknowledged in Haiti's constitution in 1987.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Creole_language","surface_form":"Creole language","offset":28},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haitians","offset":86},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diaspora","offset":111},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":263},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":274},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"enslaved","offset":292},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"African","offset":311},{"uri":"Upper_class","surface_form":"upper classes","offset":438},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"books","offset":587},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":655}]}
