{"id":356688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_goat","text":"The mountain goat (\"Oreamnos americanus\") is a species of goats. They are also known as the Rocky Mountain goat. They live in North America. They are part of the genus \"Oreamnos\", or 'true goats'. They like to live on high elevations. Mountain goats are great at climbing, and will rest on rocky cliffs. They do this so predators cannot get them.\nThe mountain goat wanders the mountains alone, and meets only to mate. It eats grasses, lichens, and leaves. It is 3\u20134\u00A0ft. at the shoulder (90-120 centimeters.) The mother mountain goat is called a nanny, and the male is called a billy, the baby is called a kid.\nTheir thick undercoat, and long white overcoat, protects them from blustery wind, and harsh weather that often occurs in their mountainous habitat. Both male and female have short, strong, legs that have large black hooves on the end. The billy had long slender horns that measure approximately 1 foot. The nannies have slightly longer horns. The female uses her horns to defend her young. She will often dominate the territory, and the male will leave her alone.\nThe female mountain goat, or nanny, becomes pregnant in November, the only month they are together, and gives birth to her kid six months, or half a year, later. The nanny will protect her young for a while and eventually the kid will leave his mother. He will most likely not know his father. They are alone for most of the year except for November which is the mating month.\nReferences.\nRaedeke, Kenneth J. \"Mountain goat.\" World Book Advanced.
