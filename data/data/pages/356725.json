{"id":356725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth","text":"=\"preserve\">Forth (sometimes written FORTH) is a stack-based programming language best known for its use of Reverse Polish notation which greatly simplified the compiler as it required no precedence analysis component.\nIt was developed by Charles H. Moore in 1969. Forth uses a two component system, an operating system to run the programs, and an editor to write them. Like most other high-level languages, FORTH can produce highly-efficient code.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":61},{"uri":"Reverse_Polish_notation","surface_form":"Reverse Polish notation","offset":108},{"uri":"Order_of_operations","surface_form":"precedence","offset":188},{"uri":"Charles_H._Moore","surface_form":"Charles H.
