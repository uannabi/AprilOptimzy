{"id":356776,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkin%27_Donuts","text":"Dunkin' Donuts, often abbreviated as DD and officially known as simply Dunkin', is an American franchise based in Canton, Massachusetts.\nThe company started as a traditional donut shop, selling doughnuts and coffee. Later, they added flavored coffee and iced coffee. They also began to sell breakfast sandwiches: these contain egg, cheese, and pork (bacon, ham, or sausage), on bread (bagel, croissant, or English muffin). With the addition of breakfast sandwiches, Dunkin' Donuts has since become a popular spot for a quick breakfast.\nThe franchise was established around 1950, in Quincy, Massachusetts. As of 2010, over ten thousand Dunkin' Donuts locations exist worldwide. Their largest market outside of the United States is in South Korea. Its name was changed to Dunkin' in 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":86},{"uri":"Canton%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Canton, Massachusetts","offset":114}]}
