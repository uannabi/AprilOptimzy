{"id":35685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation","text":"In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material. This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA. These changes are heritable (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have lethal effects.\nMutations can happen for several reasons. It can happen because of errors when \"meiosis\" produces the gametes (eggs & sperms). Damage by radiation, or by certain chemicals may cause mutations. Mutations occur at random.\nAlso, by derivation, an individual carrying the mutation may be called a mutant or a \"mutation\". So is the trait (character) most obviously affected by the mutation.\nChromosome mutations.\nThese terms are explained in the third diagram.\nResults of mutation.\nMutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or benefit the organism. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism \u2013 the protein made by the 'new' DNA does not work at all, and causing the embryo to die. On the other hand, evolution is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism.\nMutations are the ultimate source of variation, upon which \"natural selection\" acts. What happens is that some mutations affect the organism's ability to live and reproduce. This is an important part of the theory of evolution. The amount of heritable variation carried by a population can be huge, and as a result natural populations can change and adapt to conditions in their environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":3},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":42},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":50},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":86},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":100},{"uri":"Heritable","surface_form":"heritable","offset":151},{"uri":"Lethal","surface_form":"lethal","offset":220},{"uri":"Error","surface_form":"error","offset":303},{"uri":"Meiosis","surface_form":"meiosis","offset":316},{"uri":"Gametes","surface_form":"gametes","offset":338},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"eggs","offset":347},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":354},{"uri":"Damage","surface_form":"Damage","offset":363},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":373},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":398},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":448},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"trait","offset":563},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":842},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":910},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":944},{"uri":"Variation_(biology)","surface_form":"variation","offset":1089},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":1112},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":1259},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1269},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapt","offset":1402},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":1431}]}
