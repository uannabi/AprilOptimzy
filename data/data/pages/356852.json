It has an area of, slightly smaller than South Uist. North Uist is connected by causeways to Benbecula via Grimsay, to Berneray, and to Baleshare.\nWith the exception of the south east, the island is very flat, and covered with a patchwork of peat bogs, low hills and lochs, with more than half the land being covered by water. Some of the lochs contain a mixture of fresh and tidal salt water, giving rise to some complex and unusual habitats.\nLoch Sgadabhagh is the largest loch by area on North Uist but Loch Obisary has about twice the volume of water. The northern part of the island is part of the South Lewis, Harris and North Uist National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":31},{"uri":"Outer_Hebrides","surface_form":"Outer Hebrides","offset":48},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":66},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":171},{"uri":"South_Uist","surface_form":"South Uist","offset":227},{"uri":"Causeway","surface_form":"causeway","offset":266},{"uri":"Benbecula","surface_form":"Benbecula","offset":279},{"uri":"Grimsay","surface_form":"Grimsay","offset":293},{"uri":"Berneray%2C_North_Uist","surface_form":"Berneray","offset":305},{"uri":"Baleshare","surface_form":"Baleshare","offset":322},{"uri":"Peat","surface_form":"peat","offset":428},{"uri":"Bog","surface_form":"bog","offset":433},{"uri":"Loch","surface_form":"loch","offset":453},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":620},{"uri":"Lewis","surface_form":"Lewis","offset":795},{"uri":"Harris","surface_form":"Harris","offset":802},{"uri":"National_Scenic_Area","surface_form":"National Scenic Area","offset":824}]}
