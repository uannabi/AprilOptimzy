{"id":356861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction","text":"Faraday's law of induction is a law of physics proposed by English physicist Michael Faraday in 1831. It is one of the basic laws of electromagnetism. The law explains why generators, transformers and electrical motors work.\nFaraday's law of induction says that when a magnetic field changes, it causes a voltage, a difference in the electric potential that can make electric currents flow. That phenomenon was also found by Joseph Henry in 1831.\nThis equation says that how much current is induced in the wire loop depends directly on how fast the magnetic flux is changing in time, whether due to the loop moving or the magnetic field changing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":59},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":67},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":77},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"electromagnetism","offset":133},{"uri":"Generator","surface_form":"generator","offset":172},{"uri":"Transformer","surface_form":"transformer","offset":184},{"uri":"Electrical","surface_form":"electrical","offset":201},{"uri":"Motor","surface_form":"motor","offset":212},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":269},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":305},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":396},{"uri":"Joseph_Henry","surface_form":"Joseph Henry","offset":425}]}
