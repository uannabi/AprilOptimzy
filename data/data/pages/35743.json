{"id":35743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbot","text":"Turbot is a large flatfish. It is a demersal fish which lives in marine or brackish waters. It is found in the North Atlantic, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.\nTurbot are fished for food, and have a delicate flavour. They are farmed in a number of countries, and are quite expensive in restaurants.\nWhen caught, professional fishermen often make small cuts through the bone near the tailfin. This lets the blood out and keeps the meat white. Storing the Turbot upside down also helps in keeping the underside of the fish white.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flatfish","surface_form":"flatfish","offset":18},{"uri":"Demersal","surface_form":"demersal","offset":36},{"uri":"Marine_biology","surface_form":"marine","offset":65},{"uri":"Brackish","surface_form":"brackish","offset":75},{"uri":"North_Atlantic","surface_form":"North Atlantic","offset":111},{"uri":"Baltic_Sea","surface_form":"Baltic Sea","offset":127},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":146},{"uri":"Flavour","surface_form":"flavour","offset":213},{"uri":"Restaurants","surface_form":"restaurants","offset":291},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":317},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishermen","offset":330},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":374},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":388}]}
