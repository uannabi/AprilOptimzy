{"id":357478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster","text":"The Virgo Supercluster (\"Virgo SC\") or Local Supercluster is the large galaxy cluster that contains the Virgo Cluster and the Local Group. At least 100 galaxies and clusters are in it.\nThe diameter of Virgo SC is 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). It is one of millions of supercluster<nowiki/>s in the observable universe.\nBackground.\nWhen the first large sample of nebulae was published by William and John Herschel in 1863, it was seen that there is a marked excess of nebular fields in the constellation Virgo (near the north galactic pole).\nIn the 1950s, it was suggested that this excess was a large-scale galaxy-like structure, a \"Local Supercluster\". Debate went on during the 1960s and 1970s as to whether the Local Supercluster (LS) was actually a structure or a chance alignment of galaxies.\nThe issue was resolved with the large redshift surveys of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which showed a flattened concentration of galaxies along the supergalactic plane.\nStructure.\nIn 1982 R. Brent Tully showed it consists of two components: a flattened disk with two-thirds of the supercluster's luminous galaxies, and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining one-third.\nThe disk itself is a thin (~1 megaparsecs) ellipsoid with a long axis / short axis ratio of at least 6 to 1, and possibly as high as 9 to 1.\nData released in June 2003 from a redshift survey lets astronomers compare the LS to other superclusters. The LS represents a typical poor (that is, it lacks a high density core) supercluster of rather small size. It has one rich galaxy cluster in the center, surrounded by filaments of galaxies and poor groups.\nThe Local Group is on the outskirts of the LS in a small filament extending from the Fornax Cluster to the Virgo Cluster. The Virgo Supercluster's volume is about 7000 times that of the Local Group or 100 billion times that of the Milky Way.\nFile:Virgosupercluster_atlasoftheuniverse.gif|frame|center|The Virgo Supercluster in supergalactic coordinates (click on feature names for more information)\ncircle 473 220 33 Virgo Cluster\ncircle 339 230 16 M83 Group\ncircle 349 252 15 M81 group\ncircle 326 264 15 Maffei Group\ncircle 289 292 20 NGC 1023 Group\ncircle 370 236 13 M101 group\ncircle 347 299 20 NGC 2997 Group\ncircle 405 238 20 Canes Venatici I Group\ncircle 426 203 19 NGC 5033 group\nrect 445 247 508 276 Ursa Major Cluster\ncircle 391 270 18 Leo I Group\ncircle 277 197 25 NGC 6744 Group\ncircle 236 314 22 Dorado Group\ncircle 518 87 40 Virgo III Groups\ncircle 526 225 20 NGC 4697\ncircle 546 331 34 Leo II Groups\ncircle 165 194 27 NGC 7582\npoly 180 356 178 325 252 345 242 378 Fornax Cluster\npoly 176 357 239 379 214 413 162 381 Eridanus Cluster\nrect 295 213 324 239 Local Group\nrect 252 235 304 257 Sculptor Group","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxy_cluster","surface_form":"galaxy cluster","offset":71},{"uri":"Virgo_Cluster","surface_form":"Virgo Cluster","offset":104},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":126},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":189},{"uri":"Parsec","surface_form":"parsec","offset":220},{"uri":"Light-years","surface_form":"light-years","offset":241},{"uri":"Supercluster","surface_form":"supercluster","offset":280},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":321},{"uri":"Nebula","surface_form":"nebula","offset":374},{"uri":"William_Herschel","surface_form":"William","offset":399},{"uri":"John_Herschel","surface_form":"John Herschel","offset":411},{"uri":"Virgo_constellation","surface_form":"Virgo","offset":515},{"uri":"Galactic_coordinate_system","surface_form":"galactic pole","offset":537},{"uri":"Redshift","surface_form":"redshift","offset":848},{"uri":"Parsec","surface_form":"megaparsecs","offset":1223},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":1651},{"uri":"Fornax_Cluster","surface_form":"Fornax Cluster","offset":1732},{"uri":"Virgo_Cluster","surface_form":"Virgo Cluster","offset":1754},{"uri":"Supergalactic_coordinates","surface_form":"supergalactic coordinates","offset":1974},{"uri":"Virgo_Cluster","surface_form":"Virgo Cluster","offset":2064},{"uri":"M83_Group","surface_form":"M83 Group","offset":2096},{"uri":"M81_group","surface_form":"M81 group","offset":2124},{"uri":"Maffei_Group","surface_form":"Maffei Group","offset":2152},{"uri":"NGC_1023_Group","surface_form":"NGC 1023 Group","offset":2183},{"uri":"M101_group","surface_form":"M101 group","offset":2216},{"uri":"NGC_2997_Group","surface_form":"NGC 2997 Group","offset":2245},{"uri":"Canes_Venatici_I_Group","surface_form":"Canes Venatici I Group","offset":2278},{"uri":"NGC_5033","surface_form":"NGC 5033 group","offset":2319},{"uri":"Ursa_Major_Cluster","surface_form":"Ursa Major Cluster","offset":2355},{"uri":"Leo_Group","surface_form":"Leo I Group","offset":2392},{"uri":"NGC_6744","surface_form":"NGC 6744 Group","offset":2422},{"uri":"Dorado_Group","surface_form":"Dorado Group","offset":2455},{"uri":"Virgo_III_Groups","surface_form":"Virgo III Groups","offset":2485},{"uri":"NGC_4697","surface_form":"NGC 4697","offset":2520},{"uri":"Leo_II_Groups","surface_form":"Leo II Groups","offset":2547},{"uri":"NGC_7582","surface_form":"NGC 7582","offset":2579},{"uri":"Fornax_Cluster","surface_form":"Fornax Cluster","offset":2625},{"uri":"Eridanus_Cluster","surface_form":"Eridanus Cluster","offset":2677},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":2715},{"uri":"Sculptor_Group","surface_form":"Sculptor Group","offset":2748}]}
