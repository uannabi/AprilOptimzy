It is not clear that he invented it himself.\nRespondents to a \"Physics World\" poll called the identity \"the most profound mathematical statement ever written\", \"uncanny and sublime\", \"filled with cosmic beauty\" and \"mind-blowing\".\nMathematical proof of Euler's Identity using Taylor Series.\nMany equations can be written as a series of terms added together. This is called a Taylor series.\nThe exponential function formula_1 can be written as the Taylor series\nformula_1\nAs well, the sine function can be written as\nformula_1\nformula_1\nHere, we see a pattern take form. formula_1 seems to be a sum of sine and cosine's Taylor series, except with all of the signs changed to positive. The identity we are actually proving is formula_1.\nSo, on the left side is formula_1, whose Taylor series is formula_1\nWe can see a pattern here, that every second term is \"i\" times sine's terms, and that the other terms are cosine's terms.\nformula_1\nif we add these together, we have\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nwhich is the statement of Euler's identity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":162},{"uri":"Leonard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonard Euler","offset":182},{"uri":"Taylor_series","surface_form":"Taylor series","offset":572},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponential function","offset":591},{"uri":"Taylor_series","surface_form":"Taylor series","offset":644},{"uri":"Sine","surface_form":"sine","offset":681}]}
