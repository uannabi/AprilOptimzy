You were getting a salary for performance plus a rehearsal salary. We would do three plays in Central Park for the summer. And then you'd do three to six plays every year down on Lafayette Street -- new plays by new writers: Sam Shepard, David Mamet, David Rabe, John Ford Noonan, Jason Miller\".\nIn slack periods between acting jobs, Durning taught ballroom dancing at the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in New York City.\nA bit later, Durning moved into television and movies.
