{"id":357592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelash_viper","text":"The eyelash viper (\"Bothriechis schlegelii\") is a species of venomous pit viper found in Central and South America. The scientific name \"Bothriechis schlegelii\" is for the German ornithologist, Hermann Schlegel.\nDescription.\nThe eyelash viper is a small species of snake, and rarely ever grows longer than the length of 75 cm (2.5 ft). Females are larger than males. It gets the name \"eyelash viper\" because it has a small group of scales over its eyes which make it look like the snake has eyelashes. The eyelash viper comes in many colors like green, yellow, red, brown or even pink.\nBehavior.\nLike other snakes of the genus \"Bothriechis\", this species is arboreal, meaning it lives in trees. The eyelash viper is nocturnal. It is not known to be aggressive, but if annoyed or disturbed it doesn't hesitate to strike.\nThe viper is viviparous, meaning it gives live birth. It gives birth to around 10 to 12 young at a time. When they are born, young vipers are 5-9 inches long.\nFeeding.\nEyelash vipers capture their prey by ambushing. They feed on small rodents, small birds, frogs, and lizards.\nCommon names.\nThe eyelash viper is also known as the 'eyelash mountain viper\", the \"horned palm viper\", Schlegel's viper\", and the \"eyelash palm-pit viper\". It is also known as the \"bocarac\u00E1\" in Costa Rica and other Central and South American countries.\nWhere they live.\nThe eyelash viper is found in southern Mexico, southeastward to the Atlantic lowlands, through Central America to northern South America in Colombia and Venezuela. It is also found in parts of Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru.\nHabitat.\nThe viper likes to live in humid, tropical areas not far from water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":50},{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venom","offset":61},{"uri":"Pit_viper","surface_form":"pit viper","offset":70},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central","offset":89},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":101},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":172},{"uri":"Ornithologist","surface_form":"ornithologist","offset":179},{"uri":"Hermann_Schlegel","surface_form":"Hermann Schlegel","offset":194},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":265},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":607},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":621},{"uri":"Bothriechis","surface_form":"Bothriechis","offset":628},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":658},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":688},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":716},{"uri":"Viviparous","surface_form":"viviparous","offset":833},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":1055},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1070},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":1077},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":1088},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":1292},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central","offset":1313},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South American","offset":1325},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1407},{"uri":"Lowland","surface_form":"lowland","offset":1445},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1463},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1491},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":1508},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":1521},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":1561},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":1573},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":1581},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":1594},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":1643}]}
