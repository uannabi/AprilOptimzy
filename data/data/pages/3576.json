{"id":3576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi","text":"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (;; Sindhi: 20 September 1869 \u2013 17 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; \"mahatma\" is an honorific meaning \"great-soul\" or \"venerable\" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called \"Bapu\" in India (Gujarati endearment for \"father\", \"papa\"). Full Name is Mohandas Karam Chand Gandhi\nHe was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him the title of 'Mahatma'.\nGandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through a non-violent protest.\nEarly life.\nGandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to study law in England. After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. In 1897, Gandhi was attacked by a group of people in Durban Harbor, South Africa when he was going to work. He went to South Africa because he could not find work in India. When traveling through South Africa, Gandhi was also kicked out of a first class train because of his skin color. Then Gandhi started protesting against segregation. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the United Kingdom, but wanted independence. He was a huge leader during that era and his thoughts helped catalyze the Indian independence movement.\nAs an activist.\nOn 27 December, 1914 (NS-9 January, 1915) when Gandhi returned to India, he decided to again lead a march against a law called the Rowlatt Act. But then the protest turned violent and people started to kill the protesters.\nOn 27 February, 1930 (NS-12 March, 1930) Gandhi led the Salt March.\nWhen he returned to India, he helped cause India's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth.\nPeople of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country.\nIn 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process.\nOn 2 August, 1947 (NS-15 August, 1947) British Indian Empire became independent, breaking India in two, India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want to split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was crying over the division of India.\nGandhi's principle of \"satyagraha\", often translated as \"way of truth\" or \"pursuit of truth\", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (\"satya\"), and non-violence (\"ahimsa\").\nDeath.\nOn January 17, 1948 (NS-January 30, 1948) Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead by an Hindu activist Nathuram Godse, because Godse thought that Mahatma Gandhi was too respectful to the Muslims.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sindhi","surface_form":"Sindhi","offset":31},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalism","offset":92},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British-ruled India","offset":107},{"uri":"Honorific","surface_form":"honorific","offset":187},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":236},{"uri":"Gujarati_language","surface_form":"Gujarati","offset":331},{"uri":"Rabindranath_Tagore","surface_form":"Rabindranath Tagore","offset":459},{"uri":"Non-violence","surface_form":"non-violent","offset":621},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":633},{"uri":"Nonviolence","surface_form":"non-violent","offset":687},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":699},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"study law in England","offset":896},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":936},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":977},{"uri":"Human_skin_colour","surface_form":"skin","offset":1043},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":1603},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1617},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":1644},{"uri":"Salt_March","surface_form":"Salt March","offset":2057},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":2233},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":2273},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":2312},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":2326},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hindus","offset":2535},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":2546},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":2655},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":2662},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":2674},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Indian Empire","offset":3069},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":3144},{"uri":"Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","offset":3479},{"uri":"Nelson_Mandela","surface_form":"Nelson Mandela","offset":3507},{"uri":"Nathuram_Godse","surface_form":"Nathuram Godse","offset":3753}]}
