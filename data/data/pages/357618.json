{"id":357618,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster","text":"Galaxy clusters are large collections of galaxies. They consist of hundreds of galaxies and galaxy groups, bound together by gravity. Galaxy clusters are much larger than galaxy groups, like our Local Group.\nClusters of galaxies should not be confused with either star clusters, which are \"inside\" galaxies, or with globular clusters, which usually orbit galaxies.\nNotable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby universe include the Virgo Cluster (which includes our Local Group), Fornax Cluster, Hercules Cluster, and the Coma Cluster.\nStill larger than galaxy clusters are superclusters. A very large aggregation of galaxies known as the Great Attractor, dominated by the Norma Cluster, is massive enough to affect the local expansion of the universe (Hubble's law).\nNotable galaxy clusters in the distant, high-redshift universe include SPT-CL J0546-5345, the most massive galaxy cluster ever found in the early universe.\nBasic properties.\nGalaxy clusters typically have the following properties.\nScale of things.\nUniverse > observable universe > very large-scale structures > superclusters > galaxy clusters > galaxy groups > galaxies > star clusters > stars","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxies","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":41},{"uri":"Galaxies","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":79},{"uri":"Galaxy_groups","surface_form":"galaxy groups","offset":92},{"uri":"Galaxy_groups","surface_form":"galaxy groups","offset":171},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":195},{"uri":"Star_cluster","surface_form":"star cluster","offset":264},{"uri":"Globular_cluster","surface_form":"globular cluster","offset":316},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":349},{"uri":"Virgo_Cluster","surface_form":"Virgo Cluster","offset":435},{"uri":"Fornax_Cluster","surface_form":"Fornax Cluster","offset":483},{"uri":"Hercules_Cluster","surface_form":"Hercules Cluster","offset":499},{"uri":"Coma_Cluster","surface_form":"Coma Cluster","offset":525},{"uri":"Superclusters","surface_form":"superclusters","offset":577},{"uri":"Great_Attractor","surface_form":"Great Attractor","offset":642},{"uri":"Norma_Cluster","surface_form":"Norma Cluster","offset":676},{"uri":"Hubble%27s_law","surface_form":"Hubble's law","offset":756},{"uri":"Redshift","surface_form":"redshift","offset":816},{"uri":"SPT-CL_J0546-5345","surface_form":"SPT-CL J0546-5345","offset":842},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"Universe","offset":1019},{"uri":"Observable_universe","surface_form":"observable universe","offset":1030},{"uri":"Superclusters","surface_form":"superclusters","offset":1082},{"uri":"Galaxy_clusters","surface_form":"galaxy clusters","offset":1098},{"uri":"Galaxy_groups","surface_form":"galaxy groups","offset":1116},{"uri":"Galaxies","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":1132},{"uri":"Star_clusters","surface_form":"star clusters","offset":1143},{"uri":"Stars","surface_form":"stars","offset":1159}]}
