{"id":357756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izabal_Department","text":"Izabal is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. Its coastal areas are part of the homeland of the Garifuna people.\nIzabal is bordered to the north by Belize, to the north east by the Gulf of Honduras, and to the east by Honduras. It is bordered by the Guatemalan departments of Pet\u00E9n to the north west, Alta Verapaz to the west, and Zacapa to the south.\nThe department of Izabal surrounds Lago Izabal. It is Guatemala's largest lake at about 48\u00A0km long and 24\u00A0km wide, with an area of about 590\u00A0km\u00B2. The Spanish Colonial fort of San Felipe overlooks the point where the lake flows into the R\u00EDo Dulce.\nThe small town of Izabal is on the south shore of the lake. Before the ports of Livingston and Puerto Barrios were built in the 19th century this was Guatemala's main Caribbean Sea port. It was the original seat of Izabal department. Now Izabal town is a remote village that gets little traffic.\nFrom the area around Lake Izabal, the Department of Izabal stretches along the R\u00EDo Dulce to the coast of the Caribbean Sea.\nThe department of Izabal includes the ports of Puerto Barrios (the departmental seat), Santo Tom\u00E1s de Castilla, Livingston and Guatemala's free trade zone Zolic. Izabal also includes the Pre-Columbian Maya ruins of Quirigua.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Departments_of_Guatemala","surface_form":"departments","offset":24},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":39},{"uri":"Garifuna_people","surface_form":"Garifuna people","offset":100},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":152},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Honduras","surface_form":"Gulf of Honduras","offset":185},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":222},{"uri":"Pet%C3%A9n_(department)","surface_form":"Pet\u00E9n","offset":280},{"uri":"Alta_Verapaz","surface_form":"Alta Verapaz","offset":305},{"uri":"Zacapa","surface_form":"Zacapa","offset":335},{"uri":"Lago_Izabal","surface_form":"Lago Izabal","offset":391},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":506},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_Dulce","surface_form":"R\u00EDo Dulce","offset":592},{"uri":"Izabal_(town)","surface_form":"Izabal","offset":621},{"uri":"Livingston%2C_Guatemala","surface_form":"Livingston","offset":683},{"uri":"Puerto_Barrios","surface_form":"Puerto Barrios","offset":698},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":770},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":1008},{"uri":"Puerto_Barrios","surface_form":"Puerto Barrios","offset":1070},{"uri":"Livingston%2C_Guatemala","surface_form":"Livingston","offset":1135},{"uri":"Zolic","surface_form":"Zolic","offset":1178},{"uri":"Pre-Columbian","surface_form":"Pre-Columbian","offset":1210},{"uri":"Maya_civilization","surface_form":"Maya","offset":1224},{"uri":"Quirigua","surface_form":"Quirigua","offset":1238}]}
