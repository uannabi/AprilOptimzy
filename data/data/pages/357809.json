It was through this book that Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism first reached a wide audience. The idea was later taken up by Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin. Playfair is also remembered for his proposal of an alternative to Euclid's parallel postulate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"FRSE","offset":14},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":20},{"uri":"Natural_philosophy","surface_form":"natural philosophy","offset":118},{"uri":"University_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"University of Edinburgh","offset":144},{"uri":"James_Hutton","surface_form":"James Hutton","offset":297},{"uri":"Uniformitarianism","surface_form":"uniformitarianism","offset":363},{"uri":"Charles_Lyell","surface_form":"Charles Lyell","offset":443},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":461},{"uri":"Euclid","surface_form":"Euclid","offset":543},{"uri":"Parallel_postulate","surface_form":"parallel postulate","offset":552}]}
