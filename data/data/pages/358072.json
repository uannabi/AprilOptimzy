{"id":358072,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomorphinae","text":"Neomorphinae is a subfamily of the cuckoo family, Cuculidae. The birds in this group live in the Americas and are terrestrial, meaning they live on the ground. But the two genera, \"Dromococcyx\" and \"Tapera\", are more arboreal, meaning they live in trees. Birds in this group are known as \"New World ground cuckoos\".\nDescription.\nAll birds in this group are long-legged and long-tailed. They come in different sizes. The species in the genus \"Geococcyx\" are around long. The smallest bird in this group, the striped cuckoo, is long.\nFeeding.\nNew World ground cuckoos are omnivores, meaning they eat both meat and plants. They eat many types of insects like grasshoppers, beetles, and caterpillars, arachnids like spiders and scorpions, snakes like rattlesnakes, lizards, other birds and bird eggs, small mammals like mice, small, young rabbits and bats. They also eat seeds and fruits.\nHabitat.\nNew World ground cuckoos are found in forests, woodlands and deserts all over the Americas.\nGenera.\nGenus: \"Tapera\"\nGenus: \"Morococcyx\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subfamily","surface_form":"subfamily","offset":18},{"uri":"Cuckoo","surface_form":"cuckoo","offset":35},{"uri":"Cuckoo","surface_form":"Cuculidae","offset":50},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":65},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":97},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":172},{"uri":"Dromococcyx","surface_form":"Dromococcyx","offset":181},{"uri":"Striped_cuckoo","surface_form":"\"Tapera\"","offset":198},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":248},{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":289},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":333},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":420},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":435},{"uri":"Roadrunner","surface_form":"\"Geococcyx\"","offset":441},{"uri":"Striped_cuckoo","surface_form":"striped cuckoo","offset":507},{"uri":"Omnivore","surface_form":"omnivore","offset":570},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":643},{"uri":"Grasshopper","surface_form":"grasshopper","offset":656},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":670},{"uri":"Caterpillar","surface_form":"caterpillar","offset":683},{"uri":"Arachnid","surface_form":"arachnid","offset":697},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":712},{"uri":"Scorpion","surface_form":"scorpion","offset":724},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":735},{"uri":"Rattlesnake","surface_form":"rattlesnake","offset":747},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":761},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":776},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":791},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":803},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":816},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":835},{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":847},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":867},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":877},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":932},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":941},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":955},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":976},{"uri":"Striped_cuckoo","surface_form":"\"Tapera\"","offset":1001},{"uri":"Lesser_ground_cuckoo","surface_form":"\"Morococcyx\"","offset":1017}]}
