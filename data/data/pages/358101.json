{"id":358101,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Fitz_Roy","text":"Monte Fitz Roy (also known as Cerro Chalt\u00E9n, Cerro Fitz Roy, or simply Mount Fitz Roy) is a mountain in the border between Argentina and Chile that is located near the village of El Chalt\u00E9n that is in Argentina.. It is in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field in Patagonia. The mountain is 3375 metre high. It was first climbed in 1952 by French mountain climbers Lionel Terray and Guido Magnone. It is one of the most difficult mountains to climb on Earth. The clothing label, Patagonia, used Monte Fitz Roy as the idea for their logo, after Yvon Chouinard climbed the mountain in 1968 and made a movie about it.\nFrancisco Moreno first saw the mountain on 2 March 1877. He named it Fitz Roy, in honour of Robert Fitz Roy. Fitz Roy was captain of HMS Beagle and had travelled up the Santa Cruz River in 1834 and made maps of large parts of the Patagonian coast.\n\"Cerro\" is a Spanish word meaning hill, while \"Chalt\u00E9n\" is a Tehuelche word meaning smoking mountain, as they believe it was a volcano for its peak is most of the time covered by clouds.\nGeology.\nFitz Roy is a huge pyramid shaped granite monolith, carved by the winds, snow and ice. Fitz Roy is made of igneous rocks from deep in the Earth. When large tectonic plates collided about 100 million years, magma escaped between these plates and solidified between other rocks. The erosion of these rocks led to the formation of the mountain.\nPlants and animals.\nThere are no plants on the bare walls of the summit. In the steep foothills, below the summit there are forests of beech and vast plains of short vegetation adapted to extreme climatic conditions\nAnimals are very rare in the region of Fitz Roy. There are a few eagles and rabbits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":92},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":123},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":137},{"uri":"El_Chalt%C3%A9n","surface_form":"El Chalt\u00E9n","offset":179},{"uri":"Patagonia","surface_form":"Patagonia","offset":259},{"uri":"HMS_Beagle","surface_form":"HMS Beagle","offset":743},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":871},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":1073},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":1088},{"uri":"Monolith","surface_form":"monolith","offset":1096},{"uri":"Igneous_rock","surface_form":"igneous rock","offset":1161},{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":1210},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":1260},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":1335},{"uri":"Beech","surface_form":"beech","offset":1531},{"uri":"Plains","surface_form":"plains","offset":1546},{"uri":"Adapted","surface_form":"adapted","offset":1573}]}
