{"id":358206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function","text":"e=\"preserve\">In quantum mechanics, the Wave function, usually represented by \"\u03A8\", or \"\u03C8\", describes the probability of finding an electron somewhere in its matter wave. To be more precise, the \"square\" of the wave function gives the probability of finding the location of the electron in the given area, since the normal answer for the wave function is usually a complex number. The wave function concept was first introduced in the legendary Schr\u00F6dinger equation.\nMathematical Interpretation.\nformula_1\nwhere \"i\" is the imaginary number, \"\u03C8 (x,t)\" is the wave function, \"\u0127\" is the reduced Planck constant, \"t\" is time, \"x\" is position in space, \"\u0124\" is a mathematical object known as the \"Hamilton operator\". The reader will note that the symbol formula_1 denotes that the partial derivative of the wave function is being taken.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":16},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":130},{"uri":"Matter_wave","surface_form":"matter wave","offset":156},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":363},{"uri":"Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation","surface_form":"Schr\u00F6dinger equation","offset":443},{"uri":"Imaginary_number","surface_form":"imaginary number","offset":521},{"uri":"Planck_constant","surface_form":"Planck constant","offset":590},{"uri":"Partial_derivative","surface_form":"partial derivative","offset":773}]}
