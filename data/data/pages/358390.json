He became the first video game producer when he founded Electronic Arts in 1982. Hawkins believed that a video game producer could be like a record producer, who takes control over the whole development of a video game. Hawkins brought record producers from A&M Records to help train the first video game producers.\nBack then, video game producer had a negative reputation as \"imitation Hollywood\" by game executives and press members. However, it is now a term that is accepted and used more often in video games. The role of the video game producer has been defined by different companies and different teams. There are a number of positions of a producer.\nVideo game producers earn the third most money in the video game industry. They earn an average of USD$75,000 annually. Associate producers with less than three years experience earn $43,000. However, those between three to six years of experience earn an average of $55,700 annually. Executive producers with over six years experience earn an average of $103,000 annually.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game_development","surface_form":"development","offset":70},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":87},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":135},{"uri":"Electronic_Arts","surface_form":"Electronic Arts","offset":231},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"record producer","offset":316},{"uri":"A%26amp%3BM_Records","surface_form":"A&M Records","offset":433},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":537},{"uri":"Executive","surface_form":"executive","offset":581},{"uri":"Press","surface_form":"press","offset":596},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"USD","offset":933}]}
