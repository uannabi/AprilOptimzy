{"id":3584,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink","text":"A drink or beverage is a liquid that an organism can take into their body, by using their mouth. Typical drinks for humans include water, tea, milk, coffee, juice, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks.\nAll drinks are mainly water. All life needs water to live. If a living organism don't get enough water, they will dehydrate, and likely die. Plants take in water through their roots, which are underground. Most land animals get water by drinking.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":25},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":40},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":131},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":138},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":143},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":149},{"uri":"Juice","surface_form":"juice","offset":157},{"uri":"Soft_drinks","surface_form":"soft drinks","offset":164},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcoholic","offset":180},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":231},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydrate","offset":312},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"die","offset":334},{"uri":"Roots","surface_form":"roots","offset":374},{"uri":"Terrestrial_animal","surface_form":"land animals","offset":409}]}
