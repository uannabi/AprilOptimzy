They live in pools and slow-moving streams in subtropical forests.They mostly are awake during night and sleep during the day. The emperor newt usually eats small insects. These include crickets and worms.\nIt is also called the mandarin newt or mandarin salamander. They can grow up to long. It has a ridged orange head. A single orange ridge runs along its back. This ridge is lined with two parallel rows of orange bumps on a black background. The tail and legs are entirely orange. There are different shades of orange.\nWhen the newt is grabbed, the tips of the ribs will squeeze out poison. Emperor newts have enough toxin to kill about 7,500 mice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":55},{"uri":"Newt","surface_form":"newt","offset":61},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":89},{"uri":"Orange_(colour)","surface_form":"orange","offset":403}]}
