It is in the northeastern part of the island. It is next to Taipei County. Nicknamed the \"Rainy Port\" for its frequent rain and maritime role, the city is Taiwan's second largest seaport (after Kaohsiung).\nEarly History.\nKeelung was first inhabited by the Ketagalan, a tribe of Taiwanese aborigine. The Spanish expedition to Formosa in the early 17th century was its first contact with the West; by 1624 the Spanish had built San Salvador de Quelung, a fort in Keelung serving as an outpost of the Manila-based Spanish East Indies. The Spanish ruled it as a part of Spanish Formosa. From 1642 to 1661 and 1663\u20131668, Keelung was under Dutch control. The Dutch East India Company took over the Spanish Fort San Salvador at Santissima Trinidad.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement","Chinese|title=Keelung City|c={{linktext|\u57FA\u9686|\u5E02}}|p=J\u012Bl\u00F3ng Sh\u00EC|mi={{IPAc-cmn|j|i|1|.|l|ong|2|-|shi|4}}|gr=Jilong Shyh|tp=Jil\u00F3ng Sh\u00ECh|mps=J\u012Bl\u00FAng Shr\u0300|w=Chi\u00B9-lung\u00B2 Shih\u2074|bpmf=\u3110\u3127&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\u310C\u3128\u3125\u02CA&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\u3115\u02CB|myr=J\u012Bl\u00FAng Shr\u0300|phfs=K\u00EE-l\u00F9ng-s\u1E73"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chung_Cheng_Park_(Keelung)","surface_form":"Chung Cheng Park","offset":26},{"uri":"Freeway_1_(Taiwan)","surface_form":"Sun Yat-sen Freeway","offset":66},{"uri":"Loliginidae","surface_form":"Loliginidae","offset":154},{"uri":"Hokkien","surface_form":"Hokkien","offset":206},{"uri":"Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB","surface_form":"POJ","offset":214},{"uri":"Provincial_city","surface_form":"provincial city","offset":262},{"uri":"Taiwan_Province","surface_form":"Taiwan Province","offset":281},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":298},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":355},{"uri":"Taipei_County","surface_form":"Taipei County","offset":377},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":496},{"uri":"Kaohsiung","surface_form":"Kaohsiung","offset":511},{"uri":"Ketagalan_people","surface_form":"Ketagalan","offset":573},{"uri":"Taiwanese_aborigine","surface_form":"Taiwanese aborigine","offset":595},{"uri":"Spanish_expedition_to_Formosa","surface_form":"Spanish expedition to Formosa","offset":620},{"uri":"San_Salvador_de_Quelung","surface_form":"San Salvador de Quelung","offset":743},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":815},{"uri":"Spanish_East_Indies","surface_form":"Spanish East Indies","offset":828},{"uri":"Spanish_Formosa","surface_form":"Spanish Formosa","offset":883},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":951},{"uri":"Dutch_East_India_Company","surface_form":"Dutch East India Company","offset":970},{"uri":"Santissima_Trinidad_(Taiwan)","surface_form":"Santissima Trinidad","offset":1038}]}
