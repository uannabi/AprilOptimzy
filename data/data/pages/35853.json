{"id":35853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit","text":"e=\"preserve\">In math, imaginary unit, or formula_1, is a number that can be represented by equations, but refers to a value that can only exist outside of real numbers. The mathematical definition of the imaginary unit is formula_1 (i.e., the principal root of formula_1), where formula_1 satisfies the property formula_1.\nThe reason why formula_1 was created was to answer a polynomial equation, formula_1, which normally has no solution (as the value of formula_1 would have to equal formula_1). Though the problem is solvable, the square root of formula_1 could hardly be represented by a physical quantity of objects in real life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Math","surface_form":"math","offset":16},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":155},{"uri":"Polynomial_equation","surface_form":"polynomial equation","offset":376}]}
