It was performed in New York City at the Martin Beck Theater on May 24, 1939 with Loring as Billy and Marie-Jeanne in the dual role of Mother and Mexican Sweetheart. During Christmas week 1939, the ballet was presented at the St. James Theater in New York City with Michael Kidd as Billy and Alicia Alonso as Mother and Mexican Sweetheart.\nStory.\nThe ballet opens with pioneers heading west led by Pat Garrett in \"March\". In \"Street Scene\", cowboys, Indians, dance hall girls, and other western types throng the street of a town. Billy and his Mother enter as a brawl breaks out. Alias (as cowboy) kills Billy's Mother with a wild shot. Billy stabs Alias and runs away.\nIn \"Billy's Soliloquy\", Billy shoots Alias (as land agent) during a card game. In \"Card Game on the Desert\" and \"Gun Battle\", Garrett accuse Billy of cheating at cards and goes off. The posse approaches led by Alias (as sheriff). Billy's gang is killed, but Billy kills Alias. The posse takes him to jail. At the end of \"Macabre Dance\", the Mexican Sweetheart enters looking for Billy. In \"Jail Scene\" Billy escapes by killing Alias (as jailer).\nIn \"Desert\", Alias (as Indian Guide) leads Billy to the Mexican Sweetheart's hide-out. Billy has no thought for anyone but himself and the Sweetheart leaves. The Indian Guide returns with Garrett, and, when Billy lights a cigarette in the darkness, Garret kills him (\"Billy's Death\"). Mexican women mourn Billy's death in \"Piet\u00E0\". The ballet ends with Garret leading pioneers in \"Closing March\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["ballet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":29},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":41},{"uri":"Billy_the_Kid","surface_form":"Billy the Kid","offset":120},{"uri":"Aaron_Copland","surface_form":"Aaron Copland","offset":160},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":292},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":337}]}
