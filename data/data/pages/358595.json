They live in the highlands in the Mount Nimba region of the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and C\u00F4te d'Ivoire. They are Critically Endangered due to habitat loss, and iron and bauxite mining in their small ranges.\nThe two species are viviparous. This means they have internal fertilisation. The female gives birth to fully developed, tiny toadlets. \"Nectophrynoides\" and \"Nimbaphrynoides\" are the only frogs/toads that do not lay eggs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":23},{"uri":"Bufonidae","surface_form":"true toads","offset":32},{"uri":"Mount_Nimba","surface_form":"Mount Nimba","offset":78},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":104},{"uri":"Guinea","surface_form":"Guinea","offset":130},{"uri":"Liberia","surface_form":"Liberia","offset":138},{"uri":"C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire","surface_form":"C\u00F4te d'Ivoire","offset":150},{"uri":"Critically_Endangered","surface_form":"Critically Endangered","offset":174},{"uri":"Habitat_loss","surface_form":"habitat loss","offset":203},{"uri":"Iron_ore","surface_form":"iron","offset":221},{"uri":"Bauxite","surface_form":"bauxite","offset":230},{"uri":"Vivipary","surface_form":"viviparous","offset":288},{"uri":"Internal_fertilisation","surface_form":"internal fertilisation","offset":321}]}
