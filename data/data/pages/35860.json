{"id":35860,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycology","text":"=\"preserve\">Phycology (or algology), a part of botany, is the study of algae. Algae are important as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Most algae are eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms that live in a wet environment. They are different from the higher plants by a lack of \"normal\" roots, stems or leaves. Many types have one cell and are very small or microscopic (including plankton and other microalgae); many others have many cells; some of these are very big, like seaweeds such as kelp and \"Sargassum\".\nPhycology includes the study of prokaryotic forms known as blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. Some microscopic algae are also in lichens.\nA \"phycologist\" is a person who studies phycology...","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":47},{"uri":"Alga","surface_form":"alga","offset":71},{"uri":"Primary_production","surface_form":"primary producers","offset":101},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":122},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":130},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryotic","offset":157},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthetic","offset":169},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":184},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":261},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":290},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":306},{"uri":"Microscopic","surface_form":"microscopic","offset":361},{"uri":"Phytoplankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":384},{"uri":"Microalgae","surface_form":"microalgae","offset":403},{"uri":"Multicellular","surface_form":"have many cells","offset":428},{"uri":"Seaweeds","surface_form":"seaweeds","offset":478},{"uri":"Kelp","surface_form":"kelp","offset":495},{"uri":"Sargassum","surface_form":"Sargassum","offset":505},{"uri":"Prokaryote","surface_form":"prokaryotic","offset":549},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"cyanobacteria","offset":596},{"uri":"Lichen","surface_form":"lichen","offset":646}]}
