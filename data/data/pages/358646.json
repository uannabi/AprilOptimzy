{"id":358646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelobatidae","text":"The European spadefoot toads are a family of frogs, the Pelobatidae. There is only one living genus, called \"Pelobates\". It has four species. They live in Europe, the Mediterranean, northwestern Africa and western Asia.\nThe European spadefoot toads are small to large sized frogs. They grow up to in length. They burrow in sandy soils. They have a hardened growth on their feet to help in digging. They will come out from the ground during times of rain and breed in pools, which are usually temporary.\nAll of the species from this family have free-living, aquatic tadpoles. The eggs are laid in temporary ponds that may quickly evaporate. The tadpole stage is very short. They grow to adult form in as little as two weeks. To further speed their growth, some of the tadpoles are cannibalistic, eating their brood-mates to increase their supply of protein.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":35},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":94},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":155},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":167},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":195},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":214},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":565},{"uri":"Evaporate","surface_form":"evaporate","offset":629},{"uri":"Cannibalism","surface_form":"cannibalistic","offset":780}]}
