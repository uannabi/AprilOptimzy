{"id":358742,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_derivative","text":"e=\"preserve\">In physics and mathematics (particularly in differential calculus), the second derivative is the derivative of the derivative of a function, say formula_1. The second derivative has many real-life applications, especially in the study of mathematical optimization and acceleration. Second derivatives can be notated in several ways, some of which are\nOther notations are used, but the above two are the most commonly used.\nPower Rule for Finding the Second Derivative.\nIf we have a function formula_1, then the second derivative of the function can be found using the power rule for second derivatives.
