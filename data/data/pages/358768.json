{"id":358768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caeciliidae","text":"Caeciliidae is the family of common caecilians. They are found in Central and South America, equatorial Africa and India. Like other caecilians, they look like worms or snakes.\nAlthough they are the most diverse of the caecilian families, the caeciliids do have a number of features in common that make them different from other caecilians. In particular, their skulls have few bones. The ones tey have are fused to form a solid ram. This helps in digging through the soil. The mouth is beneath the nose area. There is no tail.\nMany caeciliids lay their eggs in moist soil. The eggs then hatch into aquatic larvae. However, some species do not have a larval stage. The eggs hatch into juveniles with the same form as the adults. In some they lack eggs and give birth to live young.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":19},{"uri":"Caecilian","surface_form":"caecilian","offset":133},{"uri":"Diverse","surface_form":"diverse","offset":204},{"uri":"Larvae","surface_form":"larvae","offset":607}]}
