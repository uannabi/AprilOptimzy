For example, they still have a tail, and the mouth is not to the back on the underside of the head. They lay their eggs in small holes in the soil. The larvae have external gills. They live in seepages until they change into adults. The adults live in moist soil and leaf litter.\nTaxonomy.\nThere are nine species in two genera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caecilian","surface_form":"caecilian","offset":52},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":131},{"uri":"Primitive","surface_form":"primitive","offset":183},{"uri":"Larvae","surface_form":"larvae","offset":417}]}
