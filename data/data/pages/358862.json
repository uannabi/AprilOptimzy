{"id":358862,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostatic_loudspeaker","text":"A magnetostatic loudspeaker is a dipole speaker. It is quite similar than electrostatic loudspeaker but it doesn't use high voltages, it uses high currents.\nThe impedance of a magnetostatic speaker may be so low that an amplifier has to be ready to feed low impedance. Sound quality about current speaker type is respected.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Loudspeaker","surface_form":"speaker","offset":40},{"uri":"Electrostatic_loudspeaker","surface_form":"electrostatic loudspeaker","offset":74},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":124},{"uri":"Current","surface_form":"current","offset":147},{"uri":"Impedance","surface_form":"impedance","offset":161},{"uri":"Amplifier","surface_form":"amplifier","offset":220},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"Sound","offset":269}]}
