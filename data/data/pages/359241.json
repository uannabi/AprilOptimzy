It is in the sea to the west of Africa. It has an area of. Close to 5,000 people live there. The island is a heavily eroded volcano over three million years old. It is surrounded by other smaller islands including Ilheu Bom Bom, Ilh\u00E9u Caro\u00E7o, Tinhosa Grande and Tinhosa Pequena. Pr\u00EDncipe rises in the south to at Pico de Pr\u00EDncipe, in a part of the Obo National Park that is covered with trees. The north and centre of the island were formerly plantations, most of them formed by Portuguese colonialists using slave labor. These concentrated initially on producing sugar and later on cocoa, becoming the world's greatest cocoa producer. Since independence these plantations have since largely gone back to being forest.\nPr\u00EDncipe was the site where Einstein's Theory of Relativity was experimentally proved successful by Arthur Stanley Eddington and his team during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Tom\u00E9 and Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":80},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":135},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":227},{"uri":"Ilheu_Bom_Bom","surface_form":"Ilheu Bom Bom","offset":317},{"uri":"Ilh%C3%A9u_Caro%C3%A7o","surface_form":"Ilh\u00E9u Caro\u00E7o","offset":332},{"uri":"Tinhosa_Grande","surface_form":"Tinhosa Grande","offset":346},{"uri":"Tinhosa_Pequena","surface_form":"Tinhosa Pequena","offset":365},{"uri":"Pico_de_Pr%C3%ADncipe","surface_form":"Pico de Pr\u00EDncipe","offset":416},{"uri":"Obo_National_Park","surface_form":"Obo National Park","offset":451},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":546},{"uri":"Portuguese_colonies","surface_form":"Portuguese colonialists","offset":582},{"uri":"Slavery_in_Africa","surface_form":"slave labor","offset":612},{"uri":"Cane_sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":667},{"uri":"Theobroma_cacao","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":686},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Einstein's","offset":850},{"uri":"Theory_of_Relativity","surface_form":"Theory of Relativity","offset":861},{"uri":"Arthur_Stanley_Eddington","surface_form":"Arthur Stanley Eddington","offset":922},{"uri":"Solar_eclipse_of_May_29%2C_1919","surface_form":"solar eclipse of May 29, 1919","offset":977}]}
