{"id":3593,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula","text":"The Arabian peninsula or southern Arabia is a peninsula in Southwest Asia at the junction of Africa and Asia. It lies east of Ethiopia and northern Somalia; south of Israel, the disputed Palestinian territories, and Jordan; and southwest of Iran.\nThe waters around Arabia are: on the southwest the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba; on the southeast the Arabian Sea; and on the northeast the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf.\nThe peninsula is part of the Middle East, but that usually means the Arabian Peninsula with the Levant and Mesopotamia. The word \"Arabia\" often refers only to Saudi Arabia.\nThe country of Saudi Arabia covers almost all of Arabia. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Northern Arabia has important oil wells.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":46},{"uri":"Southwest_Asia","surface_form":"Southwest Asia","offset":59},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":93},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":104},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":126},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":148},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":166},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":187},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":216},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":241},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":298},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Aqaba","surface_form":"Gulf of Aqaba","offset":310},{"uri":"Arabian_Sea","surface_form":"Arabian Sea","offset":346},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Oman","surface_form":"Gulf of Oman","offset":384},{"uri":"Persian_Gulf","surface_form":"Persian Gulf","offset":405},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":448},{"uri":"Levant","surface_form":"Levant","offset":515},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":526},{"uri":"Oil_well","surface_form":"oil well","offset":759}]}
