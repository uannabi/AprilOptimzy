They live in North America, in southern Canada and USA south to southern Mexico. Scaphiopodidae is a small family with only seven species.\nThe American spadefoot toads are of typical shape to most digging frogs. They are round, with short legs and eyes that stick out. This frog has a hard growth on their feet which helps them to dig. They dig backwards into the ground.\nThe American spadefoot toads live on land when not under ground. They are dully coloured, usually a grey or dull green or brown. This is to help in camouflage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":39},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":93},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":120},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":131},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":153},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"camouflage","offset":600}]}
