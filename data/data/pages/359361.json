{"id":359361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroleptidae","text":"The Arthroleptidae is a family of frogs found in sub-Saharan Africa. They are known as squeakers because of their high-pitched call. They are small, less than in length. They live on land mostly in leaf litter on the forest floor. They do not have tadpoles. They lay their eggs on the ground.\nSome species hatch already completely metamorphosed into the adult form, others still have tails when they hatch.\nTaxonomy.\nArthroleptidae is separated into two sub-families: Arthroleptinae and Leptopelinae. Some think these are separate families.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":24},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":34},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"sub-Saharan Africa","offset":49},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":248},{"uri":"Metamorphosis","surface_form":"metamorphosed","offset":331},{"uri":"Tails","surface_form":"tails","offset":384}]}
