{"id":359366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddleback_toad","text":"The saddleback toads are the family Brachycephalidae in the order Anura. The family has just one genus, \"Brachycephalus\". It has 28 species.\nThese tiny, often yellow frogs live in the cool cloud Atlantic forests of south-eastern Brazil. These mountainous areas have even more species (per square km) than the Amazon basin. Each small mountain has its own species.\nThe saddleback toads are very small frogs. They are mostly about in length. They include the smallest frog in the southern hemisphere, the Brazilian golden frog (\"Brachycephalus didactylus\"). They have only three toes on each foot, and two fingers on each hand. This is different than the usual five toes and four fingers of most frogs.\nThe saddleback toads are active during the day. They live in the leaf litter on forest floors. The eggs hatch into miniature frogs. There is no tadpole stage. The eggs are laid on the ground. They are covered in soil to protect from the heat and predators.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":29},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":60},{"uri":"Anura","surface_form":"Anura","offset":66},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":97},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":132},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":229},{"uri":"Brazilian_golden_frog","surface_form":"Brazilian golden frog","offset":503},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":845},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":947}]}
