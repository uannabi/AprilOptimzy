{"id":359468,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratophryinae","text":"The Ceratophryinae, known as common horned frogs, are a subfamily of the leptodactylid frogs. All species live in South America.\nFossils of the giant \"Beelzebufo\" from Cretaceous Madagascar suggest that the subfamily may have once ranged throughout the prehistoric supercontinent of Gondwana. Not all species in the subfamily have the horn-like growth at the eyes. All are carnivorous, terrestrial or semi-aquatic. They have large heads and mouths.\nSome people enjoy keeping these frogs as pets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Leptodactylidae","surface_form":"leptodactylid","offset":73},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":87},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":114},{"uri":"Beelzebufo","surface_form":"Beelzebufo","offset":151},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":168},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":179},{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":265},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":283},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":373},{"uri":"Terrestrial_animal","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":386},{"uri":"Aquatic_animal","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":406}]}
