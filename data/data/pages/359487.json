{"id":359487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoliidae","text":"Hyperoliidae is a family of small to medium sized, brightly colored, frogs. It has more than 250 species in 19 genera. Seventeen genera live in sub-Saharan Africa.\nHyperoliids range from to in body length. Many species have smooth, brightly patterned, skin that almost looks enameled.\nMost hyperoliids live in trees. Some live on land, including several \"Kassina\" species that move by walking or running rather than hopping. Diet varies widely, with examples including \"Tornierella\", who eats snails, and \"Afrixalus fornasinii\", the only land frog known to eat eggs of other species of anurans.\nBreeding in this family begins at the start of the rainy season. Hyperoliids come together at breeding sites. Most hyperoliids lay their eggs in water. Tadpoles are pond type larvae with large dorsal fins on the tail.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":69},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":111},{"uri":"Enamel_(glass)","surface_form":"enamel","offset":275},{"uri":"Kassina","surface_form":"Kassina","offset":355},{"uri":"Tornierella","surface_form":"Tornierella","offset":470},{"uri":"Afrixalus_fornasinii","surface_form":"Afrixalus fornasinii","offset":506},{"uri":"Anura","surface_form":"anura","offset":586},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"Tadpole","offset":747},{"uri":"Larvae","surface_form":"larvae","offset":770}]}
