{"id":359489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantellidae","text":"Mantellidae is a family of the order Anura. These frogs are found only in Madagascar and Mayotte.\nThese frogs are very different from each other. Most species live on land, though some live in trees. Body size ranges from 3 to 10 centimetres in length. The genus Mantella has many similarities with the South American poison dart frogs.\nThey are small, aposematically coloured, and secrete alkaloid toxins.\nSome members of this group are kept as pets due to their bright colors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":17},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":31},{"uri":"Anura","surface_form":"Anura","offset":37},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":74},{"uri":"Mayotte","surface_form":"Mayotte","offset":89},{"uri":"Mantella","surface_form":"Mantella","offset":263},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":303},{"uri":"Poison_dart_frog","surface_form":"poison dart frog","offset":318},{"uri":"Aposematic","surface_form":"aposematic","offset":353},{"uri":"Alkaloid","surface_form":"alkaloid","offset":390},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":399},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":446}]}
