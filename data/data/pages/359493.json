{"id":359493,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myobatrachidae","text":"Myobatrachidae is a family of frogs found in Australia and New Guinea. Members of this family vary greatly in size. There are species less than long. This family also has the second-largest frog in Australia, the Giant Barred Frog at in length. The entire family either live in land or water. None of them live in trees.\nThese frogs do not have the adhesive toe disc cups found in the tree frogs. The family is broken up into three sub-families: Limnodynastinae, Myobatrachinae and Rheobatrachinae. This separation is based mainly on their egg-laying habits. Those of the sub-family Limnodynastinae lay foam nests. The female makes foam with a chemical on her skin. The foam may float on top of water, or be on land. The sub-family Rheobatrachinae has the two species of gastric-brooding frog, and the rest are in the sub-family Myobatrachinae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":20},{"uri":"Frogs","surface_form":"frogs","offset":30},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":45},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":59},{"uri":"Giant_Barred_Frog","surface_form":"Giant Barred Frog","offset":213},{"uri":"Disc","surface_form":"disc","offset":362},{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":385},{"uri":"Gastric","surface_form":"gastric","offset":771}]}
