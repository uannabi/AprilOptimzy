{"id":359576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhacophoridae","text":"Rhacophoridae is a family of frog species. They live in tropical regions of Asia and Africa. They are commonly known as shrub frogs. Sometimes they are called '\"moss frogs\" or \"bush frogs\". Some Rhacophoridae are called \"tree frogs\". Among the most spectacular members of this family are numerous \"flying frogs\".\nMost of the species are arboreal. This may include reproducing in trees. Mating frogs, while in amplexus, hold onto a branch, and beat their legs to form a foam. The eggs are laid in the foam. They are then covered with seminal fluid. Then the foam hardens into a protective casing. In some species, this is done in a large group. The foam is laid above a water source, so the tadpoles fall into the water once they hatch.\nThe species in this family vary in size, from to. Like other arboreal frogs, they have toe discs. This family has the Old World flying frogs, including Wallace's flying frogs(\"Rhacophorus nigropalmatus\"). These frogs have extensive webbing between their hands and feet. This lets them glide through the air.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":19},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":29},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":76},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":85},{"uri":"Moss_frog_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"moss frogs","offset":161},{"uri":"Bush_frog_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"bush frogs","offset":177},{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":221},{"uri":"Flying_frog","surface_form":"flying frog","offset":298},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":325},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":337},{"uri":"Amplexus","surface_form":"amplexus","offset":409},{"uri":"Semen","surface_form":"seminal","offset":533},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":690},{"uri":"Flying_frog","surface_form":"flying frog","offset":864},{"uri":"Rhacophorus_nigropalmatus","surface_form":"Rhacophorus nigropalmatus","offset":912}]}
