{"id":35961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotheria","text":"The Allotheria are an extinct infraclass or superorder of mammals. They are related to the prototheria and theria.\nThe allotheres was a branch of successful Mesozoic mammals. The most important characteristic was the presence of lower molariform teeth with two longitudinal rows of cusps.\nAllotheres also had a narrow pelvis, indicating that they gave birth to tiny, helpless young as marsupials do.\nThe Haramiyida from the Triassic period were the earliest group, and the Multituberculates survived until the Oligocene, 35 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":22},{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":35},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":49},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":58},{"uri":"Prototheria","surface_form":"prototheria","offset":91},{"uri":"Theria","surface_form":"theria","offset":107},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":157},{"uri":"Molar","surface_form":"molar","offset":235},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":246},{"uri":"Cusp","surface_form":"cusp","offset":282},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":318},{"uri":"Marsupials","surface_form":"marsupials","offset":385},{"uri":"Haramiyida","surface_form":"Haramiyida","offset":404},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":424},{"uri":"Multituberculate","surface_form":"Multituberculate","offset":473},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":510}]}
