{"id":359615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooglossidae","text":"The Sooglossidae (Seychelles frogs) are a family of frogs. They are found on the Seychelles Islands and India.\nAll of the species are small land frogs, about in length. They hide under fallen leaves or in rock crevices. They lay their eggs on moist ground, rather than in water. One species lacks tadpoles, with the eggs hatching directly into froglets. The others carry the tadpoles on their back until metamorphosis.\nTaxonomy.\nThe family was first described in 1931 by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble (1894\u20131940).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":42},{"uri":"Frogs","surface_form":"frogs","offset":52},{"uri":"Seychelles","surface_form":"Seychelles Islands","offset":81},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":104},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":297},{"uri":"Metamorphosis","surface_form":"metamorphosis","offset":404}]}
