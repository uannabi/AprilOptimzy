{"id":35963,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwanatheria","text":"Gondwanatheria is an extinct group of mammals that lived during the Upper Cretaceous to the end of the Eocene. They lived in the Southern Hemisphere continents which had been part of the supercontinent Gondwana.\nThese mammals are known only from isolated teeth and a few lower jaws. Because of these fragmentary remains, their relationships are unclear.\nFossils have come from South America, India and Antarctica, where gondwanatherids once lived in the lush forests of the Eocene. Climate changes at the Eocene\u2013Oligocene boundary may have caused their extinction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":38},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":68},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":103},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":129},{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":187},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":202},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":255},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":277},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"Fossil","offset":354},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":377},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":392},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":402},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":459},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"Climate change","offset":482},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":512},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":553}]}
