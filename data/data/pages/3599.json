{"id":3599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland","text":"Greenland is the world's largest island.\nGreenland is a semi-autonomous territory of the kingdom of Denmark. This large Arctic island is near Iceland to the east and Canada to the west. It has a population of only 50,000 people, limited by its cold climate. Most of the civilian population lives in the southern part of the island, on the coasts. The capital of Greenland is Nuuk.\nThe island is democratic, with its own elections and a representative seat of government in Nuuk. It is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutional monarchy with Queen Margrethe II as head of state.\nThe island's Thule Air Base is under Danish control, but is administered by the United States Air Force.\nThe island is the least densely populated country in the world, with a density of 0.026 people per square kilometer. Antarctica is not counted because it is not an independent country and has no permanent inhabitants.\nThe ice sheet that covers Greenland may hide three separate islands, which have been joined by glaciers since the last geologic ice age.\nIn Greenland, there are no forests. In the south, at the coastal area, only some dwarf trees are found.\nHistory.\nGreenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples. They came from what is now Canada. Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, having previously settled Iceland.\nNorsemen would later set sail from Greenland and Iceland with Leif Erikson. They were the first known Europeans to reach North America. They did so nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean islands. Inuit peoples arrived in Greenland in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1261. Their colonies declined after the Black Death in the late 1400s. Denmark\u2013Norway, joined in alliance at the time, reclaimed sovereignty over the island in the 17th century. Greenland became Danish in 1814.\nLanguages.\nThe island is populated mostly by Inuit and Scandinavians who speak Greenlandic, an Eskimo-Aleut language. Danish is also spoken by most people. The national anthem of Greenland is Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit. Greenlandic became the sole official language in June 2009. However, it is the dialect of western Greenland, leaving other dialects to become less used and endangered. Danish is used in practice by professional people and by many of the Inuit population. English is taught in schools from the first year onwards.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAs of January 1st, 2008, 218 people lived there.\nLandscape.\nThe island has many mountains. All of the cities are on the coast, because everywhere else is covered by a big layer of ice. The major cities are Nuuk, Sisimiut, Ilulissat, and Qaqortoq.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":33},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Denmark","surface_form":"kingdom of Denmark","offset":89},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":120},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":142},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":166},{"uri":"Nuuk","surface_form":"Nuuk","offset":375},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Kingdom of Denmark","offset":497},{"uri":"Queen_Margrethe_II","surface_form":"Queen Margrethe II","offset":548},{"uri":"Thule_Air_Base","surface_form":"Thule Air Base","offset":598},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"United States Air Force","offset":665},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"densely populated","offset":714},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":807},{"uri":"Ice_sheet","surface_form":"ice sheet","offset":912},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":1003},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geologic","offset":1027},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":1036},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1072},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coastal","offset":1102},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1281},{"uri":"Vikings","surface_form":"Norsemen","offset":1289},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":1406},{"uri":"Leif_Erikson","surface_form":"Leif Erikson","offset":1477},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Columbus","offset":1587},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":1608},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Inuit","offset":1627},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1720},{"uri":"Black_Death","surface_form":"Black Death","offset":1842},{"uri":"Inuit","surface_form":"Inuit","offset":2058},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":2068},{"uri":"Greenlandic_language","surface_form":"Greenlandic","offset":2092},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":2131},{"uri":"Nunarput_utoqqarsuanngoravit","surface_form":"Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit","offset":2205},{"uri":"Nuuk","surface_form":"Nuuk","offset":2780},{"uri":"Sisimiut","surface_form":"Sisimiut","offset":2786},{"uri":"Ilulissat","surface_form":"Ilulissat","offset":2796},{"uri":"Qaqortoq","surface_form":"Qaqortoq","offset":2811}]}
