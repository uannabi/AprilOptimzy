{"id":360226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Loves_of_a_She-Devil","text":"\"The Life and Loves of a She-Devil\" is a 1983 novel by British feminist author Fay Weldon. It is about a highly unattractive woman who goes to great lengths to take revenge on her husband and his attractive lover. The book, Weldon says, is about envy, rather than revenge.\nThe novel was made into two movies. In 1986 it was as an award-winning BBC television serial. It starred Patricia Hodge as Mary Fisher, Dennis Waterman as Bobbo and Julie T. Wallace as Ruth. In 1989 it was made as \"She-Devil\". This version starred Roseanne Barr as the \"she-devil\" and Meryl Streep as her adversary, Mary Fisher.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Feminism","surface_form":"feminist","offset":63},{"uri":"Fay_Weldon","surface_form":"Fay Weldon","offset":79},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":344},{"uri":"Patricia_Hodge","surface_form":"Patricia Hodge","offset":378},{"uri":"Dennis_Waterman","surface_form":"Dennis Waterman","offset":409},{"uri":"Julie_T._Wallace","surface_form":"Julie T.
