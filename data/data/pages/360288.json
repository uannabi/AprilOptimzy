{"id":360288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperland","text":"\"Hyperland\" is a 50-minute long documentary movie about hypertext and surrounding technologies. It was written by Douglas Adams and produced and directed by Max Whitby. It ran on BBC Two in 1990. It stars Douglas Adams as a computer user and Tom Baker as a personification of a software agent.\nThe dream (and the documentary) ends with a vision of how information might be accessed in 2005. \"Hyperland\" does describe a number of features of the modern web. This is especially noteworthy because it predates the public release of the first Web browser by about a year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Documentary","surface_form":"documentary","offset":32},{"uri":"Hypertext","surface_form":"hypertext","offset":56},{"uri":"Douglas_Adams","surface_form":"Douglas Adams","offset":114},{"uri":"Max_Whitby","surface_form":"Max Whitby","offset":157},{"uri":"BBC_Two","surface_form":"BBC Two","offset":179},{"uri":"Tom_Baker","surface_form":"Tom Baker","offset":242},{"uri":"Personification","surface_form":"personification","offset":257},{"uri":"Software_agent","surface_form":"software agent","offset":278},{"uri":"WorldWideWeb","surface_form":"first Web browser","offset":533}]}
