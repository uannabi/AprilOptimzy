There are two series: the first was shown in 1994; the second in 1995.\nAlistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona were among the regular guests on the show. It only ran for two series. The second was more simply titled \"Punt and Dennis\".\nThere were several character inventions in the sketches. Some of these were \"The Gullibles\", who were always falling for scams, as well as a number of Punt and Dennis's characters from \"The Mary Whitehouse Experience\", such as the milk-obsessed \"Mr Strange\". There were also spoofs from TV programs such as \"Baywatch\" and \"The X-Files\".\nThe second series also had performances by tribute bands. They impersonated bands including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":64},{"uri":"Stand-up_comedy","surface_form":"stand-up","offset":72},{"uri":"Sketch_comedy","surface_form":"sketch","offset":85},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedian","offset":100},{"uri":"Steve_Punt","surface_form":"Steve Punt","offset":110},{"uri":"Hugh_Dennis","surface_form":"Hugh Dennis","offset":125},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":152},{"uri":"Alistair_McGowan","surface_form":"Alistair McGowan","offset":209},{"uri":"Ronni_Ancona","surface_form":"Ronni Ancona","offset":230},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":386},{"uri":"The_Mary_Whitehouse_Experience","surface_form":"The Mary Whitehouse Experience","offset":553},{"uri":"Baywatch","surface_form":"Baywatch","offset":675},{"uri":"The_X-Files","surface_form":"The X-Files","offset":690},{"uri":"Tribute_bands","surface_form":"tribute bands","offset":747},{"uri":"Impersonate","surface_form":"impersonate","offset":767},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":780},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":796},{"uri":"The_Rolling_Stones","surface_form":"The Rolling Stones","offset":812}]}
