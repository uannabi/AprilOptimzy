The eyewitnesses said that the Israeli soldier operating the bulldozer on purpose ran over Corrie, and the Israeli government claims it was an accident.\nHer life has been the focus of several tributes, including the play \"My Name Is Rachel Corrie\", the cantata \"The Skies are Weeping\" and more than 30 songs. Her collected writings were published in 2008 under the title \"Let Me Stand Alone\", opening \"a window on the maturation of a young woman seeking to make the world a better place.\" The Rachel Corrie Foundation for Peace and Justice has been established to continue her work.\nShe has been compared to Anne Frank.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":31},{"uri":"Olympia%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Olympia, Washington","offset":39},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":70},{"uri":"Rafah","surface_form":"Rafah","offset":78},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":92},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":101},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":124},{"uri":"International_Solidarity_Movement","surface_form":"International Solidarity Movement","offset":159},{"uri":"Armored_bulldozer","surface_form":"armored bulldozer","offset":231},{"uri":"Israel_Defense_Forces","surface_form":"Israel Defense Forces","offset":266},{"uri":"Palestinian_people","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":341},{"uri":"Gaza_Strip","surface_form":"Gaza","offset":362},{"uri":"Tribute","surface_form":"tribute","offset":560},{"uri":"My_Name_Is_Rachel_Corrie","surface_form":"My Name Is Rachel Corrie","offset":590},{"uri":"Cantata","surface_form":"cantata","offset":621},{"uri":"The_Skies_are_Weeping","surface_form":"The Skies are Weeping","offset":630},{"uri":"Let_Me_Stand_Alone","surface_form":"Let Me Stand Alone","offset":740},{"uri":"Rachel_Corrie_Foundation_for_Peace_and_Justice","surface_form":"Rachel Corrie Foundation for Peace and Justice","offset":861},{"uri":"Anne_Frank","surface_form":"Anne Frank","offset":976}]}
