It began after the end of the Goryeo Dynasty at what is today the city of Kaesong. It ended with the assassination of Empress Myeongseong. Joseon was the last dynasty of Korean history and the longest Confucian dynasty.\nToday, some Koreans use the word \"Joseon\" to mean something bad because they think of the Joseon Dynasty as something that failed. Young Koreans use the expression \"Hell Joseon\" to talk about how hard it is to find a good job in South Korea today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Korean name"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":83},{"uri":"Taejo_of_Joseon","surface_form":"Taejo Yi Seong-gye","offset":107},{"uri":"Goryeo","surface_form":"Goryeo","offset":157},{"uri":"Kaesong","surface_form":"Kaesong","offset":201},{"uri":"Empress_Myeongseong","surface_form":"Empress Myeongseong","offset":245},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"dynasty","offset":286},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korean","offset":297},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucian","offset":328},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":576}]}
