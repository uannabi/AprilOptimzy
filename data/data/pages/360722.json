{"id":360722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palenquero","text":"Palenquero is a Spanish-African Creole language spoken in Colombia. Is it spoken primarily in the Northern and the Caribbean parts of Colombia; the palenque villages and their diasporas.\nFormation of Palenquero.\nPalenquero, just like in the other Spanish-Based Caribbean Creoles, has influences from the contact between European masters and African slaves. In the case of Palenquero, it has been accepted that the maroons (escaped slaves) moved in somewhere in the mountains, along with some Native Americans. The maroons had very little contact with their masters, which led to them having to blend their African substrate languages with the Spanish European ones.\nAfrican influences.\nPalenquero has a lot of African influence in its sounds, phonetics, syntax, grammar, vocabulary, and a lot of words.\nSample.\nThe African languages that have had the most dominant influence on Palenquero is the languages of the Bantu, specifically the Kongo.\nRelated languages or dialect.\nCuban Creole Oriental is very similar to Palenquero. They even share some words.\nMany of the Spanish-based Creoles can be compared to the other Creoles of the Americas, where there has been the blending of African and European languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":58},{"uri":"Bantu","surface_form":"Bantu","offset":913},{"uri":"Kikongo","surface_form":"Kongo","offset":937},{"uri":"Cuban_Creole_Oriental","surface_form":"Cuban Creole Oriental","offset":974}]}
