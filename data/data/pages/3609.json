{"id":3609,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information","text":"The word \"information\" is used in many different ways. Originally, it comes from a word that meant to give a form to something. Information is something that people can learn, know about, or understand. For example, a newspaper contains information about the world. This article contains information about \"Information\".\nInformation in computer science.\nPeople who use computers often use the words \"information\" and \"data\" in the same way. There are special fields of study called \"information science\", \"information technology\" (IT), and data science.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, some people gave a new, specific meaning to \"information\". At that time, the first computer databases were built. In computer science, \"data\" often means a kind of information that has not been checked. That means \"data\" has not been changed or fixed, and you may not be able to trust it. With the new meaning, \"information\" means data that has been checked and passed tests for what it must be. A person can trust that \"information\" is correct.\nInformation can only be correct and good enough to trust if there are very good and complete ways to check the data (data checking, validation or verification) and decide it is good enough (acceptance process). A person must know rules were used to check the data or trust the person who checked the data. If a person cannot tell that this was done, the information still seems to be data for that person, so that person must check the data again, in that general view about data.\nThe Information Age is a historic period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Form","surface_form":"form","offset":109},{"uri":"Learn","surface_form":"learn","offset":169},{"uri":"Know","surface_form":"know","offset":176},{"uri":"Understand","surface_form":"understand","offset":191},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":218},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":259},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":369},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":418},{"uri":"Information_science","surface_form":"information science","offset":483},{"uri":"Information_technology","surface_form":"information technology","offset":506},{"uri":"Data_science","surface_form":"data science","offset":540},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":561},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":571},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":661},{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database","offset":670},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":695},{"uri":"Trust","surface_form":"trust","offset":987},{"uri":"Correct","surface_form":"correct","offset":1015},{"uri":"Validation","surface_form":"validation","offset":1156},{"uri":"Verification","surface_form":"verification","offset":1170},{"uri":"Acceptance","surface_form":"acceptance","offset":1214},{"uri":"Information_Age","surface_form":"Information Age","offset":1509}]}
