It orbits the Sun-like star Upsilon Andromedae A.\nUpsilon Andromedae A was the third star known to host a multiple-planet planetary system, the others are the Sun and the pulsar PSR 1257+12.\nIn 1999, two groups of astronomers independently concluded that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae C and Upsilon Andromedae D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extrasolar_planet","surface_form":"extrasolar planet","offset":27},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":49},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":60},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":69},{"uri":"Host","surface_form":"host","offset":145},{"uri":"Planetary_system","surface_form":"planetary system","offset":168},{"uri":"Pulsar","surface_form":"pulsar","offset":217}]}
