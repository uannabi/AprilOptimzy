{"id":36102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefort_cheese","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"For other uses, see\" Roquefort (disambiguation)\nRoquefort cheese is a kind of blue cheese. It comes from the south of France. It is made from sheep's milk. French laws about AOC say that only cheese from the region of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon (close to Millau) may be called Roquefort cheese.\nOverview.\nThe cheese breaks into little pieces easily. It is a little moist. Blue mould is added to Roquefort cheese. This gives it a particular taste. Roquefort is made in big wheels. They weigh around 2.5 kilograms. They are about 10 cm thick. Roquefort needs to ripen for around 5 months. It is best eaten April to October, but of course it is available all year round.\nIn the year 2003, there were seven Roquefort producers. The largest by far is Roquefort Soci\u00E9t\u00E9. Roquefort Papillon is also a well-known brand. The five other producers are Carles, Gabriel Coulet, Fromageries occitanes, Verni\u00E8res and Le Vieux Berger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roquefort_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"Roquefort (disambiguation)","offset":36},{"uri":"Blue_cheese","surface_form":"blue cheese","offset":93},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":133},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":157},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":165},{"uri":"Appellation_d%27Origine_Contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e","surface_form":"AOC","offset":189},{"uri":"Roquefort-sur-Soulzon","surface_form":"Roquefort-sur-Soulzon","offset":233},{"uri":"Millau","surface_form":"Millau","offset":265},{"uri":"Mould","surface_form":"mould","offset":387},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":482},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilogram","offset":512}]}
