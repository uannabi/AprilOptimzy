{"id":361163,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousebird","text":"A mousebird is one of a small group of birds. They are not closely related to other groups of birds. Though they and the parrots and cockatoos (Psittaciformes) may be closer to each other than to other birds. The mousebirds are given order status as Coliiformes. This group only lives in sub-Saharan Africa. They had a wider range in prehistoric times and apparently evolved in Europe.\nDescription.\nThey are slender greyish or brown birds with soft, hairlike body feathers. They are typically about 10\u00A0cm in body length. They have a long, thin, tail a further 20\u201324\u00A0cm in length. They weigh 45\u201355\u00A0grams. They are arboreal and scurry through the leaves like rodents, in search of berries, fruit and buds. This habit, and their legs, is the reason for the group's English name. They can feed upside down. They have crests and stubby bills.\nMousebirds are very talkative. They are found in bands of about twenty in lightly wooded country.\nThese birds build cup-shaped twig nests in trees, which are lined with grasses. 2\u20134 eggs are typically laid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":39},{"uri":"Psittaciformes","surface_form":"Psittaciformes","offset":144},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":234},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":300},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolve","offset":367},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":378},{"uri":"Feathers","surface_form":"feathers","offset":464},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":613},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":657},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":762},{"uri":"Crest_(feathers)","surface_form":"crests","offset":813}]}
