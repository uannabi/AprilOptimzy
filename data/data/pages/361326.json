{"id":361326,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_River","text":"The Saigon River () is a river in Vietnam. It begins at Lake Dau Tieng (in its water-catchment area) near the country of Cambodia.\nThe river flows south and south-southeast for about. Most of the rivers in the Mekong Delta region have a water-table and canal connection. The system of rivers and canals for southern Vietnam help with water transport for commercial activities. The water supplies many businesses and agricultural (farm) operations.\nThe Saigon River has a river port at Ho Chi Minh City. It ends just after the Phu My Bridge (). The Saigon River ends by meeting another two rivers, the Nha Be and Dong Nai rivers. The lower end of the river is on the flood plain, and is therefore subject to tide change from the sea and delta. Ho Chi Minh City regularly floods (in areas that get a lot of floods) with either tidewater or rainwater.\nThe river system has many fish. Recently the government released native fish to improve the population. Fish, shrimp, and snails are popular for farming.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":25},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":34},{"uri":"Water-catchment","surface_form":"water-catchment","offset":79},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":121},{"uri":"Flow","surface_form":"flow","offset":141},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"Mekong Delta","offset":210},{"uri":"Water-table","surface_form":"water-table","offset":237},{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canal","offset":253},{"uri":"Commercial","surface_form":"commercial","offset":354},{"uri":"Agricultural","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":416},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":477},{"uri":"Ho_Chi_Minh_City","surface_form":"Ho Chi Minh City","offset":485},{"uri":"Tidal","surface_form":"tidewater","offset":825},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":838},{"uri":"Native","surface_form":"native","offset":914},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":959},{"uri":"Snail","surface_form":"snail","offset":971}]}
