{"id":3614,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel","text":"Travel is the activity of going from one place to another place. When a person makes the same trip every day to work or school, this type of travelling is usually called \"commuting.\" Some people travel to other cities as part of their job. This is called \"business travel.\" When many people travel to a distant place to stay, it is called \"human migration\".\nSome people travel on their vacation, to visit other towns, cities, or countries. This is tourism. These people stay overnight in hotels, hostels, motels, apartments or bed and breakfast. Some prefer camping. Through the centuries, modes of travel have changed. Some people (travel writers) write about travelling in books including autobiographies or journals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_migration","surface_form":"human migration","offset":340},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":448},{"uri":"Bed_and_breakfast","surface_form":"bed and breakfast","offset":527},{"uri":"Camping","surface_form":"camping","offset":558},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiographies","offset":691},{"uri":"Journal","surface_form":"journal","offset":710}]}
