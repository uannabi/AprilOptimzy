{"id":361450,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink-footed_goose","text":"The pink-footed goose (\"Anser brachyrhynchus\") is a goose which breeds in eastern Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard. It is migratory. It winters in northwest Europe, especially Great Britain, the Netherlands, and western Denmark.\nIt is a medium-sized goose, 60\u201375\u00A0cm (24\u201330\u00A0in) long. The wingspan is 135\u2013170\u00A0 (53\u201367\u00A0in) cm. It weighs 1.8\u20133.4\u00A0kg (4\u20137.5 lbs). It has a short bill, bright pink in the middle with a black base and tip, and pink feet. The body is grey-brown, the head and neck a richer, darker brown, the rump white, and the tail grey with a broad white tip.\nEcology.\nNesting is often on cliffs close to glaciers. This gives protection from mammalian predators (mainly Arctic Fox). Three to six eggs are laid in early to mid May in Iceland, late May in Svalbard. Incubation lasts 26\u201327 days. On hatching, the goslings go with the parents on foot to the nearest lake. They fledge after about 56 days. Southbound migration is from mid September to early October, and northbound from mid April to early May.\nThe diet is almost entirely vegetarian. In summer, they feed on a wide range of tundra plants, both on land and in water. In winter, they graze mostly on oilseed rape, sugar beet, potato, and various grasses. Damage to crops can be large.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Goose","surface_form":"goose","offset":52},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":82},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":93},{"uri":"Svalbard","surface_form":"Svalbard","offset":105},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migratory","offset":121},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":175},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":194},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":219},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":598},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":614},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":651},{"uri":"Arctic_Fox","surface_form":"Arctic Fox","offset":679},{"uri":"Incubation","surface_form":"Incubation","offset":773},{"uri":"Tundra","surface_form":"tundra","offset":1095},{"uri":"Oilseed_rape","surface_form":"oilseed rape","offset":1169},{"uri":"Sugar_beet","surface_form":"sugar beet","offset":1183},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":1195},{"uri":"Poaceae","surface_form":"grasses","offset":1215}]}
