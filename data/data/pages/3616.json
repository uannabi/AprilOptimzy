{"id":3616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader","text":"A leader is somebody whom people follow. A leader has authority. For people to accept a leader, his or her leadership must therefore be legitimate.\nBecause people follow a leader, the leader can make people do things. A leader can therefore make people work together towards a common goal.\nAn example of a leader is the head of government of a country. People within the government \"follow\" the leader, and citizens look to the head of government for inspiration and guidance. Sometimes, when a head of government lacks legitimacy, people will stop following him or her. The head of government is therefore no longer able to lead properly. This may result in a new election, or in worst case civil war.\nA group with no leader is called leaderless.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Authority","surface_form":"authority","offset":54},{"uri":"Legitimacy","surface_form":"legitimate","offset":136},{"uri":"Goal","surface_form":"goal","offset":284},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":320},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":665},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"civil war","offset":692}]}
