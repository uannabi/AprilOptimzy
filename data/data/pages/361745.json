{"id":361745,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference","text":"e=\"preserve\">RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in living cells. It adjusts (moderates) the activity of their genes. RNAi molecules are a key to gene regulation. In 2006, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", published in 1998.\nTwo types of small RNA molecules\u00A0\u2013 microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u00A0\u2013 do the work. These small RNAs bind to normal messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and increase or decrease their activity. They can prevent a mRNA from producing a protein. RNA interference defends cells against foreign nucleotide sequences\u00A0\u2013 viruses and transposons. Also, they control development, and gene expression in general.\nThe RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes including animals. RNAi is a valuable research tool, in cell culture and in living organisms. Synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can suppress specific genes of interest. RNAi may be used for large-scale screens that shut down each gene to analyse cellular process or cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology and medicine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":112},{"uri":"Gene_regulation","surface_form":"gene regulation","offset":147},{"uri":"Andrew_Fire","surface_form":"Andrew Fire","offset":173},{"uri":"Craig_Mello","surface_form":"Craig Mello","offset":189},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":212},{"uri":"Nematode","surface_form":"nematode","offset":292},{"uri":"Caenorhabditis_elegans","surface_form":"Caenorhabditis elegans","offset":307},{"uri":"Ribonucleic_acid","surface_form":"RNA","offset":370},{"uri":"MicroRNA","surface_form":"microRNA","offset":386},{"uri":"Small_interfering_RNA","surface_form":"small interfering RNA","offset":407},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":484},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":597},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":676},{"uri":"Transposon","surface_form":"transposon","offset":688},{"uri":"Developmental_biology","surface_form":"development","offset":720},{"uri":"Gene_expression","surface_form":"gene expression","offset":737},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":799},{"uri":"Cell_culture","surface_form":"cell culture","offset":866},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":1080},{"uri":"Biotechnology","surface_form":"biotechnology","offset":1143},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":1161}]}
