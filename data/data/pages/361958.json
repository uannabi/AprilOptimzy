South of the Little Sandy Desert is the Great Sandy Desert and to west of it is Gibson Desert. It is to the east of Great Northern Highway, which is south of the town Newman and about 200 kilometres north of Wiluna.\nIt is named because it is close and looks like the Great Sandy Desert, but it is much smaller. Both deserts are crossed by the Canning Stock Route.\nIt is one of Western Australia's \"Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia\" (IBRA) regions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":29},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":39},{"uri":"Great_Sandy_Desert","surface_form":"Great Sandy Desert","offset":98},{"uri":"Great_Northern_Highway","surface_form":"Great Northern Highway","offset":174},{"uri":"Newman%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Newman","offset":225},{"uri":"Wiluna%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Wiluna","offset":266}]}
