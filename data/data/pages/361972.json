It was developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912.\nDefinition.\nThe Gini coefficient is usually a number between 0 and 1 (or 0 to 100). 0 means a country where the income is equally distributed. On the other hand, 1 means that one person owns everything but the rest owns nothing. In reality, all scores are between 0.25 and 0.6 (between 25 and 60 on the 0 to 100 scale).\nStatistics.\nThe table below is about the \"world\" Gini coefficient (not by single countries).\nThe table below shows the income Gini coefficient of the United States from 1947 to 2009.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measure","offset":71},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":97},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":129},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistician","offset":137},{"uri":"Corrado_Gini","surface_form":"Corrado Gini","offset":150},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":642}]}
