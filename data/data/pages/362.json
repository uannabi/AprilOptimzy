{"id":362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Internet is the biggest world-wide communication network of computers. The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry many different kinds of information. The short form of internet is the 'net'. The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world.\nThe Internet was developed in the United States by the \"United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\" (DARPA). The Internet was first connected in October of 1969 and was called ARPANET. The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a British (UK) scientist named Tim Berners-Lee.\nToday, people can pay money to access the Internet from internet service providers. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes people who offer these free services use advertising to make money. Censorship and freedom of speech on the Internet can be controversial.\nServices on the Internet.\nThe Internet is used for many things, such as electronic mail, online chat, file transfer and other documents of the World Wide Web.\nThe most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web (which is also called the \"Web\" or \u201Cwww\u201D). The web contains websites, including blogs and wikis like Wikipedia. Webpages on the Internet can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a password, or it is blocked).\nThe second biggest use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one user to another. Instant messaging is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other faster.\nSome governments think the internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it. For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad, so often no one in China can read it or add to it. Another example of the internet being blocked is in North Korea. Some parents and schools block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see.\nDangers on the Internet.\nThe Internet makes communication easy, and communication can be dangerous too. People often send secret information, and sometimes other people can steal that information. They can use the Internet to spread lies or stolen secrets or dangerously bad advice. For example, Facebook has had some problems with privacy settings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":66},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":135},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":145},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":159},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":225},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web","surface_form":"World Wide Web","offset":283},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Defense","surface_form":"United States Department of Defense","offset":439},{"uri":"DARPA","surface_form":"DARPA","offset":511},{"uri":"ARPANET","surface_form":"ARPANET","offset":586},{"uri":"CERN","surface_form":"CERN","offset":629},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":637},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":662},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":671},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":675},{"uri":"Tim_Berners-Lee","surface_form":"Tim Berners-Lee","offset":691},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":730},{"uri":"Internet_service_provider","surface_form":"internet service provider","offset":764},{"uri":"Advertising","surface_form":"advertising","offset":894},{"uri":"Freedom_of_speech","surface_form":"freedom of speech","offset":936},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"electronic mail","offset":1064},{"uri":"Online_chat","surface_form":"online chat","offset":1081},{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"file","offset":1094},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web","surface_form":"World Wide Web","offset":1135},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web","surface_form":"World Wide Web","offset":1196},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":1271},{"uri":"Blog","surface_form":"blog","offset":1291},{"uri":"Wiki","surface_form":"wiki","offset":1301},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":1312},{"uri":"Webpage","surface_form":"Webpage","offset":1323},{"uri":"Password","surface_form":"password","offset":1404},{"uri":"User","surface_form":"user","offset":1539},{"uri":"Instant_messaging","surface_form":"Instant messaging","offset":1556},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1821},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":1905},{"uri":"Parent","surface_form":"parent","offset":1923},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":1994},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":2307},{"uri":"Privacy","surface_form":"privacy","offset":2343}]}
