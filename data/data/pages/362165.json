{"id":362165,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Doisneau","text":"Robert Doisneau (14 April 1912 - 1 April 1994) was a French photographer. In the 1930s he used a Leica on the streets of Paris. He and Henri Cartier-Bresson were pioneers of photojournalism.\nAs a young man Doisneau attended the \u00C9cole Estienne in Paris to learn the crafts involved in the book trade, but he always claimed that the streets of the working-class neighbourhood of Gentilly provided his most important schooling. In 1929, in an effort to improve his draftsmanship, he began photographing, just as Modernist ideas were beginning to promote photography as the prime medium for advertising and reportage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"14_April","surface_form":"14 April","offset":17},{"uri":"1912","surface_form":"1912","offset":26},{"uri":"1_April","surface_form":"1 April","offset":33},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":41},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":53},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":60},{"uri":"1930s","surface_form":"1930s","offset":81},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":121},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":265},{"uri":"1929","surface_form":"1929","offset":428},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":551}]}
