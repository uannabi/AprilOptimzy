{"id":362204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, sets can be used to make new sets. Given two sets \"A\" and \"B\", the Cartesian product of \"A\" with \"B\" is written as \"A \u00D7 B\", and is the set of all ordered pairs whose first element is a member of \"A\", and whose second element is a member of \"B\".\nThe set of a Cartesian product can be visualized as a two-dimensional table, with its entry being its elements.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Ordered_pair","surface_form":"ordered pairs","offset":175}]}
