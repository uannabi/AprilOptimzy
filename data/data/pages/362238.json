{"id":362238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(lignite)","text":"Jet is a geological material considered to be a minor gemstone. It is originally a wood product called lignite, squeezed and heated by geological processes. The older definition of mineral did not apply to organic material. Therefore, jet was not called a mineral, but instead a \"mineraloid\". However, this view is changing, as so many crystalline materials have organic origin.\nThe English noun \"jet\" comes from the French word for the same material: \"jaiet\". Jet is either black or dark brown, but may contain pyrite inclusions, which are of brassy colour and metallic lustre. The adjective \"jet-black\", meaning as dark a black as possible, comes from this material.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geological","surface_form":"geological","offset":9},{"uri":"Gemstone","surface_form":"gemstone","offset":54},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":181},{"uri":"Organic","surface_form":"organic","offset":206},{"uri":"Jais","surface_form":"jaiet","offset":453},{"uri":"Pyrite","surface_form":"pyrite","offset":512},{"uri":"Inclusion_(mineral)","surface_form":"inclusions","offset":519},{"uri":"Lustre_(mineralogy)","surface_form":"lustre","offset":571}]}
