{"id":362581,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide","text":"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), also known as lipoglycans, are large molecules made of a lipid and a polysaccharide joined by a covalent bond.\nThey occur in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and act as triggers for the innate immune system. Their presence is sensed by toll-like receptors on dendritic cells. This causes a strong immune response in animals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":64},{"uri":"Lipid","surface_form":"lipid","offset":84},{"uri":"Polysaccharide","surface_form":"polysaccharide","offset":96},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent bond","offset":123},{"uri":"Gram-negative","surface_form":"Gram-negative","offset":174},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":188},{"uri":"Innate_immune_system","surface_form":"innate immune system","offset":226},{"uri":"Toll-like_receptor","surface_form":"toll-like receptor","offset":276},{"uri":"Dendritic_cell","surface_form":"dendritic cell","offset":299},{"uri":"Immune_response","surface_form":"immune response","offset":337}]}
