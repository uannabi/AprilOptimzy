{"id":362617,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricomycetes","text":"Agaricomycetes is a class of fungi. Agaricomycetes include 17 orders, 100 families, 1147 genera, and 20951 species.\nAll members of this class produce basidiocarps and these range in size from tiny cups a few millimeters across to a giant polypore (\"Fomitiporia ellipsoidea\") greater than several meters across and weighing up to.\nThe group also includes what are arguably the largest and oldest individual organisms on earth: the mycelium of \"Armillaria gallica\" have been estimated to extend over 150,000\u00A0square metres (37\u00A0acres) with a mass of 10,000\u00A0kg (22,000\u00A0lb) and an age of 1,500\u00A0years.\nNearly all species in the class are terrestrial (although a few are aquatic). They mostly function as decayers, especially of wood. However, some species are pathogenic or parasitic, and yet others are symbiotic. These include the important ectomycorrhizal symbionts of forest trees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":20},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":29},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"orders","offset":62},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":74},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":89},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":107},{"uri":"Basidiocarp","surface_form":"basidiocarp","offset":150},{"uri":"Polypore","surface_form":"polypore","offset":238},{"uri":"Mycelium","surface_form":"mycelium","offset":430},{"uri":"Armillaria_gallica","surface_form":"Armillaria gallica","offset":443},{"uri":"Parasitism","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":767},{"uri":"Symbiosis","surface_form":"symbiotic","offset":797},{"uri":"Mycorrhiza","surface_form":"mycorrhiza","offset":840}]}
