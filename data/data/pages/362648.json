The pie is usually served with ice cream.\nIt is popular because of the amount of chocolate in each serving.\nThe name \"Mississippi mud pie\" comes from the dense cake which looks like the banks of the Mississippi River.\nIt is believed that this dish was made by home cooks after World War II. This is because it was made of simple ingredients that could be found at any supermarket and did not need any special cooking tools.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":25},{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":41},{"uri":"Pie","surface_form":"pie","offset":49},{"uri":"Chocolate_syrup","surface_form":"chocolate sauce","offset":76},{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":152},{"uri":"Bank_(geography)","surface_form":"banks","offset":307},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":320},{"uri":"Home_cook","surface_form":"home cook","offset":381},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":398},{"uri":"Cooking_tool","surface_form":"cooking tool","offset":530}]}
