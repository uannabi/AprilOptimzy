{"id":3635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness","text":"Blindness is to not see anything. Some people are called blind, even though they can see a little bit. This is because they cannot see clearly, but only see unfocused shapes or colors.\nIn modern countries, few young people are blind. In all the world, blindness is mostly caused by malnutrition and diseases of old people, like cataracts and trachoma. People can become blind because of diseases or accidents, but sometimes people are born blind.\nSome people are \"color blind\", which means they can see, but cannot tell certain colors apart.\nWhen people are blind they use such things as the alphabet in \"braille\" and \"guide dogs\" to do every day life things.\nFamous blind people have included Louis Braille, the inventor of the braille alphabet, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles and Helen Keller.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sight","surface_form":"see","offset":20},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"colors","offset":177},{"uri":"Malnutrition","surface_form":"malnutrition","offset":282},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":299},{"uri":"Cataract","surface_form":"cataract","offset":328},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":399},{"uri":"Color_blindness","surface_form":"color blind","offset":464},{"uri":"Braille_script","surface_form":"braille","offset":605},{"uri":"Guide_dog","surface_form":"guide dog","offset":619},{"uri":"Louis_Braille","surface_form":"Louis Braille","offset":694},{"uri":"Braille","surface_form":"braille","offset":729},{"uri":"Stevie_Wonder","surface_form":"Stevie Wonder","offset":747},{"uri":"Ray_Charles","surface_form":"Ray Charles","offset":762},{"uri":"Helen_Keller","surface_form":"Helen Keller","offset":778}]}
