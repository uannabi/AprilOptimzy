{"id":36372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian","text":"A radian is a unit of measuring angles. It is shown by the symbol \"rad\" or, less often, c (for circular measure). The radian was once an SI supplementary unit, but was changed to a derived unit in 1995.\nUsage.\nMost people who do mathematics or physics use radians, rather than degrees, because some kinds of calculations, mostly in trigonometry and calculus, are simpler when using radians rather than degrees. Thus, most calculations related to angular frequency (such as angular velocity) use radians per second.\nPeople who look through a telescope or sniper scope often use milliradians to describe distances as seen through it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":32},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":137},{"uri":"Supplementary_unit","surface_form":"supplementary unit","offset":140},{"uri":"Degree_(angle)","surface_form":"degrees","offset":277},{"uri":"Trigonometry","surface_form":"trigonometry","offset":332},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":349},{"uri":"Angular_frequency","surface_form":"angular frequency","offset":446},{"uri":"Angular_velocity","surface_form":"angular velocity","offset":473},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":541},{"uri":"Sniper_scope","surface_form":"sniper scope","offset":554}]}
