{"id":363748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missak_Manouchian","text":"e=\"preserve\">Missak Manouchian (1 September 1906 - 21 February 1944) was a French-Armenian poet, a militant in the MOI (\"Immigrant Workforce Movement\") in the Paris region. He was 37 years old when executed by the Nazis for his R\u00E9sistance work.\nAlthough Manouchian became well known for his leadership in the French Resistance, he was, above all, an intellectual and a talented poet.\nManouchian posthumously was awarded by the Legion of Honor highest order. In 2009 Robert Gu\u00E9diguian directed a film, \"The Army of Crime\", dedicated to Manouchian and his group.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":159},{"uri":"Nazis","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":214},{"uri":"Legion_of_Honor","surface_form":"Legion of Honor","offset":427},{"uri":"Robert_Gu%C3%A9diguian","surface_form":"Robert Gu\u00E9diguian","offset":466}]}
