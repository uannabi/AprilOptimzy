His \"Blue-backed Speller\" books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read. His dictionary was first published in 1828 as \"An American Dictionary of the English Language\".\nCopyright.\nWebster worried that his \"Grammatical Institute\" might be pirated. He had to seek copyright protection from each state. At last, on May 31, 1790, President George Washington signed the United States\u2019 first general copyright act into law. Later, Webster lobbied for an extended copyright law. He wrote \u201CBy this bill the term of copy-right is secured for 28 years, with the right of renewal \u2026 for 14 years more. If this should become law, I shall be much benefited.\u201D The new federal copyright law was passed and remained in effect until 1909.\nThe Blue-backed Speller.\n385 'editions' (mostly reprints) in his lifetime; by 1837 15 million copies sold; by 1890 60 million copies sold.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionary","offset":89},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":114},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":448},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":522}]}
