Thornton first became known for his acting on the CBS sitcom \"Hearts Afire\" and in a number of early 1990s movies. These movies included \"On Deadly Ground\" and \"Tombstone\". In the mid-1990s, after writing, directing, and starring in the independent movie \"Sling Blade\", he won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He had many large movie roles after \"Sling Blade\" 's success. These included 1998's \"Armageddon\" and \"A Simple Plan.\" During the late 1990s, Thornton began a career as a singer-songwriter. He has released three albums. Thorton was the singer in a blues rock band.\nEarly life.\nThornton was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He is the son of Virginia Roberta (n\u00E9e Faulkner), a psychic, and William Raymond \"Billy Ray\" Thornton, a high school history teacher and basketball coach. His father died when Thornton was 18. He has two younger brothers, Jimmy Don and John David. During his childhood, Thornton lived in both Alpine, Arkansas, and Malvern, Arkansas. He was raised a Methodist. Thorton grew up in a large family in a shack. It did not have electricity nor plumbing. Thornton graduated from high school in 1973. He was good high school baseball player. He tried out for the Kansas City Royals, but was let go after an injury.\nIn the mid 1980s, Thornton moved to Los Angeles to become an actor. At first, Thornton had a hard time becoming an actor. He worked in telemarketing, offshore wind farming, and fast food management while trying to get acting jobs. He also played drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While Thornton worked as a waiter for an event, he served movie director and screenwriter Billy Wilder. Wilder is known for movies that include \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\". Thornton talked with Wilder, who told Thornton to think about a career as a screenwriter.\nFilm.\nBilly Bob's first role was in 1980s \"South of Reno\". He played a small role as a man in a restaurant. Billy Bob was also in a 1987 episode of Andy Griffith's series \"Matlock\". Another one of Thornton's early roles was on the CBS sitcom \"Hearts Afire\" with John Ritter and Markie Post. His role as the villain in the 1992 movie \"One False Move\" got him noticed by the critics. He also had small roles in the early 1990s movies \"Indecent Proposal\", \"On Deadly Ground\", \"Bound by Honor\", \"Grey Knight\", and \"Tombstone\". Thornton did what Wilder told him to do. He wrote, direct and star in the independent movie \"Sling Blade\". The movie was released in 1996. The movie was an expansion of a short named \"Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade\". It told the story of Karl Childers, a mentally handicapped man imprisoned for murder. \"Sling Blade\" was well liked internationally. Thornton's screenplay earned him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award. His acting in the movie earned him an Oscar and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Actor.\nIn 1998, he played the James-Carville-like Richard Jemmons in \"Primary Colors\". Thornton wrote the movie version of the book \"All the Pretty Horses\" as a 2000 movie with the same name. The movie starred Matt Damon and Pen\u00E9lope Cruz. After he was forced to cut more than an hour of the movie, he decided to never direct another movie. Also in 2000, an early script he had written was made into \"The Gift\". It starred Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, and Giovanni Ribisi. In 2000, he also appeared in Travis Tritt's music video for the song \"Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde\".\nThe press usually describe Thorton as a \"tattooed, hirsute man's man\". He had many large movie roles after \"Sling Blade\" 's success. These include 1998's \"Armageddon\" with Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis, \"A Simple Plan\", \"Monster's Ball\", \"Bandits\" and \"The Man Who Wasn't There\". He played a mall Santa Claus in 2003's \"Bad Santa\". It was a black comedy that did very good at the box office. The movie made Thornton notable as a leading comic actor. Thornton has said that, after \"Bad Santas success, audiences \"like to watch [him] play that kind of guy,\" and \"they [casting directors] call [him] up when they need an asshole. It's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be.\" In 2004 he played Davy Crockett in \"The Alamo\".\nHe was in the comic movie \"School for Scoundrels\" in 2006. More recent movies include \"The Astronaut Farmer\" and the comedy, \"Mr. Woodcock\". In September 2008, Thornton starred in the action movie \"Eagle Eye\" with Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.

They separated in June 2002 and divorced the following year.\nSince 2003, Thornton has been in a relationship with Connie Angland. They have a daughter, Bella.
