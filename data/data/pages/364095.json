Makano in Panama means \"strong like a tree\". At the age of 12, Jim\u00E9nez was part of a reggaeton group called \"Los Makanos\". The members of the group made a promise that the first of them to record a full disc would carry on the group's name.\nWhen he was 16, Jim\u00E9nez was writing quality music. His father discouraged him from music, saying he needed to get a real job. After several years of trying, Jimenez appeared on the CD \"La Alianza\" in 2004. Afterward, he was given the chance to record several songs which later became number one hits in Panama. In 2007, Jimenez signed with Panama Music. He recorded his first album as a solo singer, \"Te Amo\", which features the songs \"Yo Quisiera Vivir\", \"Te Va a Doler\", \"Te Amo\" and \"D\u00E9jame Entrar\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":46},{"uri":"Reggaeton","surface_form":"reggaeton","offset":195}]}
