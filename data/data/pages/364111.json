{"id":364111,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe","text":"=\"preserve\">Mok\u00E8l\u00E9-mb\u00E8mb\u00E9, meaning \"one who stops the flow of rivers\" in the Lingala language is a legendary water-dwelling creature of Congo River basin folklore, sometimes described as living creature, sometimes as a spirit, and loosely analogous to the Loch Ness Monster in Western culture. It is claimed to be a sauropod by some cryptozoologists.\nExpeditions mounted in the hope of finding evidence of the Mok\u00E8l\u00E9-mb\u00E8mb\u00E9 have failed, and the subject has been covered in a number of books and by a number of television documentaries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lingala_language","surface_form":"Lingala language","offset":77},{"uri":"Congo_River","surface_form":"Congo River","offset":136},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":194},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":219},{"uri":"Loch_Ness_Monster","surface_form":"Loch Ness Monster","offset":256},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":316},{"uri":"Cryptozoology","surface_form":"cryptozoologists","offset":333},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":485},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":510}]}
