{"id":364758,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Smith_(sea_captain)","text":"Edward John \"E. J.\" Smith (27 January 1850 \u2013 15 April 1912) was an English sea captain. He was the captain of the R.M.S Titanic, which sank when it struck an iceberg. Smith was to retire after the maiden voyage of the Titanic, but he died when the ship sank.\nSmith was born on 27 January 1850 in Hanley, Staffordshire, England. He was married to Sarah Eleanor Pennington from 1887 until his death in 1912. They had one daughter.\nJust minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing \"Titanics crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators room and released Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride and senior wireless operator John \"Jack\" Phillips from their duties. He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: \"Now it's every man for himself.\" Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say \"Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves.\u201D He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone just seconds before the ship took its final plunge. This was the last reliable sighting of Smith. Just seconds later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty.\nSmith died that night along with around 1,500 others, and his body was never recovered.\nThere are conflicting accounts of his death; Some claimed to have seen Smith in the water swimming towards a lifeboat, or near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\", others claimed saw shooting himself with a pistol. Other accounts describe him entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed. The actual fate of captain Smith will probably remain uncertain. His body was never recovered.\nSmith has been played by many actors during documentaries, movies, television series, or plays. The most well known actors to play Smith are George C. Scott and Bernard Hill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"English","offset":67},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":99},{"uri":"R.M.S_Titanic","surface_form":"R.M.S Titanic","offset":114},{"uri":"Iceberg","surface_form":"iceberg","offset":158},{"uri":"Hanley","surface_form":"Hanley","offset":296},{"uri":"Staffordshire","surface_form":"Staffordshire","offset":304},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":319},{"uri":"Harold_Bride","surface_form":"Harold Bride","offset":623},{"uri":"John_George_Phillips_(wireless_officer)","surface_form":"John \"Jack\" Phillips","offset":665},{"uri":"George_C._Scott","surface_form":"George C.
