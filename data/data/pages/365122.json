{"id":365122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegomastax","text":"\"Pegomastax\" (\"strong jaw\") is a genus of small heterodontosaur dinosaur discovered in Lower Jurassic rocks in South Africa. It is based on a skull in the Iziko South African Museum in Cape Town.\nIt was collected during a 1966\u20131967 expedition but not named and described until recently. Paul Sereno, who had recognized it as unusual in the 1980s, published a description in 2012. The type species is \"P. africana\". \"Pegomastax\" differed from other heterodontosaurs by details of the skull. The lower jaw was robust, with a short beak. Like most other heterodontosaurs, \"Pegomastax\" had an enlarged canine-like tooth at the beginning of the lower jaw's tooth row, which may have been used for defence. The rest of its teeth were those of a herbivore.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":33},{"uri":"Heterodontosauridae","surface_form":"heterodontosaur","offset":48},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":64},{"uri":"Lower_Jurassic","surface_form":"Lower Jurassic","offset":87},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":111},{"uri":"Holotype","surface_form":"based on","offset":131},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":142},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":185},{"uri":"Paul_Sereno","surface_form":"Paul Sereno","offset":287},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":384},{"uri":"Canine_tooth","surface_form":"canine","offset":598},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":739}]}
