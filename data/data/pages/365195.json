{"id":365195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir","text":"John Muir (21 April 1838 \u2013 24 December 1914) was an influential Scottish-born American naturalist, author, environmental philosopher, glaciologist, writer, and early advocate of preservation of wilderness in the United States.\nHis letters, essays, and books of his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, have been read by millions of people. Among his many notable journeys throughout the wilderness, Muir traveled from the Upper Mississippi Basin to the Gulf of Mexico and kept a journal of his travels called A Thousand-Mile Walk\"<nowiki/>'. Muir felt that the national parks and forests needed to be preserved and some resources which should be off-limits to industrial use. His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and many other wilderness areas throughout the United States. The Sierra Club, which he co-founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States.\nIn 1867, when he was 29, Muir was temporarily blinded in an accident in an Indianapolis sawmill, when his right cornea was pierced by a stray file.\nOne of the most well-known hiking trails in the U.S., the John Muir Trail, was named in his honor. Other places named in his honor are Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College, Mount Muir, Camp Muir and Muir Glacier. For his outstanding accomplishments in preserving America's environment, he is known to many as the \"Father of the National Parks\" and \"son of the wilderness\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":64},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":78},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":87},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"wilderness","offset":194},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":212},{"uri":"Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)","surface_form":"Sierra Nevada","offset":305},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":332},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":495},{"uri":"Yosemite_Valley","surface_form":"Yosemite Valley","offset":754},{"uri":"Sequoia_National_Park","surface_form":"Sequoia National Park","offset":771},{"uri":"Sierra_Club","surface_form":"Sierra Club","offset":859},{"uri":"1867","surface_form":"1867","offset":978},{"uri":"John_Muir_Trail","surface_form":"John Muir Trail","offset":1181},{"uri":"Muir_Woods_National_Monument","surface_form":"Muir Woods National Monument","offset":1258},{"uri":"Muir_Beach","surface_form":"Muir Beach","offset":1288},{"uri":"John_Muir_College","surface_form":"John Muir College","offset":1300},{"uri":"Mount_Muir","surface_form":"Mount Muir","offset":1319},{"uri":"Camp_Muir","surface_form":"Camp Muir","offset":1331},{"uri":"Muir_Glacier","surface_form":"Muir Glacier","offset":1345}]}
