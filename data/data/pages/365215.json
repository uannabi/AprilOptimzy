{"id":365215,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_fighting","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dog fighting is a blood sport that involves several dogs fighting at one time; sometimes many dogs are involved. The practice of dog fighting goes back to the ancient times. Dog fighting is forbidden in Australia, the United States and Canada. All fifty U.S. States classify dog fighting as a felony and attending a dog fight is not allowed in many US States.\nIn dog fighting breeds, \"gameness\" is valued as it gives the dog the ability to maintain the attack in baiting, despite ripped flesh, dehydration, exhaustion or broken bones. As one writer describes it, \"Game is the dog that won't quit fighting, the dog that'll die in the ring, the dog that'll fight with two broken legs.\" Training of a game dog varies depending on the level and experience of the dog-fighter. A famous American \"gamebred\" breed of dog is the American Pit Bull Terrier. A famous Irish \"gamebred\" breed of dog is the Kerry Blue Terrier. A famous English \"gamebred\" breed of dog is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. A famous Japanese \"gamebred\" breed of dog is the Tosa Inu. A famous Argentinian \"gamebred\" breed of dog is the Dogo Argentino.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":31},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":37},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":65},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":216},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":231},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":249},{"uri":"Bait_(dogs)","surface_form":"baiting","offset":476},{"uri":"Flesh","surface_form":"flesh","offset":500},{"uri":"Fatigue_(physical)","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":507},{"uri":"Exhaustion","surface_form":"exhaustion","offset":520},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":541},{"uri":"American_Pit_Bull_Terrier","surface_form":"American Pit Bull Terrier","offset":834},{"uri":"Kerry_Blue_Terrier","surface_form":"Kerry Blue Terrier","offset":907},{"uri":"Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier","surface_form":"Staffordshire Bull Terrier","offset":975},{"uri":"Tosa_Inu","surface_form":"Tosa Inu","offset":1052},{"uri":"Dogo_Argentino","surface_form":"Dogo Argentino","offset":1114}]}
