The name \"Patapsco\" comes from the language of the Algonquian tribe of Native Americans. The Alginquian word \"pota-psk-ut\" means \"backwater\" or \"tide covered with froth.\"\nThe river runs through central Maryland and empties into the Chesapeake Bay. The mouth of the river, where it enters the Chesapeake Bay, serves as the city of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The river has two tributaries. The North Branch runs north. The South Branch runs east and is the northern border of Howard County, Maryland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":24},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":46},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":62},{"uri":"Eastern_Algonquian_languages","surface_form":"language","offset":124},{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":160},{"uri":"Chesapeake_Bay","surface_form":"Chesapeake Bay","offset":321},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":419},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":463},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":498},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":527},{"uri":"Howard_County%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Howard County, Maryland","offset":562}]}
