{"id":365300,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloprotein","text":"A metalloprotein is a protein that contains a metal ion cofactor. A large fraction of all proteins are members of this category, so the number is very large.\nIt is estimated that about half of all proteins contain a metal. In another estimate, about one-quarter to one-third of all proteins need metals to carry out their functions. Thus, metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":22},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":46},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":52},{"uri":"Cofactor_(biochemistry)","surface_form":"cofactor","offset":56},{"uri":"Category","surface_form":"category","offset":119},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":388},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":403},{"uri":"Signal_transduction","surface_form":"signal transduction","offset":448}]}
