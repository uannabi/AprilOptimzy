{"id":365301,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haem","text":"A haem (British English) (or heme (American English) is a type of co-factor. It is an iron ion in the center of a large organic ring called a \"porphyrin\".\nNot all porphyrins contain iron, but many porphyrin-containing metalloproteins have haem as their co-factor; these are known as haemoproteins. Haems are components of haemoglobin, the red pigment in blood. They are also components of a number of other haemoproteins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":8},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":35},{"uri":"Co-factor","surface_form":"co-factor","offset":66},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":86},{"uri":"Organic","surface_form":"organic","offset":120},{"uri":"Porphyrin","surface_form":"porphyrin","offset":143},{"uri":"Metalloprotein","surface_form":"metalloprotein","offset":218},{"uri":"Haemoprotein","surface_form":"haemoprotein","offset":283},{"uri":"Haemoglobin","surface_form":"haemoglobin","offset":322},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":354}]}
