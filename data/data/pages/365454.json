{"id":365454,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resusci_Anne","text":"Resusci Anne, also known as Rescue Anne, Resusci Annie or CPR Annie, is a training mannequin used for teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is for both emergency workers and members of the general public. Resusci Anne was made by Norwegian toy maker \u00C5smund Laerdal. It was based on the research of Peter Safar and James Elam. It was first used in 1960. The mannequin is made to be just like the human respiratory system and outer body in order to help training.\nSince its first use, several different versions of Resusci Anne have been introduced. These include versions with computer monitoring, and versions that seem like other emergency medical conditions, such as severe wounds and trauma.\nTrainees using the original Resusci Anne were expected to approach the mannequin. After getting no response, the trainees then administered CPR to the mannequin. This system was meant to teach trainees that not all victims require CPR. If a victim can respond when asked if okay, the victim does not need CPR.\nThe face of Resusci Anne was based on \"L'Inconnue de la Seine\". It was the death mask of an unidentified young woman who may have drowned in the Seine River around the late 1880s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mannequin","surface_form":"mannequin","offset":83},{"uri":"Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","surface_form":"cardiopulmonary resuscitation","offset":111},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":241},{"uri":"Asmund_Laerdal","surface_form":"\u00C5smund Laerdal","offset":261},{"uri":"Peter_Safar","surface_form":"Peter Safar","offset":309},{"uri":"James_Elam","surface_form":"James Elam","offset":325},{"uri":"Respiratory_system","surface_form":"respiratory system","offset":412},{"uri":"L%27Inconnue_de_la_Seine","surface_form":"L'Inconnue de la Seine","offset":1055},{"uri":"Death_mask","surface_form":"death mask","offset":1091},{"uri":"Seine","surface_form":"Seine River","offset":1161}]}
