{"id":36577,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artiodactyl","text":"The Artiodactyla are an order of mammals. They are also called even-toed ungulates because they have an even number of toes: two or four. For example, camelids or animals of the Giraffidae family have two toes, but hippopotami have four toes.\nWhales are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related super-order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":24},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":33},{"uri":"Toe","surface_form":"toe","offset":119},{"uri":"Camelid","surface_form":"camelid","offset":151},{"uri":"Giraffidae","surface_form":"Giraffidae","offset":178},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":189},{"uri":"Hippopotamus","surface_form":"hippopotami","offset":215},{"uri":"Whale","surface_form":"Whale","offset":243},{"uri":"Cetartiodactyla","surface_form":"Cetartiodactyla","offset":330}]}
