{"id":365826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossibilism","text":"=\"preserve\">Impossibilism is an idea for bringing about socialism. Impossibilism says that socialists should focus only, or at least mostly, on structural changes to society. They should not seek change through social or political reforms, because trying to bring about meaningful change under a capitalist system is pointless.\nSome political parties that have followed impossibilism include the Socialist Party of Canada, World Socialist Movement companion parties, Proletarian Party and the Socialist League.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":56},{"uri":"Capitalist","surface_form":"capitalist","offset":296}]}
