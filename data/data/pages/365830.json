National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games, after the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A total of 113 athletes, 63 men and 50 women, competed in 17 sports, although two other athletes played as team reserves. Handball was the only sport in a team in which Denmark took part in these Olympic games.\nThe Danish team included several past Olympic champions, one of them defending (the men's lightweight coxless fours team, led by veteran rowers Eskild Ebbesen and Morten J\u00F8rgensen). Notable athletes featured tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, and swimmer Lotte Friis, who won the bronze medal in Beijing. Kim Wraae Knudsen, silver medalist in the men's sprint kayak doubles in Beijing, was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.\nTeam Danmark and the Danish Sports' Union (\"Dansk Idr\u00E6ts-Forbund\", DIF) set a goal of eight medals to be targeted in the medal standings. Team Danmark and DIF also believed Denmark had the best chances of winning a medal in wrestling, shooting, cycling, handball, the equestrian events, rowing, athletics, badminton and sailing. At the end of the Games, Denmark has reached beyond the medal target by a single point.\nDenmark left London with a total of 9 medals (2 gold, 4 silver, and 3 bronze), being considered its most successful Olympics after 64 years. One gold medal were won by rowers Rasmus Quist and Mads Rasmussen in the men's lightweight double sculls, and one gold medal won by track cyclist Lasse Norman Hansen in the first ever men's omnium. Other medals were awarded to the team in sailing, shooting, badminton, and women's rowing. Several Danish athletes, however, nearly missed out of the medal standings in their sporting events, including two from Greco-Roman wrestling.\n Archery.\nThree Danish individual quota places as well as a team quota place were secured at the 2011 World Archery Championships on 6 June 2011, as the Danish team, consisting of Carina Christiansen, Maja Jager and Louise Laursen, finished 8th in the women's recurve event. The same three archers were selected for participation by the NOC on 14 May 2012.\n Badminton.\nThe BWF World Ranking of 1 May 2012 was used for the qualifying for the badminton tournament. This gave Denmark the following quota places: 2 in men's singles, 1 in men's doubles, 1 in women's singles, 1 in women's doubles and 2 in mixed doubles. Nine players were selected on 14 May 2012.\n Boxing.\nDenmark qualified in the following event with one qualifier.\n Sprint.\nDenmark has qualified boats for the following events in the sprint discipline of the canoeing sport.
