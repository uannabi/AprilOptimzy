{"id":365999,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule","text":"e=\"preserve\">In differential calculus, the chain rule is a way of finding the derivative of a function. It is used where the function is within another function. This is called a composite function.\nwhere \"g\" is a function differentiable at \"x\" and \"f\" is a function differentiable at \"g\"(\"x\"), then the derivative of formula_1, written as formula_1, exists, and is equal to\nSteps.\n1. Find the derivative of the outside function (all of it at once).\n2. Find the derivative of the inside function (the bit between the brackets).\n3. Multiply the answer from the first step by the answer from the second step. This is basically the last step in solving for the derivative of a function.\nIn this example, the cubed sign (3) is the outside function and formula_1 is the inside function. The derivative of the outside function would be formula_1, where \"x\" is replaced by the inside function. The derivative of the inside function would be 2\"x\", which is multiplied by formula_1 to get formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Differential_calculus","surface_form":"differential calculus","offset":16},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"derivative","offset":78},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":94},{"uri":"Function_composition","surface_form":"composite function","offset":179},{"uri":"Multiply","surface_form":"Multiply","offset":531}]}
