{"id":366241,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium","text":"\"Mycobacterium\" is a genus of bacteria, with about 100 species.The genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis (\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\") and leprosy (\"Mycobacterium leprae\").\nMycobacteria can colonize their hosts without the hosts showing any adverse signs. Many people around the world have infections of \"M. tuberculosis\" without showing any signs of it.\nMycobacterial infections are difficult to treat. The organisms are tough due to their cell wall. In addition, they are naturally resistant to a number of antibiotics that disrupt cell-wall building, such as penicillin. With their unique cell wall, they can survive long exposure to acids, alkalis, detergents, oxidative bursts, lysis by complement, and many antibiotics.\nMost mycobacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics clarithromycin and rifamycin, but antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged.\nThe Greek prefix \"myco\" means \"fungus\". When they are cultured on the surface of liquids, mycobacteria growth is similar to that of moulds, a kind of fungus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":21},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":30},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":55},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":82},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":146},{"uri":"Mycobacterium_tuberculosis","surface_form":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","offset":161},{"uri":"Leprosy","surface_form":"leprosy","offset":194},{"uri":"Mycobacterium_leprae","surface_form":"Mycobacterium leprae","offset":204},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":564},{"uri":"Penicillin","surface_form":"penicillin","offset":617},{"uri":"Complement_system","surface_form":"complement","offset":747},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":768},{"uri":"Clarithromycin","surface_form":"clarithromycin","offset":834},{"uri":"Rifamycin","surface_form":"rifamycin","offset":853},{"uri":"Antibiotic_resistance","surface_form":"antibiotic-resistant strains","offset":868},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":915},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungus","offset":942},{"uri":"Mould","surface_form":"mould","offset":1043}]}
