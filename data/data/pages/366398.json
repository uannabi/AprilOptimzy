{"id":366398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspelling","text":"Fingerspelling is making an alphabet with your hands. Many deaf people learn fingerspelling. They use it when they want to sign a word but there is no sign in the sign language, or when they don't understand what the sign means. Other people also use fingerspelling to talk in secret, to help remember something, or to talk without making sound (for example in a church).\nFingerspelling is a part of some sign languages. Writing systems are not the same everywhere, and fingerspelling is also different. Different countries have different ways of fingerspelling. Some alphabets use one hand, some use two hands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":28},{"uri":"Deaf","surface_form":"deaf","offset":59},{"uri":"Sign_language","surface_form":"sign language","offset":163},{"uri":"Secret","surface_form":"secret","offset":277},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":339},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":363},{"uri":"Sign_language","surface_form":"sign language","offset":405},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"Writing system","offset":421}]}
