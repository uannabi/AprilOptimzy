It is connected to Morioka by an east-west train line and highway and the coastal highway also goes through the town. The city has a port but much of the shipping traffic is taken by larger cities along the coast.\nOn June 6, 2005, the old Miyako absorbed the town of Tar\u014D and village of Niisato from Shimohei District to form the new city of Miyako, more than doubling the old city's size. As of 2008, the new city had an estimated population of 57,874 and a density of 83.1 persons per km\u00B2. The total area is 696.82\u00A0km\u00B2.\nOn January 1, 2010, the city absorbed another Shimohei District village, Kawai.\n2011 tsunami.\nOn March 11, 2011, the city was devastated by a tsunami caused by the 2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake.\nAt least 401 lives were lost.\nOnly about 30\u201360 boats survived from the town's 960 ship fishing fleet. A study by the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute found that the waters had reached at least above sea level. This was almost as high the record of the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake tsunami.\nSome of the most well known scenes of the 2011 Japanese tsunami, broadcast worldwide, were shot in Miyako. It shows a dark black wave cresting and overflowing a floodwall and tossing cars, followed by a fishing boat capsizing as it hit the floodwall and then crushed as it was forced under a bridge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cities_of_Japan","surface_form":"city","offset":5},{"uri":"Iwate_Prefecture","surface_form":"Iwate Prefecture","offset":13},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":31},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":128},{"uri":"Morioka%2C_Iwate","surface_form":"Morioka","offset":162},{"uri":"Tar%C5%8D%2C_Iwate","surface_form":"Tar\u014D","offset":410},{"uri":"Niisato%2C_Iwate","surface_form":"Niisato","offset":430},{"uri":"Shimohei_District%2C_Iwate","surface_form":"Shimohei District","offset":443},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":575},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"density","offset":602},{"uri":"Kawai%2C_Iwate","surface_form":"Kawai","offset":738},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":807},{"uri":"2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami","surface_form":"2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake","offset":829},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":900},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":940},{"uri":"Fleet","surface_form":"fleet","offset":948},{"uri":"Earthquake_Research_Institute%2C_University_of_Tokyo","surface_form":"University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute","offset":970},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1071},{"uri":"1896_Meiji-Sanriku_earthquake","surface_form":"1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake","offset":1124},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":1228},{"uri":"Floodwall","surface_form":"floodwall","offset":1324},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":1346},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":1455}]}
