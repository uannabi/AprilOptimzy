{"id":36672,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapir","text":"The tapirs or tapir deer are a family of odd-toed ungulate mammals. They form the family Tapiridae. The only living genus is \"Tapirus\".\nThe first tapirids appeared in the Eocene epoch, and by the Oligocene they looked similar to the present-day species. For much of their history, tapirs were spread across the Northern Hemisphere. The northern species became extinct as recently as 10,000 years ago.\nAppearance.\nTapirs are about 2 m / 7 ft long and about 1 meter / 3\u00A0ft high. They weigh between 150 - 300 kg / 330 - 700 lb. They have a rounded body and very short stubby tails. Tapirs have hoofed toes, with four toes on the front feet and three toes on the hind feet. The Tapir's upper lip and nose have formed a short trunk, and they have a long tongue.\nTapirs have a short fur, with colors that are reddish-brown to grey to nearly black. Exceptions are the Mountain Tapir and the Asian Tapir. The Mountain Tapir has longer wooly fur. The Asian Tapir has a black front part and legs, and a white middle part and back. All baby tapirs have brown fur, with lighter stripes and dots for camouflage.\nTapirs cannot see very well, but they have good hearing and a very good sense of smell. Tapirs also swim very well.\nHabitat.\nTapirs live in of South America and Central America, except the Asian Tapir which lives in Southeast Asia.\nTapirs live in dense forests, and close to water.\nLife.\nTapirs are active at night. They eat leaves, fruit, berries, vegetables and nuts.\nTapirs live alone. After a pregnancy of about 13 months, the female gives birth to a single baby. After half a year the baby starts to lose the baby-coloring of its fur. When the young tapir is one year old it looks like an adult tapir, and it leaves its mother. Tapirs become mature when they are 4 years old. Tapirs can become 25 \u2013 30 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":31},{"uri":"Odd-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"odd-toed ungulate","offset":41},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":59},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":116},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":171},{"uri":"Epoch_(geology)","surface_form":"epoch","offset":178},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":196},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":245},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":311},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":360},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":432},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"ft","offset":438},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":506},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"lb","offset":521},{"uri":"Toe","surface_form":"toe","offset":598},{"uri":"Trunk","surface_form":"trunk","offset":721},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":777},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"camouflage","offset":1087},{"uri":"Sight","surface_form":"see","offset":1113},{"uri":"Hearing","surface_form":"hearing","offset":1147},{"uri":"Olfaction","surface_form":"smell","offset":1180},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1242},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1260},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":1315},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1352},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":1424},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1432},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":1439},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":1448},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":1463},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":1496}]}
