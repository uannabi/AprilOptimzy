{"id":366737,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Frederick_I%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Hildburghausen","text":"Ernst Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (Gotha, 21 August 1681 \u2013 Hildburghausen, 9 March 1724), was a duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen. He was the oldest son of Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Countess Sophie Henriette of Waldeck.\nWhen he was younger, he served in the Netherlands army. He was wounded in the Spanish Succession War at H\u00F6chst\u00E4dt. In 1715, after the death of his father, he left the Army and governed the duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\nLike many German princes, He wanted his duchy to have the splendor of the court of the King Louis XIV of France. This caused him to be ruined financially.\nBecause he always needed money, he raised taxes and sold towns. He sold the county of Cuylenburg which was the dowry of his wife. The county was sold in 1720. He did not sell it to pay any money he owed to others. It was sold so that a garden and a channel could be built in his palace. In 1723 the Schalkau was sold to the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. At the time, Schalkau had city privileges, and the right to hold a market. What was sold was an administrative division, much like a county, only smaller, which included Schalkau. The sale without the agreement of his wife was illegal. This led to a war with Saxe-Meiningen. At the end of the war, all of the county was ruined.\nBecause of his very bad taxes, in 1717 an open revolt took place in the duchy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gotha_(town)","surface_form":"Gotha","offset":48},{"uri":"Hildburghausen","surface_form":"Hildburghausen","offset":72},{"uri":"Duke","surface_form":"duke","offset":109},{"uri":"Saxe-Hildburghausen","surface_form":"Saxe-Hildburghausen","offset":117},{"uri":"Ernst%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Hildburghausen","surface_form":"Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen","offset":163},{"uri":"Countess_Sophie_Henriette_of_Waldeck","surface_form":"Countess Sophie Henriette of Waldeck","offset":202},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":278},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":290},{"uri":"Spanish_Succession_War","surface_form":"Spanish Succession War","offset":318},{"uri":"H%C3%B6chst%C3%A4dt_an_der_Donau","surface_form":"H\u00F6chst\u00E4dt","offset":344},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"governed","offset":416},{"uri":"Duchy","surface_form":"duchy","offset":429},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":469},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":476},{"uri":"Wealth","surface_form":"splendor","offset":517},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":551},{"uri":"Finance","surface_form":"financially","offset":601},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":639},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":656},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":671},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":690},{"uri":"Culemborg","surface_form":"Cuylenburg","offset":700},{"uri":"Dowry","surface_form":"dowry","offset":725},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":850},{"uri":"Channel","surface_form":"channel","offset":863},{"uri":"Hildburghausen_Castle","surface_form":"his palace","offset":889},{"uri":"Schalkau","surface_form":"Schalkau","offset":913},{"uri":"Saxe-Meiningen","surface_form":"Saxe-Meiningen","offset":947},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"illegal","offset":1190},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":1213},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolt","offset":1338}]}
