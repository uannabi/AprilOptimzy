{"id":366785,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization","text":"Self-organization is a process where some form of order arises out of a random system. The process is spontaneous: it happens on its own. It is not directed or controlled by any agent inside or outside the system.\nSelf-organization occurs in a variety of physical, chemical, biological, social and cognitive systems. A common example is crystallization. An example from biological chemistry is the lipid bilayer, which is the basis of the cell membrane, and so is of great importance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":72},{"uri":"Spontaneity","surface_form":"spontaneous","offset":102},{"uri":"Control","surface_form":"control","offset":160},{"uri":"Agent","surface_form":"agent","offset":178},{"uri":"Crystallization","surface_form":"crystallization","offset":337},{"uri":"Biological","surface_form":"biological","offset":370},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":381},{"uri":"Lipid_bilayer","surface_form":"lipid bilayer","offset":398},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":439}]}
