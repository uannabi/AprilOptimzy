It was built in Katsuyama because a lot of fossils have been found there since 1989. Famous fossils such as Fukuiraptor and Fukuisaurus are also showed in this museum.\nThe building was designed by Kisho Kurokawa.\nThe cost of the construction was about 14 billion Japanese Yen.\nIn 2014, a dinosaur building was opened outside, in which people can experience digging fossil as they look at the remains.\nExhibits.\nThe exhibition is divided into 5 zones: \"Dino Street\", \"World of Dinosaurs\", \"Science of the Earth\", \"History of Life\", and \"Dino Lab\". More than 40 skeletons of dinosaurs including 10 original fossils are displayed in the \"World of Dinosaurs\" zone.\nThe \u201CScience of the Earth\u201D zone shows the earth from two points of view--\u201CWater and the Earth\u201D and \u201CFire and the Earth\u201D. People can see how active the Earth is by observing its sediments, rocks, and minerals.\nThe \u201CHistory of Life\u201D zone shows the origin of life and vertebrates, and how they have evolved for 4.6 billion years. Organisms (lives) on the Earth have evolved through a repeated cycle of evolution and extinction. As living organisms and environment influenced each other, the present Earth environment was formed. You can read the story of life as told by these fossils.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fukui_Prefecture","surface_form":"Fukui Prefecture","offset":15},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":33},{"uri":"Prefectures","surface_form":"prefectures","offset":79},{"uri":"Katsuyama%2C_Fukui","surface_form":"Katsuyama.","offset":152},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":186},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossils","offset":195},{"uri":"Royal_Tyrrell_Museum_of_Palaeontology","surface_form":"The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology","offset":417},{"uri":"Zigong_Dinosaur_Museum","surface_form":"The Zigong Dinosaur Museum","offset":473},{"uri":"Characterization","surface_form":"character","offset":755},{"uri":"Stegosaurus","surface_form":"Stegosaurus","offset":768},{"uri":"Fukuiraptor","surface_form":"Fukuiraptor","offset":1027},{"uri":"Kisho_Kurokawa","surface_form":"Kisho Kurokawa","offset":1116},{"uri":"Exhibition","surface_form":"exhibition","offset":1334},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediments","offset":1757},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrates","offset":1845},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolved","offset":1876},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"Organisms","offset":1907},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinction","offset":1993}]}
