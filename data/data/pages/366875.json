{"id":366875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Berg","text":"Paul Berg (born June 30, 1926) is an American biochemist (a person who studies chemistry in living things). He was given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980, with Walter Gilbert and Frederick Sanger. The award recognized their contributions to basic research on nucleic acids.\nBerg received his undergraduate education at Penn State University, where he majored in biochemistry. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from Case Western Reserve University in 1952.\nAfter 1959 Berg worked at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. There he taught biochemistry from 1959 until 2000. He served as director of the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine from 1985 until 2000. He is now professor emeritus at Stanford University.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Berg was given with the National Medal of Science in 1983 and the National Library of Medicine Medal in 1986.\nBerg is famous for his pioneering work involving recombinant DNA, the process of inserting DNA from another species into a molecule, leading to the development of modern genetic engineering. After developing the technique, Berg used it for his studies of viral genomes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":37},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":46},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":125},{"uri":"Walter_Gilbert","surface_form":"Walter Gilbert","offset":164},{"uri":"Frederick_Sanger","surface_form":"Frederick Sanger","offset":183},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":263},{"uri":"Pennsylvania_State_University","surface_form":"Penn State University","offset":323},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":366},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":396},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":405},{"uri":"Case_Western_Reserve_University","surface_form":"Case Western Reserve University","offset":423},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":490},{"uri":"Palo_Alto%2C_California","surface_form":"Palo Alto, California","offset":511},{"uri":"Professor_emeritus","surface_form":"professor emeritus","offset":696},{"uri":"National_Medal_of_Science","surface_form":"National Medal of Science","offset":795},{"uri":"Recombinant_DNA","surface_form":"recombinant DNA","offset":930},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":972},{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetic engineering","offset":1051},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"viral","offset":1136},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":1142}]}
