{"id":36693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovid","text":"Bovids are a family of even-toed ungulate mammals. The word \"Bovidae\" is comes from Latin \"bos\", \"ox\". Even-toed ungulates are said to have \"cloven hooves\": that means their hooves are formed from two toes. They evolved early in the Miocene period.\nThere 143 living species in this family. They include cattle, goats, sheep and antelopes. The family is widespread, living in continents except South America, Australia and Antarctica.\nThey are all ruminants, with the double stomach system of digesting vegetation, which is most efficient. The family originated in the Miocene, and is now very successful. Their success, and that of the three domestic animals (cow, sheep and goat) is probably helped by their digestive system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":13},{"uri":"Even-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"even-toed ungulate","offset":23},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":42},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":84},{"uri":"Hooves","surface_form":"hooves","offset":148},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":233},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":266},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":303},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":311},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":318},{"uri":"Antelope","surface_form":"antelope","offset":328},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":393},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":408},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":422},{"uri":"Ruminant","surface_form":"ruminant","offset":447},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":474},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":502},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":568},{"uri":"Domestic_animals","surface_form":"domestic animals","offset":642}]}
