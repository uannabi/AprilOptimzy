{"id":366956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection","text":"e=\"preserve\">Transfection is the process of deliberately introducing DNA or RNA into cells. The word is formed from\ntransformation and infection.\nTransfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells. Transfection with RNA molecules produces changes which cannot be permanently transmitted down a line of cells.\nDNA constructs.\nA DNA construct is an artificially constructed bit of nucleic acid which is going to be 'transplanted' into a target tissue or cell. It may include a DNA insert, which contains the gene sequence coding for a protein of interest.\nThe DNA insert is the heart of the molecular biology vector. This is a general term for a vehicle used to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell. Transfection of animal cells usually involves opening temporary pores (holes) in the cell membrane, to allow the cells to take up the vector.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":69},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":76},{"uri":"Cells","surface_form":"cells","offset":85},{"uri":"Transformation_(genetics)","surface_form":"transformation","offset":116},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":135},{"uri":"DNA_construct","surface_form":"DNA construct","offset":361},{"uri":"Molecular_biology_vector","surface_form":"molecular biology vector","offset":623},{"uri":"Plasma_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":832}]}
