{"id":367,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island","text":"An island is a piece of ground that is surrounded by a body of water such as a lake, river or sea. Water is all around an island. Islands are smaller than continents. The largest island in the world is Greenland, unless Australia is believed to be an island.\nMost people think Australia is a continent because it is more than three times bigger than Greenland.\nSome islands are their own countries. Examples of islands that are their own countries include Cuba, Iceland, and Cyprus. There are many others. Other islands have more than one country, such as Borneo and Hispaniola.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":155},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":202},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":220},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":456},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":462},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":475},{"uri":"Borneo","surface_form":"Borneo","offset":556},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":567}]}
