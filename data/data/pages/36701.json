{"id":36701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction","text":"=\"preserve\">Subduction is when two tectonic plates meet. One of the plates is pushed under the other into the Earth's mantle. Subduction causes the most powerful earthquakes in the world. Earthquakes caused by subduction can lead to tsunamis.\nAreas where subduction occurs are called subduction zones. Subduction zones are all around the world in places like Indonesia, Seattle, Washington and in the Himalaya mountain range in Nepal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":35},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth's","offset":110},{"uri":"Mantle_(geology)","surface_form":"mantle","offset":118},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":162},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":233},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":359},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":370},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":379},{"uri":"Himalaya","surface_form":"Himalaya","offset":401},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":428}]}
