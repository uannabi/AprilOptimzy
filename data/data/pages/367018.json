{"id":367018,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell","text":"Addison Mitchell \"Mitch\" McConnell, Jr. (born February 20, 1942) is the senior United States Senator from Kentucky. A member of the Republican Party, he is the Majority Leader of the Senate, succeeding Harry Reid. He is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history.\nEarly life.\nMitch McConnell was born to Julia (n\u00E9e Shockley) and Addison Mitchell McConnell at Helen Keller Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama on February 20, 1942. He grew up in segregated Athens, Alabama; his family owned slaves and cotton plantations in the area generations before him. They moved to southern Louisville, Kentucky and McConnell attended the duPont Manual High School. In 1964, he graduated with honors from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science. He graduated in 1967 from the University of Kentucky College of Law.\nCareer.\nIn 1984, McConnell ran for the United States Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last polls returned came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin\u2014only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.\nMcConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election. Part of McConnell's success came from a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston, implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was less than stellar. It is likely that he was helped by Ronald Reagan's 21-point win in Kentucky that year. His campaign bumper stickers and television ads asked voters to \"Switch to Mitch\".\nMcConnell has repeatedly been found to have the lowest home state approval rating of any sitting senator.\nPersonal life.\nMcConnell is a member of the Baptist Church. His first wife was Sherrill Redmon, from whom he was later divorced; they have three daughters. His second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, the current Secretary of Transportation under Donald Trump and the former Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush (the first Asian American woman to serve in the Cabinet).\nSenator McConnell's personal fortune was between $9,839,049 to $44,587,000 in 2010 and he was ranked as the 10th wealthiest member of the U.S. Senate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":79},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":106},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":132},{"uri":"Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Majority Leader","offset":160},{"uri":"Harry_Reid","surface_form":"Harry Reid","offset":202},{"uri":"Sheffield%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Sheffield, Alabama","offset":394},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"segregated","offset":449},{"uri":"Athens%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Athens, Alabama","offset":460},{"uri":"Slavery_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"slaves","offset":494},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":505},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantations","offset":512},{"uri":"Louisville%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Louisville, Kentucky","offset":583},{"uri":"University_of_Louisville","surface_form":"University of Louisville","offset":701},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"B.A.","offset":733},{"uri":"Political_science","surface_form":"political science","offset":741},{"uri":"University_of_Kentucky","surface_form":"University of Kentucky","offset":790},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senate","offset":868},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":906},{"uri":"Walter_Huddleston","surface_form":"Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston","offset":927},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":1211},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":1555},{"uri":"Baptist","surface_form":"Baptist","offset":1840},{"uri":"Elaine_Chao","surface_form":"Elaine Chao","offset":1997},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation","surface_form":"Secretary of Transportation","offset":2022},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":2056},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Labor","surface_form":"Secretary of Labor","offset":2084},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
