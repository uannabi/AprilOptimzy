The zenith is the opposite of the nadir. The nadir is in the direction the direction that gravity pulls. The zenith is not a real point, it is used as a reference for the location of other things in the sky.\nRelevance and use.\nFor scientists, the zenith is the direction of reference for measuring the zenith angle. The zenith angle is the angle between a place in the sky (usually a star) and the local zenith.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":3},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":74},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":122},{"uri":"Nadir","surface_form":"nadir","offset":182},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":238}]}
