{"id":36705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">An artificial or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language that has been made by a person or small group, instead of being formed naturally as part of a culture. Some constructed languages are designed for use in human communication (like the common Esperanto). Others are created for use in fiction, linguistic experiments, secret codes, or simply because the maker likes to play language games.\nConstructed languages can be split into a priori languages, which are made from scratch, and a posteriori languages, which borrow words and grammar from existing languages.\nSome constructed languages also have constructed scripts to write them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":85},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":188},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":254},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":285},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistic","offset":336},{"uri":"Code","surface_form":"code","offset":367},{"uri":"Language_games","surface_form":"language games","offset":416},{"uri":"Constructed_scripts","surface_form":"constructed scripts","offset":642}]}
