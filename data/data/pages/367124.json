{"id":367124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_golden_cat","text":"The African golden cat (\"Caracal aurata\") is a medium-sized cat. This cat was previously listed as \"Profelis aurata\". It weighs about on average. The underside of its chest and chin are normally light-colored. In rare cases, they are pure white. This cat is closely related to the caracal.\nIts fur color can change over time. This is affected by its age and other factors.\nThe head of an African golden cat has light spots around the eyes. In the 1960s, studies were done that showed that various colors of the African golden cat (red, brown, silver) were found in equal numbers in most areas of their habitats. Distinctive spots on the back of the cat are only found on cats in West Africa.\nNormally, the habitat of the African golden cat is in the tropical rainforests found along the equator in Africa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":60},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weighs","offset":121},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":167},{"uri":"Chin","surface_form":"chin","offset":177},{"uri":"Caracal","surface_form":"caracal","offset":281},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":294},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":377},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":434},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":602},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":679},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":706},{"uri":"Tropical_rainforest","surface_form":"tropical rainforest","offset":750},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":787},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":798}]}
