{"id":367213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection","text":"In geometry, a stereographic projection is a function that maps the points of a sphere onto a plane. The projection is defined on the entire sphere, except for one point, called the \"projection point\".\nIntuitively, the stereographic projection is a way of picturing a sphere as a plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the stereographic projection; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereonet or Wulff net.\nA simple example of such a projection, encountered in everyday life is the sun casting a shadow of a globe onto the ground.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":45},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":80},{"uri":"Plane_(geometry)","surface_form":"plane","offset":94},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":378},{"uri":"Complex_analysis","surface_form":"complex analysis","offset":491},{"uri":"Cartography","surface_form":"cartography","offset":509},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":522},{"uri":"Photography","surface_form":"photography","offset":535},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":594},{"uri":"Graph_paper","surface_form":"graph paper","offset":638}]}
