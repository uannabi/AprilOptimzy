{"id":367290,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lemke","text":"Leslie Lemke (born January 31, 1952) is a blind American, prodigious savant who is autistic. He is best known for his work as a musician.\nLeslie Lemke was born prematurely in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1952. At birth, he was diagnosed with glaucoma, cerebral palsy, and brain damage. Doctors were forced to remove his eyes. His birth mother gave him up for adoption. May Lemke, a nurse, adopted him when he was six months old. To feed him, May had to stroke his throat to make him swallow his food. It was a year before Leslie could chew food on his own. It took seven years of constant care before Leslie showed any progress. During this time, he made no sounds or movements and showed no emotions. He was 12 before he first learned to stand. He was 15 before he learned to walk.\nWhen he was 16, May found Leslie playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto no. 1 during the middle of the night. He had recently heard the piece on television. Leslie was soon playing all styles of music, from ragtime to classical.\nHis adoptive mother encouraged his talent for the piano. By 1980, Leslie was giving concerts in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Because of his new fame, he was asked to be on many television programs such as CBC's \"Man Alive\" (hosted by Roy Bonisteel), \"CBS Evening News\", \"60 Minutes\", and \"That's Incredible!\". In 1983, ABC broadcast \"The Woman Who Willed a Miracle\", a drama about Leslie and his adoptive mother. It stars Cloris Leachman as May Lemke. Leslie is also the subject of Fred Small's song, \"Leslie is Different.\"\nLeslie toured the United States, Scandinavia, and Japan and gave free concerts. He was quite animated when he played.\nMay Lemke developed Alzheimer's disease and died on November 6, 1993.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blind","offset":42},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":48},{"uri":"Savant_syndrome","surface_form":"prodigious savant","offset":58},{"uri":"Autism","surface_form":"autistic","offset":83},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":128},{"uri":"Premature_birth","surface_form":"prematurely","offset":160},{"uri":"Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Milwaukee","offset":175},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":186},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosed","offset":222},{"uri":"Glaucoma","surface_form":"glaucoma","offset":237},{"uri":"Cerebral_palsy","surface_form":"cerebral palsy","offset":247},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":267},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":315},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adoption","offset":354},{"uri":"May_Lemke","surface_form":"May Lemke","offset":364},{"uri":"Nurse","surface_form":"nurse","offset":377},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":459},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":687},{"uri":"Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Tchaikovsky","offset":819},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":921},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":971},{"uri":"Ragtime","surface_form":"ragtime","offset":983},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical","offset":994},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":1055},{"uri":"Fond_du_Lac%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Fond du Lac, Wisconsin","offset":1101},{"uri":"Television_programs","surface_form":"television programs","offset":1177},{"uri":"Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation","surface_form":"CBC's","offset":1205},{"uri":"Man_Alive_(Canadian_TV_series)","surface_form":"Man Alive","offset":1212},{"uri":"Roy_Bonisteel","surface_form":"Roy Bonisteel","offset":1234},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":1251},{"uri":"60_Minutes","surface_form":"60 Minutes","offset":1271},{"uri":"That%27s_Incredible%21","surface_form":"That's Incredible!","offset":1289},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":1319},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":1323},{"uri":"The_Woman_Who_Willed_a_Miracle","surface_form":"The Woman Who Willed a Miracle","offset":1334},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":1369},{"uri":"Cloris_Leachman","surface_form":"Cloris Leachman","offset":1422},{"uri":"Fred_Small","surface_form":"Fred Small","offset":1482},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":1557},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1574},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":1594},{"uri":"Alzheimer%27s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer's disease","offset":1662}]}
