The mountain is known to Pitjantjatjara speakers as Ngarutjaranya. In their Dreaming, the mountain represents the spirit being Ngintaka.\nMount Woodroffe is in the far northwest of South Australia, in the Musgrave Ranges. The mountain range rises about 700\u2013800 metres above the plains around it. The rock is mostly granite and gneiss.\nMount Woodroffe was named by William Gosse, who first saw it on 20 July 1873. He named it after George Woodroffe Goyder, another early explorer of South Australia and the Northern Territory. Access to the mountain is restricted. Permission is needed to enter the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":19},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":99},{"uri":"Australian_Aboriginal_mythology","surface_form":"Dreaming","offset":150},{"uri":"Ngintaka","surface_form":"Ngintaka","offset":201},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":254},{"uri":"Musgrave_Ranges","surface_form":"Musgrave Ranges","offset":278},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":388},{"uri":"Gneiss","surface_form":"gneiss","offset":400},{"uri":"William_Gosse","surface_form":"William Gosse","offset":437},{"uri":"George_Woodroffe_Goyder","surface_form":"George Woodroffe Goyder","offset":504},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":579},{"uri":"Anangu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara","offset":671}]}
