It covers the boundary of South Australia (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara) and the Northern Territory (MacDonnell Shire). It separates the Great Victoria Desert to the south and the Gibson Desert to the north. The range has a length of. Many of its peaks have a height of more than. The highest peak is Mount Woodroffe at.\nThe mountains were originally the home of Yankunytjatjara people. The first European to find them was the English explorer William Gosse in the 1870s. He named them after Anthony Musgrave, the Governor of South Australia at the time. At the start of the 20th century, Yankunytjatjara people began migrating east, setting up camps along the Alberga River and moving into the mission at Ernabella. From 1917, they also began a movement southward to Ooldea. Groups of Pitjantjatjara were forced to move to the Musgrave region because of a long drought in their territory, the Mann and Tomkinson Ranges in the west. Today, most of the families in the communities of Amata and Kaltjiti identify as Pitjantjatjara.\nThe South Australian part of the Musgrave Ranges was granted to the Pitjantjatjara people in the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act 1980. Since then, most people have moved into settlements in more hospitable areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":34},{"uri":"Central_Australia","surface_form":"Central Australia","offset":52},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":97},{"uri":"Anangu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara","offset":114},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":161},{"uri":"MacDonnell_Shire","surface_form":"MacDonnell Shire","offset":181},{"uri":"Great_Victoria_Desert","surface_form":"Great Victoria Desert","offset":217},{"uri":"Gibson_Desert","surface_form":"Gibson Desert","offset":260},{"uri":"Mount_Woodroffe","surface_form":"Mount Woodroffe","offset":381},{"uri":"Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"Yankunytjatjara","offset":443},{"uri":"William_Gosse","surface_form":"William Gosse","offset":524},{"uri":"Anthony_Musgrave","surface_form":"Anthony Musgrave","offset":572},{"uri":"Governor_of_South_Australia","surface_form":"Governor of South Australia","offset":594},{"uri":"Human_migration","surface_form":"migrating","offset":698},{"uri":"Alberga_River","surface_form":"Alberga River","offset":741},{"uri":"Mission_(Christianity)","surface_form":"mission","offset":775},{"uri":"Ernabella","surface_form":"Ernabella","offset":786},{"uri":"Ooldea%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Ooldea","offset":848},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":866},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":942},{"uri":"Mann_Ranges","surface_form":"Mann","offset":974},{"uri":"Tomkinson_Ranges","surface_form":"Tomkinson Ranges","offset":983},{"uri":"Amata%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Amata","offset":1063},{"uri":"Kaltjiti%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Kaltjiti","offset":1073},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara_Land_Rights_Act_1980","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act 1980","offset":1207}]}
