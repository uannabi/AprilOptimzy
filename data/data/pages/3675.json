{"id":3675,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel","text":"A wheel is a disc or circle-shaped mechanical device. Its main purpose is to allow things to \"roll\"; in other words, the wheel spins, and object on the wheels moves more easily along the ground. It is a simple machine.\nMost land vehicles roll on wheels. Wheels are often used in pairs, connected by a rod of wood or metal known as an axle. Many machines have wheels with teeth, known as gear<nowiki/>s. The principle behind the wheel is that of mechanical advantage.\nWheel and axle.\nThis is a machine in which the wheel and axle turn together. It is the basis of many machines, not just vehicles. The potter's wheel, the lathe and the windlass are examples.\nHistory.\nMost experts believe that the ancient Mesopotamians invented the wheel about 4000 BC.\nPeople in Asia also discovered it on their own around 3500 BC. The Inca and Maya had wheels on children's toys around 1500 BC, but they did not use wheels for work. Africa south of the Sahara desert, Europe, and Australia did not have the wheel until people there met people from Europe. Early wheels were solid disks; the spoked wheel was invented around 2000 BC. The earliest documentation of a vehicle with wheels is a painting dated between 33503500 BC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disc","surface_form":"disc","offset":13},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":21},{"uri":"Simple_machine","surface_form":"simple machine","offset":203},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":229},{"uri":"Axle","surface_form":"axle","offset":334},{"uri":"Gear","surface_form":"gear","offset":387},{"uri":"Mechanical_advantage","surface_form":"mechanical advantage","offset":445},{"uri":"Potter%27s_wheel","surface_form":"potter's wheel","offset":601},{"uri":"Lathe","surface_form":"lathe","offset":621},{"uri":"Windlass","surface_form":"windlass","offset":635},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":705},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":763},{"uri":"Inca","surface_form":"Inca","offset":820},{"uri":"Maya_civilization","surface_form":"Maya","offset":829},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":918},{"uri":"Sahara","surface_form":"Sahara","offset":938},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":965},{"uri":"Disk","surface_form":"disk","offset":1065},{"uri":"Spoke","surface_form":"spoke","offset":1076},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":1207}]}
