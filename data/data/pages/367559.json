{"id":367559,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_swan","text":"The mute swan (\"Cygnus olor\") is a species of swan, and thus a member of the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae. It is native to much of Europe and Asia, and (as a rare winter visitor) the far north of Africa. It is also an introduced species in North America, Australasia and southern Africa.\nDescription.\nMeasuring 125 to 170 centimetres (49 to 67 in) in length, this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange bill bordered with black. It is recognisable by its pronounced knob atop the bill.\nWhen swimming, the mute swan holds its neck in a graceful \"S\" curve with its bill pointing downward. The whooper swans usually carry their bill level with their neck erect. The male frequently arches his secondary wing feathers over his back in an aggressive display posture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":35},{"uri":"Swan","surface_form":"swan","offset":46},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":77},{"uri":"Goose","surface_form":"goose","offset":83},{"uri":"Anatidae","surface_form":"Anatidae","offset":105},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":139},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":150},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":204},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":248},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":263},{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":418},{"uri":"Knob","surface_form":"knob","offset":488}]}
