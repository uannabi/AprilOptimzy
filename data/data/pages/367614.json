{"id":367614,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_wrongs_make_a_right","text":"The phrases, \"Two wrongs make a right\" and \"two wrongs don't make a right\" are English phrases that denote philosophical norms.\nThe key idea is based on the \"two wrongs\" phrase which consider the two things as wrong.\n\u201CTwo wrongs don't make a right\u201D, is a proverb used to rebuke or renounce wrongful conduct as a response to another's assumed transgression.\n\u201CTwo wrongs make a right\u201D in which an allegation of wrongdoing is countered with a similar allegation. In English language, it might be considered as a fallacy of relevance.\n\u201CTwo wrongs make a right\u201D.\n\u201CTwo wrongs make a right\u201D might be considered as a fallacy of relevance when assuming that, if one wrong is committed, then another wrong will cancel it out.\nThis phrase considers the two actions are wrong. for this reason it is not used by a wrongdoer which does not consider its action as wrong.\nThis phrase considers breaking the law (or the wrong) is justified, as long as the other party also does so.\nTwo wrongs do not make one right.\nTwo wrongs don't make a right is a proverb which means that a wrongful action is not a appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action, in regard to a norm.\nAdditionally, it alleges the first action is also wrong.\nRelationship.\nWhen both actions are considered wrong, the two phrases might be opposed to each other.\nCriticism.\nCommon use of the term has been criticized by scholar Gregory S. Kavka writing in the \"Journal of Business Ethics\". Kavka refers back to philosophical concepts of retribution by Thomas Hobbes. He states that if something supposedly held up as a moral standard or common social rule is violated enough in society, then an individual or group within society can break that standard or rule as well since this keeps them from being unfairly disadvantaged. As well, in specific circumstances violations of social rules can be defensible if done as direct responses to other violations. For example, Kavka states that it is wrong to deprive someone of their property but it is right to take property back from a criminal who takes other's property in the first place. He also states that one should be careful not to use this ambiguity as an excuse to recklessly violate ethical rules.\nConservative journalist Victor Lasky wrote in his book \"It Didn't Start With Watergate\" that while \"two wrongs don't make a right\", if a set of immoral things are done and left un-prosecuted, this creates a legal precedent. Thus, people who do the same wrongs in the future should rationally expect to get away as well. Lasky analogizes the situation between John F. Kennedy's wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr. (which lead to nothing) and Richard Nixon's actions in Watergate (which Nixon thought would also lead to nothing).\nHistory.\nThe phrase \"two wrongs infer one right\" appears in a poem dated to 1734, published in \"The London Magazine\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norm_(philosophy)","surface_form":"philosophical norms","offset":107},{"uri":"Proverb","surface_form":"proverb","offset":255},{"uri":"Fallacy","surface_form":"fallacy","offset":509},{"uri":"Relevance","surface_form":"relevance","offset":520},{"uri":"Fallacy","surface_form":"fallacy","offset":609},{"uri":"Relevance","surface_form":"relevance","offset":620},{"uri":"Assume","surface_form":"assuming","offset":635},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"breaking the law","offset":878},{"uri":"Tort","surface_form":"the wrong","offset":899},{"uri":"Two_wrongs_don%27t_make_a_right","surface_form":"Two wrongs don't make a right","offset":999},{"uri":"Proverb","surface_form":"proverb","offset":1034},{"uri":"Retributive_justice","surface_form":"retribution","offset":1505},{"uri":"Thomas_Hobbes","surface_form":"Thomas Hobbes","offset":1520},{"uri":"Victor_Lasky","surface_form":"Victor Lasky","offset":2247},{"uri":"Legal_precedent","surface_form":"legal precedent","offset":2430},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
