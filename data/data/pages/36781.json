{"id":36781,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paran%C3%A1_(state)","text":"Paran\u00E1 is a state in Southern Brazil. It is next to Paraguay and Argentina. Its capital is Curitiba. Paran\u00E1 is a famous state because of Itaipu Dam and the Igua\u00E7u Falls.\nParan\u00E1 is bounded on the north by S\u00E3o Paulo, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Santa Catarina and the Misiones Province of Argentina, and on the west by Mato Grosso do Sul and the republic of Paraguay, with the Paran\u00E1 River as its western boundary line.\nParan\u00E1 is one of the Brazilian states that shows the most signs of recent European colonization. Most of the population are descendants of European settlers, and is one of the most ethnically diverse. Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians. The development of the state is closely linked to the arrival of the immigrants. Nowadays, migrants from other Brazilian states (especially from the S\u00E3o Paulo, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast Region) come to Paran\u00E1 in search of a better life.\nPeople of Polish descent predominate in the central and south regions, mainly around Curitiba. Italians predominate in the capital, Curitiba, and in the coast. People of Ukrainian descent predominate in a few cities, such as Prudent\u00F3polis; many Ukrainians are found throughout the state. Germans predominate in a few cities, such as Rol\u00E2ndia. Almost all towns have many Portuguese people and their descendants.\nPeople of mixed-race ancestry predominate in a few towns in the north. There is an important Muslim Lebanese and Syrian community around Foz do Igua\u00E7u. In the north, there are many Japanese people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":12},{"uri":"Southern_Brazil","surface_form":"Southern Brazil","offset":21},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":52},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":65},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":80},{"uri":"Curitiba","surface_form":"Curitiba","offset":91},{"uri":"Itaipu_Dam","surface_form":"Itaipu Dam","offset":137},{"uri":"Igua%C3%A7u_Falls","surface_form":"Igua\u00E7u Falls","offset":156},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":195},{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Paulo","offset":204},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":234},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":257},{"uri":"Santa_Catarina_(state)","surface_form":"Santa Catarina","offset":266},{"uri":"Misiones_Province","surface_form":"Misiones Province","offset":289},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":310},{"uri":"Mato_Grosso_do_Sul","surface_form":"Mato Grosso do Sul","offset":340},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":379},{"uri":"Paran%C3%A1_River","surface_form":"Paran\u00E1 River","offset":398},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":418},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonization","offset":524},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":550},{"uri":"1850","surface_form":"1850","offset":694},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germans","offset":707},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italians","offset":716},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poles","offset":726},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainians","offset":736},{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Paulo","offset":897},{"uri":"Santa_Catarina_(state)","surface_form":"Santa Catarina","offset":908},{"uri":"Rio_Grande_do_Sul","surface_form":"Rio Grande do Sul","offset":924},{"uri":"Curitiba","surface_form":"Curitiba","offset":1096},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":1164},{"uri":"Prudent%C3%B3polis","surface_form":"Prudent\u00F3polis","offset":1236},{"uri":"Rol%C3%A2ndia","surface_form":"Rol\u00E2ndia","offset":1344},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1365},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":1381},{"uri":"Mulatto","surface_form":"mixed-race","offset":1432},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":1486},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":1515},{"uri":"Arabs","surface_form":"Lebanese and Syrian","offset":1522},{"uri":"Foz_do_Igua%C3%A7u","surface_form":"Foz do Igua\u00E7u","offset":1559},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":1581},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1603}]}
