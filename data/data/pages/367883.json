They are mostly found in the districts of Mansehra and Batagram, and to some extent in Kohistan as well. A number of Swatis are also settled in the Kashmir region.\nMost of the Swatis in Hazara speak Hindko but some also speak Pashto.\nOrigins and history.\nSwatis are Bettani origin Pashtuns tribe from Afghanistan and migrated to the Swat valley in the early 13th century, around the time of Mohammad Ghori. The Swatis defeated the local Buddhists and Hindus of Swat District and established their own rule. The Swatis ruled in Swat for four centuries.\nLater on, the Yusufzai tribe, who had recently migrated to Peshawar and Bajaur after their expulsion from Kabul by Governor Ulugh Beg Mirza in the 16th century, were welcomed by Swatis in the region. However, the Yusufzai pushed them out of Swat and took the area over themselves. Therefore, many Swatis crossed over into Hazara region and settled in their present homeland.\nClans and subtribes.\nThe Swatis are divided into three subtribes: Gabari, Mitrawi, and Mamaili, while Lughmani are part of Gabari clan.\nGabari are settled in Kaghan valley, Balakot, Garhi Habibullah, Mansehra, Dhodial, Shinkiari,Baffa, Batagram, Thakot and Konsh Valley. Mitrawi, and Mamaili are settled in Bherkund, Agror, Tikri Valley and Deshan of District Batagram.The Allai area is inhabited by all the three subtribes. The Lughmanis are found in Baffa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hazara","surface_form":"Hazara","offset":62},{"uri":"Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","surface_form":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","offset":83},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":168},{"uri":"Mansehra","surface_form":"Mansehra","offset":220},{"uri":"Batagram","surface_form":"Batagram","offset":233},{"uri":"Kohistan_District%2C_Pakistan","surface_form":"Kohistan","offset":265},{"uri":"Kashmir","surface_form":"Kashmir","offset":326},{"uri":"Hindko","surface_form":"Hindko","offset":377},{"uri":"Pashto_language","surface_form":"Pashto","offset":404},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":479},{"uri":"Mohammad_Ghori","surface_form":"Mohammad Ghori","offset":569},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":615},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":629},{"uri":"Swat_District","surface_form":"Swat District","offset":639},{"uri":"Yusufzai_tribe","surface_form":"Yusufzai tribe","offset":744},{"uri":"Peshawar","surface_form":"Peshawar","offset":789},{"uri":"Bajaur_Agency","surface_form":"Bajau","offset":802},{"uri":"Kabul","surface_form":"Kabul","offset":836}]}
