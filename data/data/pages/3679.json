{"id":3679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise","text":"Basic modes of physical exercises.\nExercises can be an important part of physical therapy, weight loss, or sports performance.\nExercise can be fun, but it is important for the exerciser to do what he likes and eat enough calories, so when he exercises he is building up muscles, not just breaking them down for fuel. Carbohydrates are muscle-sparing; and if one does not get enough calories overall, there is the risk of burning muscles up with the fat to make up the deficit.\nExercise benefits.\nBenefits of exercise for all ages have been known since antiquity. Marcus Cicero, around 65 BC, stated: \u201CIt is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor.\u201D\nRegular exercise has been shown to help high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression, among others. Exercise also helps people feel less tired.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Therapy","surface_form":"therapy","offset":82},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":107},{"uri":"Fun","surface_form":"fun","offset":143},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"eat","offset":210},{"uri":"Calorie","surface_form":"calorie","offset":221},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":270},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"Carbohydrate","offset":317},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":449},{"uri":"Marcus_Cicero","surface_form":"Marcus Cicero","offset":563},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":724},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":740},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":749},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":764},{"uri":"Depression_(illness)","surface_form":"depression","offset":778},{"uri":"Fatigue","surface_form":"tired","offset":841}]}
