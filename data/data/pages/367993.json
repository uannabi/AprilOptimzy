{"id":367993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Pakistan","text":"Christianity is the largest minority religion in Pakistan. The total number of Christians in Pakistan was about 2,800,000 in 2008, or 1.6% of the population. Most Christians in Pakistan are descended from recent converts from Hinduism during British Indian rule in the 19th and early 20th century.\nBoth Roman Catholics and Protestants (mostly belonging to the Church of Pakistan) are found here. There is an interdenominational 'Pakistan Christian Congress', that helps to smooth out relations between various sects and to take up any issues of mutual concern.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":49},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":226},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":242},{"uri":"Roman_Catholics","surface_form":"Roman Catholics","offset":303},{"uri":"Protestants","surface_form":"Protestants","offset":323},{"uri":"Church_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Church of Pakistan","offset":360}]}
