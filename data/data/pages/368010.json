{"id":368010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procellariiformes","text":"Procellariiformes is an order of seabirds that comprises four families: the albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world's oceans, with the highest diversity being around New Zealand.\nOnly a single egg is laid per nesting attempt, and usually only a single nesting attempt is made per year, although the larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years. Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Incubation times are long compared to other birds, as are fledgling periods. Once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":24},{"uri":"Seabird","surface_form":"seabird","offset":33},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":62},{"uri":"Albatross","surface_form":"albatross","offset":76},{"uri":"Procellariidae","surface_form":"petrels and shearwaters","offset":89},{"uri":"Storm_petrel","surface_form":"storm petrel","offset":114},{"uri":"Diving_petrel","surface_form":"diving petrel","offset":133},{"uri":"Cosmopolitan_distribution","surface_form":"cosmopolitan distribution","offset":161},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":254},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":281},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":544}]}
