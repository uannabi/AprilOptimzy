{"id":368011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amata%2C_South_Australia","text":"Ama\u1E6Fa is an Aboriginal community in the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is in the north of the APY, between Umuwa and Nyapari. It is at the base of the Musgrave Ranges, about west of the Stuart Highway. Ama\u1E6Fa was established under the name of Musgrave Park in 1961. The community was set up to take the pressure off the growth of nearby Pukatja (then known as Ernabella). The goal was to use it to teach the Aborigines in how to work in the livestock industry. A school was opened 7 years later, in 1968.\nAbout 319 people lived at Ama\u1E6Fa in the 2006 census. It appears to have a growing population, which is not the usual pattern for Aboriginal communities in Australia. From 180 residents in 1981, it has grown steadily past 350 in the 1990s, to 536 in 1996.\nAma\u1E6Fa is made up of about 60 houses. There is a school, a general store and a health clinic. Supplies are delivered once per week and mail is delivered twice per week. Water comes from bores and is stored in tanks. The school was renovated by the state government from 2003\u20132005. A swimming pool was opened in June 2007. Ama\u1E6Fa also has a community centre, a community church, and an airstrip.\nThere is a police station at Ama\u1E6Fa, but they are not always there; state police are based in Marla and run patrols to the area. Some night patrols by residents have been done in the past to help policing of the community. In the absence of police, the community is served by 2 community constables. Tony Abbott suggested in 2007 there should be police at Ama\u1E6Fa permanently. In response, the state government said it would spend A$7.5 million at Ama\u1E6Fa and Pukatja for new police stations, court facilities and prison cells. It would also provide housing for police officers.\nThe sale of local artwork is important to the economy of the Ama\u1E6Fa community. Tjala Arts, founded in 1999, displayed the works of seven Ama\u1E6Fa artists in Canberra in 2006. In the 2007 State Budget, the South Australian Government announced $350,000 for a new arts centre in Ama\u1E6Fa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":12},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":40},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":87},{"uri":"Umuwa%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Umuwa","offset":143},{"uri":"Nyapari%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Nyapari","offset":153},{"uri":"Musgrave_Ranges","surface_form":"Musgrave Ranges","offset":187},{"uri":"Stuart_Highway","surface_form":"Stuart Highway","offset":222},{"uri":"Pukatja%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Pukatja","offset":372},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"livestock","offset":476},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":584},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":668},{"uri":"Clinic","surface_form":"clinic","offset":879},{"uri":"Groundwater","surface_form":"bores","offset":979},{"uri":"Swimming_pool","surface_form":"swimming pool","offset":1076},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":1162},{"uri":"Airstrip","surface_form":"airstrip","offset":1177},{"uri":"Marla%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Marla","offset":1280},{"uri":"Constable","surface_form":"constable","offset":1474},{"uri":"Tony_Abbott","surface_form":"Tony Abbott","offset":1486},{"uri":"Australian_dollar","surface_form":"A$","offset":1615},{"uri":"Pukatja%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Pukatja","offset":1642},{"uri":"Canberra","surface_form":"Canberra","offset":1914}]}
