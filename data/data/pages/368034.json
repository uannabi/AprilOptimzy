{"id":368034,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimili%2C_South_Australia","text":"Mimili is an Aboriginal community in the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is located in the Everard Ranges, about west of the Stuart Highway. According to the local A\u1E49angu, the place has always been called Mimili. The current settlement was built around a cattle station called Everard Park, which was built by White farmers in the 1920s. The station's land was given back to the local Aborigines by the South Australian government in 1972.\nThere were 283 people living at Mimili in the 2006 census. The residents are mainly A\u1E49angu people who speak either Pitjantjatjara or Yankunytjatjara as their first language. The 2001 census data showed that Mimili had the lowest average weekly income per person (AU$172 compared with the South Australian average of AU$345). However, it also had one of the state's highest proportions of residents under the age of 15 (32.6%); and the state's highest ratio of single-parent families (36.0% compared with a statewide average of 15.6%).\nMimili has an airstrip, and a small health facility. There is also a general store and a craft facility where art is made and displayed. A diesel generator supplies electricity to the community. Water is stored in tanks and comes from two bores. A police station was built in 2011, and state police are stationed there permanently. The local school has about 60 children. Attendance at the school benefited from the construction of a swimming pool, opened in October 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":13},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":41},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":88},{"uri":"Everard_Ranges","surface_form":"Everard Ranges","offset":126},{"uri":"Stuart_Highway","surface_form":"Stuart Highway","offset":160},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu","offset":199},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":290},{"uri":"Station_(agriculture)","surface_form":"station","offset":297},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":590},{"uri":"Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"Yankunytjatjara","offset":608},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":719},{"uri":"Australian_dollar","surface_form":"AU$","offset":738},{"uri":"Aboriginal_art","surface_form":"art","offset":1120},{"uri":"Diesel_engine","surface_form":"diesel","offset":1149},{"uri":"Generator","surface_form":"generator","offset":1156},{"uri":"Groundwater","surface_form":"bores","offset":1249}]}
