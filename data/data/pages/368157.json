{"id":368157,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpi","text":"Ka\u1E49pi (sometimes spelled Kanypi) is an Aboriginal community in the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is located about south of the Northern Territory border at the base of the Mann Ranges. The nearby town of Nyapa\u1E5Fi is to the east.\nKa\u1E49pi is part of the Murputja Homelands, which also includes the family outstations Angatja and Umpukulu. The residents are mostly Pitjantjatjara people with their traditional country nearby. The settlement started as an outstation for the Baker family, who moved here from other parts on the APY lands to be closer to the country of their ancestors.\nBecause both Ka\u1E49pi and nearby Nyapa\u1E5Fi are small communities, there are only basic services and most of them are shared between the two towns. In Ka\u1E49pi there is a work shop, a garage, a day care centre and an art centre. It also has a community store, built in 1996, which has a pump for petrol. Food and supplies are delivered once every two weeks. The store services both Ka\u1E49pi and Nyapa\u1E5Fi, as well as nearby outstations. Local health services are based at the clinic in Nyapa\u1E5Fi. Both Ka\u1E49pi and Nyapa\u1E5Fi had their own schools from 1987, but these joined together in 1993. The new school, Murputja Education Centre, was built between the two communities, east of Ka\u1E49pi and 6\u00A0km west of Nyapa\u1E5Fi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":39},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":67},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":114},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":164},{"uri":"Mann_Ranges","surface_form":"Mann Ranges","offset":209},{"uri":"Nyapa%E1%B9%9Fi%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Nyapa\u1E5Fi","offset":241},{"uri":"Outstation_movement","surface_form":"outstations","offset":337},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":396},{"uri":"Homeland","surface_form":"traditional country","offset":429},{"uri":"Jimmy_Baker","surface_form":"Baker family","offset":505},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":605},{"uri":"Petrol","surface_form":"petrol","offset":903}]}
