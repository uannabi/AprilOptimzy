{"id":368164,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyapa%E1%B9%9Fi%2C_South_Australia","text":"Nyapa\u1E5Fi is an Aboriginal community in the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is about south of the Northern Territory border at the base of the Mann Ranges. The nearby community of Ka\u1E49pi is to the west.\nThere are about 85 people living there. The residents are mostly Pitjantjatjara people. Nyapa\u1E5Fi began as a family outstation by the Stevens family, who moved here to look after the country of their ancestors. Today it is a fully-established community of extended families. It serves as an administration centre for nearby outstations Ulkiya and Tankannu.\nBecause both Nyapa\u1E5Fi and nearby Ka\u1E49pi are small communities, there are only basic services and most of them are shared between the two towns. In Nyapa\u1E5Fi, there is an art centre and a health clinic. Supplies are delivered once every two weeks, and mail is delivered once per week. The community store is in Ka\u1E49pi. Both Ka\u1E49pi and Nyapa\u1E5Fi had their own schools from 1987, but these joined together in 1993. The new school, Murputja Education Centre, was built between the two communities, east of Nyapa\u1E5Fi and 9\u00A0km west of Ka\u1E49pi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":14},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":42},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":89},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":131},{"uri":"Mann_Ranges","surface_form":"Mann Ranges","offset":176},{"uri":"Ka%E1%B9%89pi%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Ka\u1E49pi","offset":213},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":300},{"uri":"Outstation_movement","surface_form":"outstation","offset":349},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":433},{"uri":"Clinic","surface_form":"clinic","offset":780}]}
