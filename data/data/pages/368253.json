{"id":368253,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark","text":"e=\"preserve\">A \"byte order mark\" (BOM) is a sequence of bytes used to indicate Unicode encoding of a text file. The underlying character code, codice_2, takes one of the following forms depending on the character encoding.\nBOM use is optional. If used, it must be at the very beginning of the text. The BOM gives the producer of the text a way to describe the encoding such as UTF-8 or UTF-16, and in the case of UTF-16 and UTF-32, its endianness. The BOM is important for text interchange, when files move between systems that use different byte orders or different encodings, rather than in normal text handling in a closed environment.\nAs UTF-8 has become the most common text encoding, codice_2 (shown here as three hexadecimal values) is the most commonly occurring BOM form, also known as the \"UTF-8 signature\". HTML5 browsers are required to recognize the UTF-8 BOM and use it to detect the encoding of the page. Software may alternatively recognize UTF-8 encoding by looking for bytes with the high order bit set (values codice_2 through codice_2) followed by bytes that define valid UTF-8 sequences.\nThe Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for UTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file.\nMost modern software applications recognize a BOM and may insert it when saving a text file with UTF encoding. The presence of the UTF-8 BOM may cause problems with some software, especially legacy software not designed to handle UTF-8, in which case it may appear as the characters \".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":79},{"uri":"UTF-8","surface_form":"UTF-8","offset":377},{"uri":"UTF-16","surface_form":"UTF-16","offset":386},{"uri":"Endianness","surface_form":"endianness","offset":436}]}
