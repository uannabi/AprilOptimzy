{"id":368269,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hell_in_a_Cell","text":"WWE Hell in a Cell is a professional wrestling event produced every year by WWE, a Connecticut\u2013based professional wrestling promotion, and broadcast live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The event began in 2009, replacing No Mercy in the early October slot of WWE's PPV calendar. In 2012, WWE announced that Hell in a Cell would move to late October, leaving only one pay-per-view in October.\nThe show's concept is based on WWE's well-known Hell in a Cell match, in which wrestlers fight inside a 20-foot (6-metre) high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. Each main event match of the card is contested as a Hell in a Cell match. \"Hell in a Cell\" was chosen over \"No Escape\", \"Locked Up\" and \"Rage in a Cage\".\nSince it began, the event has been held only in indoor arenas in the United States. Championship bouts are scheduled on every card. Under the former Brand Extension, WWE assigned its performers to either Raw or SmackDown, which in the 2009 and 2010 events caused matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show.\nConcept.\nIn this PPV, all main events are fought as Hell in a Cell matches, in which the ring and ringside area are surrounded by a 20-foot high roofed cell structure. This type of match has no disqualifications or countouts, and also no escape. The only way to win is by pinfall or submission inside the ring.\nReferences.\n\"This article is based on WWE Hell in a Cell on the English Wikipedia.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":24},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":76},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling_promotion","surface_form":"professional wrestling promotion","offset":101},{"uri":"Live_television","surface_form":"live","offset":149},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":162},{"uri":"WWE_No_Mercy","surface_form":"No Mercy","offset":217},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":363},{"uri":"Hell_in_a_Cell","surface_form":"Hell in a Cell","offset":436},{"uri":"Main_event","surface_form":"main event","offset":582},{"uri":"Indoor_arena","surface_form":"indoor arena","offset":779},{"uri":"Championship_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"Championship","offset":815},{"uri":"Card_(sports)","surface_form":"card","offset":857},{"uri":"WWE_Brand_Extension","surface_form":"Brand Extension","offset":880},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"Raw","offset":935},{"uri":"WWE_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown","offset":942},{"uri":"Hell_in_a_Cell","surface_form":"Hell in a Cell","offset":1103},{"uri":"WWE_Hell_in_a_Cell","surface_form":"WWE Hell in a Cell","offset":1400},{"uri":"English_Wikipedia","surface_form":"English Wikipedia","offset":1426}]}
