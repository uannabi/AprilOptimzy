{"id":368439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Colony","text":"The Connecticut Colony was an English colony in British America. The Connecticut Colony or Colony of Connecticut, was formed in what would become the US state of Connecticut. It was first called the River Colony and was organized on March 3, 1636. It was a place for Puritan noblemen. The English took control of the colony from the Dutch by the late 1630s. The colony became a war zone between the English and American Indians, known as the Pequot War. This war helped established the self-government in the New World.\nThere were two other English colonies in the state of Connecticut. The Saybrook Colony in 1644 and the New Haven Colony in 1662, merged with the Connecticut Colony. Thomas Hooker was a Puritan minister. Hooker and Governor John Haynes of Massachusetts Bay Colony led a group of 100 people to present-day Hartford in 1636. They are sometimes referred to as the founders of the Connecticut Colony.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":30},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":38},{"uri":"British_America","surface_form":"British America","offset":48},{"uri":"US_state","surface_form":"US state","offset":150},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":162},{"uri":"Puritan","surface_form":"Puritan","offset":267},{"uri":"Noblemen","surface_form":"noblemen","offset":275},{"uri":"Dutch_Empire","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":333},{"uri":"War_zone","surface_form":"war zone","offset":378},{"uri":"American_Indian","surface_form":"American Indian","offset":411},{"uri":"Pequot_War","surface_form":"Pequot War","offset":442},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":491},{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":509},{"uri":"Saybrook_Colony","surface_form":"Saybrook Colony","offset":591},{"uri":"New_Haven_Colony","surface_form":"New Haven Colony","offset":623},{"uri":"Merge","surface_form":"merged","offset":649},{"uri":"Thomas_Hooker","surface_form":"Thomas Hooker","offset":685},{"uri":"Minister_(Christianity)","surface_form":"minister","offset":713},{"uri":"John_Haynes","surface_form":"John Haynes","offset":743},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Bay_Colony","surface_form":"Massachusetts Bay Colony","offset":758},{"uri":"Hartford%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Hartford","offset":824}]}
