{"id":368494,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation","text":"=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a transformation is a rule that describes relations between two different coordinate systems and points in them.\nSome examples are translation, dilation, rotation, reflection, shear mapping, point reflection, and circle inversion. Any combination of transformations is also a transformation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coordinate_system","surface_form":"coordinate system","offset":102},{"uri":"Translation_(geometry)","surface_form":"translation","offset":159},{"uri":"Dilation_(geometry)","surface_form":"dilation","offset":172},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotation","offset":182},{"uri":"Reflection","surface_form":"reflection","offset":192},{"uri":"Shear_mapping","surface_form":"shear mapping","offset":204},{"uri":"Point_reflection","surface_form":"point reflection","offset":219},{"uri":"Circle_inversion","surface_form":"circle inversion","offset":241},{"uri":"Combination","surface_form":"combination","offset":263}]}
