{"id":368599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Bahrain","text":"e=\"preserve\">There is a low rate of crime in Bahrain. Some petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are reported especially in the old market areas (souks). Violent crime is uncommon, but increasing. Much of the crime in the nation is committed by the large South Asian population of guest workers. Though small in size, there is a growing underground drug market in the country. According to Emile Nakhleh, about 65% of violent crime and theft are done by foreign citizens living in Bahrain.\nCharisse Tia Maria Coston and Freda Adler wrote a book about the reasons behind the low crime rate in Bahrain. The society of Bahrain follows the teachings of the Qur'an; the Qur'an influences political, economic and social environment. Islam, which is most important in the structure of Bahraini society, teaches wrongdoings will result in downfall of societies.\nBahrain is a destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia cine to Bahrain to work as laborers or domestic servants. Some are placed in involuntary servitude such as unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on movements, non-payment of wages, threats and physical or sexual abuse. Women from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asian country like Thailand and North African nation like Morocco are trafficked to Bahrain for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.\nThreat of terrorist attack is a matter of concern. The Government of Australia advised travelers \"to exercise a high degree of caution in Bahrain\" due to high threat of terrorism.\nIn the Corruption Perceptions Index 2007, Bahrain was ranked 46th out of 179 countries for corruption.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bahrain","surface_form":"Bahrain","offset":45},{"uri":"Petty_crime","surface_form":"petty crime","offset":59},{"uri":"Pickpocketing","surface_form":"pickpocketing","offset":79},{"uri":"Souk","surface_form":"souk","offset":160},{"uri":"Violent_crime","surface_form":"Violent crime","offset":168},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":269},{"uri":"Bahrain","surface_form":"Bahrain","offset":495},{"uri":"Freda_Adler","surface_form":"Freda Adler","offset":534},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":667},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":741},{"uri":"Human_trafficking","surface_form":"trafficked","offset":919},{"uri":"Exploit","surface_form":"exploitation","offset":994},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1027},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":1050},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":1305},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":1321},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":1364},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":1377},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":1403},{"uri":"Sexual_exploitation","surface_form":"sexual exploitation","offset":1467},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist attack","offset":1498},{"uri":"Government_of_Australia","surface_form":"Government of Australia","offset":1543},{"uri":"Corruption_Perceptions_Index","surface_form":"Corruption Perceptions Index","offset":1675},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":1759}]}
