It was a natural disaster. The fire killed between 1,500 people and 2,700 people. Occurring on the same day as the more famous\u00A0Great Chicago Fire, the Peshtigo Fire has been largely forgotten.\nThe setting of small fires was a common way to clear forest land for farming and railroad construction. On the day of the Peshtigo Fire, a cold front moved in from the west, bringing strong winds that fanned the fires out of control. A huge fire was started.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":44},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":95},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":112},{"uri":"Natural_disaster","surface_form":"natural disaster","offset":136},{"uri":"Great_Chicago_Fire","surface_form":"Great Chicago Fire","offset":254}]}
