{"id":368688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1790_United_States_Census","text":"The United States Census of 1790 was the first United States Census. It recorded the population of the United States as of August 2, 1790. In the First Census, the population of the United States was 3,929,214.\nData was collected from all thirteen states (Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia), and districts and territories that would become Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Maine.\nReaction.\nBoth Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and President George Washington didn't fully believe in the results. They believed that there were more people in the United States than what the census said. A reason why there may be more people would be because of the people living farther apart, bad roads that would go to where people may live, limited technology, and people simply not giving any information.\nLoss of information.\nThe records for many states were lost sometime between 1790 and 1830. Almost one third of the original census data have been lost or destroyed since the original census. These include some 1790 data from: Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Vermont. The data can still be proven in many secondary sources about the first census.\nData.\nCensus data included the name of the head of the family. They put people into these categories: free white males at least 16 years old (to figure out the country's industrial and military potential), free white males under 16 years old, free white females, all other free persons (reported by sex and color), and slaves. The Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson told marshals to get data from all thirteen states (Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia), and from the Southwest Territory.\n17.8% of the people were slaves. This is the highest percentage of slaves in any American census.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Census","surface_form":"United States Census","offset":47},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":103},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":256},{"uri":"Delaware","surface_form":"Delaware","offset":269},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":279},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":288},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":298},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":313},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":328},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":340},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":350},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":366},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":380},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":394},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":414},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":473},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":482},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":492},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":507},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":548},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":579},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":1157},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":1170},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":1177},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":1187},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":1202},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":1217},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":1227},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":1243},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":1257},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":1271},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":1291},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":1698},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":1710},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":1729},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":1798},{"uri":"Delaware","surface_form":"Delaware","offset":1811},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":1821},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":1830},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":1840},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":1855},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1870},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":1882},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":1892},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":1908},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":1922},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":1936},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":1956},{"uri":"Southwest_Territory","surface_form":"Southwest Territory","offset":1980}]}
