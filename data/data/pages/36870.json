He was given the title \"changsa\" (\"the athlete\" or \"the strong man\"). He was also given an ox.\nAs Korea grew industrially, this type of wrestling has become a real sport. It has support in the form of the teams of professional athletes coming from colleges and universities. There are also organizations for the national Championship Ssirum Changsa. There are competitions in the country.\nTwo fighters fight on the sand inside a circle. They each put on \"satpa\" - a piece of cloth that ties around the waist and thighs. Using their hands, legs backs, they try to make the other person fall.\nMost wrestlers are in height and in weight. The fights can seem slow at first they are actually very dynamic.\nLi Man-ki is one of the most well known sportsmen in this sport. In the 1980s, he won the title \"changsa\" (\"jangsa\") many times.
