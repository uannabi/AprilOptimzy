It consists of sand dunes, small sandhills, grassland plains, areas with closely packed pebbles (called desert pavement or gibber plains) and salt lakes. The desert is an Australian IBRA.\nThe desert covers a large area, about in the states of Western Australia and South Australia. The distance from east to west is about. It is very dry, getting only between to of rain each year. It is surrounded by other very dry areas including the Nullabor Plain to the south, the Gibson Desert to the north, Sturt's Stony Desert to the east. It was named by the explorer Ernest Giles in 1875, after Queen Victoria. Aboriginal people have lived in the desert for more than 24,000 years.\nBetween 1953 and 1957, the British government exploded nine atomic bombs in the Great Victoria Desert at Maralinga and Emu.\nGeography.\nThe area of the Great Victoria Desert is shared roughly equally by the states of South and Western Australia. It is north of the Nullarbor Plain and south of the Musgrave Ranges. The desert is bounded on the west by Laverton and the goldfields and to the east by Coober Pedy and the Stuart Highway.\nEnvironment.\nThe Great Victoria Desert can be very dry and sandy. However, plants and animals still live there. The plants are adapted to the dry, arid climate, otherwise they would not be able to survive. Wallabies, bandy snakes, lizards. kangaroos. and many birds live in the Great Victoria Desert. These animals have also adapted to survive in extreme heat and extreme cold.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":41},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":51},{"uri":"Sand_dune","surface_form":"sand dune","offset":77},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":106},{"uri":"Pebbles","surface_form":"pebbles","offset":150},{"uri":"Desert_pavement","surface_form":"desert pavement","offset":166},{"uri":"Salt_lake_(geography)","surface_form":"salt lake","offset":204},{"uri":"IBRA","surface_form":"IBRA","offset":244},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":305},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":327},{"uri":"Nullabor_Plain","surface_form":"Nullabor Plain","offset":499},{"uri":"Gibson_Desert","surface_form":"Gibson Desert","offset":532},{"uri":"Sturt%27s_Stony_Desert","surface_form":"Sturt's Stony Desert","offset":560},{"uri":"Ernest_Giles","surface_form":"Ernest Giles","offset":623},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":651},{"uri":"Australian_Aborigine","surface_form":"Aboriginal people","offset":667},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":765},{"uri":"Atomic_bomb","surface_form":"atomic bomb","offset":798},{"uri":"Maralinga%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Maralinga","offset":843},{"uri":"Emu%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Emu","offset":857},{"uri":"Nullarbor_Plain","surface_form":"Nullarbor Plain","offset":1002},{"uri":"Musgrave_Ranges","surface_form":"Musgrave Ranges","offset":1035},{"uri":"Laverton","surface_form":"Laverton","offset":1089},{"uri":"Coober_Pedy","surface_form":"Coober Pedy","offset":1136},{"uri":"Stuart_Highway","surface_form":"Stuart Highway","offset":1156},{"uri":"Arid","surface_form":"dry","offset":1223},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":1231},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapted","offset":1299},{"uri":"Wallaby","surface_form":"Wallabies","offset":1378},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":1395},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":1403}]}
