Skull bossing may happen from different medical conditions.\nFrontal bossing.\nFrontal bossing is when the forehead becomes bigger than normal which may also make the brow ridge stick out more. It happens when the frontal bone becomes bigger because of a medical condition. This often happens when other facial bones of the skull become bigger too, as well as the jaw bone and the bones in the hands and feet. Frontal bossing is usually seen in a few rare medical syndromes such as acromegaly - a chronic medical disorder in which the anterior pituitary gland makes to much growth hormone (GH).\nTurricephaly.\nTurricephaly often called \"tower skull\", may be caused by different medical conditions. In some cases such as Apert and Pfeiffer syndromes, it is caused when sutures in the skull close before they are supposed to.\nTurricephaly is also one of the most common problems which affect the bones of the face and skull in those with Sickle-cell disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frontal_bone","surface_form":"frontal bone","offset":102},{"uri":"Frontal_bone","surface_form":"frontal bone","offset":350},{"uri":"Facial_bones","surface_form":"facial bones","offset":440},{"uri":"Human_skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":460},{"uri":"Mandible","surface_form":"jaw bone","offset":500},{"uri":"Acromegaly","surface_form":"acromegaly","offset":618},{"uri":"Anterior_pituitary","surface_form":"anterior pituitary","offset":671},{"uri":"Growth_hormone","surface_form":"growth hormone","offset":710},{"uri":"Sickle-cell_disease","surface_form":"Sickle-cell disease","offset":1071}]}
