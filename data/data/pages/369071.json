It tries to stop people from hurting themselves or committing suicide, and help them through counselling. It is made up of 159 crisis centers in the United States. It has a 24-hour telephone number that is free to call for people who feel like killing themselves or have big problems that they need to talk about with someone. After dialing 1-800-273-TALK (8255), the person calling is connected to their nearest crisis center to get immediate counseling and referrals to local mental health services. The Lifeline supports people who call for themselves or someone they care about.\nOn December 12, 2019, the US Federal Communications Commission approved a rule that will make 988 the official number for the Lifeline. The 988 number is expected to be fully in place by mid-2021.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":92},{"uri":"Self-harm","surface_form":"hurting themselves","offset":136},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":169},{"uri":"Counselling","surface_form":"counselling","offset":200},{"uri":"Mental_health","surface_form":"mental health","offset":585},{"uri":"Federal_Communications_Commission","surface_form":"Federal Communications Commission","offset":719}]}
