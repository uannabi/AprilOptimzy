{"id":369081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly","text":"Acromegaly is a medical condition that happens when the anterior (rear) pituitary gland makes too much growth hormone (GH), after a person has passed puberty. If this happens before puberty it causes a condition known as gigantism. A number of medical conditions may cause the pituitary gland to make too much growth hormone, but the most common cause is a tumor on the pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma'\nAcromegaly is most commonly diagnosed in middle aged adults, and can result in severe disfigurement, serious complicating conditions, and early death if not treated. Acromegaly is hard to diagnose when it is just beginning. It is usually not found until 10\u201312 years after it starts. This is when it causes changes in the way a person looks, especially their face.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":182},{"uri":"Pituitary_adenoma","surface_form":"pituitary adenoma","offset":395}]}
