{"id":36909,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson","text":"Bruce Dickinson (born 7 August 1958) is an English heavy metal singer. He is the singer in the band Iron Maiden.\nBiography.\nDickinson was born on 7 August 1958 in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. He was born as Paul Dickinson, but changed his first name to Bruce. As a teenager, he lived in Sheffield. This was where he started to listen to heavy metal music. He sang in local bands during this time, after trying to play the drums.\nIn the early 1980s, Dickinson was part of the band Samson. He left Samson in 1981. Later that year, after Paul Di'Anno left Iron Maiden, Dickinson was chosen to be the band's new singer. During the 1980s, Iron Maiden was very popular, and Dickinson's singing was a big part of this.\nIn 1990, Dickinson made his first solo album, called \"Tattooed Millionaire\". In 1993, he left Iron Maiden to become only a solo artist. He released five solo albums during the 1990s, but they were not as popular as his work with Iron Maiden had been.\nIn 1999, Dickinson joined Iron Maiden again, and soon after the band made a new album, Brave New World. Since then, he has stayed as a part of Iron Maiden as well as recording music both by himself and with other people.\nOther interests.\nOutside of music, Dickinson is interested in fencing, has written both books and a script based on one of his albums for a screenplay, and has worked in the radio industry.\nHe is also a pilot for Astraeus Airlines, and became marketing director for the airline in September 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":43},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":51},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":63},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":95},{"uri":"Iron_Maiden","surface_form":"Iron Maiden","offset":100},{"uri":"Worksop","surface_form":"Worksop","offset":163},{"uri":"Nottinghamshire","surface_form":"Nottinghamshire","offset":172},{"uri":"Sheffield","surface_form":"Sheffield","offset":284},{"uri":"Samson_(band)","surface_form":"Samson","offset":477},{"uri":"Paul_Di%27Anno","surface_form":"Paul Di'Anno","offset":532},{"uri":"Solo","surface_form":"solo","offset":743},{"uri":"Tattooed_Millionaire","surface_form":"Tattooed Millionaire","offset":763},{"uri":"Brave_New_World_(album)","surface_form":"Brave New World","offset":1047},{"uri":"Fencing","surface_form":"fencing","offset":1243},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"screenplay","offset":1321},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":1355},{"uri":"Astraeus_Airlines","surface_form":"Astraeus Airlines","offset":1394},{"uri":"Marketing","surface_form":"marketing","offset":1424}]}
