She was born in Basra, and is therefore also called R\u0101bia al-Basr\u012B ().\nShe was the fourth daughter of her family and therefore named R\u0101bi\u2019a, meaning \"fourth\". Her family was very poor. She was very devoted to God. When R\u0101bia's father died, she became an orphan. She was captured by thieves and sold into slavery. During the day, she worked for her master. During the night, she prayed to God. Once her master learned about her passionate faith, he immediately released her. He decided to serve her instead.\nR\u0101bia became an ascetic. Over time, many came to follow her. Even though R\u0101bia did many favors for them and lived in poverty and hardship, she never asked for anything, even from God.\nThe name R\u0101bia is used to describe women of the highest type of spirituality. She is considered one of the most devoted Sufi saints. She is highly revered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":60},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":67},{"uri":"Sufi","surface_form":"Sufi","offset":77},{"uri":"Basra","surface_form":"Basra","offset":106},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poor","offset":269},{"uri":"Allah","surface_form":"God","offset":299},{"uri":"Orphan","surface_form":"orphan","offset":344},{"uri":"Thief","surface_form":"thieves","offset":372},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":394},{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayed","offset":468},{"uri":"Asceticism","surface_form":"ascetic","offset":613},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spirituality","offset":845}]}
