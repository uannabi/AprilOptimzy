{"id":369164,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flugelhorn","text":"A Fl\u00FCgelhorn is a musical instrument, a part of the brass family. It looks similar to the trumpet but the tubing is wider and more conical. It is pitched in Bb like trumpets and cornets. It can have three piston valves like a trumpet, or rotary valves like a French horn. It has been described as being a bugle with valves. The sound is more mellow, not as harsh as a trumpet.\nThe instrument was developed from German hunting horns, and became popular in brass bands in the 1850's. Performers such as Miles Davis have used the Fl\u00FCgelhorn in jazz recordings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":18},{"uri":"Brass_instrument","surface_form":"brass family","offset":52},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":165},{"uri":"Cornet","surface_form":"cornet","offset":178},{"uri":"French_horn","surface_form":"French horn","offset":259},{"uri":"Bugle","surface_form":"bugle","offset":305},{"uri":"Brass_band","surface_form":"brass band","offset":455},{"uri":"Miles_Davis","surface_form":"Miles Davis","offset":501}]}
