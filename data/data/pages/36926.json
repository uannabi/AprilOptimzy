{"id":36926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude","text":"e=\"preserve\">An \u00E9tude (said \"ay-TOOD\"; French for study) is a short piece of music written to help the player to become a better player. They are usually quite difficult. Sometimes they are just called \"studies\". Composers such as the pianist Carl Czerny and the violinist Otakar \u0160ev\u010Dik wrote lots of \u00E9tudes. Each one concentrates on a technical problem: fast scale passages, arpeggios, wide leaps, chords or, for string players, different ways of bowing.\nThe tradition of writing \u00E9tudes started in the early 19th century, when the piano started to become popular. Many of the \u00E9tudes from that time are still very popular today, including those by Muzio Clementi.\nFr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin wrote two sets of \u00E9tudes for piano. Franz Liszt also wrote some very difficult \u00E9tudes, including the piece known as \"La Campanella\". These two composers' \u00E9tudes are known for being not only good for developing piano technique but are also beautiful to hear. Because of this, they are often performed in concerts and recorded onto CDs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":39},{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"study","offset":50},{"uri":"Carl_Czerny","surface_form":"Carl Czerny","offset":243},{"uri":"Otakar_%C5%A0ev%C4%8Dik","surface_form":"Otakar \u0160ev\u010Dik","offset":273},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"technical","offset":336},{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"scale","offset":360},{"uri":"Arpeggio","surface_form":"arpeggio","offset":376},{"uri":"Chord","surface_form":"chord","offset":399},{"uri":"Bowing","surface_form":"bowing","offset":448},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":532},{"uri":"Muzio_Clementi","surface_form":"Muzio Clementi","offset":648},{"uri":"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin","surface_form":"Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin","offset":664},{"uri":"%C3%89tudes_(Chopin)","surface_form":"\u00E9tudes","offset":698},{"uri":"Franz_Liszt","surface_form":"Franz Liszt","offset":716},{"uri":"La_Campanella","surface_form":"La Campanella","offset":797},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"technique","offset":896},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":983},{"uri":"CD","surface_form":"CD","offset":1010}]}
