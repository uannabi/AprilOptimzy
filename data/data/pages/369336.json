And say that he was born in Gilan Iraq, a historic village near the cities (Al-Mada'in) of 40\u00A0kilometers south of Baghdad, as evidenced by historical studies academic and adopted by the Gilan Family in Baghdad.\nName's origin.\nThe name \"Muhiyudin\" describes him as a \"reviver of religion\". Gilan (Arabic \"al-Jilani\") refers to his place of birth, Gilan. However, Gilani also carried the epithet \"Baghdadi.\" referring to his residence and burial in Baghdad.

He was respected as a saint by the people of his day, and was known as \"Jangi Dost\" \"who loves God\", thus \"Jangidost\" was his sobriquet.\nEducation.\nGilani spent his early life in Gilan, the town of his birth. In 1095, at the age of eighteen years, he went to Baghdad. There, he pursued the study of Hanbali law under Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi and ibn Aqil. He was given lessons on Hadith by Abu Muhammad Ja'far al-Sarraj. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas.

In the morning he taught hadith and tafsir, and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science of the heart and the virtues of the Quran.
