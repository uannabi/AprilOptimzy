{"id":369480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime","text":"In special relativity, the Minkowski spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold, created by Hermann Minkowski. It has four dimensions: three dimensions of space (x, y, z) and one dimension of time. Minkowski spacetime has a metric signature of (-+++), and describes a flat surface when no mass is present. The convention in this article is to call Minkowski spacetime simply spacetime.\nHowever, Minkowski spacetime only applies in special relativity. General relativity used the notion of curved spacetime to describe the effects of gravity and accelerated motion.\nMathematical.\nSpacetime can be thought of as a four-dimensional coordinate system in which the axes are given by\nformula_1\nThey can also be denoted by\nformula_1\nWhere formula_1 represents formula_1. The reason for measuring time in units of the speed of light times the time coordinate is so that the units for time are the same as the units for space. Spacetime has the differential for arc length given by\nformula_1\nThis implies that spacetime has a metric tensor given by\nformula_1\nAs before stated, spacetime is flat everywhere; to some extent, it can be thought of as a plane.\nSimple.\nSpacetime can be thought of as the \"arena\" in which all of the events in the universe take place. All that one needs to specify a point in spacetime is a certain time and a typical spatial orientation. It is hard (virtually impossible) to visualize four dimensions, but some analogy can be made, using the method below.\nSpacetime diagrams.\n1) The angle between the x-axis and the x'-axis is given by formula_1 where v is the velocity of the object\n2) The speed of light through spacetime \"always\" makes an angle of 45 degrees with either axis.\nSpacetime in general relativity.\nIn the general theory of relativity, Einstein used the equation\nformula_1\nTo allow for spacetime to actually curve; the resulting effects are those of gravity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Special_relativity","surface_form":"special relativity","offset":3},{"uri":"Manifold","surface_form":"manifold","offset":69},{"uri":"Hermann_Minkowski","surface_form":"Hermann Minkowski","offset":90},{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":373},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"General relativity","offset":449},{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":494},{"uri":"Einstein","surface_form":"Einstein","offset":1767}]}
