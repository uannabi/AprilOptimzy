{"id":369506,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize_Barrier_Reef","text":"The Belize Barrier Reef is a series of coral reefs. It goes along the coast of Belize, about offshore in the north and in the south. The Belize Barrier Reef is a long section of the long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The reef system runs continuous from Canc\u00FAn on the northeast tip of the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula through the Riviera Maya down to Honduras. This makes it one of the largest coral reef systems in the world after the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the New Caledonia Barrier Reef.\nCharles Darwin described it as \"the most remarkable reef in the West Indies\" in 1842.\nSpecies.\nAbout 90% of the reef still needs to be researched. It is thought that only 10% of all species have been discovered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":39},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":79},{"uri":"Mesoamerican_Barrier_Reef_System","surface_form":"Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System","offset":187},{"uri":"Canc%C3%BAn","surface_form":"Canc\u00FAn","offset":258},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula","offset":293},{"uri":"Riviera_Maya","surface_form":"Riviera Maya","offset":323},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":344},{"uri":"Great_Barrier_Reef","surface_form":"Great Barrier Reef","offset":429},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":451},{"uri":"New_Caledonia_Barrier_Reef","surface_form":"New Caledonia Barrier Reef","offset":469},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":497}]}
