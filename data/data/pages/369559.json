They are a source of meat in many places.\nBoth species of paca eat mainly fruit. Other foods include roots, seeds, leaves, buds, and flowers. In the wild, pacas are herbivores, meaning they eat only plants. In captivity, they are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and flesh. Pacas in zoos eat fruits, vegetables, raw meat, lizards, and insects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":4},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":81},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":100}]}
