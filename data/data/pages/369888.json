{"id":369888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_order_logic","text":"e=\"preserve\">First order logic is a type of logic which is used in certain branches of mathematics and philosophy. First order logic enables the definition of a syntax which is independent of the mathematical or logical terms.\nIn first order logic, reasoning can be done from two points of view: either using syntax alone, or including semantic terms. First order logic is different from propositional logic: In first order logic, there are \"quantifiers\", called \"for all\" (written as formula_1) and \"there is at least one\" (written as formula_1). Negation, conjunction, inclusive disjunction, exclusive disjunction and implication are all defined the same way as in propositional logic. Because of that, first order logic can be thought of as an extension of propositional logic.\nThe completeness of first order logic, the result which asserts the equivalence between valid formulas and formal theorems, is established by G\u00F6del. Together with Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, first order logic is the foundation of many branches of modern mathematics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":44},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":87},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":103},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":161},{"uri":"Semantic","surface_form":"semantic","offset":336},{"uri":"Propositional_logic","surface_form":"propositional logic","offset":388},{"uri":"Logical_negation","surface_form":"Negation","offset":548},{"uri":"Conjunction","surface_form":"conjunction","offset":558},{"uri":"Inclusive_disjunction","surface_form":"inclusive disjunction","offset":571},{"uri":"Exclusive_disjunction","surface_form":"exclusive disjunction","offset":594},{"uri":"Implication_(logic)","surface_form":"implication","offset":620},{"uri":"Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory","surface_form":"Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory","offset":944}]}
