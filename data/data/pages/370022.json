{"id":370022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Coast","text":"The Slave Coast is the name of the coastal areas of present Togo, Benin (formerly Dahomey) and western Nigeria. This is a fertile region of coastal Western Africa along the Bight of Benin. In pre-colonial times it was one of the most densely populated parts of the African continent. It was one of the most important places for the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century.\nThe slave trade became so large in the 18th and 19th centuries that an \u201CAtlantic community\u201D was formed. Slaves went to the New World, mostly to Brazil and the Caribbean. Ports that exported these slaves from Africa include Ouidah, Lagos, An\u00E9ho (Little Popo), Grand-Popo, Agou\u00E9, Jakin, Porto-Novo, and Badagry.\nResearchers think that between 2 and 3 million slaves were exported out of this region. They were traded for goods like alcohol and tobacco from the Americas and textiles from Europe. Religions, architectural styles, languages, knowledge, and other new goods were mixed at this time.\nAfter slavery was ended by European countries, the slave trade continued for a time with independent traders (instead of government agents).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Togo","surface_form":"Togo","offset":60},{"uri":"Benin","surface_form":"Benin","offset":66},{"uri":"Dahomey","surface_form":"Dahomey","offset":82},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":103},{"uri":"Bight_of_Benin","surface_form":"Bight of Benin","offset":173},{"uri":"Atlantic_slave_trade","surface_form":"Atlantic slave trade","offset":332},{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":525},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":546},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":561},{"uri":"Ouidah","surface_form":"Ouidah","offset":625},{"uri":"Lagos","surface_form":"Lagos","offset":633},{"uri":"An%C3%A9ho","surface_form":"An\u00E9ho","offset":640},{"uri":"Grand-Popo","surface_form":"Grand-Popo","offset":661},{"uri":"Agou%C3%A9","surface_form":"Agou\u00E9","offset":673},{"uri":"Jakin%2C_The_Gambia","surface_form":"Jakin","offset":680},{"uri":"Porto-Novo","surface_form":"Porto-Novo","offset":687},{"uri":"Badagry","surface_form":"Badagry","offset":703},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":832},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":844},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":874},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural","offset":907}]}
