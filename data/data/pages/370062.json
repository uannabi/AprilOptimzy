{"id":370062,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_suicide","text":"e=\"preserve\">An incident where all members of a group considered a cult kill themselves has been called a cult suicide. In some cases, all or nearly all members commit suicide at the same time and place. Very often, this has been arranged as a mass suicide.\nGroups that have committed such mass suicides and that have been called cults include Heaven's Gate, Order of the Solar Temple, and Peoples Temple. There are other cases, where the respective group has supported mass suicide, but where it did not encourage all members to kill themselves. An example for such a case is that of the Filippians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cult","surface_form":"cult","offset":67},{"uri":"Mass_suicide","surface_form":"mass suicide","offset":244},{"uri":"Heaven%27s_Gate_(religious_group)","surface_form":"Heaven's Gate","offset":344},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Solar_Temple","surface_form":"Order of the Solar Temple","offset":359},{"uri":"Peoples_Temple","surface_form":"Peoples Temple","offset":390},{"uri":"Filippians","surface_form":"Filippians","offset":589}]}
