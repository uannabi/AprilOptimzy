{"id":37026,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension","text":"Hypertension or high blood pressure is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is higher than it should be. This requires the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels.\nBlood pressure.\nThe pressure in the arteries changes depending on what the heart is doing. When the heart squeezes, pumping blood into the arteries, the pressure increases. When the heart relaxes, the pressure decreases. When blood pressure is measured, the highest pressure (when the heart is squeezing) is called the systolic blood pressure. The lowest pressure (when the heart is relaxing) is called the diastolic blood pressure.\nBlood pressure is written as two numbers. For example, in the picture at the right, the person's systolic blood pressure was 158. Their diastolic blood pressure was 99. This blood pressure is written as 158/99. It is said \"158 over 99.\"\nHypertension Types.\nThere are two types of hypertension, called \u201Cprimary\u201D and \u201Csecondary.\u201D Primary hypertension means that the hypertension is not caused by any other disease or condition and it gradually develops over time with age. Secondary hypertension means that the hypertension is caused by another disease or conditions. Secondary hypertension tend to result in higher blood pressure than primary hypertension. In most cases (90-95%), hypertension is primary. Only a small amount of hypertension (5-10%) is secondary.\nThere are various health conditions that leads to secondary hypertension which includes: Obstructive sleep apnea, Kidney problems, Adrenal gland tumors, Thyroid problems, Certain defects you're born with (congenital) in blood vessels, Certain medications (birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs), Illegal drugs (cocaine and amphetamines).\nProblems caused by hypertension.\nHypertension can cause many problems, including heart attack, stroke, Aneurysm, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, vision loss, Metabolic syndrome, Dementia, etc..\nRisk Factors.\nThe risk factors includes age, Race, Family history or genes, obesity, lack of physical activity, chewing or smoking tobacco, too much salt in diet, not enough potassium in diet, alcohol, stress, kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.\nEffectiveness.\nEven small decreases in blood pressure can have a large effect on a person's health. For example, decreasing\u00A0blood pressure\u00A0by 5\u00A0mmHg (for example, from 150/100 to 145/95 mmHg) can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%. It can also decrease the risk of heart disease\u00A0by 21%.\nReferences.\n[https://studysciences.com/what-is-blood-pressure-or-hypertension/ What is Blood Pressure Or Hypertension ?]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chronic","surface_form":"chronic","offset":41},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":80},{"uri":"Arteries","surface_form":"arteries","offset":102},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":158},{"uri":"Circulatory_system","surface_form":"circulate blood through the blood vessels","offset":194},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":257},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":312},{"uri":"Systole","surface_form":"heart squeezes","offset":337},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":361},{"uri":"Diastole","surface_form":"heart relaxes","offset":419},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":1074},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1925},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":1939},{"uri":"Congestive_heart_failure","surface_form":"congestive heart failure","offset":1957},{"uri":"Kidney_failure","surface_form":"kidney failure","offset":1983},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":2565}]}
