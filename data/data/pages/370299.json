Foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck fattened by gavage (force-feeding corn), although outside of France it is occasionally produced using natural feeding.\nFoie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait or p\u00E2t\u00E9 (the lowest quality), and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak.\nThere is concern in animal rights circles that the way of making it is cruel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":29},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":78},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":103},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":114},{"uri":"Goose","surface_form":"goose","offset":122},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":267},{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French cuisine","offset":375},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":424},{"uri":"Mousse","surface_form":"mousse","offset":540},{"uri":"Parfait","surface_form":"parfait","offset":548},{"uri":"P%C3%A2t%C3%A9","surface_form":"p\u00E2t\u00E9","offset":559},{"uri":"Steak","surface_form":"steak","offset":659},{"uri":"Animal_rights","surface_form":"animal rights","offset":686}]}
