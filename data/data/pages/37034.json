Live Aid was held in two places at the same time: Wembley Stadium in London, and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The concert raised over $280 million.\nIn 2004, Live Aid was released on DVD. The money used to buy the DVD set was given to Africa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charity","offset":27},{"uri":"July_13","surface_form":"July 13","offset":105},{"uri":"1985","surface_form":"1985","offset":114},{"uri":"Bob_Geldof","surface_form":"Bob Geldof","offset":140},{"uri":"Midge_Ure","surface_form":"Midge Ure","offset":155},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":184},{"uri":"Wembley_Stadium_(1923)","surface_form":"Wembley Stadium","offset":287},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":306},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy_Stadium","surface_form":"John F.
