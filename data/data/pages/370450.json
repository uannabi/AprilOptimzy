{"id":370450,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire","text":"The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft. It was used by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries throughout the Second World War. The Spitfire was designed by R. J. Mitchell as a short-range, high-performance interceptor aircraft. There were more Spitfires made than any other British aircraft and it was the only British fighter that was being made throughout the war.\nThe Spitfire's elliptical wing had a thin cross-section. This allowed a higher top speed than other fighters of the time, including the Hawker Hurricane. The elliptic shaped wing gives the aircraft a very low amount of induced drag. Speed was seen as essential to carry out the mission of home defence against enemy bombers. The original airframe was designed to be powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030\u00A0hp (768\u00A0kW).\nBecause of its higher performance, Spitfire units had a higher victory-to-loss ratio than units flying Hurricanes.\nA tribute to the people who built the spitfires can be found next to the site of the factory where they were made. It is in Castle Bromwich in Birmingham. It is a sculpture called \"Sentinel\".\nSpecifications (Spitfire MK VB).\nData from Spitfire: The History[184] and Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II[185]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":50},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":87},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allied","offset":118},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":150},{"uri":"R._J._Mitchell","surface_form":"R.
