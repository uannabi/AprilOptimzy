{"id":370537,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B","text":"Linear B is an ancient script, used to write Mycenaean Greek, as the oldest known form of Ancient Greek. This was proved by Michael Ventris in the early 1950s. Linear B came before the Greek alphabet by several centuries.\nThe script is based on Linear A, a script which cannot be read today. The oldest texts written in Linear B date from about 1450 BC. Linear B was found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Cydonia, Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae. The writing of Linear B language disappeared with the fall of the Mycenaean civilization.\nThere are about 87 signs in Linear B that represent syllables. In addition, there are many ideographic signs: These represent objects or commodities. They do not represent sounds, and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence.\nLinear B seems to have only been used for administration. In all the thousands of clay tablets, a relatively small number of different \"hands\" (or writers) have been detected: 45 in Pylos (west coast of the Peloponnese, in southern Greece) and 66 in Knossos (Crete). The script may have only been used by a guild of professional scribes. These scribes worked at the different palaces: when the palaces were destroyed, the script disappeared.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"script","offset":23},{"uri":"Mycenaean","surface_form":"Mycenaean","offset":45},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":55},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":90},{"uri":"Michael_Ventris","surface_form":"Michael Ventris","offset":124},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":185},{"uri":"Centuries","surface_form":"centuries","offset":211},{"uri":"Linear_A","surface_form":"Linear A","offset":245},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":350},{"uri":"Knossos","surface_form":"Knossos","offset":406},{"uri":"Kydonia","surface_form":"Cydonia","offset":415},{"uri":"Pylos","surface_form":"Pylos","offset":424},{"uri":"Thebes%2C_Greece","surface_form":"Thebes","offset":431},{"uri":"Mycenae","surface_form":"Mycenae","offset":442},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":593},{"uri":"Ideogram","surface_form":"ideographic","offset":632},{"uri":"Peloponnese","surface_form":"Peloponnese","offset":984},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":1009},{"uri":"Crete","surface_form":"Crete","offset":1036},{"uri":"Guild","surface_form":"guild","offset":1084},{"uri":"Scribe","surface_form":"scribe","offset":1106}]}
