{"id":370799,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle","text":"The Oh-My-God particle was a really tiny portion of matter or energy (undefined) moving incredibly fast. It was first spotted on the evening of 15 October 1991 over Dugway Proving Ground in Utah and shocked many astrophysicists. It has an estimated energy of (50\u00A0J)\u2014in other words, a subatomic particle with kinetic energy equal to that of a baseball () traveling at about. That amount of energy is also 50 times the energy that a collision in the Large Hadron Collider would have.\nThe speed of the particle was almost the speed of light. If a year were to pass in a race between a ray of light and the particle the distance will be 0.00000046 millimetre or be behind 0.00000000000000015 seconds.\nThere have been at least 15 similar events recorded.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysicists","offset":212},{"uri":"Subatomic_particle","surface_form":"subatomic particle","offset":284},{"uri":"Baseball_(object)","surface_form":"baseball","offset":342}]}
