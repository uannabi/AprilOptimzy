A contest was held for the architectural design of the building from 1931 until 1933. Construction was started on the building in 1937, but was stopped in 1941 because of World War II. The building was going to be used as a administrative center and meeting place. It was to be built in Moscow near the Kremlin. The palace would have had a height of 415m. This would have made it the largest building of the world at that time.\nThe design of the building was created by the architect Boris Iofan. During its design, there were many changes to how it would look and to the location of the palace in Moscow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":35},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":85},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":117},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":135},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural design","offset":176},{"uri":"Construct","surface_form":"Construction","offset":235},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":320},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative center","offset":373},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":436},{"uri":"Kremlin","surface_form":"Kremlin","offset":452},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":465},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":502},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":623},{"uri":"Boris_Iofan","surface_form":"Boris Iofan","offset":633}]}
