It has been used since ancient times to dye skin, hair, fingernails, leather, cotton, wool and other fabrics. The name is also used for the dye or color preparation derived from the plant, and for the art of making temporary tattoos or designs from these dyes. These henna tattoos are often used in wedding ceremonies.\nIn addition, the name is also sometimes used, wrongly, for other chemical preparations and dyes that are in fact not made from this plant.\nThe English name \"henna\" comes from the Arabic (or colloquially, loosely pronounced /\u0127inna/). The natural dye is still mostly used in Arabia, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan.\nUses.\nHenna is used for many hair related problems.\nScalp Itchiness:- The anti-microbial and anti-fungal property of henna is the best to soothe the itchy scalp.\nRelieves Oxidative Stress:- Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance in the production of free radicals.
