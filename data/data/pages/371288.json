{"id":371288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Garden_Park","text":"The Lady Garden Park (originally Ladies' Garden) is a public park in Abbottabad town, Pakistan.\nHistory.\nThe park was established soon after the foundation of Abbotabad town itself (January 1853) by Major James Abbott. As distinct from the \"Company Bagh\" (East India Company Park) which was also founded down in the main bazaar for the recreation of \"natives\", the Ladies Garden was exclusively for the use of European or \"White\" ladies and families. It was laid out over a whole block of the urban military cantonment area, opposite to St Luke's Church, Abbottabad. A number of trees and flowers imported from England and other places were also planted here.\nWhile the British Raj in India lasted, this park retained its exclusive character, but after the Independence of Pakistan in 1947, it was opened to all the general public.\nPresent status.\nThe park is a very popular recreational place for the citizens of Abbottabad. Apart from the general, open area with lawns and walks etc., a section has also been segregated for women and children, with swings, slides, see-saws and so on. A small snack-bar and benches are also placed in a pleasant location, under some fine old trees. A special feature of the park is the copy of the farewell poem written by Major Abbott, the town's founder, which has been carved on a big stone slab beneath a majestic cedar tree. Many tourists come to see and read this and get themselves photographed here (See Link Below for Abbott Poem Text).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abbottabad","surface_form":"Abbottabad","offset":69},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":86},{"uri":"James_Abbott","surface_form":"James Abbott","offset":205},{"uri":"East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":256},{"uri":"Bazaar","surface_form":"bazaar","offset":321},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"European","offset":410},{"uri":"St_Luke%27s_Church%2C_Abbottabad","surface_form":"St Luke's Church, Abbottabad","offset":537},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":611},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":670},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":685},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":773},{"uri":"Cedar","surface_form":"cedar","offset":1353}]}
