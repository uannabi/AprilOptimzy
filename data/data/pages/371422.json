Blair helped many democratic politicians to vote yes on making slavery illegal and becoming the 13th Amendment.\nBlair asked President Lincoln that once Savannah, Georgia fell, he should travel to the capital of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia to talk to President Jefferson Davis, whom he knew. He organized a peace conference that failed.\nIn 1862, Blair had told his slaves that they could \"go when they wished.\" He said that \"all but one declined the privilege,\" choosing to stay on as servants.\nDeath.\nBlair died on October 18, 1876 in Silver Spring, Maryland from natural causes, aged 85.
