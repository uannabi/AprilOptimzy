It is in the National Military and Police cemetery of Israel. The garden is dedicated to the missing in action whose bodies were never found from 1914 until today. There is also a temporary monument for the unknown soldiers. It is planned to move this to the National Memorial Hall. The memorial includes names of Jewish and non-Jewish soldiers and officers who have served in the Israeli Army and Israeli Police. The garden was built in 1954 a short time after an ancient Jewish cave was discovered nearby. It became the \"Garden of the Missing\" in 2004. The garden includes \"empty graves\" with a memorial board with all the names of the missing in action next to a memorial plaza.\nThe Operation Boatswain Memorial is next to the garden.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":52},{"uri":"Mount_Herzl","surface_form":"Mount Herzl","offset":62},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":77},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":142},{"uri":"Missing_in_action","surface_form":"missing in action","offset":181},{"uri":"Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier","surface_form":"unknown soldiers","offset":295},{"uri":"National_Memorial_Hall_(Mount_Herzl)","surface_form":"National Memorial Hall","offset":347},{"uri":"Israeli_Army","surface_form":"Israeli Army","offset":469},{"uri":"Israeli_Police","surface_form":"Israeli Police","offset":486},{"uri":"Operation_Boatswain_Memorial","surface_form":"Operation Boatswain Memorial","offset":774}]}
