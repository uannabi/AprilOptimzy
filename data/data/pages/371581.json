The family consists of trees, shrubs and herbs showing a wide range of colours and floral patterns.\nEconomically, some species are cultivated ornamental plants and many species yield bitter principles used medicinally and in flavorings.\nMany of this group are mycoheterotrophs: their roots need fungi to break down organic material for them to absorb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":19},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":29},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":73},{"uri":"Cosmopolitan_distribution","surface_form":"cosmopolitan","offset":98},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":135},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":142},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":153},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":254},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":265},{"uri":"Mycoheterotroph","surface_form":"mycoheterotroph","offset":372}]}
