It first premiered on June 12, 2008 on Cartoon Network in the United States. This season takes place at Camp Wawanakwa, a fictional island located somewhere in Muskoka, Ontario to meet the host Chris McLean, where the season is based on a summer camp theme (although a contestant is eliminated at the end of every episode).

This is because the contestants are brutally tortured along the way through the intense challenges they are given. Challenges are sometimes based on other reality shows like \"Fear Factor\" and \"Survivor\". All of this is so that the winner of the season (the one to last the longest on the island and not get eliminated), will win a small fortune of C$100,000 and cheesy fame. Eliminated contestants are sent packing toward the Dock of Shame and must ride the Boat of Losers off the island.\nTotal Drama Action.\n\"Total Drama Action\" is the second season of the series.
