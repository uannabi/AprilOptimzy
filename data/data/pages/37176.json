It began full operation two days after a ceremonial opening on 26 May 2006.\nIt is on the site of the old \"Lehrter Bahnhof\".

Paris Gare du Nord is the largest station in Europe measured by traffic volume but it is regarded as a terminus.\nThe longest route that runs through Berlin Central railway station is the Sibirjak. It links Berlin to some cities in Russia. It passes through Poland, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. The longest route offered goes to Novosibirsk.
