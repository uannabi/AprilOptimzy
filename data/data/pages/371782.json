The troops under Joshua Chamberlain, the 20th Maine, formed the left flank for the Confederate troops. They repelled several charges by the Confederates. However, eventually Chamberlain's troops ran low on ammunition. Chamberlain ordered that the soldiers mount bayonets to their rifles and he ordered a charge down the hill against the Confederates. This charge surprised the Confederates and was successful.\nThe success in the Battle of Little Round Top is considered a turning-point in the Battle of Gettysburg and in the Civil War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battle_of_Gettysburg","surface_form":"Battle of Gettysburg","offset":59},{"uri":"Joshua_Chamberlain","surface_form":"Joshua Chamberlain","offset":127}]}
