Its design was influenced by the architectural style of the buildings of the Monte-Carlo Casino, particularly the Op\u00E9ra de Monte-Carlo. The building was originally organized as a club for the wealthy of Baku, who attended it for banquets and entertainment. During the Russian Civil War it was a place for public rallies. In 1936, the club was officially reorganized into a residence for the philharmonic society aimed at promoting Azerbaijani classical and folk music. On 11 August 1937 after the building was renovated, it was named after the Azerbaijani composer Muslim Magomayev. In 1995, the hall was closed down for more than 8 years for another renovation. It was not until November 2002 that the restoration works finally started due to President Heydar Aliyev's special decree. The opening of the fully renovated building happened on 27 January 2004.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Azerbaijani_language","surface_form":"Azeri","offset":50},{"uri":"Concert_hall","surface_form":"concert hall","offset":120},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":137},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":157},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":175},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":186},{"uri":"Baku","surface_form":"Baku","offset":198},{"uri":"Request","surface_form":"request","offset":297},{"uri":"Elite","surface_form":"elite","offset":317},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":330},{"uri":"Renaissance_architecture","surface_form":"Italian Renaissance","offset":346},{"uri":"Rococo","surface_form":"German Rococo","offset":380},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural","offset":403},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"styles","offset":417},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":440},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":485},{"uri":"Monte-Carlo","surface_form":"Monte-Carlo","offset":502},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra_de_Monte-Carlo","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra de Monte-Carlo","offset":539},{"uri":"Organize","surface_form":"organize","offset":589},{"uri":"Club","surface_form":"club","offset":604},{"uri":"Wealthy","surface_form":"wealthy","offset":617},{"uri":"Attend","surface_form":"attended","offset":638},{"uri":"Banquet","surface_form":"banquet","offset":654},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":667},{"uri":"Russian_Civil_War","surface_form":"Russian Civil War","offset":693},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"public rallies","offset":730},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":768},{"uri":"Residence","surface_form":"residence","offset":798},{"uri":"Philharmonic","surface_form":"philharmonic","offset":816},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":829},{"uri":"Aim","surface_form":"aim","offset":837},{"uri":"Promotion","surface_form":"promoting","offset":846},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical","offset":868},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":882},{"uri":"Restoration","surface_form":"renovated","offset":935},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":981},{"uri":"Muslim_Magomayev_(composer)","surface_form":"Muslim Magomayev","offset":990},{"uri":"President_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"President","offset":1169},{"uri":"Heydar_Aliyev","surface_form":"Heydar Aliyev","offset":1179},{"uri":"Order","surface_form":"decree","offset":1203}]}
