{"id":371827,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae","text":"The Accipitridae are one of the two major families in the order Accipitriformes (the diurnal birds of prey).\nThey are a family of small to large birds with strongly hooked bills (beaks). They vary accordig to their diet. They feed on prey items from insects to medium-sized mammals. Some feed on carrion and a few feed on fruit. The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world's continents (except Antarctica) and a number of oceanic island groups. Some species are migratory.\nMany well-known birds, such as hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures are included in this group. The osprey is usually placed in a separate family (Pandionidae), as is the secretary bird. The New World vultures are now usually a separate family or order.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":42},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":58},{"uri":"Accipitriformes","surface_form":"Accipitriformes","offset":64},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":85},{"uri":"Birds_of_prey","surface_form":"birds of prey","offset":93},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":145},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":250},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":274},{"uri":"Carrion","surface_form":"carrion","offset":296},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":322},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":430},{"uri":"Migratory","surface_form":"migratory","offset":498},{"uri":"Hawks","surface_form":"hawks","offset":540},{"uri":"Eagles","surface_form":"eagles","offset":547},{"uri":"Kite_(bird)","surface_form":"kites","offset":555},{"uri":"Harrier","surface_form":"harrier","offset":562},{"uri":"Old_World_vulture","surface_form":"Old World vulture","offset":575},{"uri":"Osprey","surface_form":"osprey","offset":626},{"uri":"Secretary_bird","surface_form":"secretary bird","offset":697},{"uri":"New_World_vulture","surface_form":"New World vulture","offset":717}]}
