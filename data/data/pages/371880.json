{"id":371880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semites","text":"e=\"preserve\">Semites was a word used for people who speak a Semitic language like Arabic or Hebrew. Scientists don't use the words \"Semites\" or \"Semitic peoples\" any longer, but they still speak of \"Semitic languages\".\nThe word \"Semite\" was taken from Shem, a son of Noah in Genesis (chapters 6-11). It was first used in the 1770s by German professors at G\u00F6ttingen university.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic language","offset":60},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":82},{"uri":"Hebrew","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":92},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"Scientist","offset":100},{"uri":"Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":275},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":334},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":341},{"uri":"G%C3%B6ttingen","surface_form":"G\u00F6ttingen","offset":355}]}
