{"id":372064,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire","text":"The Great Chicago Fire was a large fire that started on Sunday October 8, 1871 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The fire started out as nine separated fires. It burned until Tuesday October 10, 1871 when rain started to fall.\nThe fire destroyed and $192,000,000 in property. About 100,000 people were left homeless. Three hundred people died. Because of a large fire the night before, firefighters were too tired to quickly put out these fires.\nNo one is sure what caused the fire. A legend says that it started when a cow knocked over a lantern in Catherine O'Leary's barn on De Koven Street.\nThe oldest structure left standing in the area where the fire burned is the Couch family tomb. This stone tomb was built in 1858.\nNot all of the city was destroyed. Important places like the Stock Yards, where animals were slaughtered, were not damaged. Neither was the railroad system.\nThe second red star of the Chicago flag represents the fire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":82},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":91},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":101},{"uri":"Homeless","surface_form":"homeless","offset":310},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":488},{"uri":"Lantern","surface_form":"lantern","offset":542},{"uri":"Barn","surface_form":"barn","offset":573},{"uri":"Tomb","surface_form":"tomb","offset":687}]}
