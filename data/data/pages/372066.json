{"id":372066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop","text":"The Loop or Chicago Loop is one of 77 officially designated community areas in the City of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is the historic commercial center of downtown Chicago. It is the seat of government for Chicago and Cook County, as well as the historic theater and shopping district.\nAs established in social research done by the University of Chicago in the 1920s, the Loop is a defined community area of Chicago. The name comes from the eleveated train tracks that form a loop. Chicago's central business district community area is bounded on the west and north by the Chicago River, on the east by Lake Michigan, and on the south by Roosevelt Road. But the commercial core has grown into adjacent community areas.\nThe community area includes Grant Park and one of the largest art museums in the United States, the Art Institute of Chicago. Other major cultural institutions here include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Goodman Theatre, the Joffrey Ballet, the Cloud Gate, the Willis Tower, the Chicago Board of Trade Building, the central public Harold Washington Library, and the Chicago Cultural Center.\nIn what is now the Loop Community Area, on the southern banks of the Chicago River, near today's Michigan Avenue Bridge, the U.S. Army erected Fort Dearborn in 1803. It was the first settlement in the area sponsored by the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":91},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":100},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":110},{"uri":"Cook_County","surface_form":"Cook County","offset":228},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":342},{"uri":"Chicago_River","surface_form":"Chicago River","offset":583},{"uri":"Lake_Michigan","surface_form":"Lake Michigan","offset":613},{"uri":"Grant_Park","surface_form":"Grant Park","offset":757},{"uri":"Art_Institute_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Art Institute of Chicago","offset":829},{"uri":"Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Chicago Symphony Orchestra","offset":906},{"uri":"Lyric_Opera_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Lyric Opera of Chicago","offset":938},{"uri":"Goodman_Theatre","surface_form":"Goodman Theatre","offset":966},{"uri":"Joffrey_Ballet","surface_form":"Joffrey Ballet","offset":987},{"uri":"Cloud_Gate","surface_form":"Cloud Gate","offset":1007},{"uri":"Willis_Tower","surface_form":"Willis Tower","offset":1023},{"uri":"Chicago_Board_of_Trade_Building","surface_form":"Chicago Board of Trade Building","offset":1041},{"uri":"Harold_Washington_Library","surface_form":"Harold Washington Library","offset":1093},{"uri":"Chicago_Cultural_Center","surface_form":"Chicago Cultural Center","offset":1128}]}
