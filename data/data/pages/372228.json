He had a huge following of students, many of whom also later became well-known artists in Pakistan.\nMuseum.\nBefore he died, Shakir Ali donated many of his own paintings and artworks to a private, non-profit trust for a museum to be established. The Shakir Ali Museum was established by the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) after Shakir Ali died in 1975. The PNCA decided on a plan of buying the house of teacher and painter Shakir Ali, and of converting into a museum.\nThe museum is in Lahore. It is a fine museum with a good art collection and is a very useful learning site for art students and teachers. PNCA is in charge of the museums exhibitions and programs and the day-to-day management.\nSome of his other paintings can also be seen at the Lahore Museum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pakistani","surface_form":"Pakistani","offset":43},{"uri":"National_College_of_Arts","surface_form":"National College of Arts","offset":105},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":133},{"uri":"Non-profit_organization","surface_form":"non-profit","offset":437},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":460},{"uri":"Lahore_Museum","surface_form":"Lahore Museum","offset":1001}]}
