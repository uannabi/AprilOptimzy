{"id":37242,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence","text":"Existence usually means \"the state or fact of being\", but there are many different views on the meaning of the word existence, and what it means to exist.\nIn English, existence is usually connected with the verb \"to be\".\nThe first sentence can be understood to say \"I \"exist\" as a human\", and simply speaking, this is probably true. The fourth sentence is more difficult to understand, because it can be understood to say \"seven \"exists\" as the sum of four and three\", but \"seven\" is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human.\nThe question \"What is existence?\" is a very important one for philosophers, and many people think Aristotle is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":29},{"uri":"Fact","surface_form":"fact","offset":38},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":158},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"sum","offset":445},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophers","offset":608},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":644}]}
