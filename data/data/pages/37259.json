{"id":37259,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk_deer","text":"Musk deer are a group of even-toed ungulate mammals. They form the family \"Moschidae\". There are four species of musk deer, but they are all very similar. Musk deer are more primitive than true deer.\nAppearance.\nMusk deer are about 90 centimeters long and about 60 centimeters high with a tail length of 4-6 centimeters. They weigh about 10 kilograms. Musk deer usually have dark brown fur. Males have long upper canine teeth (called tusks), which can be up to 7 cm long. Musk deer do not have antlers. Male musk deer also have a musk gland.\nHabitat.\nMusk deer live in the mountain forests of Asia, Russia, China, and the Korean Peninsula. They live in the mountains, mostly at heights of 2500 to 3500 meters. They live in dense forests.\nLife.\nMusk deer are mostly active at night. Musk deer eat grass and moss; in winter they also eat twigs and lichen.\nMusk deer live alone. They only come together to mate. If two male musk deer meet, they fight, during which they can seriously hurt each other with their tusk-like teeth.\nThe female gives birth to 1-2 babies. A musk deer baby has spots on its fur.\nMusk deer and humans.\nMale musk deer have a gland that produces musk. Musk is used to make perfumes and soap, and it is also used in Traditional Chinese medicine. One musk gland has about 25 to 30 grams of musk. Musk deer have been hunted and killed for its musk. Because of this, musk deer have become fewer and endangered.\nAnother method is to catch a living musk deer, take its musk, and let it go free again. This method takes more time, so it is not used often. There are also musk deer farms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Even-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"even-toed ungulate","offset":25},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":44},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":67},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":102},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"true deer","offset":189},{"uri":"Centimeter","surface_form":"centimeters","offset":235},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilograms","offset":341},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":386},{"uri":"Antler","surface_form":"antler","offset":494},{"uri":"Musk","surface_form":"musk","offset":530},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":535},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":593},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":599},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":607},{"uri":"Korean_Peninsula","surface_form":"Korean Peninsula","offset":622},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":657},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":729},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":796},{"uri":"Moss","surface_form":"moss","offset":806},{"uri":"Lichen","surface_form":"lichen","offset":846},{"uri":"Musk","surface_form":"musk","offset":1166},{"uri":"Perfume","surface_form":"perfume","offset":1193},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"soap","offset":1206},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":1255},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":1299}]}
