She won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1935 with her husband, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Joliot. Curie was the daughter of Pierre and Marie Curie\nEducation.\nCurie started her studies at the Faculty of Science in Paris. During World War I, she served as a radiographer. Curie became Doctor of Science in 1925. She did her thesis on the alpha rays of polonium.\nDuring World War I (1914-1918), she helped her mother using X-ray technology in military hospitals. She helped train radiological workers. Curie then graduated from the Sorbonne in Paris. She earned a degree for work on radioactivity in polonium in 1925.\nResearch.\nCurie did important work on radioactivity, transmutation of elements, and nuclear physics. Curie and her husband won the 1935 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their creation of new radioactive elements. This work was written about in their paper \"Production artificielle d'\u00E9l\u00E9ments radioactifs. Preuve chimique de la transmutation des \u00E9l\u00E9ments\" (1934).\nIn 1938, she researched the action of neutrons on the heavy elements. This was an important part of the discovery of the nuclear fission of uranium. Curie became Professor in the Faculty of Science in Paris in 1937. She became Director of the Radium Institute in 1946. After six years as a Commissioner for Atomic Energy, Curie took part in the construction of the first French atomic pile in 1948. Its construction was continued after her death by her husband.\nPersonal life.\nCurie was born in Paris. Marie and Pierre Curie were her parents. In 1926, Curie married Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Joliot-Curie, a French physical chemist. He joined Curie\u2019s Radium Institute in 1925. In 1934, they discovered that they that could make stable elements radioactive. Curie and Joliot had a son and a daughter. Curie was also interested in social and intellectual advancement of women. In 1936, she became the Undersecretary of State for Scientific Research.\nCurie died on March 17th, 1956.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":59},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":66},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_for_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize for Chemistry","offset":89},{"uri":"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Joliot","surface_form":"Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Joliot","offset":141},{"uri":"Pierre_Curie","surface_form":"Pierre","offset":184},{"uri":"Marie_Curie","surface_form":"Marie Curie","offset":195},{"uri":"Faculty_of_Science","surface_form":"Faculty of Science","offset":251},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":273},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":287},{"uri":"Radiography","surface_form":"radiographer","offset":316},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Doctor of","offset":343},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"Science","offset":353},{"uri":"Thesis","surface_form":"thesis","offset":382},{"uri":"Alpha_radiation","surface_form":"alpha rays","offset":396},{"uri":"Polonium","surface_form":"polonium","offset":410},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":480},{"uri":"University_of_Paris","surface_form":"Sorbonne","offset":589},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactivity","offset":640},{"uri":"Polonium","surface_form":"polonium","offset":657},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactivity","offset":713},{"uri":"Transmutation","surface_form":"transmutation","offset":728},{"uri":"Element","surface_form":"element","offset":745},{"uri":"Nuclear_physics","surface_form":"nuclear physics","offset":759},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":1048},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":1073},{"uri":"Heavy_element","surface_form":"heavy element","offset":1089},{"uri":"Nuclear_fission","surface_form":"nuclear fission","offset":1156},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"uranium","offset":1175},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"Professor","offset":1197},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":1380},{"uri":"Atomic_pile","surface_form":"atomic pile","offset":1413},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical chemist","offset":1633}]}
