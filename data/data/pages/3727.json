{"id":3727,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_tube","text":"A test tube is a kind of laboratory glassware, composed of a fingerlike length of glass tubing, open at the top, usually with a rounded lip at the top, and a rounded 'U' shaped bottom.\nThey range in size from a couple inches to several inches long, from a few millimeters to a couple centimeters in diameter. They are designed to allow easy heating of samples, to be held in a flame, and often are made of expansion-resistant glasses, such as borosilicate glass (known by brand-names such as Pyrex and Kimax).\nTests tubes are often preferred above beakers when multiple small chemical or biological samples have to be handled and/or stored.\nVacutainers are a type of test tube that can be used for both collection and storage of blood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Laboratory_glassware","surface_form":"laboratory glassware","offset":25},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":82},{"uri":"Lip","surface_form":"lip","offset":136},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":218},{"uri":"Millimeter","surface_form":"millimeter","offset":260},{"uri":"Centimeter","surface_form":"centimeter","offset":284},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":299},{"uri":"Sample","surface_form":"sample","offset":352},{"uri":"Flame","surface_form":"flame","offset":377},{"uri":"Borosilicate_glass","surface_form":"borosilicate glass","offset":443},{"uri":"Beaker","surface_form":"beaker","offset":548},{"uri":"Vacutainer","surface_form":"Vacutainer","offset":641}]}
