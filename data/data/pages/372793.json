Jahan Begum was the last woman ruler, who after 25 years of rule, abdicated in favour of her son, Nawab Sir Hamidullah Khan. The rule of Begums gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system and a municipality constituted in 1907. The peaceful rule of Begums led to the rise of a unique mixed culture in Bhopal.
