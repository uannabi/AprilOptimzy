{"id":372829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisei","text":"ce=\"preserve\"> is a Japanese language term used in countries in North America and South America to name the children born to Japanese people who immigrated. The emigrants or immigrants who were born in Japan are called \"Issei\"; and their children born in the new country are called \"Nisei\" (second generation). The grandchildren of \"Issei\" are called \"Sansei\" (third generation).\nThe character and uniqueness of the \"Nisei\" is recognized in its social history.\nHistory.\nThe earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.\nImigration to Brazil began in 1908. Today, the community which grew from the \"Nisei\" children has become the largest Japanese emigrant population outside of Japan, including approximately 1.5 million Brazilians. Other communities of \"Nisei\" grew up in the United States, Canada, and Peru.\nThe use of the term \"Nisei\" was modeled after an \"Issei\" pattern or template. In the 1930s, the term \"Issei\" came into common use. The word replaced the term \"immigrant\" (\"ijusha\"). This change in usage mirrored an evolution in the way the \"Issei\" looked at themselves. The label \"Issei\" also included the idea of belonging to the new country.\nCultural profile.\nThe term \"Nikkei\" (\u65E5\u7CFB) was created by sociologists in the late 20th century. The \"Nikkei\" include all of the world's Japanese immigrants and their descendants.\nThe \"Issei\" were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice. Their \"Nisei\" sons and daughters grew up with a national and cultural point-of-view that was different from their parents.\nAlthough the \"Issei\" kept an emotional connection with Japan, they created homes in a country far from Japan. The \"Nisei\" had never known a country other than the one into which they were born.\nThe \"Issei,\" \"Nisei\" and \"Sansei\" generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, and religious practice, and other matters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese language","offset":20},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":64},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":82},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":125},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigrated","offset":145},{"uri":"Emigration","surface_form":"emigrants","offset":161},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigrants","offset":174},{"uri":"Issei","surface_form":"Issei","offset":220},{"uri":"Grandchild","surface_form":"grandchildren","offset":315},{"uri":"Sansei","surface_form":"Sansei","offset":352},{"uri":"Character","surface_form":"character","offset":384},{"uri":"Uniqueness","surface_form":"uniqueness","offset":398},{"uri":"Emigration","surface_form":"emigrant","offset":511},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":532},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":705},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":804},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":819},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":831},{"uri":"Pattern","surface_form":"pattern","offset":894},{"uri":"Template","surface_form":"template","offset":905},{"uri":"Japanese_diaspora","surface_form":"Nikkei","offset":1209}]}
