{"id":37287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup","text":"e=\"preserve\">The FIBA Basketball World Cup, known as the FIBA World Championship from 1950 through 2010, is a world basketball tournament for men's national teams held once every four years by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). After the 2014 FIBA World Cup, the tournament will move to a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup. To that end, no tournament will be held in 2018; the FIBA World Cup will resume in 2019.\nThe current champions are Spain. They defeated Argentina 95-75 in the 2019 tournament at the Cadillac Center in Beijing, China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":116},{"uri":"International_Basketball_Federation","surface_form":"International Basketball Federation","offset":197},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":349},{"uri":"Spain_national_basketball_team","surface_form":"Spain","offset":480},{"uri":"Argentina_national_basketball_team","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":501},{"uri":"Cadillac_Center","surface_form":"Cadillac Center","offset":547},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing, China","offset":566}]}
