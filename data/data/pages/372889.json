He was the brother of naturalist Louis Ventenat (1765\u20131794).\nVentenat took a trip to England while he was employed as director of the ecclesiastic library Sainte-Genevi\u00E8ve in Paris. While in England, he visited the country's botanical gardens. This inspired him to pursue a career in science. Later he studied under and worked with a botanist named Charles Louis L'H\u00E9ritier de Brutelle (1746\u20131800). In 1795, he was elected a member of the \"Institut national des sciences et des arts\". They later changed their name to be the \"Acad\u00E9mie des sciences\".\nIn 1794 he wrote a treatise on the principles of botany. It was called \"Principes de botanique, expliqu\u00E9s au Lyc\u00E9e r\u00E9publicain par Ventenat\". It did not receive much interest when it was released, and Ventenat became so disappointed that he reportedly made efforts to buy all copies of the book and have them destroyed. In 1798 he published a French translation of Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu's \"Genera plantarum\" as \"Tableau du r\u00E8gne v\u00E9g\u00E9tal selon la m\u00E9thode de Jussieu\". In his translation of the work, Ventenat added information about the properties and uses of plants.\nIn 1799 he published \"Description des plantes nouvelles et peu connues, cultiv\u00E9es dans le jardin de J.-M. Cels\". This book described plants in the botanical garden of Jacques Philippe Martin Cels (1740\u20131806). In 1803 he published \"Le Jardin de la Malmaison\" because Jos\u00E9phine de Beauharnais (1763\u20131814) asked him to write it. He wanted to make sure the rare species of plants found in the gardens and greenhouses of Ch\u00E2teau de Malmaison were remembered forever. The pictures and drawings in the two aforementioned works were performed by famed botanical artist Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00E9 (1759\u20131840). Ventenat is also credited with continuing the work on Jean Baptiste Fran\u00E7ois Pierre Bulliard's \"Histoire des champignons de la France\". This was a landmark (very important) work on mushrooms native to France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":82},{"uri":"Limoges","surface_form":"Limoges","offset":99},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":130},{"uri":"Louis_Ventenat","surface_form":"Louis Ventenat","offset":141},{"uri":"Ecclesiastic","surface_form":"ecclesiastic","offset":242},{"uri":"Library_Sainte_Genevi%C3%A8ve","surface_form":"Sainte-Genevi\u00E8ve","offset":263},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":283},{"uri":"Botanical_gardens","surface_form":"botanical gardens","offset":333},{"uri":"Charles_Louis_L%27H%C3%A9ritier_de_Brutelle","surface_form":"Charles Louis L'H\u00E9ritier de Brutelle","offset":457},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_des_sciences","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie des sciences","offset":634},{"uri":"Treatise","surface_form":"treatise","offset":677},{"uri":"Principle","surface_form":"principles","offset":693},{"uri":"Antoine-Laurent_de_Jussieu","surface_form":"Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu","offset":1023},{"uri":"Jacques_Philippe_Martin_Cels","surface_form":"Jacques Philippe Martin Cels","offset":1397},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9phine de Beauharnais","offset":1496},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Malmaison","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Malmaison","offset":1646},{"uri":"Botanical_artist","surface_form":"botanical artist","offset":1774},{"uri":"Pierre-Joseph_Redout%C3%A9","surface_form":"Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00E9","offset":1791},{"uri":"Jean_Baptiste_Fran%C3%A7ois_Pierre_Bulliard","surface_form":"Jean Baptiste Fran\u00E7ois Pierre Bulliard","offset":1880},{"uri":"Mushroom","surface_form":"mushroom","offset":2007}]}
