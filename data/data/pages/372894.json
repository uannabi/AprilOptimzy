With the Tuileries it was the headquarters of the French government from 1800 to 1802.\nHistory.\nJos\u00E9phine de Beauharnais bought the manor house in April 1797 for herself and her husband, General Napol\u00E9on Bonaparte. The future Napol\u00E9on I of France was at that time away fighting the Egyptian Campaign. Malmaison was a run-down estate, seven miles (12\u00A0km) west of central Paris that encompassed nearly of woods and meadows.\nWhen he came back from Egypt, Bonaparte was angry at Jos\u00E9phine for buying such an expensive house. She had expected him to bring back a lot of money from the Egyptian campaign. She had paid well over 300,000 francs for the house and it needed extensive renovations. She spent a lot of money fixing it. Malmaison would bring great happiness to the Bonapartes. Jos\u00E9phine's daughter, Hortense would call it \"a delicious spot\".\nJos\u00E9phine worked hard to transform the large estate into \"the most beautiful and curious garden in Europe. She wanted it to be a model of good cultivation\". She located rare and exotic plants and animals to enhance the gardens. Jos\u00E9phine wrote: \"I wish that Malmaison may soon become the source of riches for all [of France]\"...\nIn 1800, Jos\u00E9phine built a heated orangery large enough for 300 pineapple plants. Five years later she ordered the building of a greenhouse. It was heated by a dozen coal-burning stoves. From 1803 until her death in 1814 she cultivated nearly 200 new plants in France for the first time.\nBirds and animals of all sorts began to fill her garden. They were allowed to roam free among the grounds. At the height of her days at Malmaison, Jos\u00E9phine had the company of kangaroos, emus, black swans, zebras, sheep, gazelles, ostriches, chamois, a seal, antelopes and llamas to name a few. Some were from the Baudin expedition.\nAfter her divorce from Napol\u00E9on, Jos\u00E9phine received Malmaison in her own right, along with a pension of 5\u00A0million francs a year, and remained there until her death in 1814. After his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 Napol\u00E9on returned to the house before his exile to the island of Saint Helena.\nIn 1842 Malmaison was purchased by Maria Christina, widow of King Ferdinand VII of Spain; she lived there with her second husband Agust\u00EDn Fernando Mu\u00F1oz, 1st Duke of Ri\u00E1nsares. In 1861 Maria Christina sold the property to Napoleon III.\nMalmaison has been restored by the French famous architect Pierre Humbert in the early 20th century.\nPresent times.\nThe public can visit the manor house as a Napoleonic \"mus\u00E9e national\". The museum lies on RN 13 (\"route nationale\" 13) from Paris and bus 258 from RER A \"Grande Arche\" station.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau","surface_form":"ch\u00E2teau","offset":51},{"uri":"Rueil-Malmaison","surface_form":"Rueil-Malmaison","offset":75},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9phine de Beauharnais","offset":155},{"uri":"Tuileries","surface_form":"Tuileries","offset":190},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9phine de Beauharnais","offset":277},{"uri":"Napol%C3%A9on_I_of_France","surface_form":"Napol\u00E9on I of France","offset":407},{"uri":"Egyptian_Campaign","surface_form":"Egyptian Campaign","offset":463},{"uri":"Hortense_de_Beauharnais","surface_form":"Hortense","offset":984},{"uri":"Orangery","surface_form":"orangery","offset":1390},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":1420},{"uri":"Greenhouse","surface_form":"greenhouse","offset":1485},{"uri":"Kangaroos","surface_form":"kangaroos","offset":1820},{"uri":"Emus","surface_form":"emus","offset":1831},{"uri":"Black_swans","surface_form":"black swans","offset":1837},{"uri":"Zebras","surface_form":"zebras","offset":1850},{"uri":"Gazelles","surface_form":"gazelles","offset":1865},{"uri":"Ostriches","surface_form":"ostriches","offset":1875},{"uri":"Chamois","surface_form":"chamois","offset":1886},{"uri":"Pinniped","surface_form":"seal","offset":1897},{"uri":"Antelopes","surface_form":"antelopes","offset":1903},{"uri":"Llama","surface_form":"llama","offset":1917},{"uri":"Baudin_expedition_to_Australia","surface_form":"Baudin expedition","offset":1958},{"uri":"Battle_of_Waterloo","surface_form":"Battle of Waterloo","offset":2174},{"uri":"Saint_Helena","surface_form":"Saint Helena","offset":2266},{"uri":"Maria_Christina_of_the_Two_Sicilies","surface_form":"Maria Christina","offset":2315},{"uri":"Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain","surface_form":"Ferdinand VII of Spain","offset":2346},{"uri":"Agust%C3%ADn_Fernando_Mu%C3%B1oz%2C_1st_Duke_of_Ri%C3%A1nsares","surface_form":"Agust\u00EDn Fernando Mu\u00F1oz, 1st Duke of Ri\u00E1nsares","offset":2410},{"uri":"Napoleon_III","surface_form":"Napoleon III","offset":2502},{"uri":"Pierre_Humbert_(architect)","surface_form":"Pierre Humbert","offset":2575},{"uri":"RER_A","surface_form":"RER A","offset":2779},{"uri":"Grande_Arche","surface_form":"Grande Arche","offset":2786}]}
