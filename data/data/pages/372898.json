It was defined by Russian botanist Nikolai Tzvelev in 1990. It was identified before (and taking precedence over) \"Bracteantha\" which was described the following year. A 2002 molecular study of the tribe Gnaphalieae found the genus is likely polyphyletic, with \"X. bracteatum\" and \"X. viscosum\" removed from each other.\nThe genus was formerly included in \"Helichrysum\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":46},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":55},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":82},{"uri":"Gnaphalieae","surface_form":"Gnaphalieae","offset":297},{"uri":"Polyphyletic","surface_form":"polyphyletic","offset":335},{"uri":"Strawflower","surface_form":"Helichrysum","offset":449}]}
