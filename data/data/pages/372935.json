{"id":372935,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-impressionism","text":"Neo-impressionism is a term coined by a French art critic in 1886 to describe an art movement founded by Georges Seurat. Seurat\u2019s greatest masterpiece, \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\", marked the beginning of this movement when it appeared at an exhibition of the \"Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 des Artistes Ind\u00E9pendants\" in Paris.\nAround this time, many painters were in search of new methods. Followers of neo-impressionism were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores. Science-based interpretation of lines and colours influenced neo-impressionists\u2019 characterization of their own contemporary art.\nPointillism is often mentioned, because it was the dominant technique in the beginning of the movement.\nThe art critic F\u00E9lix F\u00E9n\u00E9on first used the term neo-impressionism in an article he wrote for the Belgian journal \"L\u2019art Moderne\" in 1886. With the term he wanted to show that the way Seurat painted was different from the ways painting was done in Impressionism. In total, the movement lasted about five years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art_movement","surface_form":"art movement","offset":81},{"uri":"Georges_Seurat","surface_form":"Georges Seurat","offset":105},{"uri":"Contemporary_art","surface_form":"contemporary art","offset":608},{"uri":"Pointillism","surface_form":"Pointillism","offset":626},{"uri":"F%C3%A9lix_F%C3%A9n%C3%A9on","surface_form":"F\u00E9lix F\u00E9n\u00E9on","offset":745},{"uri":"Impressionism","surface_form":"Impressionism","offset":977}]}
