He was the third child of an immigrant Pomeranian father and Dutch mother. His mother died soon after he was born; at the age of thirteen his father (who died a year later) sent him to Europe for his education.\nEducation.\nHe started his education studying theology at Halle.

He rented an upper floor of a house in a poor part of town. In his later life he was unemployed, unmarried, poor and kept to himself. He did correspond with botanists throughout Europe however. Because of his financial difficulties, Persoon agreed to donate his herbarium to the House of Orange, in return for an adequate pension for life.\nAcademic career.\nThe origin of Persoon's botanical interest is unknown. The earliest of his writings was \"Abbildungen der Schw\u00E4mme\" (Illustrations of the fungi). It was published in three parts. The first was published in 1790. The second in 1791. The third was published and 1793. Between 1805 and 1807, he published two volumes of his [http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/spa/Volumenes.php?Libro=373 \"Synopsis plantarum\"].
