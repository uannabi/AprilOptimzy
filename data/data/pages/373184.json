{"id":373184,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopsony","text":"e=\"preserve\">In microeconomics an oligopsony is a market form where there are few buyers. There may be many sellers, but because there are few buyers, the decision each buyer makes influences the whole market. Therefore this is an example of imperfect competition.\nOne example of this is the market for cocoa: Three companies (Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Callebaut) buy most of the world production, usually from small farmers. Other examples are that of tobacco or that of bananas. By extension the \"market for work\" also has this characteristic: there are few companies (employers, \"buying work\") and many people \"offering to work\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microeconomics","surface_form":"microeconomics","offset":16},{"uri":"Market_form","surface_form":"market form","offset":50},{"uri":"Imperfect_competition","surface_form":"imperfect competition","offset":242},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":292},{"uri":"Cocoa","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":303},{"uri":"Cargill","surface_form":"Cargill","offset":327},{"uri":"Archer_Daniels_Midland","surface_form":"Archer Daniels Midland","offset":336},{"uri":"Callebaut","surface_form":"Callebaut","offset":363},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":463},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":482}]}
