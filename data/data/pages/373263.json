The year 1942 was crucial in his life because, upon hearing the sound of the clarinet through Radio London, he realized that this was what he wanted. And since then, fascinated by the beauty of jazz, he had regularly visited Concert Hall in Belgrade and listened to jazz concerts of then our masters (Elija Geni\u0107, Mladen Gute\u0161a, Vojin Popovi\u0107 and others), as well as of the foreign performers (Kari Burnett, German singer).\nMihailo attended the Third Male Grammar School and Secondary Music School \"Stankovic\", the piano department. He then enrolled at the Faculty of Sciences in Belgrade, department of chemistry, and left it for the music before graduation.\nAfter the war, in 1945, Mihailo continued to learn the piano in Secondary Music School \u201EStankovi\u0107\u201C.\nThe biggest turning point in his life happened in 1946 when he saw and bought his first clarinet in a consignment shop. Since he had possessed a good knowledge of music, he began to practice day and night, this time \u2013 clarinet.\nAt the age of eighteen, inspired by the music of Glenn Miller and Woody Herman Orchestra, he made a firm decision to devote his life to the clarinet and music and graduated the clarinet from Secondary Music School \u201CSlavenski\u201D in the class of professor Franjo Partli\u0107.\nWork with the orchestra Fis-dur.\nJazz was very appealing to Mihailo \u017Divanovi\u0107. Accomplishing himself in this field, in 1946 he formed a jazz orchestra \"Fis-dur\" which he named after his clarinet Fis-dur. The orchestra was led by Michael himself. Due to the quality, the orchestra had very soon become one of the most famous in Belgrade. The first members of the orchestra were: Milo Dimitrijevi\u0107 (guitar), Du\u0161ko Radi\u0107 (piano), Stanislav Sodermajer (drums) and Mihailo \u017Divanovi\u0107 (clarinet).\nAnxious to learn and progress further in music in 1946. he continued to study clarinet at the \"Allmusic Academy\" where he met Eduard Sa\u0111il, also a student of clarinet.\nOrchestra \"Fis-dur\" achieved success after success: performances, tours, great delight and standing ovations of the satisfied audience. In the year 1947, there was a large change in the orchestra with the new top musicians: Predrag Ivanovi\u0107 (trumpet), dr Aleksandar Peji\u0107 (accordion), Milovan Vukajlovi\u0107-Genije (piano and accordion), Predrag Stefanovi\u0107-Grof (-Count)(trombone) and Branko Pejakovi\u0107 (bass). Only Sodermajer and \u017Divanovi\u0107 remained of the old members.\nSignificant, almost crucial meeting with Boro Rokovi\u0107 (a trumpeter, composer, arranger, pianist and accordionist) occurred while playing at a dance party in 1949. Bora heard him and was impressed by his talent. He wanted to help Mihajlo, introduce him more and better into the world of jazz and direct him to the true value. He offered him to join his orchestra. \u017Divanovi\u0107 played there until the end of 1953. Soon he was invited by Aleksandar Ne\u0107ak and played in all three orchestras at the same time.\nWork in Radio Belgrade Revue Orchestra.\nWell-known trombonist Mladen Gute\u0161a founded Radio Belgrade Light Revue Orchestra on 18 January 1948. By the end of 1949. he invited Mihailo \u017Divanovi\u0107 to become its member. Mihajlo was then a student of the \"Music Academy\" in the class of renowned professor Bruno Brun. For such a work and permanent employment, he had to get permission from his professor. Professor Bruno gave him consent.\nIn the Revue Orchestra Mihailo first played the baritone saxophone, and then the instrument which he had been studying - the clarinet. Radio Belgrade Revue Orchestra had many successful tours and concerts. One in Zagreb in 1953, which proved that Belgrade was the center of Yugoslav jazz.\nBefore the end of the study in 1954, persuaded by professors from the Academy, he left Radio Belgrade Revue Orchestra and got a job in the National Theatre Orchestra (Belgrade Opera) where he worked four years (until 1958).\nAs a student at the Academy he achieved a remarkable success in the \"Yugoslav competition of young artists\", clarinetist of classical music, in Skopje in 1954. There he won the second prize (the first was not awarded to anyone).\nIn 1955, he graduated clarinet successfully.\nWork in Mihailo Zivanovic's octet.\nIn 1955, Zivanovic founded \"Mihailo Zivanovic\u2019s Octet\" in which he played the baritone saxophone. Alongside him, Predrag Ivanovi\u0107 played the trumpet, Nikola Dajzinger the alt saxophone, Eduard Sa\u0111il the tenor saxophone, Predrag Stefanovi\u0107 the trombone, Vojkan \u0110onovi\u0107i\u0107 the guitar, Robert Hauber the piano and Rade Milivojevi\u0107 the drums.\nOctet had been performing for 10 years with great success on radio stations in the country and abroad. It soon became one of the leading Yugoslav ensembles for contemporary and experimental jazz music.\nFurther life.\nSince 1958, almost to the last days of his life, he had been employed by the \"Music Production branch of Radio Television of Serbia\". That same year he became a permanent member of the Light String Orchestra led by Ilija Geni\u0107 and later a conductor of the Jazz Orchestra i Revue Orchestra of Radio Television Belgrade.\nIn 1960, he became a member of \"Serbian Composers Association\".\nIn 1975, he was appointed head of the \"Light Ensemble of RTB\", and since 1978 permanent conductor of the \"Light Orchestra of RTB\" until his death.\nImportance of Mihailo Zivanovic.\nMihailo \u017Divanovi\u0107 was a very prolific composer.
