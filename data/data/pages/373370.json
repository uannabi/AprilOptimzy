{"id":373370,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobermann","text":"Dobermann or Doberman Pinscher is a medium to large dog breed. It originated in Germany about 1890. It was named after a tax collector, Friedrich Louis Dobermann (1834-1894), who wanted a dog as a companion and for protection. Doberman Pinschers are known as being very intelligent, loyal and fearless dogs. They are used by police forces, search and rescue dogs, guard dogs and as guide dogs for blind people.\nSize.\nThe Doberman is a dog of medium large size. Although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, according to the FCI standard the dog typically stands between and The Kennel Club in the UK quote as being ideal. The female is typically somewhere between. A height of is considered ideal.\nColors.\nDobermans have short smooth coats which are most commonly black. Less common are red (reddish-brown), blue, or fawn-colored coats. Blue and fawn colored Dobermans usually have rust-colored (reddish-brown) markings on their legs, chest and heads.\nEars and tail.\nNormally a Doberman puppy has floppy ears and a long tail. While still a puppy, the tails are often shortened by surgery (called \"docking\") which heals quickly and causes the puppy very little pain. The ears are cut to a point and so they stand up (called \"cropping\"). This takes longer to heal. Cropping is considered by many to be unnecessary and is illegal in much of Europe. But it is still done in the United States and is part of the standard.\nTemperament.\nPeople who think they are like any other dogs or are often vicious and dangerous are for the most part wrong. It is true that any dog that is mistreated or not taken care of can become dangerous. Viciousness is a learned behavior and few dogs, including the Doberman, are naturally vicious. Dobermans can be protective and guarded or they can be sweet and eager to please. To get the desired temperament, training should start when the dog is about 8 months old.\nThe American Kennel Club describes the Doberman as\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dog_breed","surface_form":"dog breed","offset":52},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":80},{"uri":"Tax_collector","surface_form":"tax collector","offset":121},{"uri":"Friedrich_Louis_Dobermann","surface_form":"Friedrich Louis Dobermann","offset":136},{"uri":"Companion_dog","surface_form":"companion","offset":197},{"uri":"Guard_dog","surface_form":"protection","offset":215},{"uri":"Intelligent","surface_form":"intelligent","offset":270},{"uri":"Loyalty","surface_form":"loyal","offset":283},{"uri":"Fearless","surface_form":"fearless","offset":293},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":325},{"uri":"Search_and_rescue","surface_form":"search and rescue","offset":340},{"uri":"Guard_dog","surface_form":"guard dog","offset":364},{"uri":"Guide_dog","surface_form":"guide dog","offset":382},{"uri":"Blind","surface_form":"blind","offset":397},{"uri":"Breed_standard","surface_form":"breed standard","offset":474},{"uri":"The_Kennel_Club","surface_form":"The Kennel Club","offset":592},{"uri":"Smooth","surface_form":"smooth","offset":745},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"coats","offset":752},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":805},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":818},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":826},{"uri":"Tan_(color)","surface_form":"fawn-colored","offset":835},{"uri":"Leg","surface_form":"leg","offset":947},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":953},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":963},{"uri":"Puppy","surface_form":"puppy","offset":1005},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":1022},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":1038},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":1098},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":1178},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1356},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1392},{"uri":"Vicious","surface_form":"vicious","offset":1507},{"uri":"Danger","surface_form":"danger","offset":1519},{"uri":"Mistreat","surface_form":"mistreat","offset":1590},{"uri":"Protect","surface_form":"protect","offset":1756},{"uri":"Guarded","surface_form":"guarded","offset":1771},{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"training","offset":1853}]}
