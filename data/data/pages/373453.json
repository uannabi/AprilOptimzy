It is presented to people and organisations who have \"demonstrated\" the principles of the \"Four Freedoms\" of US-president Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\nPresident Roosevelt described his \"Four Freedoms\" during the State of the Union speech of 6 January 1941. In his speech he said that if democracy is to survive and flourish, people everywhere in the world are entitled to four human rights: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.\nThe awards have been given since 1982, alternately in the United States and the Netherlands. In odd years the awards are given to Americans by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, New York. In some years special awards have been given.\nIn even years the award ceremony is held in Middelburg and honours non-Americans. The choice for Middelburg was motivated by the suspected descendance of the family Roosevelt from the village of Oud-Vossemeer in the province of Zeeland.\nFour Freedoms Speech.\nThe speech delivered by President Roosevelt incorporated the following\nIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.\nThat is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.\u2014Franklin D.
