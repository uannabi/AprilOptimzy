{"id":3736,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium","text":"Beryllium is in group 2 of the periodic table, so it is an alkaline earth metal. It is grayish (slightly gray) in color. It has an atomic number of 4 and is symbolized by the letters Be. It is toxic and should not be handled without proper training.\nBeryllium has 4 electrons, 4 protons, and 5 neutrons.\nBeryllium has one of the highest melting points of the light metals: 1560 K (1287 \u00B0C). It is added to other metals to make stronger alloys. Beryllium-copper alloy is used in tools because it does not make sparks.\nAt standard temperature and pressure, beryllium resists oxidation when exposed to oxygen.\nBeryllium is best known for the chemical compounds it forms. Beryllium combines with aluminium, silicon and oxygen to make a mineral called beryl. Emerald and aquamarine are two varieties of beryl which are used as gemstones in jewelry.\nSince it has a very high stiffness to weight ratio, beryllium is used to make the diaphragms in some high-end speakers.\nUses.\nBeryllium is used to make jet aircrafts, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites, including the James Webb telescope. Beryllium can reflect neutron<nowiki/>s, and thin foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon<nowiki/>s as the outer layer of the plutonium pits. Beryllium is also used in fuel rods for CANDU reactors. Beryllium is used to make many dental alloys.\nRarity.\nIt is a relatively rare element in the universe. It usually occurs when larger atomic nuclei have split up. In stars, beryllium is depleted because it is fused and builds larger elements.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Group_(periodic_table)","surface_form":"group 2","offset":16},{"uri":"Alkaline_earth_metal","surface_form":"alkaline earth","offset":59},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":74},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":131},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":157},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":193},{"uri":"Electrons","surface_form":"electrons","offset":266},{"uri":"Protons","surface_form":"protons","offset":279},{"uri":"Neutrons","surface_form":"neutrons","offset":294},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":337},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":436},{"uri":"Spark","surface_form":"spark","offset":509},{"uri":"Standard_temperature_and_pressure","surface_form":"standard temperature and pressure","offset":520},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":573},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":639},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":692},{"uri":"Silicon","surface_form":"silicon","offset":703},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":715},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":732},{"uri":"Beryl","surface_form":"beryl","offset":747},{"uri":"Emerald","surface_form":"Emerald","offset":754},{"uri":"Aquamarine","surface_form":"aquamarine","offset":766},{"uri":"Jewelry","surface_form":"jewelry","offset":835},{"uri":"Loudspeaker","surface_form":"speakers","offset":954},{"uri":"Jet_aircraft","surface_form":"jet aircrafts","offset":996},{"uri":"Guided_missile","surface_form":"guided missiles","offset":1011},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":1028},{"uri":"Satellite_(artificial)","surface_form":"satellites","offset":1044},{"uri":"James_Webb_telescope","surface_form":"James Webb telescope","offset":1070},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":1114},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"nuclear weapon","offset":1183},{"uri":"Plutonium","surface_form":"plutonium","offset":1234},{"uri":"CANDU","surface_form":"CANDU","offset":1290},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactor","surface_form":"reactors","offset":1296},{"uri":"Dental_alloy","surface_form":"dental alloys","offset":1337},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":1399}]}
