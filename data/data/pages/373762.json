{"id":373762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamplifier","text":"Preamplifier is a type of electronic amplifier. It doesn't have enough power to feed speakers. Rather a preamplifier amplifies weak signals, for example from a microphone, for electronic processing or distribution.\nEarly preamplifiers used vacuum tubes. Since the 1960s, most electronic amplifiers have been built with transistors. Transistors are lighter, less expensive, and more reliable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Power","surface_form":"power","offset":71},{"uri":"Loudspeaker","surface_form":"speakers","offset":85},{"uri":"Microphone","surface_form":"microphone","offset":160},{"uri":"Vacuum_tube","surface_form":"vacuum tube","offset":240},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":264},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":319}]}
