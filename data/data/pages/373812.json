{"id":373812,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorah_(Temple)","text":"The menorah was an ancient lamp that accompanied the Israelites during their wanderings through the desert and later sat in their Temple. It had seven branches (a center branch with three branches on each of its sides), and it was made of gold. Olive oil fed the menorah's flames. God commanded Moses to construct the menorah while Moses and the Israelites were wandering the desert (see Book of Numbers chapter 8).\nThe menorah is associated with miracles, such as the miracle of Hanukkah. During First Jewish-Roman War, the Romans destroyed the Temple and took its treasures, including the menorah. They took the menorah to Rome and displayed it throughout the city during a celebration of their victory over the Jewish rebels.\nToday, the menorah is featured in the present state of Israel's coat of arms, and some Jewish places of worship contain replicas of the menorah. A nine-branch menorah is used during Hanukkah.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Israelites","surface_form":"Israelites","offset":53},{"uri":"Temple_in_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Temple","offset":130},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":239},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"Olive oil","offset":245},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":281},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":295},{"uri":"Book_of_Numbers","surface_form":"Book of Numbers","offset":388},{"uri":"Miracles","surface_form":"miracles","offset":447},{"uri":"Miracle_of_Hanukkah","surface_form":"miracle of Hanukkah","offset":469},{"uri":"First_Jewish-Roman_War","surface_form":"First Jewish-Roman War","offset":497},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":525},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":625},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"coat of arms","offset":793}]}
