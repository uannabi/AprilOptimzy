{"id":373819,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akara","text":"Acaraj\u00E9 is a type of fritter made from cowpeas. It is the most popular street food in the north eastern state of Brazil, Bahia. The recipe for acaraj\u00E9 was introduced to Bahia by slaves who came from Yor\u00F9b\u00E1land during the colonial period. In Nigeria acaraj\u00E9 is named Akara, and the women who sell it call out \"Akara je\", which means \"Come and eat Akara\" in Yoruba. So when freed Yor\u00F9b\u00E1 slaves started to sell acaraj\u00E9 on the streets, they used the same technique and Brazilians assumed that they were selling acaraj\u00E9.\nAcaraj\u00E9 is made with black-eyed peas, garlic, ginger and salt, then deep fried in dende - a reddish oil from the palm fruit. When done, they are split in half and filled with vatap\u00E1, caruru, fried shrimp, salad and pepper. Brazilians modified the recipe from Nigeria a little and started to fill the acaraj\u00E9 with other afro-Brazilian foods. In Nigeria, none of the Brazilian accompaniments are served; just the bean cake is eaten, fried with palm oil or vegetable oil.\nAcaraj\u00E9 are served on the streets by women who call themselves baiana do acaraj\u00E9. They wear traditional clothes, white flowing dresses, sometimes turbans and colorful necklaces related to the rituals of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candombl\u00E9. In Nigeria, however, there is no ceremony and the women who sell Akara wear whatever they like. Nowadays, these baianas sell acaraj\u00E9 as a way of life and it\u2019s something that helps to sustain their families.\nIn 2004, acaraj\u00E9 was declared part of Brazil's heritage culture in the region of Bahia. It's one of the most important symbols of the culture of Bahia and it's enjoyed by all types of tourists. They are delighted by the taste, color and relaxing way of eating acaraj\u00E9 on the streets.\nHistory.\nAcaraj\u00E9 was specially made when a person dies at the age of 70 or above. It was usually fried in large quantities and given to every household that was related to the person who died. Acaraj\u00E9 was also to be made in large quantities when warriors won a war. The wives of the warriors were to fry acaraj\u00E9 and give it to all the people in the village.\nAcaraj\u00E9, a recipe taken to Brazil by the slaves from the West African coast. It is called \"akara\" by the Yoruba people of south-western Nigeria and by the people of Sierra Leone. It is called \"kosai\" by the Hausa people of Nigeria. It is called \"koose\" in Ghana. It is eaten with millet or corn pudding. In Nigeria, akara is usually eaten with bread, ogi, which is a type of cornmeal made with fine corn flour.\nIn Sierra Leone, akara is made up of rice flour, mashed banana, baking powder, and sugar. After mixing the ingredients together, it is dropped in oil by hand, and fried. It is then formed into a ball. Akara is usually made for events like Pulnado (event held due to the birth of a child), a wedding, funeral, or party.\nIn Brazil.\nAcaraj\u00E9 sold on the street in Brazil are made with fried beef, mutton, dried shrimp, pigweed, fufu, osun sauce, and coconut. Today in Bahia, most street vendors who sell acaraj\u00E9 are women. They first started selling acaraj\u00E9 in the 19th century. The money gotten from selling acaraj\u00E9 were used to buy the freedom of enslaved family members until slavery was banned in Brazil in 1888. Selling acaraj\u00E9 served as a source of family income. The city now has more than 500 acaraj\u00E9 vendors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fritter","surface_form":"fritter","offset":21},{"uri":"Cowpea","surface_form":"cowpeas","offset":39},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":113},{"uri":"Bahia","surface_form":"Bahia","offset":121},{"uri":"Yor%C3%B9b%C3%A1land","surface_form":"Yor\u00F9b\u00E1land","offset":199},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":713},{"uri":"Black_pepper","surface_form":"pepper","offset":731},{"uri":"Candombl%C3%A9","surface_form":"Candombl\u00E9","offset":1216},{"uri":"Fried","surface_form":"fried","offset":1815},{"uri":"Household","surface_form":"household","offset":1860},{"uri":"Warrior","surface_form":"warriors","offset":1964},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":2067},{"uri":"Recipe","surface_form":"recipe","offset":2087},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":2103},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slaves","offset":2117},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West African","offset":2133},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":2146},{"uri":"Yoruba_people","surface_form":"Yoruba people","offset":2181},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":2212},{"uri":"Sierra_Leone","surface_form":"Sierra Leone","offset":2241},{"uri":"Hausa_people","surface_form":"Hausa people","offset":2283},{"uri":"Ghana","surface_form":"Ghana","offset":2332},{"uri":"Millet","surface_form":"millet","offset":2356},{"uri":"Corn","surface_form":"corn","offset":2366},{"uri":"Pudding","surface_form":"pudding","offset":2371},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":2420},{"uri":"Cornmeal","surface_form":"cornmeal","offset":2451},{"uri":"Cornflour","surface_form":"corn flour","offset":2475},{"uri":"Rice_flour","surface_form":"rice flour","offset":2524},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":2543},{"uri":"Baking_powder","surface_form":"baking powder","offset":2551},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":2570},{"uri":"Ingredient","surface_form":"ingredients","offset":2594},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":2633},{"uri":"Event","surface_form":"events","offset":2714},{"uri":"Pulnado","surface_form":"Pulnado","offset":2726},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":2778},{"uri":"Funeral","surface_form":"funeral","offset":2787},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":2874},{"uri":"Mutton","surface_form":"mutton","offset":2880},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":2894},{"uri":"Pigweed","surface_form":"pigweed","offset":2902},{"uri":"Fufu","surface_form":"fufu","offset":2911},{"uri":"Osun_sauce","surface_form":"osun sauce","offset":2917},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":2933},{"uri":"Bahia","surface_form":"Bahia","offset":2951},{"uri":"Street_vendor","surface_form":"street vendors","offset":2963},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":3048},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":3121},{"uri":"Enslave","surface_form":"enslaved","offset":3132},{"uri":"Family_member","surface_form":"family members","offset":3141},{"uri":"Banned","surface_form":"banned","offset":3174},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":3184},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"family","offset":3238},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":3245},{"uri":"Vendor","surface_form":"vendors","offset":3292}]}
