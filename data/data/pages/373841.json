{"id":373841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake%E2%80%93Leopard_Affair","text":"The Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair was a naval battle that took place off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia on June 22, 1807. The English warship attacked and boarded the American. The British were looking for people who had deserted the Royal Navy. The commander of the American ship surrendered his vessel to the British. When he returned home, he was tired, and had to leave the military.\nThe \"Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair\" made many Americans angry. Some of them wanted to go to war with Great Britain, but most people did not. President Thomas Jefferson tried to use the anger to diplomatically threaten the British government into settling the matter. The United States Congress backed away from armed conflict when British diplomats showed that they felt they did nothing wrong in the matter. The diplomats also said that impressment would continue. Jefferson's political failure to solve the problem with Great Britain led him towards economic warfare: the Embargo of 1807.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"naval","offset":36},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":73},{"uri":"Norfolk%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Norfolk, Virginia","offset":82},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":122},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warship","offset":130},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":163},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":177},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":230},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"tired","offset":346},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"military","offset":374},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":472},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":521},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":531},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomatically","offset":574},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":610},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":651},{"uri":"Impressment","surface_form":"impressment","offset":818},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":858},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economic","offset":932},{"uri":"Embargo_of_1807","surface_form":"Embargo of 1807","offset":954}]}
