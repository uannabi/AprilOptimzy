It is used to celebrate, remember, and honor the historical miracle of Hanukkah.\nIts shape is an upright stand with eight equal branches to hold a candle or oil with a wick. A ninth branch, at the center or to one side and usually taller, is the \"shamash\" (). The \"shamash\" is lit first, then used to light the others, while a prayer is recited. One of the branches is lit on the first night, two on the second, etc., which lasts eight nights.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":89},{"uri":"Miracle_of_Hanukkah","surface_form":"miracle of Hanukkah","offset":177}]}
