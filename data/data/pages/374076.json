{"id":374076,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola_lift","text":"A gondola lift is a type of public transport. It consists of cabins fixed to a cable that travels between two stations. The cable is moved around by motors at the stations and is lifted from the ground by towers. A gondola lift is similar to a cable car, and sometimes it is called like that. However, unlike a cable car a gondola lift contains many cabins that go around at the same time. Usually the cabins slow down at the stations to allow passengers to get in or out.\nGondola lifts are mainly used in skiing resorts to transport tourists up and down the mountains.\nList of incidents.\nThe National Ski Areas Association reports 0.138 deaths per 100 million miles transported compared to 1.23 for cars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"public transport","offset":28},{"uri":"Cable_car","surface_form":"cable car","offset":244},{"uri":"Skiing","surface_form":"skiing","offset":506}]}
