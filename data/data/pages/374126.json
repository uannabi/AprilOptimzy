On the Isle of Arran, for example, there are hundreds of igneous dykes giving rise to the term dyke swarm.\nAlternatively, sedimentary rocks can be laid down in vertical gaps between strata. Or, after underwater earthquakes, gaps caused by the earthquake can be filled in with breccia, that is, broken rocks.\nDykes are a common, almost universal, feature of the older Palaeozoic rocks.\nAnother type of intrusion is the sill, where later rock is formed between older layers, not through them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"bedding","offset":38},{"uri":"Igneous","surface_form":"igneous","offset":83},{"uri":"Intrusion_(geology)","surface_form":"intrusive","offset":151},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":176},{"uri":"Volcanic","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":248},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":273},{"uri":"Sedimentary","surface_form":"sedimentary","offset":327},{"uri":"Isle_of_Arran","surface_form":"Isle of Arran","offset":389},{"uri":"Earthquakes","surface_form":"earthquakes","offset":593},{"uri":"Breccia","surface_form":"breccia","offset":658},{"uri":"Palaeozoic","surface_form":"Palaeozoic","offset":749},{"uri":"Intrusion_(geology)","surface_form":"intrusion","offset":783},{"uri":"Sill_(geology)","surface_form":"sill","offset":800}]}
