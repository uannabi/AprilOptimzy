{"id":374178,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldol_reaction","text":"e=\"preserve\">The aldol reaction is a very important reaction in organic chemistry. It allows to form new carbon-carbon bonds. It was discovered in 1872.\nThe reagents are two carbonyl compounds together with a base. A proton is removed from one of them forming a negative charge on the \u03B1-carbon (the carbon just next to the C-O double bond). The negative charge can then attack the other carbonyl compound, forming the bond. The product is a \u03B2-hydroxy carbonyl compound, a molecule with a C-O double bond and an alcohol two carbon atoms down the chain. This reaction is very powerful because it can form a big molecule from two smaller ones.\nModern ways of doing the aldol reaction also allow to control the stereochemistry of the product. This is a very good way to create new chiral centres.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":52},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":64},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":105},{"uri":"Carbonyl","surface_form":"carbonyl","offset":174},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":209},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":511},{"uri":"Stereochemistry","surface_form":"stereochemistry","offset":707},{"uri":"Chirality","surface_form":"chiral centres","offset":777}]}
