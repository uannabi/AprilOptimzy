{"id":37430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)","text":"\"The Tragedy of Julius Caesar\" is a play by William Shakespeare. It is about the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC.\nShakespeare based his play on stories in Plutarch's \"Life of Brutus and Life of Caesar\". The play was probably written in 1599. It was first published in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays.\nThe play was probably one of Shakespeare's first plays to be performed at the Globe Theatre. The theatre had just been built. A Swiss traveller saw a tragedy about Julius Caesar at a London theatre on 21 September 1599. This was probably Shakespeare's play.\nThe play has been made into movies three times. In a 1950 movie, Charlton Heston played Mark Antony. In a 1953 movie, James Mason played Brutus and Marlon Brando played Antony. In a 1970 movie, Jason Robards played Brutus, Charlton Heston played Antony again, and John Gielgud played Caesar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["play"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":36},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":44},{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassination","offset":81},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":98},{"uri":"Plutarch","surface_form":"Plutarch","offset":163},{"uri":"Write","surface_form":"written","offset":233},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":263},{"uri":"First_Folio","surface_form":"First Folio","offset":288},{"uri":"Performance","surface_form":"performed","offset":406},{"uri":"Globe_Theatre","surface_form":"Globe Theatre","offset":423},{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":473},{"uri":"Tragedy","surface_form":"tragedy","offset":495},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":509},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":528},{"uri":"Charlton_Heston","surface_form":"Charlton Heston","offset":668},{"uri":"Mark_Antony","surface_form":"Mark Antony","offset":691},{"uri":"James_Mason","surface_form":"James Mason","offset":721},{"uri":"Marlon_Brando","surface_form":"Marlon Brando","offset":751},{"uri":"Jason_Robards","surface_form":"Jason Robards","offset":797},{"uri":"John_Gielgud","surface_form":"John Gielgud","offset":867}]}
