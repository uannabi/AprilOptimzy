{"id":37438,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Biya","text":"Paul Biya (born Paul Barth\u00E9lemy Biya'a bi Mvondo; 13 February 1933) is a Cameroonian politician. He is the President of Cameroon. He has been the country's president since 1982.\nBiya was born in the village of Mvomeka'a in Cameroon. At that time, the country was called French Cameroon. He studied in France, at the Sorbonne and the Institut d'\u00E9tudes politiques de Paris, both in Paris. He graduated in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in public law and a diploma in international relations.\nAfter graduating, Biya returned to Cameroon and worked in the government. In 1975, the President Ahmadou Ahidjo gave the job of Prime Minister to Biya. When President Ahidjo resigned on November 6, 1982, Biya became president of the country. Shortly afterwards, Ahidjo and Biya began feuding, and Ahidjo was forced to leave Cameroon.\nBiya was elected as the President of Cameroon in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997 and 2004, but other parties only have been allowed to enter the elections since 1992. The results many of these election results have been called fraudulent (achieved through unfair or illegal ways).\nMany international organizations, including Amnesty International, have criticized Biya's government for restricting the freedom of the people of Cameroon. These issues include control of the media (newspapers and radio and television stations) and violations of human rights. Biya's supporters point to the country's stability and high literacy rate.\nBiya is currently the longest-ruling non-royal leader in the world and the oldest ruler in Sub-Saharan Africa after Robert Mugabe stepped down during the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00E9tat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_Cameroon","surface_form":"President of Cameroon","offset":107},{"uri":"Mvomeka%27a","surface_form":"Mvomeka'a","offset":210},{"uri":"French_Cameroon","surface_form":"French Cameroon","offset":270},{"uri":"Sorbonne","surface_form":"Sorbonne","offset":316},{"uri":"Institut_d%27%C3%A9tudes_politiques_de_Paris","surface_form":"Institut d'\u00E9tudes politiques de Paris","offset":333},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":380},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor's degree","offset":415},{"uri":"Diploma","surface_form":"diploma","offset":453},{"uri":"President_of_Cameroon","surface_form":"President","offset":576},{"uri":"Ahmadou_Ahidjo","surface_form":"Ahmadou Ahidjo","offset":586},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Cameroon","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":617},{"uri":"November_6","surface_form":"November 6","offset":675},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":687},{"uri":"1984","surface_form":"1984","offset":872},{"uri":"1988","surface_form":"1988","offset":878},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":884},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":890},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":899},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"parties","offset":915},{"uri":"Fraud","surface_form":"fraud","offset":1041},{"uri":"Amnesty_International","surface_form":"Amnesty International","offset":1139},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":1287},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":1294},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":1309},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":1319},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":1358},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":1432},{"uri":"Lists_of_state_leaders_by_age","surface_form":"oldest ruler in Sub-Saharan Africa","offset":1522},{"uri":"Robert_Mugabe","surface_form":"Robert Mugabe","offset":1563},{"uri":"2017_Zimbabwean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":1601}]}
