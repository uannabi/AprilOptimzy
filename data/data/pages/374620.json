{"id":374620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_transistor","text":"A Darlington transistor, sometimes called \"Darlington pair\" is a transistor circuit that is made from two bipolar transistors. Sidney Darlington invented it at Bell Labs. It is like a transistor but it has much higher ability to gain current. The circuit can be made from two discrete transistors or it can be inside an integrated circuit. The hfe parameter with a Darlington transistor is each transistors hfe multiplied together.\nThe circuit is useful in audio amplifiers or in a probe that measures very small current that goes through water.\nIt is so sensitive that it can pick up the current in skin. If you connect it to a piece of metal, you can make a touch-sensitive button.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":65},{"uri":"Electrical_circuit","surface_form":"circuit","offset":76},{"uri":"Bell_Labs","surface_form":"Bell Labs","offset":160},{"uri":"Current_(electricity)","surface_form":"current","offset":234},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":320},{"uri":"Hfe","surface_form":"hfe","offset":344},{"uri":"Amplifier","surface_form":"amplifier","offset":463}]}
