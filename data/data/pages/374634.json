{"id":374634,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ignaz Semmelweis (born 1818 - died 1865) was a Hungarian doctor who discovered bacteria, disease and infection. He is the father of infection control. Semmelweis observed that if the doctors washed their hands, the number of infections of puerperal fever could be reduced. For this reason, Semmelweis ordered his medical students to wash their hands before and after medical rounds. He was mocked by fellow doctors, but he could not prove his findings, because bacteria had not been discovered yet. In 1870, Robert Koch proved that bacteria can cause disease. People such as Louis Pasteur proved what is known as the germ theory of disease only after Semmelweis' death.\nSemmelweis probably had Alzheimer\u2019s disease and he was sent to an asylum for being insane. He died after 14 days in the asylum possibly being beaten by the staff and inmates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":92},{"uri":"Hand_washing","surface_form":"washed their hands","offset":204},{"uri":"Puerperal_fever","surface_form":"puerperal fever","offset":252},{"uri":"Robert_Koch","surface_form":"Robert Koch","offset":521},{"uri":"Louis_Pasteur","surface_form":"Louis Pasteur","offset":588},{"uri":"Germ_theory_of_disease","surface_form":"germ theory of disease","offset":630},{"uri":"Alzheimer%E2%80%99s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease","offset":707}]}
