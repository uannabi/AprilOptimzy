{"id":374730,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_from_fear","text":"Freedom from fear is a fundamental human right. This right was mentioned by American President Franklin D. Roosevelt as one of the \"Four Freedoms\" human beings everywhere in the world should have. Roosevelt presented the \"Four Freedoms\" at his State of the Union of January 6, 1941, which therefore has been called the \"Four Freedoms Speech\" as well.\nThis right, as well as the other three of the \"Four Freedoms\" of Roosevelt, makes part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was accepted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 10, 1948. \"Freedom from fear\" is written down in the introduction tot the UN Declaration.\nIn 1943 Norman Rockwell painted his work \"Freedom from Fear \" which is one of four paintings he made on Roosevelts \"Four Freedoms\".\nAung San Suu Kyi has named this right many times in speeches and wrote a book with the title \"Freedom From Fear\" on it in 1991. Historian David M. Kennedy was inspired by the right as well and in 1991 he brought out his book with the title \"Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929\u20131945\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_right","surface_form":"human right","offset":35},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":76},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
