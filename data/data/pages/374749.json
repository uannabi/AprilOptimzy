Despite its scientific name \"Nimravides\" does not belong to the Nimravidae, but belongs to the family Felidae.\nThe earlier species of the genus are smaller and more primitive than the later forms. The tiger-sized \"Nimravides catacopsis\" resembles the primitive \"Machairodus aphanistus\", a species known from the late Miocene of Eurasia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saber-toothed_cat","surface_form":"saber-toothed cat","offset":31},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":105},{"uri":"Nimravidae","surface_form":"Nimravidae","offset":178},{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"Felidae","offset":216},{"uri":"Machairodus","surface_form":"Machairodus","offset":376}]}
