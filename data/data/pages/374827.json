Bush (Republican) and Governor of Massachusetts Michael Dukakis (Democratic). Bush capitalized on a good economy, a stable international stage, and on President Ronald Reagan's popularity, running an aggressive campaign. Meanwhile, Dukakis's campaign suffered from several miscues, including failure to defend from Bush's attacks. This allowed Bush to win with a substantial margin of the popular vote; while winning the Electoral College by a landslide. Since the 1988 election, no candidate has managed to equal or surpass Bush's number of electoral votes won or popular vote percentage.\nVice President George H.W. Bush won the election by 426 electoral votes. Governor of Massachusetts Michael Dukakis got 111 electoral votes. Lloyd Bentsen got 1 electoral vote by a West Virginia faithless elector.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President","offset":26},{"uri":"George_H._W._Bush","surface_form":"George H.
