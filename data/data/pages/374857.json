{"id":374857,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Speech_(Norman_Rockwell)","text":"\"Freedom of Speech\" is a painting of Norman Rockwell and is one of his series of four paintings called the \"Four Freedoms\". Rockwell was inspired to make these paintings since he heard the \"Four Freedoms Speech\" of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt of January 6, 1941.\nBackground.\nThis painting was made public in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" of February 20, 1943, along with an essay of Booth Tarkington. The other paintings of the \"Four Freedoms\" series are \"Freedom of Worship\", \"Freedom from Want\" and \"Freedom from Fear\", and were shown in other editions of the paper.\nIn this painting he shows a local meeting where one person speaks out his own, opposite opinion, while the others present give him the freedom of speech as a matter of protocol. Rockwell undertook four efforts to end up with this painting. He took Vermont neighbors as models for his series.\nRockwell needed four attempts to end up with this version of the painting. In former versions he found that the attention was confused because he had used to many objects. Furthermore he did not like the place of the main person in the picture.\nThe paintings toured through the United States with the motto \"Buy War Bonds\". All together 1.2 million Americans saw the paintings and 132 million dollar was collected to be used in World War II.\nThe painting can be found in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["artwork"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norman_Rockwell","surface_form":"Norman Rockwell","offset":37},{"uri":"Four_Freedoms","surface_form":"Four Freedoms Speech","offset":190},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":215},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
