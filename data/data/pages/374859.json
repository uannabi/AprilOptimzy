The other paintings of the \"Four Freedoms\" series are \"Freedom of Speech\", \"Freedom from Want\" and \"Freedom from Fear\", and were shown in other editions of the paper.it is a very good pintor(norman Rockwell)\nRockwell needed various attempts to end up with this version of the painting. Former versions showed a number of customers in a barbershop, all with another religious and racial background. He found it to be difficult to make clear images that showed how a person of a certain religion looks like. He finally chose a neutral location where people of different race worship in their own religion. He took Vermont neighbors as models for his series.\nThe paintings toured through the United States with the motto \"Buy War Bonds\". All together 1.2 million Americans saw the paintings and 132 million dollar was collected to be used in World War II.\nThe painting can be found in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["artwork"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norman_Rockwell","surface_form":"Norman Rockwell","offset":38},{"uri":"Four_Freedoms","surface_form":"Four Freedoms Speech","offset":191},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":216},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
