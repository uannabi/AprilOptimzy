{"id":374862,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_from_Fear_(painting)","text":"\"Freedom from Fear\" is a painting of Norman Rockwell and is one of his series of four paintings called the \"Four Freedoms\". Rockwell was inspired to make these paintings since he heard the \"Four Freedoms Speech\" of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt of January 6, 1941.\nBackground.\nThis painting was made public in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" of March 13, 1943, along with an essay of Stephen Vincent Ben\u00E9t. The other paintings of the \"Four Freedoms\" series are \"Freedom of Speech\", \"Freedom of Worship\" and \"Freedom from Want\", and were shown in other editions of the paper.\nThe painting portrays children laying in bed, a mother tucking them in and a father watching with a newspaper in his hand, telling the stories of the war with the headlines \"Bombings Kill... Horrors Hit...\". The children are free from fearing these horrors of the war. He took Vermont neighbors as models for his series.\nThis painting is the only one in the \"Four Freedoms\" series he had not specially painted for this subject. He first made it to illustrate the Battle of Britain of 1940. He did not want it to be published though, because he distasted the idea that American children were resting safely in their beds as Europe burned.\nThe paintings toured through the United States with the motto \"Buy War Bonds\". All together 1.2 million Americans saw the paintings and 132 million dollar was collected to be used in World War II.\nThe painting can be found in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["artwork"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norman_Rockwell","surface_form":"Norman Rockwell","offset":37},{"uri":"Four_Freedoms","surface_form":"Four Freedoms Speech","offset":190},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":215},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
