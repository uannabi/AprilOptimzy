He was trying to destroy an enemy artillery gun. Muranaga was able to fire three shells before being killed.\nPrivate First Class Kiyoshi K. Muranaga distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 26 June 1944, near Suvereto, Italy. Private First Class Muranaga's company encountered a strong enemy force in commanding positions and with superior firepower. An enemy 88mm self-propelled gun opened direct fire on the company, causing the men to disperse and seek cover. Private First Class Muranaga's mortar squad was ordered to action, but the terrain made it impossible to set up their weapons. The squad leader, realizing the vulnerability of the mortar position, moved his men away from the gun to positions of relative safety. Because of the heavy casualties being inflicted on his company, Private First Class Muranaga, who was a gunner, attempted to neutralize the 88mm weapon alone. Voluntarily remaining at his gun position, Private First Class Muranaga manned the mortar himself and opened fire on the enemy gun at a range of approximately 400 yards. With his third round, he was able to correct his fire so that the shell landed directly in front of the enemy gun. Meanwhile, the enemy crew, immediately aware of the source of mortar fire, turned their 88mm weapon directly on Private First Class Muranaga's position. Before Private First Class Muranaga could fire a fourth round, an 88mm shell scored a direct hit on his position, killing him instantly. Because of the accuracy of Private First Class Muranaga's previous fire, the enemy soldiers decided not to risk further exposure and immediately abandoned their position. Private First Class Muranaga's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":60},{"uri":"Medal_of_Honor","surface_form":"Medal of Honor","offset":104},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":145},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":192},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":206},{"uri":"Nisei","surface_form":"Nisei","offset":243},{"uri":"Granada_War_Relocation_Center","surface_form":"Granada War Relocation Center","offset":352},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"US Army","offset":424},{"uri":"Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_States)","surface_form":"Distinguished Service Cross","offset":776},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":998},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":1081},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":1254},{"uri":"Mortar_(weapon)","surface_form":"mortar","offset":1276},{"uri":"Recognize","surface_form":"recognized","offset":1335},{"uri":"Frontline","surface_form":"frontline","offset":1361},{"uri":"Mortar_(weapon)","surface_form":"mortar","offset":1471},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":1520},{"uri":"88_mm_gun","surface_form":"88mm","offset":1865},{"uri":"Self-propelled_gun","surface_form":"self-propelled gun","offset":1870}]}
