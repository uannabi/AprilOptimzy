{"id":37490,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States","text":"The United States Constitution is the highest law of the United States of America. It was signed on September 17, 1787 by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Later, it was put into effect, or ratified, by representatives of the people of the first 13 states. When nine of the states ratified the document, they created a union of sovereign states, and a federal government for that union. That government started on March 4, 1789, which took the place of the Articles of Confederation.\nThe Constitution of the United States is the oldest federal constitution now in use.\nSince 1787, changes have been made to the United States Constitution 27 times by amendments (changes). The first ten of these amendments are together called the Bill of Rights.\nArticles of the Constitution.\nWhen it was signed in 1787, the Constitution had a preamble and seven main parts, called articles.\nPreamble.\nThe Preamble is not a law. It gives the reasons for writing the Constitution. The Preamble is one of the best-known parts of the Constitution. The first three words, \"We the people,\" are used very often. The six intentions that are listed are the goals of the Constitution.\nLegislative power.\nArticle One says that the United States Congress (the legislative branch) will make the laws for the United States. Congress has two parts, called \"Houses\": the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. This Article says who can be elected to each part of Congress, and how they are elected.\nThe House of Representatives has members elected by the people in each State. The number of members from each State depends on how many people live there. Each member of the House of Representatives is elected for two years.\nThe Senate has two members, called the legislators, from each country, no matter how many people live there. Each Senator is elected for six years. The original Constitution allowed the state legislatures to choose the Senators, but this was changed later by the Seventeenth Amendment.\nArticle One also says how the Congress will do its business and what kinds of laws it can make. It lists some kinds of laws the Congress and the states cannot make.\nArticle One also makes rules for Congress to impeach and remove from office the President, Vice President, judges, and other government officers.\nExecutive power.\nArticle Two says that the President, Vice President, and executive offices (the executive branch) will carry out the laws made by Congress. This article says how the President and Vice President are elected, and who can be elected to these offices. The President and Vice President are elected for four years by a special Electoral College chosen by the states. The Vice President takes over as President if the President dies, resigns, or is unable to serve.\nArticle Two also says that the President is the Commander-in-Chief in charge of the United States military. He can make treaties with other countries, but these must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. He appoints judges, ambassadors, and other officers, but the Senate also must approve these appointments. The President can also veto bills. However, Congress can override the veto and make the bill into a law anyway.\nJudicial power.\nArticle Three says there will be a court system (the judicial branch), which includes the Supreme Court. The Article says that Congress can decide which federal courts, besides the Supreme Court, are needed.\nArticle Three says what kinds of \"cases and controversies\" these courts can decide. It also requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, and defines the crime of treason.\nStates' powers and limits.\nArticle Four is about the states. It says that all states must give \"full faith and credit\" to the laws of the other states. It also says that state governments must treat citizens of other states as fairly as they treat their own citizens, and must send arrested people back if they have been charged with a crime in another state and fled.\nArticle Four also says that Congress can make new states. There were only 13 states in 1787. Now there are 50 United States. It says Congress can make rules for Federal property and can govern territories that have not yet been made into states. Article Four says the United States must make sure that each state has a republican form of government, and protect the states from invasion and violence.\nProcess of amendment.\nArticle Five gives two ways to amend, or change, the Constitution.\nAny change that is written by Congress or by a convention must be sent to the state legislatures or to state conventions for their approval. Congress decides whether to send a change to the legislatures or to conventions. Three-fourths of the states must approve a change for it to become part of the Constitution.\nAn amendment can change any part of the Constitution, except one\u2014no amendment can change the rule that each state has an equal number of Senators in the United States Senate.\nFederal power.\nArticle Six says that the Constitution, and the laws and treaties of the United States, are higher than any other laws. It also says that all federal and state officers must swear to \"support\" the Constitution.\nRatification.\nArticle Seven says that the new government under the Constitution would not start until conventions in at least nine states approved the Constitution.\nAmendments.\nSince 1787, Congress has written 33 amendments to change the Constitution, but the states have ratified only 27 of them.\nAfter the Bill of Rights, there are 17 more changes to the Constitution that were made at different times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":46},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of
