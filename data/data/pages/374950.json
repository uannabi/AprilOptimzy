In 2010, the band released its next album \"Nobody's Daughter\" but the album was not successful. After touring around the world, the band broke up in 2012 because Love wanted to work on her solo career.\nIn 2014 Coutney Love, Eric Erlandson, Melissa Auf Der Maur, and Patty Schemel started playing together again.\nCreation.\nHole began in summer 1989 in Los Angeles, California. Courtney Love put an advertisement in a magazine called \"The Recycler\" and said she wanted to start a band. In the ad, she said her favorite bands were Big Black, Sonic Youth and Fleetwood Mac. Eric Erlandson phoned Love when he saw the advertisement and the band began rehearsing in August. Love became the singer and second guitarist and Erlandson became the lead guitarist. Love and Erlandson got Love's friend Lisa Roberts to become the bassist for Hole and found a drummer called Caroline Rue at another punk rock show. The band had two other guitar players, Mike Geisbrecht and Errol Stewart, but both of them left the band soon after. The band played their first show in September at Raji's, a small club in Hollywood, and played three more shows in California in 1989.\nEarly releases.\nAfter a lot of shows on the West Coast, Hole signed to the indie record label Sympathy for the Record Industry in 1990.

During a tour in March 1991, the band released a second single, \"Dicknail\", on Sub Pop, the grunge label in Seattle, Washington and then released their first album \"Pretty on the Inside\" in August.

Hole then signed a major label recording contract with DGC and Geffen Records. The record deal was worth over $3 million.\nIn 1993, Hole released a new single \"Beautiful Son.\" Patty Schemel was the new drummer for the band and played on all of the songs. Before the band went on tour, they got Kristen Pfaff as a new bassist. The band then took a small break in July to work on new songs for their next album.\nMainstream success.\nIn 1993, Hole moved to Carnation, Washington to write songs for their next album.

The album was called \"Live Through This\" and was released on April 12, 1994. Four days before it was released, Courtney Love's husband was found dead in Seattle.

Love began acting again and got a lead role in \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" and the other members worked with other musicians. In 1998, Hole released \"Celebrity Skin\".

Hole tried to record a fourth album but broke up in May 2002. Talking about the break-up, Love said \"Eric has been an important part of my family for over ten years and he'll continue to be a part of my life\" and Erlandson said \"we're incredibly proud of the music we've made together, but it seems like time for both of us to move on.\"\nReformation.\nMusic magazine \"NME\" announced in June 2009 that Courtney Love was reforming Hole with new members. Love said that Melissa Auf der Maur would come back as a bassist and Micko Larkin was the band's new guitarist. A small tour of Europe was planned with shows in London, Milan and Amsterdam but Auf der Maur said that she was not involved in the reunion.

Love and Erlandson tried to settle the dispute but did not come to an agreement.\nEven though there were legal problems, Hole released \"Nobody's Daughter\" in April 2010. The album included two new members, bassist Shawn Dailey and drummer Stu Fisher, and had three singles singles\u2014\"Skinny Little Bitch\", \"Pacific Coast Highway\" and \"Letter to God.\" Music critics did not give the album good reviews and it did not sell well.

The band performed two songs\u2014\"Miss World\" and \"Over the Edge\"\u2014and was the first time the four members were together live since 1995.\nIn a Twitter post for her clothing line, Never the Bride, on November 29, 2010, Courtney Love announced that Hole had broken up. She said \"from now on [the band is called Courtney]\" and \"Hole is dead.\" During an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Love said she was continuing as a solo artist and was releasing a new single, \"This is War\", in February 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":12},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":21},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":26},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":60},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":73},{"uri":"Sing","surface_form":"singer","offset":212},{"uri":"Courtney_Love","surface_form":"Courtney Love","offset":219},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":234},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bassist","offset":258},{"uri":"Drums","surface_form":"drummer","offset":283},{"uri":"Pretty_on_the_Inside","surface_form":"Pretty on the Inside","offset":363},{"uri":"Live_Through_This","surface_form":"Live Through This","offset":657},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":733},{"uri":"Music_chart","surface_form":"music chart","offset":744},{"uri":"Celebrity_Skin","surface_form":"Celebrity Skin","offset":880},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1569},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1582},{"uri":"Big_Black","surface_form":"Big Black","offset":1746},{"uri":"Sonic_Youth","surface_form":"Sonic Youth","offset":1757},{"uri":"Fleetwood_Mac","surface_form":"Fleetwood Mac","offset":1773},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":2103},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":2309},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_1","surface_form":"BBC Radio 1","offset":2701},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":2716},{"uri":"Sub_Pop","surface_form":"Sub Pop","offset":2803},{"uri":"Grunge","surface_form":"grunge","offset":2816},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":2832},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":2841},{"uri":"UK_Albums_Chart","surface_form":"UK Albums Chart","offset":3179},{"uri":"Kurt_Cobain","surface_form":"Kurt Cobain","offset":3388},{"uri":"Nirvana","surface_form":"Nirvana","offset":3403},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":3456},{"uri":"Geffen_Records","surface_form":"Geffen Records","offset":3654},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":4141},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":4817},{"uri":"Music_chart","surface_form":"music chart","offset":4828},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":5156},{"uri":"The_Smashing_Pumpkins","surface_form":"The Smashing Pumpkins","offset":6651},{"uri":"M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe","surface_form":"M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe","offset":6725},{"uri":"NME","surface_form":"NME","offset":7348},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":7601},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":7611},{"uri":"Museum_of_Modern_Art","surface_form":"Museum of Modern Art","offset":8642},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":8666},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":9046},{"uri":"Rolling_Stone","surface_form":"Rolling Stone","offset":9269}]}
