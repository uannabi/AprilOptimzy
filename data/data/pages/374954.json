They are two grumpy old men who fight and laugh at mean things on their balcony. They both appeared in all \"The Muppet Show\" episodes except for one in which Statler did not appeared because he was sick, so Waldorf appaered with his wife who looks like Statler in a dress. Statler and Walldorf are named after two important hotels in New York City. They are mostly known for appearing as Marley and Marley in \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\".\nStatler is an old man who wears a black and blue suit. Waldorf has a mustache and wears a brown suit.
