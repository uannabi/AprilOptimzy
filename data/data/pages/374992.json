Governor of Alabama George Wallace also ran by the American Independent Party.\nHumphrey did not win the south because he was very liberal and favoured civil rights. The only southern state he won was Texas (which he won narrowly).\nRichard Nixon won the election by 301 electoral votes. Hubert Humphrey got 191 electoral votes. George Wallace received 46 electoral votes and a faithless elector in North Carolina voted Wallace and running mate Curtis LeMay.\nIncumbent United States President Lyndon B. Johnson was able to run, but decided against it. On March 31, 1968, Johnson withdrewed his nomination and Johnson said, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President\".\nIncumbent Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of former United States President John F. Kennedy was a serious presidential candidate before his assassination on June 5, 1968 by Sirhan Sirhan in Los Angeles after winning the California and South Dakota primaries for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President","offset":33},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":48},{"uri":"Hubert_Humphrey","surface_form":"Hubert Humphrey","offset":81},{"uri":"Governor_of_Alabama","surface_form":"Governor of Alabama","offset":98},{"uri":"George_Wallace","surface_form":"George Wallace","offset":118},{"uri":"American_Independent_Party","surface_form":"American Independent Party","offset":149},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":495},{"uri":"Incumbent","surface_form":"Incumbent","offset":555},{"uri":"Lyndon_B._Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon B.
