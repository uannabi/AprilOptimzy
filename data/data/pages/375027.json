{"id":375027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dynamic programming is a method of solving problems, which is used in computer science, mathematics and economics. Using this method, a complex problem is split into simpler problems, which are then solved. At the end, the solutions of the simpler problems are used to find the solution of the original complex problem.\nDynamic programming can be used in cases where it is possible to split a problem into smaller problems, which are all quite similar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":83},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":101},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":117}]}
