It has about 145 postgraduate students (students that already have a degree). It allows both men and women but no undergraduate students. It is one of the smallest colleges but has 125 Fellows (teachers), making the ratio fellows/students very high.\nThe college was built by Clare College to make it easier for people who are not students anymore to come back to university and do further education. This is why the college has many facilities for families and for sports.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":41},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":66},{"uri":"Postgraduate","surface_form":"postgraduate","offset":114},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Fellow","offset":282},{"uri":"Clare_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Clare College","offset":372}]}
