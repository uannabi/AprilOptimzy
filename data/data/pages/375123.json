{"id":375123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r","text":"=\"preserve\">H\u00F6\u00F0r (also written Hodhr, Hothr, Hothur, Hoder, Hodur, Hodor, Hodr) is the blind twin brother of Baldr and son of Odin and Frigg in Norse mythology.\nHe is shown as having his eyes closed or covering them completely. H\u00F6\u00F0r is associated as the god of winter and the cold as well as being the god of darkness, unlike his brother Baldr, who is god of light. The only source of information of him thus far is when he is seen as being manipulated and tricked by Loki, and therefore accidentally killing his brother Baldr by throwing a shaft of mistletoe and piercing him in the heart. H\u00F6\u00F0r's sworn enemy is V\u00E1li, who is born to avenge his brother's death by killing H\u00F6\u00F0r. It was said that after Ragnar\u00F6k, H\u00F6\u00F0r and Baldr shall survive to rule alongside each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blind","offset":87},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":109},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":126},{"uri":"Frigg","surface_form":"Frigg","offset":135},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":144},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":261},{"uri":"Loki","surface_form":"Loki","offset":468},{"uri":"Mistletoe","surface_form":"mistletoe","offset":550},{"uri":"V%C3%A1li_(son_of_Odin)","surface_form":"V\u00E1li","offset":613},{"uri":"Ragnar%C3%B6k","surface_form":"Ragnar\u00F6k","offset":701}]}
