{"id":375148,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock_Tower","text":"The John Hancock Tower, also called Hancock Place, The Hancock Tower, or The Hancock, is a 60-story, 790-foot (241 m) skyscraper in Boston. It was named for the John Hancock Insurance company. The tower was designed by Henry N. Cobb and was completed in 1976. It has been the tallest building in Boston for more than 30 years. It is also the tallest building in New England.\nIts street address is 200 Clarendon Street. At first, John Hancock Insurance primarily used the building, but after 2004, some offices moved to a new building.\nArchitecture.\nThe John Hancock Tower was designed in 1972. It is a glass monolith. It was made in the minimalist and the modernist skyscraper design.\nThe largest panes of glass possible were used. There are no spandrel panels, and very few mullions. The floor plan has a parallelogram shape. The window glass is tinted slightly blue.\nHistory.\nThe tower has an observation deck that was a famous attraction. However, the observation deck was closed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\nIn 2006, Broadway Partners bought Hancock Place for $1.3 billion. By 2009, they had defaulted on the loans they used to buy the building, and it was forclosed. On March 30, 2009, Hancock Place was sold at auction for $660 million to a consortium of \"Normandy Real Estate Partners\" and \"Five Mile Capital Partners\". In October 2010, Boston Properties bought the John Hancock Tower for $930 million.\nThe Hancock Tower was built by \"John Hancock Insurance\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["building"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":118},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":132},{"uri":"John_Hancock_Insurance","surface_form":"John Hancock Insurance","offset":161},{"uri":"Henry_N._Cobb","surface_form":"Henry N.
