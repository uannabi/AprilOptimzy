{"id":375315,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_force","text":"There are four fundamental forces, sometimes called fundamental interactions. The forces are called \"fundamental\" because there is no simpler way for physicists to understand what the forces do or how they do it (their action). They are called interactions because the action of one object on another is matched by a reaction from the other.\nWe feel the effects of gravity and electromagnetism all the time.\nThe strong and weak interactions are forces at the smallest distances and explain nuclear interactions.\nA complete description of the forces requires advanced physics. The Standard Model explains\nthree of these forces (electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force). Most physicists think that these become a single force under very high temperatures. This idea is known as the grand unification theory.\nFrom the future to the past.\nIn the future, new forces may explain dark energy and dark matter. We may also get a Theory of everything that explains the four known fundamental forces. Even if we first \"unify\" the three forces of the Standard Model, we may continue to think of those forces as fundamental.
