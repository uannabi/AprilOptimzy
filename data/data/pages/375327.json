{"id":375327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakeboarding","text":"e=\"preserve\">Wakeboarding is a water sport that involves riding a wakeboard over the surface of a body of water. The rider is usually towed behind a motorboat. This sport, that appeared in the beginning of the eighties, has been inspired by surfing, water skiing and snowboarding.\nTo practice wakeboarding, a boat, a rope and a board are necessary. If the rider wants to do bigger jumps or tricks, he needs a tower. The waves created by the boat act like a ski jump for the surfer.\nTimeline.\nIn 1985, Tonny Finn, a surfer, marketed the \"Skurfer\". It was a board inspired by surfing and water skiing. The \"Skurfer\" was thick and it had an aileron at his back.\nIn 1987, the \"Skurfer\" board was introduced in France by Maurice Lejeune.\nIn 1989, Jimmy Redmond founded the World Wakeboard Association (WWA).\nIn 1990, the first official competition was taking place in Orlando, Florida, United States, while the first wakeboard was marketing.\nIn 1993, the first world wakeboard championship was organised in United States by the WWA.\nIn 1994, the riders Gilles Becker, Franck Rop\u00E9ro and Pierre Bergia established the ANW (Association Nationale de Wakeboard).\nIn 1995, it was the apparition of the \"twin tips\". The principle of this board has still used today. The \"twin tips\" has one or more ailerons in its back and its front.\nIn 2001, wakeboarding became a discipline in the Akita\u2019s World Games of Japan.\nIn 2004, the first magazine dedicated to the wakeboard, \"Unleashed Wakeboard Magazine\", was published in France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Water_sport","surface_form":"water sport","offset":31},{"uri":"Motorboat","surface_form":"motorboat","offset":149},{"uri":"Surfing","surface_form":"surfing","offset":241},{"uri":"Water_skiing","surface_form":"water skiing","offset":250},{"uri":"Snowboarding","surface_form":"snowboarding","offset":267},{"uri":"Surfing","surface_form":"surfing","offset":574},{"uri":"Aileron","surface_form":"aileron","offset":638},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":706},{"uri":"World_Wakeboard_Association","surface_form":"World Wakeboard Association","offset":768},{"uri":"Orlando%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Orlando, Florida","offset":863},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":881},{"uri":"Championship","surface_form":"championship","offset":972}]}
