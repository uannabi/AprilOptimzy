{"id":375337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova","text":"Bossa nova is a type of Brazilian music. Bossa nova means literally \"new trend\". Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jo\u00E3o Gilberto developed bossa nova as a genre. The first bossa nova single to achieve international popularity was \"The Girl From Ipanema\".\nThe bossa nova musical style evolved from samba but is more complex harmonically and less percussive. Joachim Ernst Berendt, the writer of a jazz book, said that bossa nova is a combination of samba and cool jazz. The influence on bossa nova of jazz styles is often debated, but a similar \"cool sensibility\" is apparent.\nBossa nova is usually performed on classical guitar and piano. It often performed with percussion and strings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":24},{"uri":"Antonio_Carlos_Jobim","surface_form":"Antonio Carlos Jobim","offset":81},{"uri":"Jo%C3%A3o_Gilberto","surface_form":"Jo\u00E3o Gilberto","offset":106},{"uri":"Samba","surface_form":"samba","offset":288},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":387},{"uri":"Classical_guitar","surface_form":"classical guitar","offset":602},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":623}]}
