{"id":375385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy","text":"There are two basic kinds of taxes: those on revenue, and those on economic activity, usually called excise taxes. Lowering the excise taxation will lead to increased economic activity, for example. Changes in welfare also have an impact on economic activity.\nIn general, fiscal policy is cyclic: Effects which result from changes in fiscal policy need some time until they can be observed.\nCertain schools of thought think that fiscal policy should not be used to influence the economy. This is the case for Monetarism, which demands that keeping money at its value is the most important goal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Excise_tax","surface_form":"excise tax","offset":101},{"uri":"Welfare","surface_form":"welfare","offset":210},{"uri":"Monetarism","surface_form":"Monetarism","offset":509},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":548}]}
