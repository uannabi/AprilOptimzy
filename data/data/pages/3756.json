{"id":3756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million","text":"One million (1,000,000), or one thousand thousand, is the natural number after 999,999 and before 1,000,001. The name is derived from Italian, where was 1,000, and 1,000,000 became a \"milione\", as 'a large thousand'.\nIn scientific notation, the number is written as 1\u00D7106 or just 106. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix when dealing with SI units. For example, 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts.\nThe word 'million' is common to both the short-scale and long-scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems.\nThe million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number, as in 'Never in a million years' and 'You're one in a million', or as hyperbole, as in 'I've walked a million miles'.\n\"Il Milione\" is the title of Marco Polo's narration of his travels in China. The name is supposed to come from Polo's nickname after his tales of riches and multitudes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thousand","surface_form":"thousand","offset":32},{"uri":"Scientific_notation","surface_form":"scientific notation","offset":220},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":337},{"uri":"Long_and_short_scales","surface_form":"short-scale and long-scale","offset":464},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":643},{"uri":"Hyperbole","surface_form":"hyperbole","offset":747},{"uri":"Marco_Polo","surface_form":"Marco Polo","offset":824},{"uri":"Tales","surface_form":"tales","offset":932}]}
