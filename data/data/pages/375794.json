{"id":375794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election","text":"This election was between former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford.\nJimmy Carter won the election by 297 electoral votes, compared to incumbent president Gerald Ford, who received 240 electoral votes. A faithless elector from Washington voted for Ronald Reagan, who would win the 1980 election.\nThis election followed the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. It is the last election to have a Democratic candidate to receive a preferable vote in American South. The American South is typically known to be Republican, however Florida is considered a swing state.\nThis is the last election where one of the two major candidates is still alive. Jimmy Carter is currently 95 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Governor_of_Georgia","surface_form":"Governor of Georgia","offset":33},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":53},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":70},{"uri":"Gerald_Ford","surface_form":"Gerald Ford","offset":80},{"uri":"Incumbent","surface_form":"incumbent","offset":159},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":251},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":272},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_1980","surface_form":"1980 election","offset":305},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":372},{"uri":"Watergate_scandal","surface_form":"Watergate scandal","offset":405},{"uri":"American_South","surface_form":"American South","offset":511},{"uri":"Swing_vote","surface_form":"swing state","offset":615}]}
