{"id":37580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","text":"=\"preserve\">The Kingdom of England (French: Royaume d'Angleterre) was a country in Western Europe. It was the land in the south of the island of Great Britain. It is now two home nations. The present home nations that were part of the Kingdom of England are England and Wales.\nBefore the Romans arrived, what is now considered to be modern Britain consisted of around twenty two tribes. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire in Britain, seven tribes or kingdoms existed until in 827, Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at Dore, briefly making Egbert the first king to reign over a united England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":36},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":72},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":83},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":145},{"uri":"Home_nation","surface_form":"home nation","offset":174},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":258},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":270}]}
