{"id":375803,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada","text":"The Green Party of Canada is a federal political party based in Canada. The party holds 3 of 338 seats in the Canadian Parliament.\nAlthough the party has had both leftist and centrist factions throughout their history, many of the members think that the left wing-right wing political spectrum doesn't capture the ecological orientation of an evolving Green Party.\nThe leader of the party is Elizabeth May. She was voted as leader when she defeated David Chernushenko and Jim Fannon in the leadership race with 65% of the vote on the first ballot.\nOn 2 May 2011, May was voted in the 2011 Canadian federal election. This made her the first member of the Green Party in history to sit in the House of Commons. On 6 May 2019, Paul Manly was voted in a by-election in the riding of Nanaimo\u2014Ladysmith. He became the second member of the Green Party in history to sit in the House of Commons. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Jenica Atwin was voted in. She became their first member outside of British Columbia to sit in the House of Commons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Federalism","surface_form":"federal","offset":31},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":39},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":64},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_Canada","surface_form":"Canadian Parliament","offset":110},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"leftist","offset":163},{"uri":"Centrism","surface_form":"centrist","offset":175},{"uri":"Elizabeth_May","surface_form":"Elizabeth May","offset":392},{"uri":"Leadership_convention","surface_form":"leadership race","offset":490},{"uri":"2011_Canadian_federal_election","surface_form":"2011 Canadian federal election","offset":584},{"uri":"Paul_Manly","surface_form":"Paul Manly","offset":724},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":750},{"uri":"Electoral_district_(Canada)","surface_form":"riding","offset":769},{"uri":"Nanaimo%E2%80%94Ladysmith","surface_form":"Nanaimo\u2014Ladysmith","offset":779},{"uri":"2019_Canadian_federal_election","surface_form":"2019 Canadian federal election","offset":895},{"uri":"Jenica_Atwin","surface_form":"Jenica Atwin","offset":927}]}
