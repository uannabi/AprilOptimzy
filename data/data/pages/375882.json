He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in World War II.\nEarly life.\nOhata was born in Hawaii to Japanese immigrant parents. He was a \"Nisei\", which means that he was a second generation Japanese-American.\nSoldier.\nOne month before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Ohata joined the US Army in November 1941.\nOhata volunteered to be part of the all-\"Nisei\" 100th Infantry Battalion. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.\nFor his actions in November 1943, Ohata was awarded the Army's second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). In the 1990s, there was a review of service records of Asian Americans who received the DSC during World War II. Ohata's award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In a ceremony at the White House on June 21, 2000, his family was presented with his medal by President Bill Clinton. Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the medal during the ceremony, but only seven of them were still alive. According to the story he shared with his brother, \"[H]e held a hill by himself and a lot of people died except him. He said the enemy came from both sides, and [at] one point he came from one side and the enemy soldier came from the other end. The only reason he lived was because he saw the guy first.\"\nMedal of Honor citation.\nOhata's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in frontline fighting in central Italy in 1944. With the help of one rifleman, he held back an attack by a large force of enemy soldiers.\nSergeant Allan M. Ohata distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 29 and November 30, 1943, near Cerasuolo, Italy. Sergeant Ohata, his squad leader, and three men were ordered to protect his platoons left flank against an attacking enemy force of 40 men, armed with machine guns, machine pistols, and rifles. He posted one of his men, an automatic rifleman, on the extreme left, 15 yards from his own position. Taking his position, Sergeant Ohata delivered effective fire against the advancing enemy. The man to his left called for assistance when his automatic rifle was shot and damaged. With utter disregard for his personal safety, Sergeant Ohata left his position and advanced 15 yards through heavy machine gun fire. Reaching his comrades position, he immediately fired upon the enemy, killing 10 enemy soldiers and successfully covering his comrades withdrawal to replace his damaged weapon. Sergeant Ohata and the automatic rifleman held their position and killed 37 enemy soldiers. Both men then charged the three remaining soldiers and captured them. Later, Sergeant Ohata and the automatic rifleman stopped another attacking force of 14, killing four and wounding three while the others fled. The following day he and the automatic rifleman held their flank with grim determination and staved off all attacks. Staff Sergeant Ohatas extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":65},{"uri":"Medal_of_Honor","surface_form":"Medal of Honor","offset":109},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":150},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":194},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":204},{"uri":"Nisei","surface_form":"Nisei","offset":242},{"uri":"Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","surface_form":"attack on Pearl Harbor","offset":352},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"US Army","offset":393},{"uri":"Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_States)","surface_form":"Distinguished Service Cross","offset":673},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":892},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":975},{"uri":"Recognize","surface_form":"recognized","offset":1461},{"uri":"Frontline","surface_form":"frontline","offset":1487}]}
