{"id":375929,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara","text":"Aokigahara is a forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan. The forest is known to be quiet because of the absence of wildlife and the wind-blocking density of the trees that are in it. A number of rocky, icy caverns are in the forest and some of them are popular tourist destinations. Demons in Japanese mythology are associated with the forest.\nIt is known as a popular suicide spot and is reportedly the most popular in Japan. It also ranks as the second in the world after San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. There are signs in the forest in both Japanese and English that try to persuade people not to commit suicide. The forest is said to be haunted by the Y\u016Brei (angry spirits) that were left to die.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":16},{"uri":"Mount_Fuji","surface_form":"Mount Fuji","offset":48},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":62},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":273},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"Demon","offset":295},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":381},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":486},{"uri":"Golden_Gate_Bridge","surface_form":"Golden Gate Bridge","offset":502},{"uri":"Y%C5%ABrei","surface_form":"Y\u016Brei","offset":672}]}
