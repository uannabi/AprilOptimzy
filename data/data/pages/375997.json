Eisenhower won the election by 442 electoral votes. Adlai Stevenson got only 89 electoral votes.\nIncumbent President Harry S. Truman was eligible to run again because the newly passed 22nd amendment did not apply to the incumbent president at that time.

This was the first time an older candidate was elected since James Buchanan was elected in 1856 at 65, something that wouldn't happen again until 69-year old Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election.\nCandidates gallery.\nBarkley was 74 years old and not accepted by labor union leaders because of his age.\nTruman's running mate was going to be Senator Estes Kefauver, but he did not choose to run in the election.
