{"id":376124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_College%2C_Cambridge","text":"Jesus College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It was created in 1496. It took over buildings from a nunnery (a place where nuns live), including the chapel which was called Jesus Chapel. Because of this it still looks more like a monastery than a college. It has very big gardens and is one of the largest colleges in Cambridge with more than 700 students.\nSome very famous people have studied here, for example Thomas Cranmer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Laurence Sterne.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":44},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":69},{"uri":"Nun","surface_form":"nun","offset":155},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":262},{"uri":"Thomas_Cranmer","surface_form":"Thomas Cranmer","offset":444},{"uri":"Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","surface_form":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge","offset":460},{"uri":"Laurence_Sterne","surface_form":"Laurence Sterne","offset":488}]}
