The building was built in the model of the newly discovered King Tut's tomb. Over time it was changed repeatedly. In 1999 it was remodeled once again after the original building.\nNow, it mainly runs movies and concerts.\nThe theater is architecturally significant as one of the few surviving theaters from the grand cinema and movie palace era in Boise.\nThe Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Bourne Ultimatum, starring Matt Damon, premieres were all hosted at The Egyptian Theatre.\nIt is also said to be one of the more haunted buildings in Boise, and was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Stories in 2009.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Boise%2C_Idaho","surface_form":"Boise, Idaho","offset":80},{"uri":"Movie_theater","surface_form":"movie theater","offset":98},{"uri":"Egyptian_Theatre","surface_form":"Egyptian Theatre","offset":146},{"uri":"King_Tut","surface_form":"King Tut","offset":333},{"uri":"The_Bourne_Identity_(2002_film)","surface_form":"The Bourne Identity","offset":626},{"uri":"The_Bourne_Supremacy_(film)","surface_form":"The Bourne Supremacy","offset":647},{"uri":"The_Bourne_Ultimatum_(film)","surface_form":"The Bourne Ultimatum","offset":673},{"uri":"Matt_Damon","surface_form":"Matt Damon","offset":704},{"uri":"Travel_Channel","surface_form":"Travel Channel","offset":857},{"uri":"Ghost_Stories","surface_form":"Ghost Stories","offset":877}]}
