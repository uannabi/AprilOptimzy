A \"crash\" means that the prices of stock were lowered greatly, and no one wanted to buy it. Instead, they sold the stock for cheap prices. Also, banks were trying to buy stock with people's money (stored inside the bank), so the banks ran out of money too.

This was the start of the Great Depression.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Share_(finance)","surface_form":"shares","offset":99},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"company stock","offset":109},{"uri":"NYSE","surface_form":"New York Stock Exchange","offset":171},{"uri":"Virtual","surface_form":"virtual","offset":208},{"uri":"NASDAQ","surface_form":"NASDAQ","offset":233},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":263},{"uri":"Bankrupt","surface_form":"ran out of money","offset":585},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":736}]}
