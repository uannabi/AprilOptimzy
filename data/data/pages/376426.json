{"id":376426,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BAnchad_mac_Fiachnai","text":"e=\"preserve\">D\u00FAnchad mac Fiachnai (died circa 644) was King of Ulaid from the Dal Fiatach dynasty. He was the son of Fiachnae mac Demm\u00E1in (died 627), a previous king. He ruled from 637-circa 644.\nThe Dal Fiatach recovered the kingship of Ulaid after the Battle of Mag Roth in 637 and were to retain it until 674. Family strife was a common theme among the dynasty at this time. D\u00FAnchad's mother was Cumne Dub ingen Furudr\u00E1in of the U\u00ED Tuirtri (a tribe of the Airgialla west of Lough Neagh in modern County Tyrone). She had previously been married to D\u00FAnchad's great uncle Baetan mac Cairill (died 581) by whom she had children. These children were eliminated by D\u00FAnchad's full brother M\u00E1el D\u00FAin mac Fiachnai in 605. However, the ambitions of M\u00E1el D\u00FAin were not to be fulfilled as he was murdered by D\u00FAnchad at \u00D3enach Deiscirt Maige, probably in southern Muirthemne in modern County Louth.\nHis son Congal Cennfota mac D\u00FAnchada (died 674) was also a King of Ulaid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ulaid","surface_form":"Ulaid","offset":63},{"uri":"Dal_Fiatach","surface_form":"Dal Fiatach","offset":78},{"uri":"Fiachnae_mac_Demm%C3%A1in","surface_form":"Fiachnae mac Demm\u00E1in","offset":117},{"uri":"Airgialla","surface_form":"Airgialla","offset":459},{"uri":"Baetan_mac_Cairill","surface_form":"Baetan mac Cairill","offset":572},{"uri":"Congal_Cennfota_mac_D%C3%BAnchada","surface_form":"Congal Cennfota mac D\u00FAnchada","offset":897}]}
