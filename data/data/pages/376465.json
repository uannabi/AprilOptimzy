{"id":376465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnham_College%2C_Cambridge","text":"Newnham College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It is for women only and has about 500 students. It was created in 1871 by Henry Sidgwick who wanted to make education more available to women. It was built at a time when most colleges where for men only. It was the second college to allow women after Girton. It started just as a group of houses in Regent Street. In 1875 the first buildings were finished in Sidgwick Avenue and the college moved there.\nNewnham College has beautiful large gardens that the students can walk on. This is different from the other colleges where only Fellows can walk on the grass. It also has one of the largest libraries in Cambridge, with more than 90,000 books.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":46},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":71},{"uri":"Henry_Sidgwick","surface_form":"Henry Sidgwick","offset":155},{"uri":"Girton_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Girton","offset":333},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Fellow","offset":614},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"libraries","offset":676}]}
