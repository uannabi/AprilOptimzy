Humayun won the battle and captured Chunar. In 1534, Humayun defeated Bahadur Shah and captured Gujrat. Sher Shah meanwhile regrouped and defeated Humayun, at Chausa in 1539 and at Kanauj the next year (1540).\nHumayun was forced to go to Persia in exile, for 15 years. In 1555, Humayun returned to India and defeated the succesor of Sher Shah, Islam Shah and regained India.\nIn 1531, Bahadur Shah Zafar overran Malwa and the next year he turned to Mewar.

He was carrying books when his feet got caught in his robe and he tripped and fractured his head. He had bent down upon hearing the azaan (the Muslim call to prayer). All medical aid proved useless, and Humayun died. He is known as \"the luckless one\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mughal_Empire","surface_form":"Mughal Emperor","offset":76},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":101},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":114},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":146},{"uri":"1530","surface_form":"1530","offset":157},{"uri":"Babur","surface_form":"Babur","offset":211},{"uri":"Akbar","surface_form":"Akbar","offset":230},{"uri":"In","surface_form":"In","offset":747}]}
