It is the sequel to the 2000 game, \"Jet Set Radio\".\nThe game is set in a futuristic Tokyo which the player as part of a gang trys to gain control of. The games gameplay also requires the player to find other gangs graffiti tags and tag over them when the player collects enough spraycans that are littered around each stage. The game's tagging system is also different from the last game. Some of the tagging locations contain multiple spray targets which depend on the tag's size. Time limits for stages are removed and the stages are interconnected.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":28},{"uri":"Smilebit","surface_form":"Smilebit","offset":56},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":85},{"uri":"Xbox","surface_form":"Xbox","offset":111},{"uri":"Jet_Set_Radio","surface_form":"Jet Set Radio","offset":153},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":201},{"uri":"Spraycan","surface_form":"spraycan","offset":395}]}
