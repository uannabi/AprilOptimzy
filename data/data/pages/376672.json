{"id":376672,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onslow%2C_Nova_Scotia","text":"Onslow is a small Canadian rural community in central Colchester County, Nova Scotia. It is an unincorporated community. The community is located along the north bank of the Salmon River. It is on the opposite side of the river from the town of Truro. It is largely a farming area. It is situated in a region first settled by Europeans as Onslow Township (1761).\nAn important highway interchange is located in the community. It is where Highway 102 terminates at Highway 104.\nOnslow is home to Central Colchester Junior High School. The school is operated by the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board. Onslow also contains a small corner store, a John Deere dealership and a volunteer fire department. The area is mostly farmland but people live here also and the community is expanding somewhat. In the fall and spring, migrating Canada Geese are attracted to the farmlands and corn fields. Onslow is geographically situated in an area with high winds. This makes it an excellent location for wind turbines. Some farmers in the area have chosen to erect wind turbines to power their farms.\nNova Scotia Power has a power distribution point in Onslow where it interconnects the Halifax Regional Municipality with Cape Breton, South Shore and New Brunswick Power Transmission System.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":18},{"uri":"Colchester_County%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Colchester County","offset":54},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":73},{"uri":"Salmon_River_(Nova_Scotia)","surface_form":"Salmon River","offset":174},{"uri":"Truro%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Truro","offset":245},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia_Highway_102","surface_form":"Highway 102","offset":437},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia_Highway_104","surface_form":"Highway 104","offset":463},{"uri":"Central_Colchester_Junior_High_School","surface_form":"Central Colchester Junior High School","offset":494},{"uri":"Chignecto-Central_Regional_School_Board","surface_form":"Chignecto-Central Regional School Board","offset":563},{"uri":"Canada_Geese","surface_form":"Canada Geese","offset":833},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"corn","offset":881},{"uri":"Wind_turbines","surface_form":"wind turbines","offset":996},{"uri":"Wind_turbines","surface_form":"wind turbines","offset":1057},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":1086},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia_Power","surface_form":"Nova Scotia Power","offset":1093},{"uri":"Halifax_Regional_Municipality","surface_form":"Halifax Regional Municipality","offset":1179},{"uri":"Cape_Breton_Island","surface_form":"Cape Breton","offset":1214},{"uri":"South_Shore_(Nova_Scotia)","surface_form":"South Shore","offset":1227},{"uri":"New_Brunswick","surface_form":"New Brunswick","offset":1243},{"uri":"Electric_power_transmission","surface_form":"Power Transmission System","offset":1257}]}
