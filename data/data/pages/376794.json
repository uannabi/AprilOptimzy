{"id":376794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_kingfisher","text":"The common kingfisher (\"Alcedo atthis\"), also known as the Eurasian kingfisher and river kingfisher, is a small kingfisher. Like most kingfishers, it needs a perch to do its fishing. Usual is to see it on a tree branch overlooking a river.\nThere are seven subspecies in its wide distribution across Eurasia and North Africa. It is resident over much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.\nThis sparrow-sized bird has the typical short-tailed, large-headed kingfisher profile; it has blue upperparts, orange underparts and a long bill. It feeds mainly on fish caught by diving, and has special visual adaptions to see its prey underwater. The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kingfisher","surface_form":"kingfisher","offset":112},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":256},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":299},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":311},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":411},{"uri":"House_Sparrow","surface_form":"sparrow","offset":424},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":438},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":584}]}
