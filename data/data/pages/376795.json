They were cladoxylopsids, close relatives of modern ferns and horsetails.\nThe crown of \"Wattieza\", discovered in 2005, was united with its root and trunk, known since 1870. The fossilized grove of \"Gilboa stumps\" had been described as \"Eospermatopteris\", though the complete plant remained unknown.\n\"Wattieza\" had fronds rather than leaves, and reproduced with spores.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":33},{"uri":"Fossils","surface_form":"fossils","offset":45},{"uri":"New_York_State","surface_form":"New York State","offset":67},{"uri":"Cyatheales","surface_form":"tree ferns","offset":147},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"mid-Devonian","offset":177},{"uri":"Cladoxylopsid","surface_form":"cladoxylopsid","offset":230},{"uri":"Fern","surface_form":"fern","offset":272},{"uri":"Equisetum","surface_form":"horsetails","offset":282},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":359},{"uri":"Trunk_(botany)","surface_form":"trunk","offset":368},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":495},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":581}]}
