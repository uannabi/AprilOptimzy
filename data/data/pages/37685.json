{"id":37685,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting","text":"e=\"preserve\">Counting is something people do to find out how many things there are of any kind.\nOne way to count.\nThe person counting in English usually starts with the number one, and gives this number to the first thing. The next thing is given the number two. Then, the next thing is given the number three. If there is another thing, it gets the number four. If after this there is another thing, it gets the number five. More things get more numbers. Each thing gets its own number in this way. The last number given to the last thing counted shows how many things there are.\nMore counting.\nCounting is starting at a number and changing it up or down a certain number of times. In the examples above, counting started at one and then it changed by one each time something was counted. So at first the count was one. Then the count was changed by one, and one plus one is two, so the count was two. Then the count of two was changed by one again, and two plus one is three, so the count was three.\nCounting can go up or down. Counting can be done on fingers.\nMore about counting.\nIt has been shown that some birds are good at counting. Crows\nare birds that are good at counting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":169},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":622},{"uri":"Fingers","surface_form":"fingers","offset":1054},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1112},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"Crow","offset":1140}]}
