{"id":3770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare","text":"Chemical warfare means using chemical compounds in war to injure or kill people. The chemicals used for chemical warfare are poisonous.\nChemical warfare has been used since the Stone Age. Since 1899, several international laws have said that using chemical weapons is illegal. But chemical weapons have still been used in wars since then.\nDefinition.\nChemical weapons are different than regular weapons (like bombs) or nuclear weapons because they do not explode. Some chemical weapons are meant to kill people; they do this by poisoning them. Other chemical weapons are meant to \"incapacitate\" people (make them unable to fight back). They do this by causing pain, injuries, or sickness.\nChemical warfare does not include using living organisms (like anthrax bacteria) to make people sick. That is called biological warfare.\nHowever, some living organisms make toxins (poisons). These toxins are not alive. For example, botulinum toxin is made by a bacteria, and ricin is made by the castor oil plant. Because botulinum toxin and ricin are not alive, using them to make people sick is called chemical warfare. This is explained in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The Convention also says that any toxic chemical is a chemical weapon unless it is used for legal reasons.\nAbout 70 different chemicals have been used or stockpiled (saved up) as chemical warfare agents during the 20th century. The Chemical Weapons Convention says that all of these chemicals should be destroyed.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention lists three different groups of chemicals. These are chemicals that are poisonous enough to be used as chemical weapons, or chemicals that may be used to make chemical weapons.\nHistory.\nAlthough very basic chemical warfare has been used in many parts of the world for thousands of years, \"modern\" chemical warfare began during World War I (see the page Chemical weapons in World War I).\nAncient history.\nChemical warfare was first used during the Stone Age. Stone Age people used poisoned arrows and spear-tips. These were dipped in poisons, like venom from snakes or scorpions. Sometimes they used poisonous plants.\nThe Ancient Chinese used different forms of poisonous smokes, when they besieged a city to try to take it over.\nThe Ancient Greeks used a form of burning wood, pitch from plants, and sulphur.\nWorld War I.\n\"Main article: Chemical weapons in World War I\"\nPoison gas was first used in World War I. France was the first country to make this type of gas. However, Germany was the first to use it in battle, on March 15th, 1915. On that day, they used tear gas against France.\nAt first, very basic ways of spreading these gases were used. Even so, many soldiers could be hurt or killed. This was partly because World War I was fought usingtrench warfare, so many soldiers would be in the same place at the same time, and escaping from poisonous gases would be very hard.\nGermany was the first country in World War I to use chemical warfare in battle. They simply opened containers of chlorine upwind of enemy soldiers, so that the wind would carry the chlorine gas to their enemies.\nSoon after this, the French started using chemical weapons too. They filled artillery projectiles with phosgene and fired them at the Germans. This was a much more effective way of using chemical weapons. It would become the most common way of delivering chemical weapons during World War I.\nModern use.\nChemical weapons were not used very much in World War II, except by the Japanese army during the invasion of China. This was because everybody was afraid that the other side would use weapons like theirs. Also, chemical weapons were not easy to use. They took time to use, and this made it harder for soldiers to move quickly. Also, the raw materials needed to make chemical weapons were not easy to get. This was because World War II was fought in areas which were not connected well by railroads.\nDuring the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq used chemical weapons (Iran did not). Many people believe that Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurdish people.\nThe United States has used chemical weapons even after World War II. For example, the U.S. used Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.\nIt has been reported that many other countries, like the People's Republic of China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, and Serbia and Montenegro, have chemical weapons.\nLaws about chemical weapons.\nAccording to international law, it is wrong to use chemical weapons. Since 1899, there have been many rules that make it illegal to make, import, and use chemical weapons.\nThe first international law to make chemical warfare illegal was the Hague Convention in 1899.\nAfter World War I, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 made it illegal to use chemical or biological weapons on people.\nIn 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was created. As of the end of 2015, 192 countries had agreed to follow the CWC. According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as of October 2015, 90% of the world's chemical weapons stockpiles had been destroyed.\nChemical agents.\nIf we use chemicals (like Agent Orange or glyphosate) to destroy plants, sometimes human beings may be affected by side effects. But, we will not call it chemical warfare. Chemical warfare covers only direct attacks on human life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":29},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injure","offset":58},{"uri":"Killing","surface_form":"kill","offset":68},{"uri":"Chemical_substance","surface_form":"chemicals","offset":85},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":125},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":177},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":208},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":268},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":395},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":409},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"nuclear weapon","offset":419},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explode","offset":455},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":660},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":736},{"uri":"Anthrax_disease","surface_form":"anthrax bacteria","offset":752},{"uri":"Biological_warfare","surface_form":"biological warfare","offset":806},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":862},{"uri":"Botulinum_toxin","surface_form":"botulinum toxin","offset":921},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":950},{"uri":"Ricin","surface_form":"ricin","offset":964},{"uri":"Castor_oil_plant","surface_form":"castor oil plant","offset":985},{"uri":"Chemical_Weapons_Convention","surface_form":"Chemical Weapons Convention","offset":1136},{"uri":"Stockpile","surface_form":"stockpile","offset":1325},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1385},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1844},{"uri":"Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I","surface_form":"Chemical weapons in World War I","offset":1870},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrows","offset":2006},{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":2017},{"uri":"Venom","surface_form":"venom","offset":2064},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":2075},{"uri":"Scorpion","surface_form":"scorpion","offset":2085},{"uri":"Ancient_China","surface_form":"Ancient Chinese","offset":2138},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smokes","offset":2188},{"uri":"Siege","surface_form":"besieged","offset":2206},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greeks","offset":2250},{"uri":"Sulphur","surface_form":"sulphur","offset":2317},{"uri":"Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I","surface_form":"Chemical weapons in World War I","offset":2354},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":2429},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":2493},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":2528},{"uri":"Tear_gas","surface_form":"tear gas","offset":2580},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldiers","offset":2681},{"uri":"Casualty_(person)","surface_form":"hurt or killed","offset":2699},{"uri":"Trench_warfare","surface_form":"trench warfare","offset":2767},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":2971},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":3187},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":3459},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":3487},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"invasion of China","offset":3512},{"uri":"Raw_material","surface_form":"raw material","offset":3752},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":3903},{"uri":"Iran-Iraq_War","surface_form":"Iran-Iraq War","offset":3925},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":3940},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":3968},{"uri":"Kurdish_people","surface_form":"Kurdish","offset":4047},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":4067},{"uri":"Agent_Orange","surface_form":"Agent Orange","offset":4159},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":4183},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"the People's Republic of China","offset":4249},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":4281},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":4287},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":4300},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":4308},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":4321},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":4331},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":4338},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":4345},{"uri":"Serbia_and_Montenegro","surface_form":"Serbia and Montenegro","offset":4357},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":4445},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"make","offset":4564},{"uri":"Import","surface_form":"import","offset":4570},{"uri":"Hague_Convention","surface_form":"Hague Convention","offset":4673},{"uri":"1925_Geneva_Protocol","surface_form":"the Geneva Protocol of 1925","offset":4718},{"uri":"Glyphosate","surface_form":"glyphosate","offset":5155},{"uri":"Side-effect","surface_form":"side effect","offset":5228}]}
