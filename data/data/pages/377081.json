In February 1984 it became the Australian Electoral Commission.\nThe AEC is run by a Chairman who is a Judge, or a retired Judge, of the Federal Court, the Electoral Commissioner and a non-judicial member who is usually the Australian Statistician). The Electoral Commissioner has the powers of a Secretary of a Department under the \"Public Service Act 1999\" and the \"Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998\". The Chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.\nThe AEC has a National Office in Canberra and State Offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.\nEach federal electorate has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for the House of Representatives elections within their division. Each State also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for the Senate elections.\nDuties.\nThe AEC's major duties are to run federal elections, by-elections and referendums.
