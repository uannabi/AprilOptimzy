{"id":37721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey","text":"Field Hockey is a well-liked sport for both men and women. It is played in many countries all around the world. In Asian countries like Pakistan and Republic of India, it is considered the \"National sport.\" The game is played between two teams and each team is made up of 11 players. There are four 15-minute quarters with a 15 minute break at halftime and a 2 minute break after the 1st and 3rd quarters. Field hockey is played with a ball on natural grass, or on sand-based or water based artificial turfs with a small hard ball. The field has a goal at each end. A semi-circle about 15 meters from the goal is known as the shooting circle. Goals can only be scored when the ball is in the shooting circle.\nPlayers use a hockey stick to move the ball. The stick is in the shape of a J and is made out of wood, glass and fibre. The players each play a position like fullbacks, halfbacks, forwards and goalkeepers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Men","surface_form":"men","offset":44},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":52},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":80},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":105},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":136},{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":149},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":806},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":812},{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibre","offset":822},{"uri":"Fullback","surface_form":"fullback","offset":867},{"uri":"Halfback","surface_form":"halfback","offset":878},{"uri":"Forward","surface_form":"forward","offset":889},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":902}]}
