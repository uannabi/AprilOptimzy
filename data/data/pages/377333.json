{"id":377333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Newcastle","text":"The Division of Newcastle is a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. The Division is centred around the city of Newcastle, after which it is named.\nThe Division was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It has been held by the Australian Labor Party since it was created. Labor has never got less than 58 percent of the two-party vote in a general election. It has only come close to losing it once, when it got 53 percent in a 1935 by-election. It is the only original Division to be held by just one party since the first Federal election.\nMembers.\nThe Division of Newcastle has had just five members since 1901. This is the fewest of any of the original Divisions. From 1901 to 1958, the seat was held by the Watkins family. David Oliver took over from his father David in 1935. Allan Morris' brother, Peter was also in the Federal Parliament, representing the Division of Shortland. Charles Jones' brother, Sam, was in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Federal Electoral Division","offset":31},{"uri":"Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian House of Representatives","offset":66},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":118},{"uri":"Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Newcastle","offset":178},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Australian Labor Party","offset":335},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":541},{"uri":"David_Oliver_Watkins","surface_form":"David Oliver","offset":836},{"uri":"David_Watkins_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"David","offset":875},{"uri":"Allan_Morris","surface_form":"Allan Morris","offset":890},{"uri":"Peter_Morris_(politician)","surface_form":"Peter","offset":913},{"uri":"Division_of_Shortland","surface_form":"Division of Shortland","offset":972},{"uri":"Charles_Jones_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"Charles Jones'","offset":995},{"uri":"New_South_Wales_Legislative_Assembly","surface_form":"New South Wales Legislative Assembly","offset":1035}]}
