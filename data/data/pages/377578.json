{"id":377578,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Stumpf","text":"Carl Stumpf (21 April 1848 \u2013 25 December 1936) was a German philosopher and psychologist. He is known for his impact on phenomenology, one of the most important philosophical trends of the twentieth century.\nHe had an important influence on Edmund Husserl, the founder of modern phenomenology, as well as Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K\u00F6hler and Kurt Koffka, co-founders of Gestalt psychology.\nStumpf was also one of the pioneers of musicology and ethnomusicology. He held positions in the philosophy departments at the Universities of G\u00F6ttingen, W\u00FCrzburg, Prague, Munich and Halle, before obtaining a chair (professorship) at the University of Berlin.\nPhenomenology.\nStumpf began his \"Tonpsychologie\" (Tone psychology) in 1875, perhaps his greatest contribution to psychology. He distinguished between phenomena and mental functions, suggesting that phenomena such as tones, colours, and images are either sensory or imaginary. Stumpf termed the study of such phenomena as \"phenomenology\". He did a wide range of studies of the sounds of different instruments, melody, tonal fusion, and the consonance and dissonance of tones.\nSensational phenomena.\nIn 1903 and 1904, Stumpf was involved in two public episodes about sensational phenomena. First, an engineer from Prague claimed to have invented a machine that could change photographs of sound waves into sound. Stumpf, after attending a demonstration, wrote an article challenging it, and it was never heard about again. However, the case of Clever Hans, an apparently brilliant horse owned by Herr von Osten, was even more sensational. The research done under his guidance disproved the idea that the animal understood language. It turned out that the horse was following subtle clues given unconsciously by its owner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":53},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":60},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":76},{"uri":"Phenomenology","surface_form":"phenomenology","offset":120},{"uri":"Edmund_Husserl","surface_form":"Edmund Husserl","offset":241},{"uri":"Max_Wertheimer","surface_form":"Max Wertheimer","offset":305},{"uri":"Wolfgang_K%C3%B6hler","surface_form":"Wolfgang K\u00F6hler","offset":321},{"uri":"Kurt_Koffka","surface_form":"Kurt Koffka","offset":341},{"uri":"Gestalt_psychology","surface_form":"Gestalt psychology","offset":369},{"uri":"Musicology","surface_form":"musicology","offset":428},{"uri":"Ethnomusicology","surface_form":"ethnomusicology","offset":443},{"uri":"G%C3%B6ttingen","surface_form":"G\u00F6ttingen","offset":531},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrzburg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrzburg","offset":542},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":552},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":560},{"uri":"Halle","surface_form":"Halle","offset":571},{"uri":"University_of_Berlin","surface_form":"University of Berlin","offset":626},{"uri":"Tonality","surface_form":"tones","offset":864},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":871},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":884},{"uri":"Imagination","surface_form":"imaginary","offset":913},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":1057},{"uri":"Consonance_and_dissonance","surface_form":"consonance and dissonance","offset":1087},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":1260},{"uri":"Clever_Hans","surface_form":"Clever Hans","offset":1490},{"uri":"Clue","surface_form":"clues","offset":1728},{"uri":"Unconscious","surface_form":"unconscious","offset":1740}]}
