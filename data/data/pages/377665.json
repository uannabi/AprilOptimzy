{"id":377665,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proserpina","text":"=\"preserve\">Proserpina (; Latin: \"Pr\u014Dserpina\") or Proserpine is the goddess of springtime and the queen of the underworld in Roman mythology. She was the daughter of Ceres. In Greek mythology, there was a goddess who was like Proserpina called Persephone. She was first introduced to the Romans in the year 204 BC, and many of her myths were based on those of the Greek goddess.\nThe most famous story about her is how she was taken by force to the Underworld by Pluto, and how she later became able to return to the world above, but only for part of each year. This myth was a popular subject in Roman art and literature, and remained so well into the Renaissance. Her name is possibly derived from the Latin \"proserpere\", meaning \"to emerge or come forth\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":26},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman mythology","offset":125},{"uri":"Ceres","surface_form":"Ceres","offset":166},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":176},{"uri":"Persephone","surface_form":"Persephone","offset":244},{"uri":"Pluto_(mythology)","surface_form":"Pluto","offset":462},{"uri":"Roman_art","surface_form":"Roman art","offset":596},{"uri":"Roman_literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":610},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":652}]}
