She is curator at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, and Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at Cambridge University. Her career is devoted to studying the early evolution of tetrapods.\nLobe-finned fish in the Devonian evolved into tetrapods in a series of transitional fossils. Clack adopted the term \"fishapod\" to describe these animals. They then colonized the freshwater swamps of the Carboniferous period.\nLife.\nClack attended Bolton School, one of the oldest schools in Lancashire. She received a BSc in Zoology from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1970. and a PhD in 1984. She also holds a Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies from the University of Leicester and an M.A. and D.Sc. from the University of Cambridge.\nIn 2006, Clack was awarded a personal chair by the University of Cambridge, taking the title Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology. In 2008 she was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2009.\nThe fairly complete fossil of \"Acanthostega\" she discovered in Greenland in 1987 is a transitional, water-bound primitive tetrapod.\nIn April 2012 she was featured in an episode of the BBC television series \"Beautiful Minds\", a set of documentaries about scientists who have made important discoveries.\nClack died on 26 March 2020 at the age of 72.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":34},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":92},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"palaeontologist","offset":100},{"uri":"Curator","surface_form":"curator","offset":124},{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge University","offset":139},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"Vertebrate","offset":196},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":290},{"uri":"Tetrapods","surface_form":"tetrapods","offset":303},{"uri":"Lobe-finned_fish","surface_form":"Lobe-finned fish","offset":314},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":338},{"uri":"Transitional_fossils","surface_form":"transitional fossils","offset":385},{"uri":"Fishapod","surface_form":"fishapod","offset":431},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":503},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":517},{"uri":"Bolton_School","surface_form":"Bolton School","offset":560},{"uri":"Lancashire","surface_form":"Lancashire","offset":604},{"uri":"BSc","surface_form":"BSc","offset":631},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"Zoology","offset":638},{"uri":"University_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne","surface_form":"University of Newcastle upon Tyne","offset":655},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":704},{"uri":"University_of_Leicester","surface_form":"University of Leicester","offset":782},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":837},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":913},{"uri":"Daniel_Giraud_Elliot_Medal","surface_form":"Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal","offset":1022},{"uri":"National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":1063},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"Fellow of the Royal Society","offset":1111},{"uri":"Acanthostega","surface_form":"Acanthostega","offset":1179},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":1211}]}
