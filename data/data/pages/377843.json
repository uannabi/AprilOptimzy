{"id":377843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lieutenant","text":"First lieutenant is a military rank in many armed forces. They are considered commissioned officer<nowiki/>s and in some militaries an appointment.\nThe rank of lieutenant has different meanings in different military formations. In the majority of cases it is common for it to be sub-divided into a senior (first lieutenant) and junior (second lieutenant) rank. In navies it may relate to a particular post rather than a rank.\nU.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force.\nIn the United States Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, a first lieutenant is a junior commissioned officer. It is just above the rank of second lieutenant and just below the rank of captain. It is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) in the other uniformed services.\nU.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.\nIn the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, first lieutenant is a position title, instead of a rank. It is held by the officer in command of the deck department. On smaller ships, the first lieutenant holds the rank of lieutenant, junior grade or ensign. On larger vessels, the position is held by a lieutenant or, in the case of extremely large warships such as aircraft carriers, a lieutenant commander or even commander. However, on submarines, where the deck department may only have a few junior sailors, the first lieutenant may be a senior enlisted member, such as a first-class petty officer or chief petty officer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military_rank","surface_form":"military rank","offset":22},{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":44},{"uri":"Officer_(armed_forces)","surface_form":"commissioned officer","offset":78},{"uri":"Appointment","surface_form":"appointment","offset":135},{"uri":"Lieutenant","surface_form":"lieutenant","offset":160},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":482},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"Air Force","offset":502},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"Marine Corps","offset":517},{"uri":"Commissioned_officer","surface_form":"commissioned officer","offset":562},{"uri":"Second_lieutenant","surface_form":"second lieutenant","offset":613},{"uri":"Captain_(United_States)","surface_form":"captain","offset":658},{"uri":"Lieutenant_(junior_grade)","surface_form":"lieutenant (junior grade)","offset":699},{"uri":"Uniformed_services_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"uniformed services","offset":738},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"U.S. Navy","offset":797},{"uri":"United_States_Coast_Guard","surface_form":"Coast Guard","offset":811},{"uri":"Deck_department","surface_form":"deck department","offset":925},{"uri":"Lieutenant%2C_junior_grade","surface_form":"lieutenant, junior grade","offset":999},{"uri":"Ensign_(rank)","surface_form":"ensign","offset":1027},{"uri":"Aircraft_carrier","surface_form":"aircraft carrier","offset":1143},{"uri":"Lieutenant_Commander_(United_States)","surface_form":"lieutenant commander","offset":1164},{"uri":"Commander_(United_States)","surface_form":"commander","offset":1193},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":1216},{"uri":"Petty_officer","surface_form":"petty officer","offset":1366},{"uri":"Chief_petty_officer","surface_form":"chief petty officer","offset":1383}]}
