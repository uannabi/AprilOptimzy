He received the Medal of Honor for actions during the Korean Expedition. He was serving as a private aboard. His Medal of Honor was issued on February 8, 1872. Private Dougherty was one of fifteen United States sailors and Marines who received the Medal of Honor for this little known American military action.\nHe is buried in Cypress Hills National Cemetery, Section 6, Grave 12374.\nMedal of Honor citation.\nOn board the in various actions of that vessel. Wounded several times, Dougherty invariably returned to duty, presenting an example of constancy and devotion to the flag.\nNote/Another James Dougherty.\nThere may have been either two James Doughertys awarded the medal during the Korean Expedition. One served on board the \"Carondelet\", while the other may have served on the. Alternatively, the medals may have been awarded to the same Marine.\nThe U.S.S. Carondelet does not appear to have served in Korea, raising the possibility that two James Doughertys received the Medal of Honor (on-line resources do not support this point) or that the citation for Private Dougherty's medal refers incorrectly to the U.S.S. Carondelet instead of to another ship (possibly the U.S.S. Benicia) involved in the Korean campaign.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"U.S. Marine","offset":62},{"uri":"Medal_of_Honor","surface_form":"Medal of Honor","offset":119},{"uri":"Korean_Expedition","surface_form":"Korean Expedition","offset":157},{"uri":"Cypress_Hills_National_Cemetery","surface_form":"Cypress Hills National Cemetery","offset":430}]}
