It is often just called Sidney by the students. It was created in 1596. It takes its name from Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex, who gave money to build it. Today it has about 550 students.\nIt is quite a small college, and it is found in the town centre of Cambridge. Because it is in quite a small area, it has changed little since it was first built. The buildings were made of red brick at the beginning, but then they were covered by cement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":52},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":77},{"uri":"Frances_Sidney%2C_Countess_of_Sussex","surface_form":"Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex","offset":181},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":345}]}
