{"id":37809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television","text":"High-definition television (HDTV) is a new television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television. With HDTV, people can watch television in higher quality than old television, giving a more vivid and clear screen.\nMost HDTV systems use digital signals with a 16:9 aspect ratio (width to height). This is different to SDTV (standard-definition television) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio.\nHDTV picture resolution is at least twice that of SDTV, so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or DVD. HDTV can control resolution efficiently.\nSome videos on the website YouTube, a free video sharing website that lets people upload and view videos, are in HD.\nAs a comparison, PAL plus is at 1024x576 pixels, and NTSC at 853x480 pixels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":43},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"broadcasting","offset":54},{"uri":"Resolution","surface_form":"resolution","offset":94},{"uri":"Digital_signal","surface_form":"digital signal","offset":269},{"uri":"SDTV","surface_form":"SDTV","offset":350},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"analog signal","offset":399},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":631},{"uri":"PAL_plus","surface_form":"PAL plus","offset":738},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":762},{"uri":"NTSC","surface_form":"NTSC","offset":774}]}
