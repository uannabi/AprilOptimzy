{"id":378273,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone","text":"e=\"preserve\">Luteinizing hormone (LH, lutropin or lutrophin) is a sex hormone produced by gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland.\nIn females, an LH surge triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum (a temporary endocrine structure in female mammals that promotes relatively high levels of progesterone). In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell\u2013stimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. It acts synergistically with Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\nPredicting ovulation.\nThe detection of a surge in luteinising hormone shows ovulation will soon happen. LH can be detected by urinary test kits. Tests are done daily, round the time ovulation is expected. A swing from a negative to a positive reading suggests that ovulation will occur in 24\u201348 hours. The women has two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intentions of conceiving.\nTests may be read manually using a colour-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":70},{"uri":"Gonadotrophin","surface_form":"gonadotroph","offset":90},{"uri":"Pituitary_gland","surface_form":"pituitary gland","offset":124},{"uri":"Ovulation","surface_form":"ovulation","offset":174},{"uri":"Corpus_luteum","surface_form":"corpus luteum","offset":207},{"uri":"Progesterone","surface_form":"progesterone","offset":312},{"uri":"Leydig_cell","surface_form":"Leydig cell","offset":427},{"uri":"Testosterone","surface_form":"testosterone","offset":453},{"uri":"Follicle-stimulating_hormone","surface_form":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","offset":496},{"uri":"Ovulation","surface_form":"ovulation","offset":608},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urinary","offset":658},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":870},{"uri":"Artificial_insemination","surface_form":"artificial insemination","offset":892},{"uri":"Conception","surface_form":"conceiving","offset":939}]}
