{"id":378316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagh-e-Jinnah","text":"=\"preserve\">Bagh-e-Jinnah (used to be called Lawrence Gardens) is a large park in Lahore, Pakistan. It includes a botanical garden and other popular facilities, which were made during the British Raj. The Gardens were originally named after Sir John Lawrence, who was the first Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab and who did much to develop the city of Lahore in colonial times.\nAfter Pakistan's independence, some people demanded that the Gardens be renamed with a more 'patriotic' name so during the 1980s, their name was finally changed to \"Bagh i Jinnah\" (Jinnah's Gardens), after Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of the country. However, many people in Lahore still continue to call the Gardens as 'Lawrence Gardens', for the sake of historical accuracy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":82},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":90},{"uri":"Botanical_garden","surface_form":"botanical garden","offset":114},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":188},{"uri":"Sir","surface_form":"Sir","offset":241},{"uri":"John_Lawrence","surface_form":"John Lawrence","offset":245},{"uri":"Punjab","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":305},{"uri":"Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah","surface_form":"Muhammad Ali Jinnah","offset":584}]}
