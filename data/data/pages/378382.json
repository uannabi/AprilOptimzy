{"id":378382,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gory%C5%8Dkaku","text":"is a star fort in the Japanese city of Hakodate on the island of Hokkaid\u014D. It was the main fortress of the short-lived Republic of Ezo.\nHistory.\n\"Gory\u014Dkaku\" was designed in 1855 by Takeda Hisabur\u014D. His plan was based on the work of the French architect Vauban. The fort is shaped like a five-pointed star. This allowed for greater numbers of gun emplacements on its walls than a traditional Japanese fortress, and reduced the number of blind spots where a cannon could not fire.\nThe fort was built by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the Tsugaru Strait against a possible invasion by the Russian fleet.\nGory\u014Dkaku is famous as the site of the last battle of the Boshin War (\"Gory\u014Dkaku no Tatakai\"). The fighting lasted for a week (June 20-27 1869).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star_fort","surface_form":"star fort","offset":5},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":22},{"uri":"Hakodate%2C_Hokkaido","surface_form":"Hakodate","offset":39},{"uri":"Hokkaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Hokkaid\u014D","offset":65},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ezo","surface_form":"Republic of Ezo","offset":119},{"uri":"Takeda_Hisabur%C5%8D","surface_form":"Takeda Hisabur\u014D","offset":181},{"uri":"Vauban","surface_form":"Vauban","offset":253},{"uri":"Tokugawa_shogunate","surface_form":"Tokugawa shogunate","offset":505},{"uri":"Tsugaru_Strait","surface_form":"Tsugaru Strait","offset":539},{"uri":"Boshin_War","surface_form":"Boshin War","offset":662}]}
