{"id":3787,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(software)","text":"Epiphany is a Web browser for GNOME. It is also available for Mac OS X and was made from Galeon.\nIt uses the Gecko layout engine from the Mozilla project to show web pages; however, the Epiphany developers have a new but less stable version of Epiphany 2.21.4 using the WebKit engine instead of Gecko. The Epiphany team wants to stop using Gecko and only use the WebKit engine, by the time they release Epiphany 2.24 or 2.26. Epiphany has tabbed browsing, cookie management, popup blocking and an extensions system. Epiphany can be extended with the Epiphany-extensions package in Linux Operating Systems.\nEpiphany was made from Galeon by Marco Pesenti Gritti (also the creator of Galeon) with the aim of making a web browser with a very simple user experience. Because of that, Epiphany does not have its own themes, instead, it uses GNOME\u2019s settings that are set in the GNOME Control Center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Web_browser","surface_form":"Web browser","offset":14},{"uri":"GNOME","surface_form":"GNOME","offset":30},{"uri":"Mac_OS_X","surface_form":"Mac OS X","offset":62},{"uri":"Galeon","surface_form":"Galeon","offset":89},{"uri":"Gecko_(layout_engine)","surface_form":"Gecko layout engine","offset":109},{"uri":"Mozilla","surface_form":"Mozilla","offset":138},{"uri":"Programmer","surface_form":"developers","offset":195},{"uri":"WebKit","surface_form":"WebKit","offset":270},{"uri":"WebKit","surface_form":"WebKit","offset":363},{"uri":"Tabbed_Document_Interface","surface_form":"tabbed browsing","offset":439},{"uri":"HTTP_cookie","surface_form":"cookie","offset":456},{"uri":"Pop-up_ad","surface_form":"popup","offset":475},{"uri":"Epiphany-extensions","surface_form":"Epiphany-extensions","offset":550},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":581},{"uri":"Operating_System","surface_form":"Operating System","offset":587},{"uri":"Galeon","surface_form":"Galeon","offset":629},{"uri":"Marco_Pesenti_Gritti","surface_form":"Marco Pesenti Gritti","offset":639},{"uri":"GNOME_Control_Center","surface_form":"GNOME Control Center","offset":872}]}
