{"id":378709,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpiya_Davey","text":"Malpiya Davey (born 1959), also known as Irpintiri Davey, is an Aboriginal Australian artist from Pukatja, South Australia. She is best known for her ceramic artworks, but she also does painting, printmaking and weaving. Davey works for Ernabella Arts, the community arts co-operative in Pukatja. Ernabella Arts opened a ceramic studio in 2003, and Malpiya has since become one of its most prolific artists. She specialises in ceramic sgraffito.\nMalpiya is Pitjantjatjara. Her parent's country is to the west of Pukatja between Watarru and Iltur, close to the border with Western Australia. She decorates the ceramic with glazed or painted designs. Her designs depict various traditional bush foods from her family's country, such as ' (desert raisins), ' (quandong) and ' (wild figs). These are the subject of many of her sgraffito pieces.\nMalpiya's ceramic work has been shown in several major exhibitions around Australia, including at Flinders University, Cudgegong Gallery, Strathnairn Homestead Gallery, and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. It was also featured twice at the annual Desert Mob exhibition in Alice Springs, in 2003 and 2004. Examples are held in the permanent collections of the Grafton Regional Gallery in New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia, and the National Gallery of Australia. The National Museum of Australia also contains examples of Malpiya's screen prints.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal Australian","offset":64},{"uri":"Aboriginal_art","surface_form":"artist","offset":86},{"uri":"Pukatja%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Pukatja","offset":98},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":107},{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"ceramic artworks","offset":150},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":186},{"uri":"Printmaking","surface_form":"printmaking","offset":196},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"weaving","offset":212},{"uri":"Sgraffito","surface_form":"sgraffito","offset":435},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":457},{"uri":"Homeland","surface_form":"country","offset":486},{"uri":"Watarru%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Watarru","offset":528},{"uri":"Iltur%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Iltur","offset":540},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":572},{"uri":"Ceramic_glaze","surface_form":"glazed","offset":622},{"uri":"Bushfood","surface_form":"bush foods","offset":688},{"uri":"Art_exhibition","surface_form":"exhibitions","offset":896},{"uri":"Flinders_University","surface_form":"Flinders University","offset":939},{"uri":"Museum_and_Art_Gallery_of_the_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory","offset":1018},{"uri":"Alice_Springs","surface_form":"Alice Springs","offset":1134},{"uri":"Grafton_Regional_Gallery","surface_form":"Grafton Regional Gallery","offset":1221},{"uri":"Art_Gallery_of_South_Australia","surface_form":"Art Gallery of South Australia","offset":1270},{"uri":"National_Gallery_of_Australia","surface_form":"National Gallery of Australia","offset":1310},{"uri":"National_Museum_of_Australia","surface_form":"National Museum of Australia","offset":1345},{"uri":"Screen_printing","surface_form":"screen prints","offset":1410}]}
