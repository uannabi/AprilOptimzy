{"id":37872,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron","text":"Boron is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol B. It has the atomic number 5. It is a metalloid (it has properties of a metal and a non-metal). Much boron is found in chemical compounds in its ore borax. Boron is never found free in nature.\nTwo types of boron are found (allotropes). Amorphous boron is a brown powder and metallic (crystalline) boron is black and hard and a weak conductor at room temperature. Boron is the 5th element in the periodic table it is part of the earths surface\nPure boron is used as a dopant (a substance added to semiconductors to change how it behaves with electricity) in the semiconductor industry. Chemical compounds of boron are important as to make strong materials not weigh very much, as nontoxic insecticides and preservatives, and for chemical synthesis.\nPlants need boron in them to live. Very small amounts of boron are needed in animal's bodies so that they are very healthy. How it keeps animals healthy is not known in a lot of detail.\nBoron was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist, in 1808.\nBoron melts at 2075\u00A0\u00B0C (3767\u00A0\u00B0F), and boils at 4000\u00A0\u00B0C (7232\u00A0\u00B0F).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":70},{"uri":"Metalloid","surface_form":"metalloid","offset":95},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":129},{"uri":"Nonmetal","surface_form":"non-metal","offset":141},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":176},{"uri":"Borax","surface_form":"borax","offset":206},{"uri":"Allotrope","surface_form":"allotrope","offset":280},{"uri":"Amorphous","surface_form":"Amorphous","offset":293},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":341},{"uri":"Electrical_conductor","surface_form":"conductor","offset":389},{"uri":"Room_temperature","surface_form":"room temperature","offset":402},{"uri":"Dopant","surface_form":"dopant","offset":524},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":534},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":553},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":598},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":618},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":632},{"uri":"Chemical_compounds","surface_form":"Chemical compounds","offset":642},{"uri":"Nontoxic","surface_form":"nontoxic","offset":736},{"uri":"Insecticide","surface_form":"insecticide","offset":745},{"uri":"Preservative","surface_form":"preservative","offset":762},{"uri":"Chemical_synthesis","surface_form":"chemical synthesis","offset":785},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"Plant","offset":805},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":882},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":920},{"uri":"Humphry_Davy","surface_form":"Humphry Davy","offset":1019}]}
