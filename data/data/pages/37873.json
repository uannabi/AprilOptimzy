{"id":37873,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace","text":"A fireplace is a brick or metal structure used to hold a fire. Fireplaces are most often used for heating but they can also be used for cooking. The part of the fireplace that holds the fire is called a \"firebox\" or a \"firepit\". There is a chimney or flue above the firebox that lets the smoke from the fire go outside.\nUntil the early 1900s, most homes had one or more fireplaces as a source of heat for the residents of the house. In the mid-1900s, gas, oil, and electric heaters became more common and fireplaces were used less often as a source of heat. In the late 1900s, fireplaces were less commonly built in new houses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brick","surface_form":"brick","offset":17},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":26},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":32},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":57},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":98},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":136},{"uri":"Firebox","surface_form":"firebox","offset":204},{"uri":"Chimney","surface_form":"chimney","offset":240},{"uri":"Flue","surface_form":"flue","offset":251},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoke","offset":288},{"uri":"1900s","surface_form":"1900s","offset":336},{"uri":"Homes","surface_form":"homes","offset":348}]}
