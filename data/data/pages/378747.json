{"id":378747,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, function composition is a way of making a new function from two other functions through a chain-like process.\nMore specifically, given a function \"f\" from \"X\" to \"Y\" and a function \"g\" from \"Y\" to \"Z\", then the function \"g\" composed with \"f\", written as \"g \u2218 f\", is a function from \"X\" to \"Z\" (notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would expect it to be).\nThe value of \"f\" given the input \"x\" is written as \"f\"(\"x\"). The value of \"g \u2218 f\" given the input \"x\" is written as (\"g\" \u2218 \"f\")(\"x\"), and is defined as \"g\"(\"f\"(\"x\")).\nComposition of functions can also be generalized to binary relations, where it is sometimes represented using the same formula_1 symbol (as in formula_1).\nProperties.\nThis can be also seen in the first example, where \"(g \u2218 f)(2) = 2*2 - 1 = 3\" and \"(f \u2218 g)(2) = 2*(2-1) = 2\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":75},{"uri":"Relation_(mathematics)","surface_form":"binary relations","offset":633}]}
