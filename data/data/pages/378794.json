They were released on October 12, 2013. \"X and Y\" are the first ever 3D games in the main \"Pok\u00E9mon\" series.\nNew starting Pok\u00E9mon were revealed in the announcement video for the game. The starters for \"X and Y\" are the Grass-type Pok\u00E9mon, Chespin, the Fire-type Pok\u00E9mon, Fennekin, and the Water-type Pok\u00E9mon, Froakie. The announcement video also showed two new legendary Pok\u00E9mon, Yveltal, a bird-like Pok\u00E9mon which has a shape kind of like the letter Y, and Xerneas, a deer-like Pok\u00E9mon which has X-shapes in its eyes. Another Pok\u00E9mon, Sylveon, is both a new Eevee evolution and an entirely new type called the Fairy-type, which is strong against Dragon-type Pok\u00E9mon. Some older Pok\u00E9mon, like Jigglypuff, Marill, and Gardevoir, have also been changed to be part Fairy-type. There is also a new gameplay element called Mega Evolution. Some Pok\u00E9mon like Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Lucario are able to power up during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. Mega forms of Pok\u00E9mon are stronger than their normal forms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["VG"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Role-playing_game","surface_form":"role-playing game","offset":26},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)","surface_form":"\"Pok\u00E9mon\" series","offset":59},{"uri":"Game_Freak","surface_form":"Game Freak","offset":84},{"uri":"Nintendo_3DS","surface_form":"Nintendo 3DS","offset":103},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":145},{"uri":"Mewtwo","surface_form":"Mewtwo","offset":1025},{"uri":"Lucario","surface_form":"Lucario","offset":1047}]}
