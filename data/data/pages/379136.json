He is known for his public choice theory. His theories helped scientists figure out political science. Buchanan won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1968 for his theory.\nEarly life.\nBuchanan was born on October 3, 1919 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. His ancestry includes Scottish and Irish. He was raised in Chicago, Illinois and in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Buchanan studied at University of Chicago, at the University of Tennessee, and at the State Teachers College, Murfreesboro.\nIdeas.\nBuchanan is the founder of a new Virginia school of political economy. Buchanan is largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy in the second half of 20th century.\nThe term \"constitutional economics\" was used by James M. Buchanan as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan\u2019s work in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his \"development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.\"\nBuchanan rejects \"any organic conception of the state\" as superior in wisdom, to the citizens of this state.\" This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. It must be able to balance interests of the state, society, and each individual.\nIn 2001 Buchanan received an honorary doctoral degree from Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00EDn, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, for his contribution to economics.\nThe \"New York Times\" commented that the Nobel Prize-winning economist who championed public choice theory influenced a \"generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes, and the size of government\".\nInfluences.\nHe was influenced by Frank Knight, Knut Wicksell, and by Ludwig von Mises. He has influenced Elinor Ostrom.\nPersonal life and death.\nHe was married to Ann Bakke from 1945 until his death in 2013. They had no children. Buchanan died on January 9, 2013, in Blacksburg, Virginia. He was 93 and he died from natural causes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["economist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":70},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Economics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Economics","offset":223},{"uri":"Murfreesboro%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Murfreesboro","offset":324},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":338},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":371},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":384},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":408},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":417},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":478},{"uri":"University_of_Tennessee","surface_form":"University of Tennessee","offset":508},{"uri":"State_Teachers_College%2C_Murfreesboro","surface_form":"State Teachers College, Murfreesboro","offset":544},{"uri":"Political_economy","surface_form":"political economy","offset":641},{"uri":"Constitutional_economics","surface_form":"constitutional economics","offset":775},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":916},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":1121},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":1285},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":1406},{"uri":"Guatemala_City","surface_form":"Guatemala City","offset":1531},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":1547},{"uri":"New_York_Times","surface_form":"New York Times","offset":1598},{"uri":"Public_choice_theory","surface_form":"public choice theory","offset":1678},{"uri":"Frank_Knight","surface_form":"Frank Knight","offset":1834},{"uri":"Knut_Wicksell","surface_form":"Knut Wicksell","offset":1848},{"uri":"Ludwig_von_Mises","surface_form":"Ludwig von Mises","offset":1870},{"uri":"Elinor_Ostrom","surface_form":"Elinor Ostrom","offset":1906},{"uri":"Blacksburg%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Blacksburg, Virginia","offset":2068}]}
