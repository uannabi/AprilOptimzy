He knew his planet would be destroyed but when he told his leaders, they did not listen try or stop the destruction since they did not believe it was true. So he built a rocket and sent superman to earth so superman would not die when the planet was destroyed.

He was married to Lara Lor-Van.\nHe was played by Marlon Brando in \"Superman\" and by Russell Crowe in \"Man of Steel\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Superman","surface_form":"Superman","offset":36},{"uri":"Artificial_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial intelligence","offset":419},{"uri":"Lara_Lor-Van","surface_form":"Lara Lor-Van","offset":560},{"uri":"Marlon_Brando","surface_form":"Marlon Brando","offset":591},{"uri":"Superman_(1978_movie)","surface_form":"Superman","offset":609},{"uri":"Russell_Crowe","surface_form":"Russell Crowe","offset":626},{"uri":"Man_of_Steel_(movie)","surface_form":"Man of Steel","offset":644}]}
