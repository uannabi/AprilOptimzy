{"id":379441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignosticism","text":"=\"preserve\">Ignosticism is the belief that people should avoid taking a position on the existence of God until the concept of God is defined.\nIgnostics claims that the word \"God\" is meaningless until it is defined. Until one defines \"God\" they might as well be saying \"Fob\".\nThis also means that until you are debating a definition of God that is able to be proven false, you might as well be debating about the word \"Fob\".\nIt is sometimes considered synonymous with theological noncognitivism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":31},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":101},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":115},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":126},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"defined","offset":133},{"uri":"Theological_noncognitivism","surface_form":"theological noncognitivism","offset":467}]}
