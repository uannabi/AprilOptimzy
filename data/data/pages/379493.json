After he finished school at the age of 14, he worked for local post offices for over 45 years until he retired in 1962 at the age of 65. In the 1920s, he also worked as a government communications worker in Korea, which was at the time a colony of Japan.\nAfter returning from Korea, he married Yae Kimura (1904\u20131978) who died at age 74, and changed his name to Jiroemon Kimura, since his wife's family lacked a male heir, and had seven children, five of whom are still living. He lived in Ky\u014Dtango, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan with his eldest son's widow and grandson's widow.\nAfter his retirement, Kimura worked as a farmer until age 90.\nLongevity.\nKimura, who became the oldest living Japanese man after Tomoji Tanabe's death on 19 June 2009, two months after celebrating his 112th birthday and being the 7th Japanese man to do so, became the oldest living man in the world as well as the oldest man to receive the title as the oldest living man after Americanman Walter Breuning's death on 15 April 2011 (Breuning, who was 30 weeks older, died on 14 April 2011 Montana Time), just four days before celebrating his 114th birthday and becoming the second Japanese man and the 7th man in the world to do so. Later that year, on 26 October, Kimura became the oldest Japanese man ever and the 5th oldest ever in the world after breaking the record of Yukichi Chuganji.\nOn 2 December 2011, upon the death of 115-year-old Chiyono Hasegawa, Kimura became the oldest living person in Japan and the third oldest living person in the world behind Americanwomen Besse Cooper and Dina Manfredini, both of whom died in December 2012, whereafter Kimura also became the oldest living person in the world, and also the oldest man ever after breaking Danish-born Americanman Christian Mortensen's record, and later on 19 April 2013, his 116th birthday, the first and only verified man as well as only the 7th verified person to become at least 116 years old. Less than 5 weeks later, after 113-year-old James Sisnett's death on 23 May, Kimura became the last living man in the world born in the 19th century, after already being the last living Japanese man since 111-year-old Tanekichi Onishi from Hokkaido, who was just a week older than Sisnett, died on 11 September 2011, and even the last living person born in 1897 since Japanesewoman Koto Okubo, who was the oldest living woman, died at age 115 years, 19 days on 12 January 2013.\nAccording to Kimura himself, the sun above him was the secret to his long life, but also that he trained eating until he was only 80 % full, drank alcohol only in moderation and never smoked.\nDeath.\nFrom 11 May 2013, Kimura was hospitalized for pneumonia and later blood-sugar problems and recovered temporarily, but his health continued to decline as his blood-sugar level, urine production and response declined, though until 2.08am the night of 12 June when Kimura died of natural causes aged 116 years, 54 days, as the youngest of only 7 verified people who had become at least 116 years old.
