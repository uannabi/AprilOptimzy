{"id":3795,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road","text":"A road is a piece of land which connects two or more places. Usually, a road has been made easy to travel on, for example by removing trees and stones so the ground is more level. Although many roads are made of gravel and dirt, some are paved with concrete or brick<nowiki/>s or stone<nowiki/>s.\nPeople have been making roads for a long time. Roman roads in Britain and the Inca road system are famous. Transport by boats on waterway<nowiki/>s was usually easier and faster than transport by road. In the industrial revolution, the railway was invented. A railway is a special type of road, using railway tracks. Roads are now usually made for wheeled vehicles, like cars, to travel on.\nWhen traffic congestion becomes a frequent problem, the road may be made wider or other roads built.\nRoad building and care is usually paid for by taxes. Some roads are toll roads, where people pay to use the road.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":99},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":134},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":144},{"uri":"Level","surface_form":"level","offset":173},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":212},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"dirt","offset":223},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":249},{"uri":"Brick","surface_form":"brick","offset":261},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":280},{"uri":"Roman_roads_in_Britain","surface_form":"Roman roads in Britain","offset":344},{"uri":"Inca_road_system","surface_form":"Inca road system","offset":375},{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"Transport","offset":404},{"uri":"Waterway","surface_form":"waterway","offset":426},{"uri":"Industrial_revolution","surface_form":"industrial revolution","offset":506},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":533},{"uri":"Railway_track","surface_form":"railway track","offset":598},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":645},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":668},{"uri":"Traffic_congestion","surface_form":"traffic congestion","offset":693},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":835},{"uri":"Toll_road","surface_form":"toll road","offset":857}]}
