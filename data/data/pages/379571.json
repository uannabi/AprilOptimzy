{"id":379571,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackgate_Prison","text":"=\"preserve\">Blackgate Prison is a fictional prison where normal prisoners are taken into jail. The prison is off the coast of Gotham Bay which is like Alcatraz Island. In other cases the prison is in the city such as in \"The Dark Knight Rises\".\nBlackgate Prison is unlike Arkham Asylum, in which many people like Rupert Thorne, Carmine Falcone, The Penguin, Ventriloquist, and Victor Zsasz are held. The prison was in \"The Dark Knight Rises\" when Bane used the Batmobile to shoot the prison open to free all the prisoners to occupy Gotham.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gotham_City","surface_form":"Gotham Bay","offset":126},{"uri":"Alcatraz_Island","surface_form":"Alcatraz Island","offset":151},{"uri":"The_Dark_Knight_Rises","surface_form":"The Dark Knight Rises","offset":221},{"uri":"Arkham_Asylum","surface_form":"Arkham Asylum","offset":272},{"uri":"Rupert_Thorne","surface_form":"Rupert Thorne","offset":313},{"uri":"Carmine_Falcone","surface_form":"Carmine Falcone","offset":328},{"uri":"Penguin_(comics)","surface_form":"The Penguin","offset":345},{"uri":"Ventriloquist_(comics)","surface_form":"Ventriloquist","offset":358},{"uri":"Victor_Zsasz","surface_form":"Victor Zsasz","offset":377},{"uri":"Batmobile","surface_form":"Batmobile","offset":461}]}
