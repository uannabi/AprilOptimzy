{"id":379666,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebechet","text":"=\"preserve\">In the Ancient Egyptian religion, Kebechet (also known as Qebehet, Kebhut, Kebehut, Qebehut, and Kabechet) was the goddess of freshness and purification. She was known as the \"wandering goddess\" or the \"lost child\". She was the daughter of Anubis and his wife Anput and was thought to help her father in his role as the god of embalming. She was particularly associated with embalming fluid used during mummification.\nKebechet was often depicted as a snake, sometimes with a body of stars. She was also depicted as a woman with the head of a snake. Sometimes she takes the form of an ostrich, linking her to the goddess of Ma\u00B4at who represented justice and balance in the universe and was involved in the judgement of the dead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Egyptian_religion","surface_form":"Ancient Egyptian religion","offset":19},{"uri":"Fresh","surface_form":"freshness","offset":138},{"uri":"Purification","surface_form":"purification","offset":152},{"uri":"Anubis","surface_form":"Anubis","offset":252},{"uri":"Anput","surface_form":"Anput","offset":272},{"uri":"Embalming","surface_form":"embalming","offset":339},{"uri":"Mummification","surface_form":"mummification","offset":415},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":463},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":495},{"uri":"Ostrich","surface_form":"ostrich","offset":596},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":657},{"uri":"Balance","surface_form":"balance","offset":669},{"uri":"Judgement","surface_form":"judgement","offset":717}]}
