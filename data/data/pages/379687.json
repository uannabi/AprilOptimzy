{"id":379687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pukutiwara","text":"Walter Pukutiwara (c. 1930 \u2013 10 November 2004) was an Aboriginal artist from central Australia. He crafted traditional tools, such as spears and spear-throwers, and wooden sculptures, known in Western Desert languages as '. He made these by carving the wood and then engraving patterns (') into its surface with a burning wire. This technique is called pokerwork. The patterns engraved into the objects depict ', spiritual stories about creation ancestors from the Dreamtime. The National Museum of Australia contains many examples of Walter's works.\nWalter was born just south of Ulu\u1E5Fu, some time around 1930. The place where he was born is associated with the, and so the ' (brushtail possum) is his personal totem. Walter grew up living a traditional way of life in the bush with his family. When he was a young man, he went to live at the mission in Ernabella, South Australia. He worked there with sheep, as a shepherd and shearer. He got married to Topsy Tjulyata, and the couple moved to Ama\u1E6Fa. During the 1980s, Walter served as the Pitjantjatjara representative on the Aboriginal Arts Board (AAB). He lobbied the board for money to support art and crafts in Ama\u1E6Fa. As a result, the craft centre at Ama\u1E6Fa was established in February 1981.\nLater in 1981, Walter and Topsy went to Ulu\u1E5Fu and set up a tent at the base of Ulu\u1E5Fu. From there they sold their ' works to tourists for over two weeks. They did this trip with other artists from Ama\u1E6Fa, including Tony Tjamiwa and Pulya Taylor, and their friends Peter Yates and Patricia D'Arango. In 1983, this group travelled around to artist communities in the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. This was to discuss the idea of setting up a new craft centre at Ulu\u1E5Fu that would sell artworks from around the region to tourists. The couple moved to Mu\u1E6Fitjulu so that they could help set up Ma\u1E5Fuku Arts, in 1984. Water and Topsy were some of the first artists for the centre. Walter served on the organisation's Governing Committee for 20 years, including as chairman many times.\nFrom 1976 to 1978, Walter also served as a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board. In the early 1990s, he helped to set up A\u1E49angu Tours, the main tour operator in Ulu\u1E5Fu-Kata Tju\u1E6Fa National Park. His daughter, Rene Kulitja, and son-in-law, Richard Kulitja, took over the company when Walter retired. Walter died on 10 November 2004, in Alice Springs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circa","surface_form":"c.","offset":19},{"uri":"Aboriginal_art","surface_form":"Aboriginal art","offset":54},{"uri":"Central_Australia","surface_form":"central Australia","offset":77},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":99},{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":134},{"uri":"Spear-thrower","surface_form":"spear-thrower","offset":145},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":172},{"uri":"Western_Desert_cultural_bloc","surface_form":"Western Desert","offset":193},{"uri":"Wood_carving","surface_form":"carving","offset":241},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"engraving","offset":267},{"uri":"Pyrography","surface_form":"pokerwork","offset":353},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":413},{"uri":"Creation_story","surface_form":"creation","offset":437},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":446},{"uri":"Dreamtime","surface_form":"Dreamtime","offset":465},{"uri":"National_Museum_of_Australia","surface_form":"National Museum of Australia","offset":480},{"uri":"Brushtail_possum","surface_form":"brushtail possum","offset":677},{"uri":"Totemism","surface_form":"totem","offset":711},{"uri":"The_bush","surface_form":"the bush","offset":769},{"uri":"Mission_(Christianity)","surface_form":"mission","offset":843},{"uri":"Ernabella","surface_form":"Ernabella","offset":854},{"uri":"Shepherd","surface_form":"shepherd","offset":915},{"uri":"Topsy_Tjulyata","surface_form":"Topsy Tjulyata","offset":955},{"uri":"Ama%E1%B9%AFa%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Ama\u1E6Fa","offset":995},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":1041},{"uri":"Tony_Tjamiwa","surface_form":"Tony Tjamiwa","offset":1460},{"uri":"Pulya_Taylor","surface_form":"Pulya Taylor","offset":1477},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":1610},{"uri":"Mu%E1%B9%AFitjulu%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Mu\u1E6Fitjulu","offset":1807},{"uri":"Chairperson","surface_form":"chairman","offset":2016},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu-Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa_National_Park","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu-Kata Tju\u1E6Fa National Park","offset":2224},{"uri":"Rene_Kulitja","surface_form":"Rene Kulitja","offset":2270},{"uri":"Alice_Springs","surface_form":"Alice Springs","offset":2396}]}
