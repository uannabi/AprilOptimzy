{"id":379690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archedictyon","text":"e=\"preserve\">Archedictyon (plural = archedictya) is the name of a hypothetical scheme of wing venation of the common ancestor of all winged insects.\nDescription.\n...the primitive original vein network [of] the wings of many of the most ancient insect fossils; the complex network of irregular veinlets between the veins in the outer [three-quarters] of both wings, including the anal lobe.\nAccording to a 1999 paper on the evolution of flght in Palaeoptera the cross veins of some Palaeodictyoptera may be an adaptive feature.\nStructure.\nThe archedictyon is believed to have contained between six and eight longitudinal veins, but current understanding of the design is based on a combination of fossil data and speculation.\nLiving species.\nIn extant insects, the term implies a retention of primitive characteristics but \"not necessarily a simplicity of form\". Modern insects with wings to which the term \"archedictyon\" has been applied include the termite \"Mastotermes darwiniensis\" from Australia and the praying mantis \"Orthodera novaezealandiae\". from New Zealand.\nThe term is also used in the discussion of phasmids. Then it refers to a network of non-directional veins in the costal region of the wing or in the elytron.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothetical","offset":66},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":89},{"uri":"Vein","surface_form":"venation","offset":94},{"uri":"Common_ancestor","surface_form":"common ancestor","offset":110},{"uri":"Pterygota","surface_form":"winged insects","offset":133},{"uri":"Palaeoptera","surface_form":"Palaeoptera","offset":445},{"uri":"Adaptive","surface_form":"adaptive","offset":509},{"uri":"Veins","surface_form":"veins","offset":620},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":696},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":703},{"uri":"Extant_taxon","surface_form":"extant","offset":744},{"uri":"Mastotermes_darwiniensis","surface_form":"Mastotermes darwiniensis","offset":959},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":990},{"uri":"Praying_mantis","surface_form":"praying mantis","offset":1008},{"uri":"Orthodera_novaezealandiae","surface_form":"Orthodera novaezealandiae","offset":1024},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":1057},{"uri":"Phasmid","surface_form":"phasmid","offset":1113},{"uri":"Elytron","surface_form":"elytron","offset":1219}]}
