{"id":379765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_bond","text":"A sigma bond (\u03C3 bond) is a type of chemical bond. It is the strongest one of the covalent type. In a sigma bond, the atomic orbitals from two atoms which are nearby go one on top of each other. This is different from a pi bond where they touch sideways. This is why a sigma bond is stronger. Sigma bonds can involve s, p, d or f orbitals. They must however be of the right symmetry to be able to form the bond.\nSince the \u03C3 bond is strong, the bonding orbital is low in energy. This also means that the antibonding orbital \u03C3* is high in energy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"chemical bond","offset":35},{"uri":"Covalent","surface_form":"covalent","offset":81},{"uri":"Atomic_orbital","surface_form":"atomic orbital","offset":117},{"uri":"Pi_bond","surface_form":"pi bond","offset":219},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":373},{"uri":"Molecular_orbital","surface_form":"bonding orbital","offset":443}]}
