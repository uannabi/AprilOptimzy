{"id":379829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham_(wrestler)","text":"Eldridge Wayne Coleman (born June 7, 1943 in Phoenix, Arizona) is a retired American professional wrestler of part Arkansas Cherokee descent who is best known for his highly dramatic and charismatic style of wrestling which he perfected with World Wrestling Federation under the ring name, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham. He is also an amateur fine artist. Graham is widely acknowledged as the individual who revolutionized modern American pro wrestling by combining it with bodybuilding, so that today professional wrestlers without bodybuilders' physiques have become a rarity.\nDuring the steroid allegations involving WWE owner Vince McMahon Jr. in 1992, Graham went on The Phil Donahue Show, admitting that he was avid user of steroids and blamed the WWF for his addiction although these drugs were not yet illegal in the 1970s. The incident caused a rift between Graham and McMahon which lasted for over ten years.\nWWE Hall of Fame.\nHe was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2004 by Triple H. He later announced that he wanted his name removed from the WWE Hall of Fame because of his general dissatisfaction with the way professional wrestling had developed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"June_7","surface_form":"June 7","offset":29},{"uri":"1943","surface_form":"1943","offset":37},{"uri":"Phoenix%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Phoenix, Arizona","offset":45},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":242},{"uri":"Steroid","surface_form":"steroid","offset":725},{"uri":"WWE_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"WWE Hall of Fame","offset":957},{"uri":"Triple_H","surface_form":"Triple H","offset":985}]}
