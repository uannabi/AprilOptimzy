Hanlon of Scranton, Pennsylvania, US. According to his friend Joseph Bigler, Hanlon first used it as part of something he wrote for a compilation of various jokes related to Murphy's law. The compilation book was published in 1980 titled \"Murphy's Law Book Two, More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong\". The name was inspired by Occam's razor.\nThere are many similar sayings. One example is \"Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence\", which has been attributed to science fiction author Robert Heinlein\u2019s short story \"Logic of Empire\" in 1941 and erroneously to Napoleon Bonaparte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Intention","surface_form":"intentions","offset":74},{"uri":"Scranton%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Scranton, Pennsylvania","offset":189},{"uri":"Compilation","surface_form":"compilation","offset":313},{"uri":"Murphy%27s_law","surface_form":"Murphy's law","offset":353},{"uri":"Occam%27s_razor","surface_form":"Occam's razor","offset":501},{"uri":"Incompetence","surface_form":"incompetence","offset":626},{"uri":"Robert_A._Heinlein","surface_form":"Robert Heinlein\u2019s","offset":693},{"uri":"Napoleon_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Napoleon Bonaparte","offset":768}]}
