{"id":379994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood%2C_Nova_Scotia","text":"Greenwood is a village in the western part of Kings County in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley.\nHistory.\nGreenwood was a small hamlet south of the Dominion Atlantic Railway's Kingston Station. In 1942, the Royal Air Force created the RAF Station Greenwood and built an aerodrome on nearby farmland for a facility to train aircrew under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The Royal Canadian Air Force took over the facility in 1944. It was renamed RCAF Station Greenwood, a name it kept until the February 1, 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces. Then the airfield and related facilities were renamed CFB Greenwood.\nDuring the 1970s\u20132000s, the village of Greenwood grew in population, as many other air force bases in eastern Canada closed and their aircraft and personnel moved to CFB Greenwood.\nNow, the village and base's combined population is about 4,500. The village has many services and is also the location of the Greenwood Mall, the largest shopping centre in the western part of the Annapolis Valley","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":15},{"uri":"Kings_County%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Kings County","offset":46},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":62},{"uri":"Annapolis_Valley","surface_form":"Annapolis Valley","offset":76},{"uri":"Hamlet","surface_form":"hamlet","offset":125},{"uri":"Dominion_Atlantic_Railway","surface_form":"Dominion Atlantic Railway","offset":145},{"uri":"Kingston%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Kingston Station","offset":173},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":204},{"uri":"Aerodrome","surface_form":"aerodrome","offset":267},{"uri":"British_Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan","surface_form":"British Commonwealth Air Training Plan","offset":338},{"uri":"Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Canadian Air Force","offset":382},{"uri":"Canadian_Forces","surface_form":"Canadian Forces","offset":539},{"uri":"CFB_Greenwood","surface_form":"CFB Greenwood","offset":610}]}
