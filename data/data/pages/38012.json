It is a vocal sound which a person makes when something is funny, like a joke, or a tickle.\nSometimes people laugh when they are not happy. When people are ashamed or embarrassed, sometimes they react by laughing.\nThere are different ways to laugh. A person can laugh using mostly their voice, mostly their throat, or mostly their nose.\nYou can write a laugh in different ways. Some people write \"ha ha ha\", or \"he he he\", or \"hehe\". If they are on the internet, they also use \"LOL\". \"LOL\" does not sound like a laugh, but it stands for Laughing Out Loud.\nHuman babies first laugh at the age of around three or four months, usually as an expression of surprise.
