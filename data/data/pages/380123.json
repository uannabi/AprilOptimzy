{"id":380123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Current","text":"=\"preserve\">The Canary Current is a wind-driven surface current that is part of the North Atlantic Gyre. This eastern boundary current branches south from the North Atlantic Current and flows southwest about as far as Senegal where it turns west and later joins the Atlantic North Equatorial Current. The current is named after the Canary Islands. The archipelago (group of islands) partially blocks the flow of the Canary Current (Gyory, 2007).\nThis wide and slow-moving current is thought to have been exploited in the early Phoenician navigation and settlement along the coast of western Morocco. The ancient Phoenicians not only exploited numerous fisheries within this current zone, but also established a factory at Iles Purpuraires off present day Essaouira for extracting a Tyrian purple dye from a marine gastropod murex species (Hogan, 2007).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean_current","surface_form":"Current","offset":174},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":218},{"uri":"Canary_Islands","surface_form":"Canary Islands","offset":332},{"uri":"Exploitation","surface_form":"exploited","offset":504},{"uri":"Phoenicia","surface_form":"Phoenician","offset":527},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":538},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":591},{"uri":"Purple","surface_form":"Tyrian purple","offset":782},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":796},{"uri":"Gastropoda","surface_form":"gastropod","offset":814}]}
