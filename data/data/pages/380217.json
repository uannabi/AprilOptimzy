{"id":380217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_apartment_at_Versailles","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Queen's apartment at Versailles (Fr: \"Grand appartement de la reine\") consists of several rooms: The Queen's Bedchamber; The Queen's Private Cabinets; The Room of the Queen's Gentlemen; The Queen's Antechamber; The Room of the Queen's Guard. The apartment overlooks the Parterre du Midi, and parallels the King's Apartment. When the King's Apartment was abandoned at the end of Louis XIV's reign, the Queens continued to occupy the Queen's Apartment.\nThe Queen's Antechamber.\nThe royal couple ate in \"The Queen's Antechamber\". This was a public event. Louis XVI and Antoinette sat with their backs to the fireplace. Only the royal family could sit at the table. The duchesses, princesses, and others of great rank were allowed to sit on stools facing the royals. Others of high rank stood.\nLouis XIV enjoyed the dinner ritual. Louis XV preferred more private suppers. Louis XVI ate well. Antoinette was bored. A witness reports that: \"The Queen sat on the King\u2019s left. They had their backs turned to the fireplace [...] The King ate with a good appetite, but the Queen did not remove her gloves and did not use her serviette (napkin), which was very wrong of her\". To ease her boredom, the Queen asked for music at every meal. She had a platform set up for this purpose.\nThis room was once The Room of the Queen's Guard. In the 1680s, the room was sometimes used as a theatre. Royal virtues are illustrated in the ceiling paintings of ancient heroines by Vignon and Paillet. Portraits of Louis XVI's aunts by Madame Labille-Guiard are part of the decor. Above the doors are works by Madeline de Boulogne dated 1675.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parterre_du_Midi","surface_form":"Parterre du Midi","offset":288},{"uri":"King%27s_Apartment","surface_form":"King's Apartment","offset":324},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":396},{"uri":"Duchess","surface_form":"duchess","offset":684},{"uri":"Princess","surface_form":"princess","offset":695},{"uri":"Stool","surface_form":"stool","offset":755},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":808},{"uri":"Louis_XV","surface_form":"Louis XV","offset":845},{"uri":"Louis_XVI","surface_form":"Louis XVI","offset":886},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":1386},{"uri":"Heroine","surface_form":"heroine","offset":1461},{"uri":"Vignon","surface_form":"Vignon","offset":1473},{"uri":"Paillet","surface_form":"Paillet","offset":1484},{"uri":"Madame_Labille-Guiard","surface_form":"Madame Labille-Guiard","offset":1527},{"uri":"Madeline_de_Boulogne","surface_form":"Madeline de Boulogne","offset":1601}]}
