{"id":380460,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(UK_universities)","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Golden Triangle is an unofficial name for a set of leading universities in the southern English cities of Oxford, Cambridge and London.\nThe University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge ('Oxbridge') form two corners of the triangle. The third is London: Imperial College, University College London, King's College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). The last three are independent colleges of the University of London. The universities within the triangle (with the exception of the LSE) attract the highest research incomes of all British universities.\nHowever, it has been argued that it should be replaced by a term like \"Brilliant Diamond\", to include the University of Manchester. The figures below suggest that both the universities of Manchester and Edinburgh belong in the same class. That might better reflect the geographical spectrum of the UK higher education.\nOxford, Cambridge and some of the London institutions collaborate in research. The Global Medical Excellence Cluster (GMEC) for biomedical research was formed by Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London, King's College London and Queen Mary University of London.\nResearch income.\na Excludes the School of Pharmacy, which merged with UCL in January 2012; the School of Pharmacy had a research income of \u00A38,130,000 in the period.\nbThe LSE has a much lower research income, perhaps explained by its concentration on social science research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":124},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":132},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":146},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"University of Oxford","offset":158},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":187},{"uri":"Oxbridge","surface_form":"Oxbridge","offset":213},{"uri":"Imperial_College","surface_form":"Imperial College","offset":279},{"uri":"University_College_London","surface_form":"University College London","offset":297},{"uri":"King%27s_College_London","surface_form":"King's College London","offset":324},{"uri":"London_School_of_Economics","surface_form":"London School of Economics and Political Science","offset":354},{"uri":"University_of_London","surface_form":"University of London","offset":457},{"uri":"University_of_Manchester","surface_form":"University of Manchester","offset":720},{"uri":"University_of_Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":802},{"uri":"University_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":817},{"uri":"Queen_Mary%2C_University_of_London","surface_form":"Queen Mary University of London","offset":1185},{"uri":"UCL_School_of_Pharmacy","surface_form":"School of Pharmacy","offset":1250}]}
