{"id":380603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophile","text":"In chemistry, an electrophile is a molecule or an atom that is happy to take electrons from another one. Many electrophiles have a positive charge. They are also called Lewis acids. Some examples of electrophiles are molecules where the atoms have a big difference in electronegativity, like HCl or a carbonyl, or also oxidizing agents.\nElectrophiles get attacked by a nucleophile, which is the opposite kind of molecule. This happens for example in addition reactions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":3},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":35},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":50},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":77},{"uri":"Lewis_acid","surface_form":"Lewis acid","offset":169},{"uri":"Electronegativity","surface_form":"electronegativity","offset":268},{"uri":"HCl","surface_form":"HCl","offset":292},{"uri":"Carbonyl","surface_form":"carbonyl","offset":301},{"uri":"Oxidizing_agent","surface_form":"oxidizing agent","offset":319},{"uri":"Nucleophile","surface_form":"nucleophile","offset":369},{"uri":"Addition_reaction","surface_form":"addition reaction","offset":450}]}
