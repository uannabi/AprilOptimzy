Who \"punishes\" those (he finds offensive) in particular, by flaying his victims alive. On his trail is Heidi, a junkie prostitute, who survived one of his brutal attacks and now strives for revenge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Independent_movie","surface_form":"independent movie","offset":20},{"uri":"Splatter_movie","surface_form":"splatter","offset":39},{"uri":"Slasher_movie","surface_form":"slasher","offset":52},{"uri":"Ted_Raimi","surface_form":"Ted Raimi","offset":84},{"uri":"Traci_Lords","surface_form":"Traci Lords","offset":95},{"uri":"Ricki_Lake","surface_form":"Ricki Lake","offset":108},{"uri":"Richard_Schiff","surface_form":"Richard Schiff","offset":123},{"uri":"Moonlighting","surface_form":"moonlights","offset":239},{"uri":"Skid_row","surface_form":"skid row","offset":255},{"uri":"Prostitute","surface_form":"hooker","offset":314},{"uri":"Punish","surface_form":"punish","offset":401},{"uri":"Flayed","surface_form":"flaying","offset":456},{"uri":"Substance_dependence","surface_form":"junkie","offset":508},{"uri":"Prostitute","surface_form":"prostitute","offset":515}]}
