{"id":380813,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_shield","text":"The \"Greek shield\" of Ancient Greece was called a hoplon or aspis. It was from this word that hoplite (a Greek soldier) is derived.\nA hoplon was a deeply-dished shield made of wood. Some shields had a thin sheet of bronze on the outer face. This was placed just around the rim. In some periods, the shield was decorated. At other times, it remained undecorated. These large shields were designed for a mass of hoplites to push forward into the opposing army, and it was their most essential equipment. The shield was carried in the left hand. It was used by Spartans as a weapon of attack.\nProbably the most famous decoration is the Spartan. This was a capital lambda (\u039B). From the late 5th century BC onward, Athenian hoplites usually used the Little Owl (Athena's sacred bird). The shields of Theban hoplites were sometimes decorated with a sphinx, or the club of Herakles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":22},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":215},{"uri":"Sparta","surface_form":"Spartans","offset":558},{"uri":"Sparta","surface_form":"Spartan","offset":633},{"uri":"Lambda","surface_form":"lambda","offset":661},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athenian","offset":710},{"uri":"Hoplite","surface_form":"hoplite","offset":719},{"uri":"Owl","surface_form":"Owl","offset":752},{"uri":"Thebes","surface_form":"Theban","offset":795},{"uri":"Hoplite","surface_form":"hoplite","offset":802},{"uri":"Sphinx","surface_form":"sphinx","offset":843},{"uri":"Herakles","surface_form":"Herakles","offset":866}]}
