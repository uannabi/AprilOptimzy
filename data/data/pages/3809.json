{"id":3809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van","text":"A van is a type of vehicle. A van can carry either goods or people. A van is usually bigger than the regular sized car. Panel vans (= vans whose cargo space has no side windows) are used for deliveries and carrying goods. These usually have large cargo space and few windows. A van which is used to carry people is often called a \"minibus\". It can usually carry many people, sometimes up to a total of 15.\nMany companies make vans, including: Chevrolet, Daihatsu, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen.\nA minivan is smaller and usually carries up to seven people.\nYou may usually drive a van with the same driver's license as an ordinary car, but the heaviest and largest vans may require a truck licence.\nThe demand for minivans is dwindling due to the introduction of crossovers. However, some companies still make minivans. The most popular minivans are the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":19},{"uri":"Goods","surface_form":"goods","offset":51},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":115},{"uri":"Minibus","surface_form":"minibus","offset":331},{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":443},{"uri":"Daihatsu","surface_form":"Daihatsu","offset":454},{"uri":"Dodge","surface_form":"Dodge","offset":464},{"uri":"Fiat","surface_form":"Fiat","offset":471},{"uri":"Ford_Motor_Company","surface_form":"Ford","offset":477},{"uri":"GMC","surface_form":"GMC","offset":483},{"uri":"Honda","surface_form":"Honda","offset":488},{"uri":"Hyundai","surface_form":"Hyundai","offset":495},{"uri":"Isuzu","surface_form":"Isuzu","offset":504},{"uri":"Mazda","surface_form":"Mazda","offset":511},{"uri":"Mercedes-Benz","surface_form":"Mercedes-Benz","offset":518},{"uri":"Mitsubishi","surface_form":"Mitsubishi","offset":533},{"uri":"Nissan","surface_form":"Nissan","offset":545},{"uri":"Subaru","surface_form":"Subaru","offset":553},{"uri":"Suzuki","surface_form":"Suzuki","offset":561},{"uri":"Toyota","surface_form":"Toyota","offset":569},{"uri":"Vauxhall","surface_form":"Vauxhall","offset":577},{"uri":"Volkswagen","surface_form":"Volkswagen","offset":591},{"uri":"Driver%27s_license","surface_form":"driver's license","offset":706},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":791},{"uri":"Crossover","surface_form":"crossover","offset":870},{"uri":"Toyota_Sienna","surface_form":"Toyota Sienna","offset":961},{"uri":"Honda_Odyssey","surface_form":"Honda Odyssey","offset":979}]}
