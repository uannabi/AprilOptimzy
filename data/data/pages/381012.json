Joseph Kony founded it in 1987, in the north of Uganda, to fight against the government, headed by president Yoweri Museveni. The group operates in Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in South Sudan. It wants to establish an independent state which is governed by laws based on the Ten Commandments. There is an insurgency called Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, which was basically caused by the group. Uganda was able to evict the group, but it continues to terrorize the population in the other countries where it is active. In conjunction with the conflict, the group is also said to have committed several grave abuses of human rights.It has been accused of widespread human rights violations, including murder, abduction, mutilation, child-sex slavery and forcing children to participate in hostilities.\nThe group is led by Joseph Kony, who proclaims himself the spokesman of God and a spirit medium. Since 1987, Kony is believed to have recruited between 60,000 and 100,000 child soldiers and displaced around 2 million people throughout central Africa. The LRA is one of the foreign organizations designated as terrorist by the United States, and its leadership is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":45},{"uri":"New_religious_movement","surface_form":"new religious movement","offset":71},{"uri":"Joseph_Kony","surface_form":"Joseph Kony","offset":95},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":143},{"uri":"Yoweri_Museveni","surface_form":"Yoweri Museveni","offset":204},{"uri":"Central_African_Republic","surface_form":"Central African Republic","offset":243},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":273},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"South Sudan","offset":313},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":408},{"uri":"Insurgency","surface_form":"insurgency","offset":438},{"uri":"Lord%27s_Resistance_Army_insurgency","surface_form":"Lord's Resistance Army insurgency","offset":456},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":802},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":837},{"uri":"Kidnapping","surface_form":"abduction","offset":845},{"uri":"Mutilation","surface_form":"mutilation","offset":856},{"uri":"Sexual_slavery","surface_form":"child-sex slavery","offset":868},{"uri":"Military_use_of_children","surface_form":"forcing children to participate in hostilities","offset":890},{"uri":"Joseph_Kony","surface_form":"Joseph Kony","offset":958},{"uri":"Spirit_medium","surface_form":"spirit medium","offset":1020},{"uri":"Central_Africa","surface_form":"central Africa","offset":1173},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1264},{"uri":"International_Criminal_Court","surface_form":"International Criminal Court","offset":1315},{"uri":"War_crimes","surface_form":"war crimes","offset":1348},{"uri":"Crimes_against_humanity","surface_form":"crimes against humanity","offset":1363}]}
