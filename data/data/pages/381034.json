The painting may have been intended for her apartment at Versailles or for her chateau at Bellevue.\nShe allegedly posed for the painting. It is more likely Venus was a product of Boucher's imagination. The technical dexterity evident in the painting is the principal charm of Rococo art.\n\"Boucher's success in communicating the charm and sensuality of the nude lies in his mastery of color and fluid brushstrokes... The painting exemplifies the rococo love of asymmetric lines and sinuous curves, artfully arranged to seduce both the eye and the mind of the beholder.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Painting"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Boucher","offset":63},{"uri":"Mme_de_Pompadour","surface_form":"Mme de Pompadour","offset":248},{"uri":"Versailles","surface_form":"Versailles","offset":364}]}
