{"id":38107,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball team who play on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. The club is in the Central Division of the American League. They are managed by Rick Renteria since 2017.\nThe White Sox won the 2005 World Series sweeping the Houston Astros in 4 games. They won the World Series before in 1906 and 1917 before going into an 88-year championship drought.\nThe Chicago White Sox finished 2006 with a 90-72 record, four games out of first place after taking two of three from the Minnesota Twins in the final week of the season at the Metrodome in Minneapolis.\nThe Sox began major league play in 1901. They took their name from the original name of the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs had first been known as the Chicago White Stockings. By 1901, they were being called the Colts. That allowed the new American League team to adopt the old National League team colors.\nThe Sox first played at South Side Park. In mid-season 1910, they opened Comiskey Park, which was just a few blocks north of South Side Park. They played at Comiskey for over 80 years. In 1991 they opened a park now known as Guaranteed Rate Field, just across the street to the south of Comiskey Park, and have played their home games there ever since.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":41},{"uri":"South_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"South Side","offset":84},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":98},{"uri":"American_League_Central","surface_form":"Central Division","offset":136},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":160},{"uri":"Manager_(baseball)","surface_form":"managed","offset":186},{"uri":"Rick_Renteria","surface_form":"Rick Renteria","offset":197},{"uri":"Houston_Astros","surface_form":"Houston Astros","offset":276},{"uri":"Minnesota_Twins","surface_form":"Minnesota Twins","offset":526},{"uri":"Metrodome","surface_form":"Metrodome","offset":581},{"uri":"Chicago_Cubs","surface_form":"Chicago Cubs","offset":699},{"uri":"South_Side_Park","surface_form":"South Side Park","offset":930},{"uri":"Comiskey_Park","surface_form":"Comiskey Park","offset":979},{"uri":"Guaranteed_Rate_Field","surface_form":"Guaranteed Rate Field","offset":1131}]}
