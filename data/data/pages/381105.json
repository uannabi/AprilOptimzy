{"id":381105,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoplastid","text":"The kinetoplastids are a group of single-cell flagellate eukaryotes. They include a number of parasites responsible for serious diseases in humans and other animals. There are also forms found in soil and aquatic environments. They are members of the phylum Euglenozoa.\nTheir main distinguishing feature is the presence of a kinetoplast, a DNA-containing granule inside the single mitochondrion at the base of the cell's flagella (the basal body).\nThe kinetoplastids were first defined by Honigberg in 1961 as the flagellate order Kinetoplastida. They are traditionally divided into the biflagellate Bodonidae and uniflagellate Trypanosomatidae.\nThe Trypanosomatidae includes several genera which are exclusively parasitic. \"Trypanosoma brucei\" causes Sleeping sickness; \"Trypanosoma cruzi\" causes Chagas disease, \"Leishmania\" causes leishmaniasis, \"Crithidia\" is parasitic on insects, and \"Cryptobia\" is an ectoparasite on the gills of fish.\n\"Bodo\" is typical of the free-living Bodonids, and includes various species which feed on bacteria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flagellate","surface_form":"flagellate","offset":46},{"uri":"Eukaryotes","surface_form":"eukaryotes","offset":57},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":94},{"uri":"Euglenozoa","surface_form":"Euglenozoa","offset":258},{"uri":"Kinetoplast","surface_form":"kinetoplast","offset":325},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":340},{"uri":"Mitochondrion","surface_form":"mitochondrion","offset":381},{"uri":"Basal_body","surface_form":"basal body","offset":435},{"uri":"Bodonidae","surface_form":"Bodonidae","offset":600},{"uri":"Trypanosomatidae","surface_form":"Trypanosomatidae","offset":628},{"uri":"Trypanosoma_brucei","surface_form":"Trypanosoma brucei","offset":725},{"uri":"Sleeping_sickness","surface_form":"Sleeping sickness","offset":752},{"uri":"Trypanosoma_cruzi","surface_form":"Trypanosoma cruzi","offset":772},{"uri":"Chagas_disease","surface_form":"Chagas disease","offset":798},{"uri":"Leishmania","surface_form":"Leishmania","offset":815},{"uri":"Leishmaniasis","surface_form":"leishmaniasis","offset":834},{"uri":"Crithidia","surface_form":"Crithidia","offset":850},{"uri":"Cryptobia","surface_form":"Cryptobia","offset":891},{"uri":"Ectoparasite","surface_form":"ectoparasite","offset":908},{"uri":"Gills","surface_form":"gills","offset":928},{"uri":"Bodo_(genus)","surface_form":"Bodo","offset":944},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":1033}]}
