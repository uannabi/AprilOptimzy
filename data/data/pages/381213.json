{"id":381213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilacs_and_Roses","text":"\"Lilacs and Roses\" is an oil painting on canvas by \u00C9douard Manet. It was one of his late works, painted in 1883. It measures 54 \u00D7 45 cm. It is in a private collection. The painting is a development of the small vase of roses on the bar in Manet's \"The Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00E8re.\"\nMany of Manet's later works offered a small still life in the lower left hand corner of the picture. The flowers present a \"cross\" shape that is broken by a diagonal line through the center. The brushwork is exceptional. The picture is one of the masterpieces of Manet's later years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oil_painting","surface_form":"oil painting","offset":25},{"uri":"%C3%89douard_Manet","surface_form":"\u00C9douard Manet","offset":51},{"uri":"The_Bar_at_the_Folies-Berg%C3%A8re","surface_form":"The Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00E8re","offset":248}]}
