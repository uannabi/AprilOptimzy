{"id":381286,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_equation","text":"Here, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of A and B. \"x\" and \"y\" depend on which step is rate-determining. If the reaction mechanism is a very simple one, where A and B hit each other and then go to products through one transition state, then \"x\"=\"a\" and \"y\"=\"b\". \"k\" is the rate constant of the reaction. This changes with temperature, pressure and other conditions.\nThe rate equation is a differential equation. If it is integrated, then an equation which tells how the concentration of reagents and products changes with time is found.\nSo, a plot of formula_1 against time \"t\" gives a straight line with a slope of formula_1.\nSometimes, experiments can be made so that the reaction looks like a first-order one. If the concentration of one reagent is kept at the same high value then it can be thought of as a constant. The equation becomes formula_1 where k' is the pseudo-first order rate constant. Then the method above can be used to calculate k'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concentration","surface_form":"concentration","offset":26},{"uri":"Rate-determining_step","surface_form":"rate-determining","offset":89},{"uri":"Reaction_mechanism","surface_form":"reaction mechanism","offset":114},{"uri":"Transition_state","surface_form":"transition state","offset":220},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":324},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":337},{"uri":"Differential_equation","surface_form":"differential equation","offset":391},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integrated","offset":423}]}
