{"id":381477,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Parramatta","text":"The Division of Parramatta is an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was created in 1900 for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the locality of Parramatta. The name \"Parramatta\" is an Aboriginal word for \"the place where the eels lie down\".\nThe division is in the western suburbs of Sydney. It includes Constitution Hill, Dundas Valley, Granville, Harris Park, Holroyd, Mays Hill, North Parramatta, Oatlands, Old Toongabbie, Parramatta, Rosehill, Rydalmere, Telopea, Wentworthville, Westmead and parts of Dundas, Ermington, Guildford, Merrylands, Merrylands West, Northmead, North Rocks, Pendle Hill, South Granville and South Wentworthville.\nThe division lies between Labor voting areas of western Sydney and the Liberal areas on the North Shore. Because of this, any change to the boundary can change the political balance in the seat. For example, in the 2006 boundary change, Parramatta shifted from marginally Labor to marginally Liberal (as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission). Nevertheless, as was expected Julie Owens held the seat for the ALP with an increased majority.\nMembers.\nFrom 1901 to 1921 the Division was represented by Sir Joseph Cook who was the Prime Minister of Australia from 1913-14. There have been several by-elections for Parramatta when the members have resigned. In 1921 Cook resigned to became Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, in 1958 Beale resigned to become Australian Ambassador to the United States, in 1964 Barwick resigned to become Chief Justice of the High Court, Bowen resigned in 1973 to become a judge in the NSW Court of Appeal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":33},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":66},{"uri":"Locality","surface_form":"locality","offset":176},{"uri":"Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Parramatta","offset":188},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":228},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":327},{"uri":"Constitution_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Constitution Hill","offset":347},{"uri":"Dundas_Valley%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Dundas Valley","offset":366},{"uri":"Granville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Granville","offset":381},{"uri":"Harris_Park%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Harris Park","offset":392},{"uri":"Holroyd%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Holroyd","offset":405},{"uri":"Mays_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Mays Hill","offset":414},{"uri":"North_Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"North Parramatta","offset":425},{"uri":"Oatlands%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Oatlands","offset":443},{"uri":"Old_Toongabbie%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Old Toongabbie","offset":453},{"uri":"Rosehill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Rosehill","offset":481},{"uri":"Rydalmere%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Rydalmere","offset":491},{"uri":"Telopea%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Telopea","offset":502},{"uri":"Wentworthville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wentworthville","offset":511},{"uri":"Westmead%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Westmead","offset":527},{"uri":"Dundas%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Dundas","offset":549},{"uri":"Ermington%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Ermington","offset":557},{"uri":"Guildford%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Guildford","offset":568},{"uri":"Merrylands%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Merrylands","offset":579},{"uri":"Merrylands_West%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Merrylands West","offset":591},{"uri":"Northmead%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Northmead","offset":608},{"uri":"North_Rocks%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"North Rocks","offset":619},{"uri":"Pendle_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Pendle Hill","offset":632},{"uri":"South_Granville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"South Granville","offset":645},{"uri":"South_Wentworthville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"South Wentworthville","offset":665},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Labor","offset":713},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Liberal","offset":758},{"uri":"North_Shore_(Sydney)","surface_form":"North Shore","offset":779},{"uri":"Australian_Electoral_Commission","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Commission","offset":1006},{"uri":"Julie_Owens","surface_form":"Julie Owens","offset":1070},{"uri":"Joseph_Cook","surface_form":"Sir Joseph Cook","offset":1195},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Australia","offset":1223},{"uri":"Australian_High_Commissioner_to_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom","offset":1381},{"uri":"Australian_Ambassador_to_the_United_States","surface_form":"Australian Ambassador to the United States","offset":1466},{"uri":"Chief_Justice_of_Australia","surface_form":"Chief Justice","offset":1545},{"uri":"High_Court_of_Australia","surface_form":"High Court","offset":1566},{"uri":"New_South_Wales_Court_of_Appeal","surface_form":"NSW Court of Appeal","offset":1626}]}
