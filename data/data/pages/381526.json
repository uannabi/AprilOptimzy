{"id":381526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid","text":"A carboxylic acid is any molecule that has a COOH group. This group contains a carbonyl (C=O double bond) together with an hydroxyl group (OH) on the same carbon atom. Because it is easy to remove the proton with even a weak base, these compounds are called acids. An example of a carboxylic acid is Acetic acid, which is also known as vinegar.\nCarboxylic acids are found a lot in food. Many types of fat molecules are actually carboxylic acids. For example, chocolate and coconuts have these acids. They are also used a lot in soaps and detergents.\nThe smaller carboxylic acids dissolve in water. The bigger ones dissolve only in organic solvents.\nList.\nThis section lists the first few carboxylic acids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":25},{"uri":"Carbonyl","surface_form":"carbonyl","offset":79},{"uri":"Double_bond","surface_form":"double bond","offset":93},{"uri":"Hydroxyl","surface_form":"hydroxyl","offset":123},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":225},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":258},{"uri":"Acetic_acid","surface_form":"Acetic acid","offset":300},{"uri":"Vinegar","surface_form":"vinegar","offset":336},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":381},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":401},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":459},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":473},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"soap","offset":528},{"uri":"Detergent","surface_form":"detergent","offset":538},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":591},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":639}]}
