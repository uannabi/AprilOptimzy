{"id":382027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity","text":"=\"preserve\">Bodily integrity is the idea that a person's body belongs only to that person, and only he or she should decide what happens to it. Violations of bodily integrity may include rape or murder. It is also sometimes used in debates about euthanasia or circumcision.\nIt is one of the principles of liberalism. It may also be called other names such as \"self-ownership\", \"individual autonomy\" or \"self-determination\".\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also requires protection of physical and mental integrity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"body","offset":57},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"belongs","offset":62},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":187},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":195},{"uri":"Euthanasia","surface_form":"euthanasia","offset":246},{"uri":"Circumcision","surface_form":"circumcision","offset":260},{"uri":"Principle","surface_form":"principle","offset":291},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberalism","offset":305},{"uri":"Individual","surface_form":"individual","offset":378},{"uri":"Autonomy","surface_form":"autonomy","offset":389},{"uri":"Self-determination","surface_form":"self-determination","offset":403},{"uri":"Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","surface_form":"Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","offset":428}]}
