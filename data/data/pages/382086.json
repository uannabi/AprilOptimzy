{"id":382086,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_the_militaries_of_ancient_Greece","text":"Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece was regarded as contributing to morale. The chief example is the Sacred Band of Thebes, a unit said to have been formed of same-sex couples. The Spartan tradition of military heroism has also been explained in light of strong emotional bonds resulting from homosexual relationships. Various ancient Greek sources record incidents of courage in battle and interpret them as motivated by homoerotic bonds.\nSocial aspects.\nPlutarch himself appears to doubt the veracity of these accounts. It is to be doubted if Pammenes actually organized military units along homosexual lines. Eventually the Greek city-states joined Pammenes' views on the most effective order of unit formation. The practice soon proliferated. City-states that had originally frowned upon the idea reversed opinions on the basis of their own experiences.\nOne such example is supposed to have taken place during the Lelantine War between the Eretrians and the Chalcidians. The account is given by Plutarch in a dialogue.\nOne of the prominent Greek military figures enjoying such a relationship was Epaminondas, considered the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus however does not have anything to say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society. Plutarch, consistently with his heterosexual message, then goes on to tell how love also inspires women to great courage: \"And here, methinks, we have very opportunely mentioned Alcestis; for although the temper of women has little to do with Mars, Love many times drives them to daring attempts beyond their own nature, even to death.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Morale","surface_form":"morale","offset":82},{"uri":"Sacred_Band_of_Thebes","surface_form":"Sacred Band of Thebes","offset":115},{"uri":"Plutarch","surface_form":"Plutarch","offset":470},{"uri":"City-states","surface_form":"city-states","offset":647},{"uri":"Pammenes","surface_form":"Pammenes","offset":666},{"uri":"Lelantine_War","surface_form":"Lelantine War","offset":932},{"uri":"Eretria","surface_form":"Eretria","offset":958},{"uri":"Chalcis","surface_form":"Chalcidians","offset":976},{"uri":"Epaminondas","surface_form":"Epaminondas","offset":1114},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":1210},{"uri":"Diodorus_Siculus","surface_form":"Diodorus Siculus","offset":1226},{"uri":"Asopichus","surface_form":"Asopichus","offset":1519},{"uri":"Caphisodorus","surface_form":"Caphisodorus","offset":1533},{"uri":"Mantineia","surface_form":"Mantineia","offset":1575},{"uri":"Alcestis","surface_form":"Alcestis","offset":1869}]}
