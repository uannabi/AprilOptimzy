{"id":382461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charioteer_of_Delphi","text":"The Charioteer of Delphi is a Greek bronze sculpture from the early Classical period, about 477 BC. It stands 1.8 m tall.\nIt was discovered in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi during excavations by French archaeologists in 1896. With the statue were found fragments of a sculpted chariot, sculpted horses, and a small, sculpted person, presumably the charioteer's groom. All would have been part of a large monument. The charioteer monument was commissioned by Polyzalos, a Sicilian tyrant, to commemorate his victory in the chariot races about 477 BC. At some point, according to Greek practice, the statue was buried, probably because of irreparable damage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":36},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":43},{"uri":"Apollo","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":160},{"uri":"Delphi","surface_form":"Delphi","offset":170}]}
