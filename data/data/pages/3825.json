{"id":3825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase","text":"e=\"preserve\">A \"phrase\" is a group of words that adds meaning to a sentence. A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a subject, verb and a predicate.\nIn English there are five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main parts of speech. In a phrase, the main word, or the word that is what the phrase is about, is called the \"head.\" In these examples, it is printed in \"bold\". The other words in the phrase do the work of changing or \"modifying\" the head.\nIn a 'Noun phrase', one or more words work together to give more information about a noun.\nIn an Adjective phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adjective.\nIn a Verb phrase, one or more words work together to give more meaning to a verb. In English, the verb phrase is very complex, but a good description of its many forms can be found [http://papyr.com/hypertextbooks/engl_126/ph_verb.htm here].\nIn an Adverb phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adverb.\nIn a Prepositional phrase, one or more words work together to give information about time, location, or possession, or condition. The preposition always appears at the front of the phrase (preposition = pre-position).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":67},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":95},{"uri":"Subject","surface_form":"subject","offset":145},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":154},{"uri":"Predicate","surface_form":"predicate","offset":165},{"uri":"Part_of_speech","surface_form":"parts of speech","offset":255},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":556},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":576},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":672},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":759},{"uri":"Complex","surface_form":"complex","offset":801},{"uri":"Adverb","surface_form":"adverb","offset":1012},{"uri":"Preposition","surface_form":"preposition","offset":1154}]}
