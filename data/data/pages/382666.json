{"id":382666,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Baker","text":"Josephine Baker (June 3, 1906 \u2013 April 12, 1975) was an American-born French dancer, singer, and actress. She was born Freda Josephine McDonald in St. Louis, Missouri. Fluent in both English and French, Baker became an international musical and political icon. She was given such nicknames as the \"Bronze Venus\", the \"Black Pearl\", and the \"Cr\u00E9ole Goddess\".\nBaker was the first African-American female to star in a major motion picture, \"Zouzou\" (1934), and to become a world-famous entertainer.\nShe tried to integrate an American concert hall, and is noted for her contributions to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. She was offered the unofficial leadership of the movement by Coretta Scott King in 1968 following Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, but turned it down.\nBaker became a citizen of France in 1937. She helped the French Resistance during World War II, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the L\u00E9gion d'Honneur and the Rosette of the R\u00E9sistance after the war.\nCareer.\nWhen Josephine came to Paris in the 1920s for \"La Revue N\u00E8gre\", it was a turning point in her career. Her career thrived, and when \"La Revue N\u00E8gre\" closed, Josephine starred in \"La Folie du Jour\" at the Follies-Berg\u00E8re Theater. Her performance, and her banana costume made her a celebrity. Josephine rivalled Gloria Swanson and Mary Pickford as the most photographed woman in the world: by 1927 she earned more than any entertainer in Europe. She starred in two movies in the early 1930s, \"Zou-Zou\" and \"Princess Tam-Tam\", and moved her family from St. Louis to Les Milandes, her estate in Castelnaud-Fayrac, France.\nIn later shows in Paris she was often accompanied on stage by her pet cheetah, Chiquita, who was adorned with a diamond collar. The cheetah frequently escaped into the orchestra pit, where it terrorized the musicians, adding another element of excitement to the show.\nPersonal life.\nBaker had 12 children through adoption. She bore only one child herself, stillborn in 1941. Josephine Baker was married four times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":55},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":69},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":76},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":84},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":96},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis, Missouri","offset":146},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":377},{"uri":"Zouzou_(film)","surface_form":"Zouzou","offset":437},{"uri":"Racial_integration","surface_form":"integrate","offset":508},{"uri":"Civil_Rights_Movement","surface_form":"Civil Rights Movement","offset":586},{"uri":"Coretta_Scott_King","surface_form":"Coretta Scott King","offset":691},{"uri":"Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","offset":728},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":804},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":815},{"uri":"French_Resistance","surface_form":"French Resistance","offset":846},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":871},{"uri":"Croix_de_Guerre","surface_form":"Croix de Guerre","offset":905},{"uri":"L%C3%A9gion_d%27Honneur","surface_form":"L\u00E9gion d'Honneur","offset":926},{"uri":"Follies-Berg%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Follies-Berg\u00E8re","offset":1203},{"uri":"Gloria_Swanson","surface_form":"Gloria Swanson","offset":1309},{"uri":"Mary_Pickford","surface_form":"Mary Pickford","offset":1328},{"uri":"St._Louis","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":1549},{"uri":"Castelnaud-Fayrac","surface_form":"Castelnaud-Fayrac","offset":1590},{"uri":"Cheetah","surface_form":"cheetah","offset":1687},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":1729},{"uri":"Orchestra_pit","surface_form":"orchestra pit","offset":1785}]}
