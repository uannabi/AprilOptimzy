{"id":3828,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun","text":"e=\"preserve\">A pronoun is traditionally a part of speech in grammar, but many modern linguists call it a type of noun. In English, pronouns are words such as \"me, she, his, them, herself, each other, it, what\".\nPronouns are often used to take the place of a noun, to avoid repeating the noun. For example, instead of saying\nWhen a pronoun replaces a noun, the noun is called the antecedent. For example, in the sentence: \"The dog that was walking down the street\", the relative pronoun is the word that referring back to the antecedent, the word 'dog'. In the sentence \"The spy who loved me\", the relative pronoun is the word 'who' and its antecedent is the word 'spy'.\nDifferences and similarities to nouns.\nPronouns are different from common nouns because pronouns normally do not come after \"article\"s or other \"determiner\"s. For example, people do not say \"the it\". Pronouns rarely come after adjectives. They are also different because many of them change depending on how they are used. For example, \"we\" is a 'subject' in grammar, but the word changes to \"us\" when used as an object.\nPronouns are the same as nouns because they both change for number (singular & plural), case (subject, object, possessive, etc.), and gender (male, female, animate, inanimate, etc.) Nouns and pronouns can be used in almost all the same places in sentences, and they name the same kinds of things: people, objects, etc. Even though they can not normally come after determiners, or adjectives, neither can proper nouns.\nKinds of pronouns.\nThere are four kinds of pronouns: personal, reciprocal, interrogative, and relative.\nPersonal pronouns in English.\nThis table shows all the personal pronouns in English that are commonly used today.\nA subject pronoun can replace a noun that is the subject of a sentence. Refer to the table above; the subject pronouns are: I, You, He, She, It, We, They. An object pronoun can replace a noun that is the object of a sentence. A possessive pronoun shows who or what a noun belongs to.\nAnother type of personal pronoun is called the 'reflexive pronoun'. Reflexive pronouns are the words ending in '-self' or '-selves', such as: \"myself, itself, themselves\".\n\"It\" and its other forms \"its\", and \"itself\" only refer to objects, not people. \"They\" and its other forms \"them\", \"their\", and \"theirs\" can be used as a singular, for a person who could be either male or female. For example: \"The patient will be told how much \"they\" will be required to pay.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":26},{"uri":"Part_of_speech","surface_form":"part of speech","offset":42},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":60},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguists","offset":85},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":113},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":122},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":258},{"uri":"Antecedent","surface_form":"antecedent","offset":379},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":897},{"uri":"Grammatical_number","surface_form":"number","offset":1151},{"uri":"Grammatical_case","surface_form":"case","offset":1179},{"uri":"Grammatical_gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":1225},{"uri":"Grammatical_person","surface_form":"personal","offset":1562},{"uri":"Grammatical_person","surface_form":"personal","offset":1668},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":1759},{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":1776},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":1789},{"uri":"Object_(grammar)","surface_form":"object","offset":1931},{"uri":"Possessive_case","surface_form":"possessive","offset":1955},{"uri":"Belongs","surface_form":"belongs","offset":1999}]}
