{"id":382820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_Fountain","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Neptune Fountain or the Fountain of Neptune (Fr: \"Bassin de Neptune\") is a fountain at the Palace of Versailles. It was built under the direction of landscape designer Andr\u00E9 Le N\u00F4tre between 1679 and 1681. At that time, it was called the Pool Below the Dragon or the Fir Tree Pool. The Fountain is at the end of the long path that features the Water Walk and the Dragon Fountain. Jacques-Ange Gabriel reworked the pool area very slightly, and, in 1740, the lead sculptures were put in place. The new fountain was officially opened by King Louis XV of France.\nThe fountain has 99 jets of water. People admired the force and variety of the jets of water playing over the sculptural groups. The fountain is decorated with stone vases, sea cupids, and three central sculpted groups depicting \"Neptune and Amphitrite\" by L. A. Adam, \"Proteus\" by Bouchardin, and \"Ocean\" by Jean-Baptise Lemoyne. The Neptune Fountain is the largest of all the fountain pools in the gardens of Versailles. Fireworks during the summer months create spectacular displays that are reflected in the fountain's large pool.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fountain","surface_form":"fountain","offset":92},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Palace of Versailles","offset":108},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":166},{"uri":"Designer","surface_form":"designer","offset":176},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Le_N%C3%B4tre","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Le N\u00F4tre","offset":185},{"uri":"Footpath","surface_form":"path","offset":338},{"uri":"Water_Walk","surface_form":"Water Walk","offset":361},{"uri":"Dragon_Fountain","surface_form":"Dragon Fountain","offset":380},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":474},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":479},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":530},{"uri":"Louis_XV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XV of France","offset":556},{"uri":"Jet","surface_form":"jet","offset":596},{"uri":"Cupid","surface_form":"cupid","offset":753},{"uri":"Fireworks","surface_form":"Fireworks","offset":999},{"uri":"Reflection","surface_form":"reflect","offset":1071}]}
