{"id":38283,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant","text":"A peasant is a name for a person that worked for others on a farm and never had much money. They usually wore rough clothes and lived in small houses.\nThe word peasant came from the French word for \"country\" in the medieval era (15th century). In feudalism peasants, like other farmers, had to be able to do a number of jobs on the farm. They lived in rural areas and made up a large amount of the population. Most peasants could not read or write. They did not usually talk with the higher society unless it was about work. Some were serfs meaning they were not free to leave their lord's land.\nMale peasants were not the only ones who worked in the fields. Their wives and other woman also worked in the fields if necessary. Female peasants usually did women's work in the house such as cooking, cleaning, making clothes, and looking after children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":26},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":85},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":215},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudalism","offset":247},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":278},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"read or write","offset":434},{"uri":"Serfdom","surface_form":"serfs","offset":535}]}
