{"id":382948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing","text":"The 1993 World Trade Center bombing happened on February 26, 1993 in the bottom section of the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Six people were killed, including a woman who was 7 months pregnant. About 1,042 people were injured. The plan was to use bomb trucks parked in the parking lot of the bottom of the North Tower. The main leader of the small group sent to destroy the buildings hoped that once the North Tower fell they would later see it collapse to hit the South Tower.\nThe main leader of the small group was Ramzi Yousef. The group wanted to destroy the building because many Jews worked in it. Their leader Osama bin Laden was not happy to see the buildings were not destroyed, so he wanted another attack on the same building. The result would be the September 11 attacks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)","surface_form":"World Trade Center","offset":114},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":136},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"small group","offset":368},{"uri":"Ramzi_Yousef","surface_form":"Ramzi Yousef","offset":543},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":611},{"uri":"Osama_bin_Laden","surface_form":"Osama bin Laden","offset":643},{"uri":"September_11_attacks","surface_form":"September 11 attacks","offset":788}]}
