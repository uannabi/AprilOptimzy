It came to mean someone's path through life, or through a particular part of life, for example one's time in school. Later many people used the word only for someone's work and, later yet, a profession, or a job that has an opportunity for advancement. Alternatively, \"a career\" often means a sequence of related jobs within a single industry or sector, such as \"a career in medicine\" or \"a career in the building trade\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":68},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":116},{"uri":"Profession","surface_form":"profession","offset":314}]}
