{"id":38312,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional","text":"e=\"preserve\">A professional is someone who has a specialised job which only very well trained people can perform, such as Doctors, lawyers, and teachers. These occupations are known as professional occupations. They may often get paid more than other people. In sport, a professional is someone who is paid to play. For example, Petra Kvitov\u00E1 and Tim Cahil are professional sportspeople.\nThe word \"professional\" is often used as an adjective, e.g.\nThe opposite of \"professional\" in this sense is: \"unprofessional\".\nAnother word that is the opposite of \"professional\" is \"amateur\". This means that someone does not get paid for the job he is doing (even if he may be doing it very well).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"job","offset":61},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Doctors","offset":122},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":131},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":144},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":262},{"uri":"Petra_Kvitov%C3%A1","surface_form":"Petra Kvitov\u00E1","offset":329},{"uri":"Tim_Cahill","surface_form":"Tim Cahil","offset":347},{"uri":"Sportsperson","surface_form":"sportspeople","offset":374},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":432},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":571}]}
