{"id":383139,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasailing","text":"Parasailing is a sport. Parasailers are put into a harness that is attached to a parachute. They hold on to a rope and are towed at high speeds behind a vehicle (usually a boat, but sometimes a truck on land). The parachute helps them rise up into the air behind the vehicle. People parasail for the thrill and also to get a good, high view of the scenery around them.\nParasailing is a popular recreational activity that was developed in the 1960s.\nDangers include falling too fast while in the air with injuries upon landing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Harness","surface_form":"harness","offset":51},{"uri":"Parachute","surface_form":"parachute","offset":81},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":153},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":394}]}
