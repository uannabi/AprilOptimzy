{"id":38314,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment","text":"An apartment (US English) or flat (British English) is a place to live that is only \"part\" of a larger building. Usually it is a group of rooms on one floor of a highrise building in a city, where land is too expensive for people to have separate houses. An apartment that people own is called a condominium or \"condo\". A proper apartment has an owner called a landlord who charges money (\"rent money\" or \"rent\") from the people who live there (\"tenants\").\nAn apartment building or block of flats may have a few or many apartments. Each apartment is a separate room or set of rooms for people to live in. Sometimes an apartment will only be one small room, and tenants will have to share other rooms like the bathroom and kitchen. Other times, tenants will only share an entrance hallway with different doors leading to each apartment. This shared area is often cared for by a janitor or caretaker.\nAn apartment complex or housing estate is a group of apartment buildings. In an apartment complex, all of the apartment buildings are usually made in a similar way.\nIn many apartments, the tenants only pay the landlord for renting the apartment, and they have to pay other people to provide utilities like electricity and heat. In some apartments, especially the ones in apartment complexes, the tenants will have to pay more to rent the apartment, but in return the landlord will give them things like utilities, laundry rooms (where people wash their clothing), exercise rooms, and parking spaces for bicycles, motorcycles, and cars.\nApartment buildings are more common in cities than single apartments or houses, because there is less room in a city to fit buildings. Building a house for one family in a dense city would cost an enormous amount of money compared to building a house outside of a city.\nKinds of apartments.\nIn a studio apartment, there is a single large room instead of separate rooms for the living room, bedroom, and other areas. Usually the bathroom is a separate room.\nA garden apartment building is usually no more than three stories high and grouped around a courtyard. Sometimes a garden apartment has its own building entrance and a one car garage underneath it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"US_English","surface_form":"US English","offset":14},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":35},{"uri":"Highrise","surface_form":"highrise","offset":162},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":247},{"uri":"Condominium","surface_form":"condominium","offset":296},{"uri":"Landlord","surface_form":"landlord","offset":361},{"uri":"Rent","surface_form":"rent","offset":406},{"uri":"Bathroom","surface_form":"bathroom","offset":709},{"uri":"Kitchen","surface_form":"kitchen","offset":722},{"uri":"Janitor","surface_form":"janitor","offset":877},{"uri":"Caretaker","surface_form":"caretaker","offset":888},{"uri":"Utility","surface_form":"utilities","offset":1190},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":1205},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":1221},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":1452},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":1463},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":1502},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":1512},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":1529},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":1574},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"dense city","offset":1707},{"uri":"Courtyard","surface_form":"courtyard","offset":2084}]}
