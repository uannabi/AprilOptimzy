It hangs in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. It dates to 1909 and measures 115 x 160.5 cm (45 1/4 x 63 3/16 in.)\n\"Both Members of This Club\" was inspired by the fights Bellows attended at Tom Sharkey's Athletic Club in New York. At the time, public boxing matches were illegal in the city. Organizations like Sharkey's made fighters temporary members of the \"club\" on the night of the event. This allowed the men to fight and not break the law.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oil_painting","surface_form":"oil painting","offset":34},{"uri":"George_Bellows","surface_form":"George Bellows","offset":50},{"uri":"National_Gallery_of_Art","surface_form":"National Gallery of Art","offset":82},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":296},{"uri":"Boxing","surface_form":"boxing","offset":326},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"illegal","offset":346}]}
