The win gave the Ravens their second Super Bowl title and their first since the 2000 NFL season at Super Bowl XXXV. Joe Flacco was named the Super Bowl MVP.\nThe game was also nicknamed the Harbaugh Bowl, HarBowl and Brother Bowl because it was the first Super Bowl that featured two brothers as opposing head coaches with both Baltimore's John Harbaugh and San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh facing each other.\nThe game also marked Ray Lewis' last NFL game after he said that he was going to retire from professional football at the end of the 2012 season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["NFL game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_numerals","surface_form":"Roman numerals","offset":43},{"uri":"Super_Bowl","surface_form":"Super Bowl","offset":65},{"uri":"Baltimore_Ravens","surface_form":"Baltimore Ravens","offset":94},{"uri":"National_Football_Conference","surface_form":"American Football Conference","offset":127},{"uri":"2012_NFL_season","surface_form":"2012 season","offset":170},{"uri":"San_Francisco_49ers","surface_form":"San Francisco 49ers","offset":192},{"uri":"American_Football_Conference","surface_form":"National Football Conference","offset":228},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":311},{"uri":"Mercedes-Benz_Superdome","surface_form":"Mercedes-Benz Superdome","offset":410},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":437},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":450},{"uri":"2000_NFL_season","surface_form":"2000 NFL season","offset":541},{"uri":"Super_Bowl_XXXV","surface_form":"Super Bowl XXXV","offset":560},{"uri":"Joe_Flacco","surface_form":"Joe Flacco","offset":577},{"uri":"John_Harbaugh","surface_form":"John Harbaugh","offset":800},{"uri":"Jim_Harbaugh","surface_form":"Jim Harbaugh","offset":834},{"uri":"Ray_Lewis","surface_form":"Ray Lewis","offset":887}]}
