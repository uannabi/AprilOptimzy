It is the biggest constellation. It represents a water snake. The astronomer named Ptolemy listed Hydra when he made a list of 48 constellations. It is also one of the 88 modern constellations that were made by the International Astronomical Union.\nEven though Hydra is a very big constellation, it only has one bright star. This star is named Alphard. Alphard means \"the solitary one\" in Arabic. Hydra actually has little to identify it exept for a cluster of stars at its head.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":11},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":146},{"uri":"Ptolemy","surface_form":"Ptolemy","offset":174},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":306},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":480}]}
