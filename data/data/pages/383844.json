Higgins was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (1894), president of the Carlton Football Club (1904), a member of the Australian House of Representatives (1901\u20131906), and a judge of the High Court of Australia (1906\u20131929).\nThe Division of Higgins covers the inner eastern suburbs of Melbourne, including Armadale, Ashburton, Malvern, Toorak and parts of Glen Iris, Camberwell, Carnegie, Murrumbeena, Prahran, and South Yarra.\nMembers.\nHiggins has been important in Australian federal politics and for the Liberal Party of Australia. The seat's first two members, Harold Holt and Sir John Gorton, were the 17th and 19th Prime Ministers of Australia. Higgins is the only Division to have been held by two Prime Ministers.\nPeter Costello the longest serving Treasurer of Australia and former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party also held the seat from 1990\u20132009. He resigned in 2009 which meant a by-election had to be held. There had also been a by-election in 1967, after Harold Holt disappeared in the sea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":30},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":63},{"uri":"H._B._Higgins","surface_form":"H.
