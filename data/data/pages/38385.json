Its main campus is at Loyola Heights in Quezon City, Metro Manila. It offers elementary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level education. It teaches many things, for example Arts, Humanities, Business, Law, Social Sciences, Theology, and Pure and Applied Sciences.\nInstitution.\nThe Ateneo de Manila University has three campuses in Metro Manila. Several thousand teachers teach students of different ages, from elementary to postgraduate. The Loyola Schools have around 7,500 undergraduate students and around 3,000 graduate students, making the Ateneo small, in number of students, compared to many other Philippine universities.\nThe University began in 1859 when the City of Manila turned over the Escuela Municipal, a public primary school in Intramuros, to Spanish Jesuits. The school took the name \"Ateneo\" when it began teaching secondary education in 1865, and it has since grown into a university.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Society_of_Jesus","surface_form":"Society of Jesus","offset":123},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":147},{"uri":"Quezon_City","surface_form":"Quezon City","offset":200},{"uri":"Metro_Manila","surface_form":"Metro Manila","offset":213},{"uri":"Metro_Manila","surface_form":"Metro Manila","offset":499},{"uri":"1859","surface_form":"1859","offset":822},{"uri":"Manila%2C_Philippines","surface_form":"Manila","offset":844},{"uri":"Intramuros","surface_form":"Intramuros","offset":913}]}
