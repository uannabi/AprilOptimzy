{"id":383886,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1","text":"State Route 1 (SR 1) is a major north-south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California.\nHighway 1 includes parts called Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern end is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County. Its northern end is at U.S. Highway 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. Highway 1 also at times runs together with US 101, through a stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThe highway is famous for running along some of the most beautiful coastlines in the USA. This is why people sometimes call it an 'All-American Road'. In addition to its scenic route to attractions along the coast, it is also a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"State_highway","surface_form":"state highway","offset":44},{"uri":"West_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Pacific coastline","offset":86},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":125},{"uri":"Interstate_5_(California)","surface_form":"Interstate 5","offset":276},{"uri":"Dana_Point%2C_California","surface_form":"Dana Point","offset":300},{"uri":"Orange_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Orange County","offset":314},{"uri":"U.S._Route_101_in_California","surface_form":"U.S. Highway 101","offset":352},{"uri":"Leggett%2C_California","surface_form":"Leggett","offset":383},{"uri":"Mendocino_County","surface_form":"Mendocino County","offset":394},{"uri":"Ventura_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Ventura","offset":484},{"uri":"Santa_Barbara_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Barbara Counties","offset":496},{"uri":"Golden_Gate_Bridge","surface_form":"Golden Gate Bridge","offset":535},{"uri":"Coastline","surface_form":"coastline","offset":622},{"uri":"Greater_Los_Angeles_Area","surface_form":"Greater Los Angeles Area","offset":809},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Bay_Area","surface_form":"San Francisco Bay Area","offset":839}]}
