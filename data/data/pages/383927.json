{"id":383927,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol","text":"A thiol is a molecule that has a R\u2013SH group. Thiols are like alcohols with an oxygen atom changed with a sulfur one. They have often a very strong and bad smell. Thiols are added to natural gas so that people can smell it. This is because methane does not have a smell but can explode very easily.\nThiols are very easy to oxidize. They are also quite acidic, more than alcohols. When the proton is taken away by a base, the thiol can become a nucleophile. It can do reactions like nucleophilic substitution.\nOne of the natural amino acids, cysteine, has a thiol in its structure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":13},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"group","offset":38},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":61},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":78},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":105},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":182},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":239},{"uri":"Redox","surface_form":"oxidize","offset":322},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acidic","offset":351},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":414},{"uri":"Nucleophile","surface_form":"nucleophile","offset":443},{"uri":"Nucleophilic_substitution","surface_form":"nucleophilic substitution","offset":481},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":527},{"uri":"Cysteine","surface_form":"cysteine","offset":540}]}
