{"id":383947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1li_(son_of_Odin)","text":"=\"preserve\">In Norse mythology, V\u00E1li is a son of the god Odin and the giantess Rindr. He was birthed for the sole purpose of killing Loki as revenge for H\u00F6\u00F0r's accidental murder of his twin brother, Baldur. He grew to full adulthood within one day of his birth, and slaughtered him with no regret, no heart, and no thought.\nHe is also the god of flight. Anything that passes through the sky, whether man made or of nature is under his control. To symbolize this his cloak is made of raven feathers that when he spreads his arms looks like wings. V\u00E1li is fated to survive Ragnar\u00F6k.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":15},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":57},{"uri":"Loki","surface_form":"Loki","offset":133},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldur","offset":199},{"uri":"Ragnar%C3%B6k","surface_form":"Ragnar\u00F6k","offset":571}]}
