{"id":383977,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Wannon","text":"The Division of Wannon is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria.\nIt is in the south-west of the state, and includes much of the western part of Victoria. It is next to the South Australian border in the west, and the Bass Strait coast in the south. The Division includes the towns of Warnambool, Portland, Ararat, Hamilton, Stawell and Halls Gap. The Grampians and the Port Campbell National Parks are in the Division. Maryborough and Avoca will become part of Wannon at the 2013 federal election after changes that took place on December 24, 2010.\nThe Division was one of the 75 divisions drawn up for the first federal election in 1901. It was named after the Wannon River, which had been named by Major Mitchell in 1836.\nMembers.\nFor the first 50 years the division was held by both the Australian Labor Party and the conservative parties. However, changes in 1955 removed most of the seat's Labor-friendly territory, and it has been a safe Liberal seat since then. The seat was held by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":29},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":62},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":179},{"uri":"Bass_Strait","surface_form":"Bass Strait","offset":224},{"uri":"Warrnambool%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Warnambool","offset":291},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Portland","offset":303},{"uri":"Ararat%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Ararat","offset":313},{"uri":"Hamilton%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Hamilton","offset":321},{"uri":"Stawell%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Stawell","offset":331},{"uri":"Halls_Gap%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Halls Gap","offset":343},{"uri":"Grampians_National_Park","surface_form":"Grampians","offset":358},{"uri":"Port_Campbell_National_Park","surface_form":"Port Campbell National Park","offset":376},{"uri":"Maryborough%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Maryborough","offset":426},{"uri":"Avoca%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Avoca","offset":442},{"uri":"Wannon_River","surface_form":"Wannon River","offset":669},{"uri":"Thomas_Mitchell","surface_form":"Major Mitchell","offset":707},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Australian Labor Party","offset":797},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Liberal","offset":951},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":1004},{"uri":"Malcolm_Fraser","surface_form":"Malcolm Fraser","offset":1019}]}
