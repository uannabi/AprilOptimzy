{"id":383998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Wills","text":"The Division of Wills is an Australian Electoral Division of Victoria.\nThe division includes the northern Melbourne suburbs of Brunswick, Coburg, Pascoe Vale, Fawkner, Glenroy, and Essendon Airport. It was named after William John Wills, of the Burke and Wills expedition.\nMembers.\nWills has been one of the safest Labor seats in the country. It has been held by Labor except between the 1992 by-election and the 1996 federal election. During this time it was held by independent Phil Cleary. The seat was held by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.\nThe 1992 by-election is remarkable for a number of reasons. It was caused by Bob Hawke's retirement from parliament. A record 22 people stood for election. It was won by an independent, Phil Cleary. However he was on unpaid leave from the state education system and the Australian Constitution forbids people employed by the government from standing for election. No replacement by-election was held as the court decision which threw out the results was made shortly before a general election was due.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":28},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":61},{"uri":"Brunswick%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Brunswick","offset":127},{"uri":"Coburg%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Coburg","offset":138},{"uri":"Pascoe_Vale%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Pascoe Vale","offset":146},{"uri":"Fawkner%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Fawkner","offset":159},{"uri":"Glenroy%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Glenroy","offset":168},{"uri":"Essendon_Airport","surface_form":"Essendon Airport","offset":181},{"uri":"William_John_Wills","surface_form":"William John Wills","offset":218},{"uri":"Burke_and_Wills_expedition","surface_form":"Burke and Wills expedition","offset":245},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Labor","offset":315},{"uri":"Phil_Cleary","surface_form":"Phil Cleary","offset":480},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":514},{"uri":"Bob_Hawke","surface_form":"Bob Hawke","offset":529},{"uri":"Australian_Constitution","surface_form":"Australian Constitution","offset":810}]}
