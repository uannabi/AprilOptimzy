{"id":384015,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innamincka%2C_South_Australia","text":"Innamincka is a very small town in north-east South Australia. It is 1065\u00A0km northeast of Adelaide and 459\u00A0km from Lyndhurst up the Strzelecki Track. It is on the banks of Cooper Creek in the state's Channel Country, and surrounded by the Strzelecki, Tirari and Sturt Stony Deserts. It is within Innamincka Regional Reserve. In 2006 there were 131 people living in the town.\nHistory.\nThe area was the traditional home of the Yandruwandha, Aborigines. The first European to visit the area was Charles Sturt in 1845. He was followed by A C Gregory in 1858 and then Burke and Wills. A monument to Sturt, Burke and Wills was built in Innamincka in 1944.\nIn 1882 a police camp was set up and a small settlement followed. From 7 April 1889, a Royal Mail coach ran fortnightly from Farina, operated by merchants Davey and Pilkington. The town was first named Hopetoun after the Governor of Victoria, the Earl of Hopetoun but it was never popular with locals. The town was never very large, but had a hotel, a store and a police station. Until 1901 the police station was also the customs post for collecting duties on cattle brought overland from Queensland into South Australia. In 1928 the Australian Inland Mission built a hospital here, the Elizabeth Symon Nursing Home. Severe drought and poor access to the settlement resulted in the hotel and hospital closing. In 1951 the police post closed and the town was abandoned.\nIncreased tourism and discovery of gas and oil in the late 1960s led to the formation of \"Cooper Creek Hotel Motel Pty Ltd\". The company opened a hotel, a store and accommodation in the abandoned town. In 1994 the Elizabeth Symon Nursing Home was restored by Dick Smith and \"Australian Geographic\" and used as a visitor centre for South Australian Parks and Wildlife.\nThe town common, on the banks of the Cooper, is popular with campers, as are the town's public coin-in-slot toilets and showers.\nBurke and Wills.\nThe Burke and Wills expedition passed through this area on their journey across Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. They set up a camp on Cooper Creek at Camp LXV, their 65th camp since leaving Melbourne. This camp is also known as The Dig Tree. Members of the expedition camped at the Dig Tree from 6 December 1860 to 21 April 1861.\nThe Victorian Contingent Party under Alfred Howitt was sent by the Victorian government to find the expedition. Howitt found the remains of both leaders, Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills and buried them close to the site of Innamincka. He also found the only survivor, John King on the 15 September 1861. King was living with and being cared for by the Yandruwandha aboriginals.\nHowitt returned to the area in 1862 as leader of the Victorian Exploring Party. He set up a depot camp at Cullyamurra Waterhole before digging up the bodies of Burke and Wills and taking them to Melbourne for a State Funeral.\nThe site of Wills' grave and King's site are on Cooper Creek downstream of Innamincka. Burke's grave, Howitt's camp and the Dig Tree are on Cooper Creek upstream of Innamincka.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":46},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":90},{"uri":"Lyndhurst%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Lyndhurst","offset":115},{"uri":"Strzelecki_Track","surface_form":"Strzelecki Track","offset":132},{"uri":"Cooper_Creek","surface_form":"Cooper Creek","offset":172},{"uri":"Channel_Country","surface_form":"Channel Country","offset":200},{"uri":"Strzelecki_Desert","surface_form":"Strzelecki","offset":239},{"uri":"Tirari_Desert","surface_form":"Tirari","offset":251},{"uri":"Sturt_Stony_Desert","surface_form":"Sturt Stony Desert","offset":262},{"uri":"Innamincka_Regional_Reserve","surface_form":"Innamincka Regional Reserve","offset":296},{"uri":"Yandruwandha","surface_form":"Yandruwandha","offset":425},{"uri":"Australian_Aborigine","surface_form":"Aborigines","offset":439},{"uri":"Charles_Sturt","surface_form":"Charles Sturt","offset":492},{"uri":"Augustus_Gregory","surface_form":"A C Gregory","offset":534},{"uri":"Burke_and_Wills_expedition","surface_form":"Burke and Wills","offset":563},{"uri":"Farina%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Farina","offset":775},{"uri":"Governor_of_Victoria","surface_form":"Governor of Victoria","offset":871},{"uri":"Earl_of_Hopetoun","surface_form":"Earl of Hopetoun","offset":897},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":1140},{"uri":"Australian_Inland_Mission","surface_form":"Australian Inland Mission","offset":1185},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":1275},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":1430},{"uri":"Dick_Smith_(businessman)","surface_form":"Dick Smith","offset":1679},{"uri":"Australian_Geographic","surface_form":"Australian Geographic","offset":1695},{"uri":"Burke_and_Wills_expedition","surface_form":"Burke and Wills expedition","offset":1938},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":2014},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":2029},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Carpentaria","surface_form":"Gulf of Carpentaria","offset":2046},{"uri":"Victorian_Contingent_Party","surface_form":"Victorian Contingent Party","offset":2289},{"uri":"Alfred_William_Howitt","surface_form":"Alfred Howitt","offset":2322},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Victoria","surface_form":"Victorian government","offset":2352},{"uri":"Robert_O%27Hara_Burke","surface_form":"Robert O'Hara Burke","offset":2439},{"uri":"William_John_Wills","surface_form":"William John Wills","offset":2463},{"uri":"Victorian_Exploring_Party","surface_form":"Victorian Exploring Party","offset":2727},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":2869}]}
