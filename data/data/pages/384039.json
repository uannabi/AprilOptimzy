It is served by Oxford Circus tube station, which is directly beneath the junction itself.\nHistory.\nThe Circus was constructed in the beginning of the 19th century, and was designed by John Nash.\nDiagonal crossing.\nIn 2009, Westminster City Council started a \u00A34m scheme for the area, allowing shoppers to cross the intersection diagonally as well as the usual 'straight ahead', turning it into a \"pedestrian scramble\", much like Tokyo's Shibuya crossing.\nThe crossing opened on November 2nd of the same year, by which time the cost had risen to \u00A35 million. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said it was \"a triumph for British engineering, Japanese innovation and good old common sense\". Others noted that a similar crossing in Balham, South London had opened in 2005 at a cost of only \u00A398,000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxford_Street","surface_form":"Oxford Street","offset":42},{"uri":"Regent_Street","surface_form":"Regent Street","offset":60},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":93},{"uri":"Oxford_Circus_tube_station","surface_form":"Oxford Circus tube station","offset":117},{"uri":"John_Nash_(architect)","surface_form":"John Nash","offset":286},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":325},{"uri":"Mayor_of_London","surface_form":"Mayor of London","offset":662},{"uri":"Boris_Johnson","surface_form":"Boris Johnson","offset":679},{"uri":"Balham","surface_form":"Balham","offset":830}]}
