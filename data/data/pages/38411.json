{"id":38411,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_Storm_Nicole_(2004)","text":"Subtropical Storm Nicole was the fourteenth named storm and first subtropical cyclone to form during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the first subtropical storm to be given a name from the standard hurricane naming list and be considered a subtropical cyclone in real-time. The storm never made landfall as a subtropical cyclone, though its remnants affected Anticosti Island, just off of the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Quebec.\nStorm history.\nNicole began with an upper tropospheric trough and a decaying frontal system over the southwestern North Atlantic in early October. By October 8, a broad area of surface low pressure formed about 400\u00A0miles (640\u00A0km) southeast of Bermuda. The system soon began to produce gale-force winds, affecting Bermuda on October 9. Early the next day, the National Hurricane Center said that the low-pressure system had sufficient tropical characteristics to be classified as a subtropical storm, and was given the name \"Nicole\".\nSteadily tracking over cooler waters toward the northwest, Nicole lost all of its tropical characteristics and was declared fully extratropical on October 11, 345\u00A0miles (555\u00A0km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Canadian Hurricane Centre continued to issue advisories on what was then called \"Post-tropical Storm Nicole\", which had now merged with a stronger mid-latitude cyclone. This weather system produced heavy rainfall across the Maritimes near Anticosti Island on October 14.\nImpact.\nNo damage or fatalities were reported, for that Nicole never made landfall or directly affected any land areas. It brought light rain to Bermuda and briefly threatened it before heading northeast. Its remnants combined with a stronger cyclone affecting Anticosti Island in Canada; however, no significant damage was caused in the area.\nRecords.\nSince 2002, subtropical storms have been given names from the same naming sequence as tropical storms. As such, Nicole was the first named subtropical storm to get a name under this rule. Many subtropical cyclones between 1975 and 2001 with a sufficiently tropical nature were either considered fully tropical storms or numbered. Initially, however, the phonetic alphabet was used to name subtropical cyclones.\nOther websites.\nFor official forecasts, see the NHC's [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/refresh/NICOLE+shtml/ public advisory archive on Subtropical Storm Nicole].","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical cyclone","offset":66},{"uri":"2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2004 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":105},{"uri":"List_of_tropical_cyclone_names","surface_form":"hurricane naming list","offset":209},{"uri":"Anticosti_Island","surface_form":"Anticosti Island","offset":370},{"uri":"Prince_Edward_Island","surface_form":"Prince Edward Island","offset":417},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":442},{"uri":"Upper_tropospheric_cyclonic_vortex","surface_form":"upper tropospheric trough","offset":486},{"uri":"Cold_front","surface_form":"frontal system","offset":527},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"North Atlantic","offset":564},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":588},{"uri":"Low-pressure_area","surface_form":"surface low pressure","offset":627},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":693},{"uri":"Gale","surface_form":"gale-force winds","offset":735},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":809},{"uri":"Extratropical","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":1113},{"uri":"Halifax_Regional_Municipality%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Halifax, Nova Scotia","offset":1180},{"uri":"Canadian_Hurricane_Centre","surface_form":"Canadian Hurricane Centre","offset":1206},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"mid-latitude cyclone","offset":1353},{"uri":"Weather_system","surface_form":"weather system","offset":1380},{"uri":"Maritimes","surface_form":"Maritimes","offset":1430},{"uri":"Anticosti_Island","surface_form":"Anticosti Island","offset":1445},{"uri":"Anticosti_Island","surface_form":"Anticosti Island","offset":1738},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1758},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical storms","offset":1842},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical cyclone","offset":2023},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical cyclone","offset":2219}]}
