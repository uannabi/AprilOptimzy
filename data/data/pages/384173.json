{"id":384173,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfone","text":"A sulfone is a molecule that has a sulfur atom with bonds to two oxygen atoms. The sulfur has two double bonds to the two oxygens. It has a single bond with the other two groups. They are usually made by oxidising thioethers.\nThey are used in many important chemical reactions. For example, the Julia olefination uses a sulfone to make an alkene from an aldehyde. They are also sometimes used as solvents.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":15},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":35},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bonds","offset":52},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":65},{"uri":"Double_bond","surface_form":"double bond","offset":98},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidising","offset":204},{"uri":"Thioether","surface_form":"thioether","offset":214},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":258},{"uri":"Julia_olefination","surface_form":"Julia olefination","offset":295},{"uri":"Alkene","surface_form":"alkene","offset":339},{"uri":"Aldehyde","surface_form":"aldehyde","offset":354},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":396}]}
