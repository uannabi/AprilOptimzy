It is the last \"Mario Party\" game for the Nintendo 64. It was made by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. It was released on December 7, 2000 in Japan, on May 7, 2001 in North America, and on September 3, 2001 in Europe.\nGameplay.\n\"Mario Party 3\" plays like the first two \"Mario Party\" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. A new element in this game is the Game Guy Space. If a player lands on this space, they must pay all of their coins to play a mini-game. If successful, the player's coins will be doubled (or more, depending on the outcome). If the player fails, they lose all of their coins. This is the only \"Mario Party\" game this space appears in. Also, the player may now hold up to three items at a time. Six boards are available. The last one must be unlocked in Story Mode.\nA new feature in this game are duel boards. Here, the player faces another player in a one-on-one duel on a board. Both players have up to two partners they can use. Twelve partners are available to use. The object is to decrease the other player's health to zero. There are six duel boards available. Duel boards are played after party boards in Story Mode. In Story Mode, the player gets a stamp for winning.\nEight characters are playable in this game. Two characters, Waluigi and Princess Daisy, make their first playable appearance in this game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":33},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":52},{"uri":"Mario_Party","surface_form":"Mario Party","offset":102},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":222},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":271},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":296},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":339},{"uri":"Minigame","surface_form":"mini-game","offset":621}]}
