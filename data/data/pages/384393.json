{"id":384393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrite","text":"Alexandrite is a gemstone. It is a type of chrysoberyl. Different kinds of light make the colors change. That is called the \"alexandrite effect\".\nA gemstone similar to alexandrite can be made in a laboratory. That kind of stone is called synthetic or simulated alexandrite. These are not made of chrysoberyl. People make these because alexandrite is expensive, and the synthetic alexandrite costs less.\nOne story says that alexandrite was named in honor of Alexander II of Russia. Alexander was not yet Tsar at the time.\nAlexandrite has been found in Russia, Brazil, India, Madagascar,Sri Lanka, and India.\nAlexandrite is one of the birthstones for June.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gemstone","surface_form":"gemstone","offset":17},{"uri":"Chrysoberyl","surface_form":"chrysoberyl","offset":43},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":197},{"uri":"Alexander_II_of_Russia","surface_form":"Alexander II of Russia","offset":457},{"uri":"Tsar","surface_form":"Tsar","offset":503},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":551},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":559},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":567},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":574},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":585},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":600},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":649}]}
