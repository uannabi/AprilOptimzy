{"id":384422,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Wallich","text":"Nathaniel Wallich FRS (28 January 1786 \u2013 28 April 1854) was a medical doctor and botanist from Denmark. He worked in India; firstly in the Danish settlement near Calcutta and later for the East India Company. He was involved in the early development of the Calcutta Botanical Garden, describing many new plant species and developing a large collection with copies that he gave to collections in Europe. Several of the plants that he collected were named after him.\nEarly life and education.\nNathaniel Wallich was born in a Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1786 as Nathan ben Wulff. His father Wulff ben Wallich (or Wolff Wallich) was a rich merchant from Altona, a town near Hamburg, Germany, and then moved to Copenhagen late in the 18th century. Nathaniel changed his name to Nathan Wallich, later Nathaniel, as an adult.\nWallich got the diploma of the Royal Academy of Surgeons at Copenhagen in 1806. At the end of the year he was appointed as doctor in the Danish colony of Serampore, then known as \"Frederiksnagore\" in Bengal (now in West Bengal). He sailed for India in April 1807 and arrived at Serampore the following November.\nHe was an honorary doctor at the University of Copenhagen and member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.\nIn India.\nBecause of bad health, Wallich spent the years 1811-1813 in the more temperate climate of Mauritius, where he continued his studies. From August 1814, Wallich became an Assistant Surgeon in the East India Company's service. Wallich was later appointed assistant to William Roxburgh, the East India Company's botanist in Calcutta.\nBy 1813 he took great interest in the flora and natural vegetation of India. He also went on expeditions to Nepal, West Hindustan, and lower Burma. Wallich travelled to Nepal in 1821, one of the very first Englishmen to go there, and returned with many new plants. During 1837 and 1838, Nathaniel Wallich served as Professor of Botany in Calcutta Medical College.\nHe also published two important books, \"Tentamen Flor\u00E6 Nepalensis Illustrat\u00E6\" (vols I-II, 1824\u201326) and \"Plant\u00E6 Asiatic\u00E6 Rariores\" (vols I-III, 1830\u201332).\nDr. Nathaniel Wallich took charge of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society on 1 June 1814. Wallich joined the East India Company's Botanical Garden in 1817 and served there until 1846 when he retired from the service.\nDeath.\nWallich retired to London in 1847, and stayed there until his death seven years later. He had a son, George Charles Wallich, and a daughter, Hannah Sarah. Part of his collections are held at Kew Gardens, and known as the 'Wallich Herbarium'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":18},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"medical doctor","offset":62},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":81},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":95},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":117},{"uri":"Kolkata","surface_form":"Calcutta","offset":162},{"uri":"East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":189},{"uri":"Botanical_garden","surface_form":"Botanical Garden","offset":266},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":523},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":540},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":552},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":648},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":682},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":691},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":718},{"uri":"Royal_Academy_of_Surgeons","surface_form":"Royal Academy of Surgeons","offset":862},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":968},{"uri":"Serampore","surface_form":"Serampore","offset":985},{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":1031},{"uri":"West_Bengal","surface_form":"West Bengal","offset":1046},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1074},{"uri":"University_of_Copenhagen","surface_form":"University of Copenhagen","offset":1176},{"uri":"Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Letters","surface_form":"Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters","offset":1219},{"uri":"Temperate_climate","surface_form":"temperate climate","offset":1344},{"uri":"Mauritius","surface_form":"Mauritius","offset":1365},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Surgeon","offset":1454},{"uri":"East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":1469},{"uri":"William_Roxburgh","surface_form":"William Roxburgh","offset":1540},{"uri":"Calcutta","surface_form":"Calcutta","offset":1595},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":1713},{"uri":"Hindustan","surface_form":"Hindustan","offset":1725},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Burma","offset":1746},{"uri":"Calcutta_Medical_College","surface_form":"Calcutta Medical College","offset":1943},{"uri":"Indian_Museum","surface_form":"Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society","offset":2163},{"uri":"Acharya_Jagadish_Chandra_Bose_Indian_Botanic_Garden","surface_form":"East India Company's Botanical Garden","offset":2237},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":2371},{"uri":"Kew_Gardens","surface_form":"Kew Gardens","offset":2543}]}
