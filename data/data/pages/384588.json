{"id":384588,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_spotted_eagle","text":"The greater spotted eagle (\"Aquila clanga\"), occasionally just called the spotted eagle, is a large bird of prey. Like all typical eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. In summer it lives in eastern Eurasia, and winters further south.\nDescription.\nA medium-sized eagle, the greater spotted eagle only has white spots as a juvenile, when they extend in bands across the upperwing. By adulthood, the spots have faded leaving dark brown feathers across the head, body and wings, with slightly paler flight feathers on the upper side. In gliding flight, the greater spotted eagle holds the feathers at the tips of the wings downward.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird_of_prey","surface_form":"bird of prey","offset":100},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":131},{"uri":"Accipitridae","surface_form":"Accipitridae","offset":164},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":208}]}
