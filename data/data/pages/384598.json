He was the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States. He was chosen as director of the Bureau of Investigation because he helped start it. He was the director until his death in 1972 at age 77.\nAccording to President Harry S Truman, Hoover transformed the FBI into his private secret police force. Truman stated that \"we want no Gestapo or secret police. FBI is tending in that direction. They are dabbling in sex-life scandals and plain blackmail. J. Edgar Hoover would give his right eye to take over, and all congressmen and senators are afraid of him\".\nHoover had the largest collection of pornography in history. Some adult movies included photos of Joan Crawford, Frank Sinatra, Warren Beatty, and Tony Curtis.\nHoover was born on January 1, 1895 in Washington, D.C. He studied at George Washington University. Hoover was homosexual.\nIt is unknown if Hoover and his political partner Clyde Tolson were ever in a relationship. Hoover died on May 2, 1972 in Washington, D.C. from heart failure, aged 77.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":57},{"uri":"Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","surface_form":"Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation","offset":95},{"uri":"FBI","surface_form":"FBI","offset":144},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":156},{"uri":"Harry_S_Truman","surface_form":"Harry S Truman","offset":334},{"uri":"Gestapo","surface_form":"Gestapo","offset":446},{"uri":"Blackmail","surface_form":"blackmail","offset":555},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":711},{"uri":"Joan_Crawford","surface_form":"Joan Crawford","offset":772},{"uri":"Frank_Sinatra","surface_form":"Frank Sinatra","offset":787},{"uri":"Warren_Beatty","surface_form":"Warren Beatty","offset":802},{"uri":"Tony_Curtis","surface_form":"Tony Curtis","offset":821},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":872},{"uri":"George_Washington_University","surface_form":"George Washington University","offset":903},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":944},{"uri":"Clyde_Tolson","surface_form":"Clyde Tolson","offset":1006}]}
