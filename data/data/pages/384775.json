It has been held by a member of a non-Labor party for all but six years, when independent Ted Mack held it. It was held after the December 1922 election by Prime Minister Billy Hughes. Hughes was replaced as Nationalist party leader, and therefore Prime Minister by Stanley Bruce in February 1923. Joe Hockey was Treasurer in the Abbott Government, but lost his position when Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister. Hockey resigned from Parliament which caused a by-election, and was then appointed as the Ambassador to the US.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian_Electoral_Divisions","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":35},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":68},{"uri":"North_Sydney%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"North Sydney","offset":117},{"uri":"Artarmon%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Artarmon","offset":266},{"uri":"Cammeray%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cammeray","offset":276},{"uri":"Cremorne%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cremorne","offset":286},{"uri":"Cremorne_Point%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cremorne Point","offset":296},{"uri":"Crows_Nest%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Crows Nest","offset":312},{"uri":"Gore_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gore Hill","offset":324},{"uri":"Greenwich%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Greenwich","offset":335},{"uri":"Henley%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Henley","offset":346},{"uri":"Hunters_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Hunters Hill","offset":354},{"uri":"Huntleys_Point%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Huntleys Point","offset":368},{"uri":"Kirribilli%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Kirribilli","offset":384},{"uri":"Lane_Cove%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lane Cove","offset":396},{"uri":"Lane_Cove_North%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lane Cove North","offset":407},{"uri":"Lane_Cove_West%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lane Cove West","offset":424},{"uri":"Lavender_Bay%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lavender Bay","offset":440},{"uri":"Linley_Point%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Linley Point","offset":454},{"uri":"Longueville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Longueville","offset":468},{"uri":"McMahons_Point%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"McMahons Point","offset":481},{"uri":"Milsons_Point%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Milsons Point","offset":497},{"uri":"Naremburn%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Naremburn","offset":512},{"uri":"Neutral_Bay%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Neutral Bay","offset":523},{"uri":"North_Sydney%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"North Sydney","offset":536},{"uri":"Northbridge%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Northbridge","offset":549},{"uri":"Northwood%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Northwood","offset":562},{"uri":"Riverview%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Riverview","offset":573},{"uri":"St_Leonards%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"St Leonards","offset":584},{"uri":"Tarban","surface_form":"Tarban","offset":597},{"uri":"Waverton%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Waverton","offset":605},{"uri":"Wollstonecraft%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wollstonecraft","offset":615},{"uri":"Woolwich%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Woolwich","offset":631},{"uri":"Castlecrag%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Castlecrag","offset":653},{"uri":"Gladesville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gladesville","offset":665},{"uri":"Willoughby%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Willoughby","offset":681},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"ALP","offset":807},{"uri":"Ted_Mack_(politician)","surface_form":"Ted Mack","offset":902},{"uri":"Billy_Hughes","surface_form":"Billy Hughes","offset":983},{"uri":"Stanley_Bruce","surface_form":"Stanley Bruce","offset":1078},{"uri":"Joe_Hockey","surface_form":"Joe Hockey","offset":1110},{"uri":"Treasurer_of_Australia","surface_form":"Treasurer","offset":1125},{"uri":"Tony_Abbott","surface_form":"Abbott Government","offset":1142},{"uri":"Malcolm_Turnbull","surface_form":"Malcolm Turnbull","offset":1188},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":1275},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"Ambassador","offset":1318}]}
