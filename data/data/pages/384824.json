They have cable television, Internet and telephone services for over 26 million customers in 41 U.S. States.\nThe Charter headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut, though many operations remain in St. Louis, Missouri.\nThe company has gotten several awards. But like certain other providers, they have also been under criticism.\nIn May 2016, Charter took over Time Warner Cable and the Bright House Networks; the three companies merged and then became Spectrum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Delaware","surface_form":"Delaware","offset":69},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":103},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":115},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":128},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S. State","offset":183},{"uri":"Stamford%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Stamford, Connecticut","offset":228},{"uri":"Time_Warner_Cable","surface_form":"Time Warner Cable","offset":446}]}
