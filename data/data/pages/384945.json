{"id":384945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius","text":"Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius (born 22 November 1986) is a South African former sprint runner. He is serving a prison sentence for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.\nPistorius was born in Sandton, Johannesburg. Both of his legs are amputated above the ankle, and he runs with prostheses. Pistorius competed in races for athletes with disabilities. He first ran in international competitions for able-bodied athletes in 2007.\nIn 2011, he competed in the World Championships, and as part of South Africa's silver-medal-winning relay team, he became the first amputee to win an able-bodied world track medal. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Pistorius became the first double-leg amputee to compete in the Olympics. He also competed in the 2012 Summer Paralympics. He won gold medals in the men's 400\u00A0metre race in a Paralympic record time of 46.68\u00A0seconds and in the 4\u00A0\u00D7\u00A0100\u00A0metres relay in a world record time of 41.78\u00A0seconds. He also won a silver in the 200\u00A0metres race.\nOn 14 February 2013, he shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead in his house. He was charged with murder, but is not in prison because he paid a R1 million to be released on bail. His murder trial began on 3 March 2014 in Pretoria. During the trial, Pistorius was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. On 11 September, he was found not guilty of murder. On 12 September 2014, he was convicted of manslaughter.\nIn November 2014, prosecutors asked the sentencing judge for permission to appeal the verdict. Permission was granted in December, and the case was presented to a five-person panel at the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was released on house arrest, and on 3 December 2015 the Appeal Court overturned the culpable homicide verdict and convicted him of murder. Pistorius appeared in court on 13 June 2016 to start the sentence hearing for the murder conviction; on 6 July he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for murder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["athlete"],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":58},{"uri":"Sprint","surface_form":"sprint","offset":79},{"uri":"Runner","surface_form":"runner","offset":86},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":110},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":134},{"uri":"Girlfriend","surface_form":"girlfriend","offset":148},{"uri":"Reeva_Steenkamp","surface_form":"Reeva Steenkamp","offset":159},{"uri":"Sandton%2C_Johannesburg","surface_form":"Sandton, Johannesburg","offset":198},{"uri":"Amputation","surface_form":"amputated","offset":242},{"uri":"Prosthesis","surface_form":"prostheses","offset":286},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabilities","offset":344},{"uri":"World_Championships_in_Athletics","surface_form":"World Championships","offset":463},{"uri":"Relay_race","surface_form":"relay","offset":535},{"uri":"2012_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2012 Summer Olympics","offset":623},{"uri":"2012_Summer_Paralympics","surface_form":"2012 Summer Paralympics","offset":753},{"uri":"South_African_rand","surface_form":"R","offset":1134},{"uri":"Bail","surface_form":"bail","offset":1163},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"trial","offset":1180},{"uri":"Diagnose","surface_form":"diagnose","offset":1253},{"uri":"Generalised_anxiety_disorder","surface_form":"generalised anxiety disorder","offset":1268},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_Appeal_of_South_Africa","surface_form":"Supreme Court of Appeal","offset":1594},{"uri":"Manslaughter","surface_form":"culpable homicide","offset":1707},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":1754}]}
