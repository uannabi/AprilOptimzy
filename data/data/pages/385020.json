{"id":385020,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Lok Sabha or House of the People is the lower house of the Parliament of India. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by direct election under universal adult franchise. As of 2019, there have been seventeen Lok Sabhas elected by the people of India. The Constitution limits the Lok Sabha to a maximum of 552 members. This includes no more than 20 members representing people from the Union Territories, and two appointed non-partisan members to represent the Anglo-Indian community (if the President feels that the community is not represented well enough).\nEach Lok Sabha is formed for a five-year term. Normally, after five years, it is automatically dissolved. It can be extended by a proclamation of emergency. If this happens, the term may be extended for one year. It can be extended more than one time. The 17th and current Lok Sabha was formed in May 2019.\nThe Lok Sabha meets at the Lok Sabha Chambers,\u00A0in Sansad Bhavan,\u00A0Sansad Marg,\u00A0in New Delhi.\nThe Lok Sabha member are elected for a team of five years.The president may dissolve the Lok Sabha.During emergency,the team may be extended for one year\nHistory.\nDuring the British colonial period, the office of the\u00A0Secretary of State for India\u00A0(along with the\u00A0Council of India) was the authority through whom\u00A0the British Parliament\u00A0exercised its rule in the Indian sub-continent. The\u00A0Viceroy of India\u00A0was created, along with an Executive Council, in India, which consisted of high officials of the British government. The\u00A0Indian Councils Act 1861\u00A0provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members; and the\u00A0Indian Councils Act 1892\u00A0established legislatures in each of the\u00A0provinces of British India.\u00A0These Acts may have increased the Indian representation in government, but the councils' power remained limited, and the electorate also remained very small. The participation of Indians in the administration increased after the passage of the Indian Councils Act 1909\u00A0and the\u00A0Government of India Act 1919.\nThe Indian Independence Act was passed on July 18, 1947, and as a result British India was to be divided into India and Pakistan upon independence on August 15, 1947. They were to be dominions (India, Pakistan) under the Crown until they had enacted their own constitutions.\nThe Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations, with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion.\nIndia became a republic on January 26, 1950.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parliament_of_India","surface_form":"Parliament of India","offset":76},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":126},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":144},{"uri":"Universal_adult_franchise","surface_form":"universal adult franchise","offset":159},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":260},{"uri":"Constitution_of_India","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":271},{"uri":"Union_territory","surface_form":"Union Territories","offset":401},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"non-partisan","offset":438},{"uri":"Anglo-Indian","surface_form":"Anglo-Indian","offset":476},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":489},{"uri":"President_of_India","surface_form":"President","offset":507},{"uri":"Statement","surface_form":"proclamation","offset":705},{"uri":"Emergency","surface_form":"emergency","offset":721},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":782},{"uri":"2019","surface_form":"2019","offset":876},{"uri":"Lok_Sabha_Chambers","surface_form":"Lok Sabha Chambers","offset":909},{"uri":"Sansad_Bhavan","surface_form":"Sansad Bhavan","offset":932},{"uri":"Sansad_Marg","surface_form":"Sansad Marg","offset":947},{"uri":"New_Delhi","surface_form":"New Delhi","offset":963},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":1148},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"colonial period","offset":1156},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State_for_India","surface_form":"Secretary of State for India","offset":1191},{"uri":"Council_of_India","surface_form":"Council of India","offset":1236},{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British Parliament","offset":1289},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian sub-continent","offset":1334},{"uri":"Viceroy_of_India","surface_form":"Viceroy of India","offset":1360},{"uri":"British_Government","surface_form":"British government","offset":1474},{"uri":"Indian_Councils_Act_1861","surface_form":"Indian Councils Act 1861","offset":1498},{"uri":"Indian_Councils_Act_1892","surface_form":"Indian Councils Act 1892","offset":1643},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"provinces of British India","offset":1708},{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Acts","offset":1742},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1795},{"uri":"Electorate","surface_form":"electorate","offset":1857},{"uri":"Indian_Councils_Act_1909","surface_form":"Indian Councils Act 1909","offset":1980},{"uri":"Government_of_India_Act_1919","surface_form":"Government of India Act 1919","offset":2013},{"uri":"Indian_Independence_Act","surface_form":"Indian Independence Act","offset":2047},{"uri":"1947","surface_form":"1947","offset":2094},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":2153},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":2163},{"uri":"Dominion_of_India","surface_form":"India","offset":2237},{"uri":"Dominion_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":2244},{"uri":"Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Crown","offset":2264},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":2499}]}
