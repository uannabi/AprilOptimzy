{"id":385154,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)","text":"In mathematics, a limit is an anticipated value of a function or sequence based on the points around it. As a function performs operations on different inputs, this can cause strange results with certain numbers, especially if we try to plot them on a Cartesian graph; limits are a way of explaining what happens in these cases.\nFormat.\nLimits are used to define many topics in calculus, like continuity, derivatives, and integrals.\nformula_1\nwhich reads \"the limit of \"f\" of \"x\", as \"x\" approaches \"c\" equals \"L\". An alternative notation is \"formula_1 as formula_1\", which reads \"formula_1 tends to formula_1 as formula_1 tends to formula_1\". Limit is shortened to \"lim\".\nFor a sequence formula_1, the similar notation formula_1 is used.\nExample.\nThis problem is unique to zero as the function still works on every value up to zero, even if we approach from the negative side. As input numbers get arbitrarily small, the output will simply get arbitrarily large, and if we draw this on a graph, the line will stretch upwards without bound before it touches 0 on either axis.\nOne way we describe this is \"The limit of formula_1 as formula_1 approaches 0, from the right side, is formula_1\", meaning that formula_1 can keep increasing beyond bounds, as long as \"x\" doesn't reach 0. Mathematically, this is written as: formula_1.\nApplications.\nWhile the equation will never be equal to formula_1, putting in a larger input will get us closer to it, and make our output more accurate. Mathematically, we can express this by saying that \"The limit of formula_1 as formula_1 approaches formula_1 is formula_1\", which is noted as formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":53},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":65},{"uri":"Operation_(mathematics)","surface_form":"operations","offset":128},{"uri":"Cartesian_coordinate_system","surface_form":"Cartesian graph","offset":252},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":378},{"uri":"Continuity","surface_form":"continuity","offset":393},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"derivatives","offset":405},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integrals","offset":422}]}
