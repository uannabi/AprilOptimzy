It was started by Robert Aladenyse, in 1987. The main mission of the association is to gather the alumni of the French Civil Aviation University. In 2013, it has almost 20,000 members. It is a non-profit organization.\nHistory.\nWhen the French Civil Aviation University was created in 1949, its first goal was to train people of the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. At the beginning of the 1970s, the university started to train professionals for the aerospace engineering industry. Robert Aladenyse (1931-2003, graduated in 1964) decided in 1987 to create a non-profit organization for alumni called INGENAC. In the 2000s, the development in France of Master's degree and \"Mast\u00E8res Sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9s\" courses encouraged the association to support and represent these new alumni.\nOn 1 Janunary 2010, ENAC became the biggest aeronautical university in Europe. Because of this, INGENAC decided to rename itself ENAC Alumni and gather graduates of all the degrees of the French Civil Aviation University (including the \"Techniciens a\u00E9ronautique d'exploitation\", the \"Techniciens sup\u00E9rieur de l'aviation\", the Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnels and the \"Ing\u00E9nieurs des \u00E9tudes et de l'exploitation de l'aviation civile\"). It has been done in March 2012.\nENAC Alumni is part of the \"Conf\u00E9rence des Grandes \u00C9coles\".\nMeetings.\nENAC Alumni is a partnership of the yearly meeting Airexpo and the \"Salon du livre a\u00E9ronautique\".\nBoard members.\nM\u00E9ziane Idjerouid\u00E8ne was one of the board members of the association.\nMarc Houalla is the current President.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["university"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alumni","surface_form":"alumni","offset":48},{"uri":"Association","surface_form":"association","offset":55},{"uri":"Toulouse","surface_form":"Toulouse","offset":76},{"uri":"Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":86},{"uri":"French_Civil_Aviation_University","surface_form":"French Civil Aviation University","offset":213},{"uri":"Non-profit_organization","surface_form":"non-profit organization","offset":294},{"uri":"French_Civil_Aviation_University","surface_form":"French Civil Aviation University","offset":337},{"uri":"Directorate_General_for_Civil_Aviation","surface_form":"Directorate General for Civil Aviation","offset":433},{"uri":"Aerospace_engineering","surface_form":"aerospace engineering","offset":558},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"Master's degree","offset":760},{"uri":"Mast%C3%A8re_Sp%C3%A9cialis%C3%A9","surface_form":"Mast\u00E8res Sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9s","offset":781},{"uri":"French_Civil_Aviation_University","surface_form":"ENAC","offset":901},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":952},{"uri":"French_Civil_Aviation_University","surface_form":"French Civil Aviation University","offset":1069},{"uri":"Technicien_a%C3%A9ronautique_d%27exploitation","surface_form":"Techniciens a\u00E9ronautique d'exploitation","offset":1118},{"uri":"Technicien_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_l%27aviation","surface_form":"Techniciens sup\u00E9rieur de l'aviation","offset":1165},{"uri":"Air_Traffic_Safety_Electronics_Personnel","surface_form":"Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel","offset":1207},{"uri":"Ing%C3%A9nieur_des_%C3%A9tudes_et_de_l%27exploitation_de_l%27aviation_civile","surface_form":"Ing\u00E9nieurs des \u00E9tudes et de l'exploitation de l'aviation civile","offset":1258},{"uri":"Conf%C3%A9rence_des_Grandes_%C3%89coles","surface_form":"Conf\u00E9rence des Grandes \u00C9coles","offset":1385},{"uri":"Airexpo","surface_form":"Airexpo","offset":1478},{"uri":"Salon_du_livre_a%C3%A9ronautique","surface_form":"Salon du livre a\u00E9ronautique","offset":1495},{"uri":"M%C3%A9ziane_Idjerouid%C3%A8ne","surface_form":"M\u00E9ziane Idjerouid\u00E8ne","offset":1540},{"uri":"Marc_Houalla","surface_form":"Marc Houalla","offset":1610}]}
