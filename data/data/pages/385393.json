{"id":385393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(genus)","text":"\"Draco\" is a genus of agamid lizards that are sometimes called the \"flying dragons\". The ribs and their connecting membrane can be extended to create a kind of wing. The hindlimbs are flattened and wing-like in cross-section, and a small set of flaps on the neck serve as a horizontal stabilizers.\nThey live in forests, and eat insects. They cannot fly, but often get lift as they glide. Glides as long as 60\u00A0m have been recorded, over which the animal loses only 10\u00A0m in height. They are quite small. One species is only about 20\u00A0cm long.\nThe only time a flying lizard comes to the ground is when a female is ready to lay her eggs. She descends the tree she is on and makes a nest hole by forcing her head into the soil. She then lays 2\u20135 eggs before filling the hole. She guards the eggs for approximately 24 hours, but then leaves and has nothing more to do with her offspring.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":13},{"uri":"Agamidae","surface_form":"agamid","offset":22},{"uri":"Lizards","surface_form":"lizards","offset":29},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":274},{"uri":"Stabilizer","surface_form":"stabilizer","offset":285},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":311},{"uri":"Glide","surface_form":"glide","offset":381},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":506}]}
