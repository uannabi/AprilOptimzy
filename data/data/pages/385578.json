{"id":385578,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saman%C3%A1_English","text":"=\"preserve\">Saman\u00E1 English is a variety of the English language. It is spoken by about 8,000 people in the Saman\u00E1 Peninsula, Dominican Republic. The speakers of Saman\u00E1 English are the descendants of African American slaves freed from the United States. They migrated to the Saman\u00E1 region beginning in 1824. Today, they are the largest group of English-speakers in the Dominican Republic.\nThe language is often described by linguists as either a Creole language or a dialect of English. It is closely related to other Creole languages of the Caribbean, especially Turks and Caicos and Bahamian Creole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"variety","offset":32},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":47},{"uri":"Saman%C3%A1_Peninsula","surface_form":"Saman\u00E1 Peninsula","offset":107},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":125},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":199},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":216},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":238},{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"linguist","offset":423},{"uri":"Creole_language","surface_form":"Creole language","offset":445}]}
