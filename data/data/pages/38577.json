{"id":38577,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_gerbil","text":"The fat-tailed gerbil (\"Pachyuromys duprasi\") is a species of gerbil. Its tail becomes fatter when it eats something. Then it uses it when food becomes scarce. They can live 5 to 7 years in captivity. It is from Africa.\nThey can survive a long time without drinking because they are adapted to a dry climate.\nThey bury themselves under the sand until night so that there are not as many predators that will attack them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gerbil","surface_form":"gerbil","offset":62},{"uri":"Captivity","surface_form":"captivity","offset":190},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":212},{"uri":"Adapted","surface_form":"adapted","offset":283}]}
