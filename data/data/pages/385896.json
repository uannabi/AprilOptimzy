{"id":385896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Katz","text":"Jonathan Paul Katz (born December 1, 1946) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. He is known for his role as Dr. Katz in \"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist\". Katz won an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\" in 1995.\nEarly life and education.\nKatz was born in New York City to a Jewish-Hungarian immigrant family. He was educated at Goddard College.\nCareer.\nKatz is a close friend of playwright David Mamet, with whom he attended Goddard College. Katz co-wrote \"House of Games]\" with Mamet and had small roles in the Mamet-directed films \"Things Change,\" \"Homicide,\" \"The Spanish Prisoner,\" and \"State and Main\".\nOriginally a musician and songwriter, Katz fronted a rhythm and blues group called \"Katz and Jammers\" before serving as the musical director for Robin Williams' 1979 standup tour. In 1998, he released \"Brandon Project\", a blues album.\nHealth.\nIn 1996, Katz was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The initial symptoms began that year: \"I was working on a TV show called \"Ink\" with Ted Danson, and after every episode we would take a curtain call and I noticed that I needed a head-start.\"\nHiding his condition became too much of a burden for Katz and he eventually disclosed it. He began speaking publicly as part of a tour sponsored by a manufacturer of medications used to treat MS.\"People have been pretty supportive; nobody ever had me in mind for an action film because of the kind of work I do -- mostly in the world of animation, which is not a big issue because as a person, I can't run that fast; as a cartoon character, I can fly -- literally.\" Katz, who now gets around with the help of a motorized scooter and performs onstage with the aid of a cane, says he doesn't regret his decision: \"One of the reasons I disclosed my condition is because it is much easier to live with MS than to pretend you don't have it. If I could convince everyone of that, my job here is done.\"\nPersonal life.\nKatz is married to Suzan Katz. They have two children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Stand-up_comedian","surface_form":"stand-up comedian","offset":58},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":77},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":88},{"uri":"Dr._Katz%2C_Professional_Therapist","surface_form":"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist","offset":137},{"uri":"Emmy_Award","surface_form":"Emmy Award","offset":184},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":288},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":307},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":314},{"uri":"Goddard_College","surface_form":"Goddard College","offset":361},{"uri":"David_Mamet","surface_form":"David Mamet","offset":423},{"uri":"Rhythm_and_blues","surface_form":"rhythm and blues","offset":694},{"uri":"Robin_Williams","surface_form":"Robin Williams","offset":786},{"uri":"Multiple_sclerosis","surface_form":"multiple sclerosis","offset":917},{"uri":"Ted_Danson","surface_form":"Ted Danson","offset":1021}]}
