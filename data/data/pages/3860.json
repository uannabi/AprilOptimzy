{"id":3860,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovel","text":"A shovel is a tool used for moving loose material. Shovels have a flat bottom head which is angled slightly from the handle to enable scooping and moving of material.\nAlthough a shovel can be used for digging, it is much less efficient than a spade. Spades are straight, and transmit force straight downwards. Shovels move loose material, such as coal, snow, gravel etc. They are usually made of metal at the bottom, and wood is sometimes used for the handle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":14},{"uri":"Spade","surface_form":"spade","offset":243},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":359}]}
