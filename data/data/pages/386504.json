Multivitamins are available as tablets, capsules, pastilles, powders, liquids, and injections. Besides injections, multivitamins are recognized by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the United Nations' authority on food standards) as a category of food.\nMultivitamins are often provided with minerals. A multivitamin or mineral set is approved in the United States as a (supplement) addition to a diet containing 3 or more vitamins and minerals that does not include herbs, hormones, or drugs. The terms multivitamin and multimineral are often used interchangeably. There is no scientific definition for either.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":36},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":61},{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"human body","offset":84},{"uri":"Codex_Alimentarius_Commission","surface_form":"Codex Alimentarius Commission","offset":268},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":303},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":365},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":584},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":591},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":604}]}
