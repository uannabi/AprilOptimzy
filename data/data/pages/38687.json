{"id":38687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths","text":"The Four Noble Truths are a Buddhist teaching. They show Buddhists why they should follow the Middle Way.\nThe First Noble Truth.\nThe first noble truth is called \"Dukkha\", which means \"suffering\". It says that life is full of suffering. To say it a different way, in life, there is sickness, poverty (being poor), old age, and death. People can not keep what they want. People can not avoid what they do not want. If that is all a person learns, they suffer.\nThe Second Noble Truth.\nThe second noble truth is \"Samudaya\", which says that there is a reason for the suffering in the world. It says that the reason there is suffering is that people want things. It also says that the reason there is suffering is that people change what they think is real. They do this because they are ignorant. People do wrong actions because they want things and because they do not see what is real. Those evil actions lead to suffering.\nThe Third Noble Truth.\nThe third noble truth is \"Nirodha\". It says that people can be free from suffering when they no longer want things.\nThe Fourth Noble Truth.\nThe fourth noble truth is called \"Magga\". It says that for a person to stop wanting things, they must follow a set of rules. The rules are called the Noble Eightfold Path.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":28},{"uri":"Lesson","surface_form":"teaching","offset":37},{"uri":"Middle_way","surface_form":"Middle Way","offset":94},{"uri":"Dukkha","surface_form":"Dukkha","offset":162},{"uri":"Suffer","surface_form":"suffer","offset":225},{"uri":"Sick","surface_form":"sick","offset":281},{"uri":"Poor","surface_form":"poor","offset":306},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":326},{"uri":"Learn","surface_form":"learn","offset":437},{"uri":"Samudaya","surface_form":"Samudaya","offset":509},{"uri":"Ignorance","surface_form":"ignorant","offset":782},{"uri":"Action","surface_form":"action","offset":808},{"uri":"Nirodha","surface_form":"Nirodha","offset":970},{"uri":"Free","surface_form":"free","offset":1007},{"uri":"Marga","surface_form":"Magga","offset":1118},{"uri":"Noble_Eightfold_Path","surface_form":"Noble Eightfold Path","offset":1234}]}
