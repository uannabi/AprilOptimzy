{"id":387068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilford","text":"=\"preserve\">Ilford is a large town in Greater London, the headquarters of the London Borough of Redbridge. It is also identified as a major area in the London Plan, being located about 9.1 miles east of Charing Cross.\nIlford was once a small settlement in Essex. It started to develop because of its strategic position near the River Roding and the road from London to Colchester. The arrival of the railway in 1839 also boosted this growth, causing trade and development to foster in the area. Ilford became a municipal borough in 1926 as well as expanding and increasing in population. In 1965, however, the municipal boroughs were scrapped and the area was removed from Essex and dissolved into Greater London. Many people still refer to Ilford and other East London areas as being part of Essex.\nIlford is part of the IG postcode area although some parts are in the E postcode area instead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":30},{"uri":"Greater_London","surface_form":"Greater London","offset":38},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":58},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Redbridge","surface_form":"London Borough of Redbridge","offset":78},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":256}]}
