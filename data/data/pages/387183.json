{"id":387183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_name","text":"Hebrew names are names that have come from the Hebrew language. Traditionally they come from the Hebrew Bible.\nThey are mostly used by people living in Jewish or Christian parts of the world, but some are also adapted to the Islamic world, particularly if a Hebrew name is mentioned in the Qur'an.\nWhen Hebrew-speaking Muslims give names, they do not necessarily use Jewish or Christian names. A typical Hebrew name can have many different forms \u2013 an important principle of the Jewish religion worldwide is to give a Hebrew name to a child that is used throughout his or her lifetime.\nNot all Hebrew names are strictly Hebrew in origin: some may have been \"taken\" from other languages since ancient times. These include Egyptian, Aramaic, Phoenician, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Spanish, German, and English.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":17},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew language","offset":47},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":97},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":152},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":162},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":225},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":290},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":319},{"uri":"Christian_name","surface_form":"Christian name","offset":377},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":485},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient times","offset":691},{"uri":"Egyptian_language","surface_form":"Egyptian","offset":720},{"uri":"Aramaic_language","surface_form":"Aramaic","offset":730},{"uri":"Phoenician_language","surface_form":"Phoenician","offset":739},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":751},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":758},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":765},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":773},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":782},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":794}]}
