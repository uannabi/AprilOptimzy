{"id":387194,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F","text":"Who is a Jew? () is the basic question about the identity of Jews, or in other words: which people are considered to be Jewish.\nQuestion of race?\nThe definition of who is a Jew may depend on a few things. Because Judaism has no specific race, it can include characteristics of an ethnicity, religion, and citizenship, and so the definition of who is a Jew is not specific.\nThis question has been a subject to legal arguments, especially in Israel but also outside of it. There have been court cases in Israel since 1962 which had to address the question. In addition, the United Kingdom and other countries has had to consider whether the question was a racial issue or not.\nIn Nazi Germany.\nIt was an important question to the Nazi party in Germany. The Nazis decided who a Jew was with the Nuremberg Laws.\nMy mom is Jewish or I converted.\nThe question is based on the person's genealogy. Simple definition: a person is a Jew either by birth (in any case if one's mother is Jewish) or by religious conversion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Identity","surface_form":"identity","offset":49},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":61},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":213},{"uri":"Race","surface_form":"race","offset":237},{"uri":"Ethnicity","surface_form":"ethnicity","offset":280},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":291},{"uri":"Citizenship","surface_form":"citizenship","offset":305},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":329},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":440},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":487},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":572},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":597},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"racial","offset":654},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi party in Germany","offset":728},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Laws","surface_form":"Nuremberg Laws","offset":792},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":879},{"uri":"Birth","surface_form":"birth","offset":937},{"uri":"Religious_conversion","surface_form":"religious conversion","offset":989}]}
