{"id":3872,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliteration","text":"e=\"preserve\">Alliteration is when a sentence or phrase has many words that start with the same sound. It is commonly used in advertising, poetry, headlines, and tongue-twisters. Basically the first consonant repeats itself throughout the sentence.\nRobert Browning used alliteration many times, too. he employed it in the poem \"Summum bonum\". This is a Latin expression and means \"all the best\".\nAlliteration is most commonly used in modern music but is also seen in magazine article titles, advertisements, business names, comic strip or cartoon characters, common sayings, and a variety of other titles and expressions.\nOne example of alliteration is \"Sally sold sea shells by the sea shore\". In \"Death Note\", the pseudonym of the detective, L, is Ryuzaki Ryuga, his real name is L Lawliet.\nOften, characters in books are named with alliteration. Many names in Harry Potter feature alliterations (for example, Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin). Similarly, in \"Hairspray\", most characters' names feature alliterations (e.g. Tracy Turnblad, Link Larkin, Corny Collins, Dan Dougherty, Penny Pingleton, and Seaweed Stubbs).\nTitles of books sometimes use alliteration, including the titles of all thirteen books (except the last one) in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Author Jeff Lindsay's novels about serial killer Dexter Morgan all feature alliteration in their titles: for example, Darkly Dreaming Dexter. Another example is William Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost.\nA common application of alliteration is in books intended for children learning about letters. Animalia by Graeme Base famously applies alliteration within a storybook, going in order through each letter of the English alphabet and providing many sentences with alliteration.\nPlaces in books: Bat Barn, Terror Tombs, Vampire Village, etc.\nCode names: The release names of the Linux distribution, Ubuntu (e.g. Breezy Badger, Hoary Hedgehog, Feisty Fawn, etc.).\nGame Titles: Prince of Persia (also the tag: Prince of Persia \u2013 Warrior Within).\n\u2022Katie Courec (Remember, alliterative words don\u2019t even necessarily have to start with the same letter, they simply have to have the same first sound).\nPhrases and quotes.\n\u2022Make a mountain out of a molehill\nAlliteration is commonly used since it adds interest to a sentence and can be a great way to help you remember names and phrases that you might other wide forget.
