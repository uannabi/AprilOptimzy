{"id":387288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_(finance)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Factoring is selling rights to the future payments. People and companies that are receiving money from contracts every some time may be in need of extra money - so they sell rights to receive those payments for cash hence Factoring. This is done especially in construction business where companies are paid for parts of work completed instead of upfront payment. Such a company will sell future payments for small percentage fee and will receive all money they need to continue the work without delays.\nThe structured settlement factoring transaction can be really helpful for business in financial needs.\nIt provides business with better financing and more funds on hands in exchange for small percentage of total sum.\nSome banks are entering field of Factoring trying to provide same service advertised by well known names.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":34},{"uri":"Payment","surface_form":"payment","offset":55},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":116},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":273}]}
