{"id":387340,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyl","text":"Rhyl (), pronounced \"Rill\", is a seaside resort and community in Denbighshire in North Wales. It is in the historic county of Flintshire and the preserved county of Clwyd. In 2011, the town's population was 25,149. This makes it one of the largest settlements in North Wales.\nThe town was once an elegant Victorian resort. Influences from Liverpool and Manchester, both cities in England, after World War II changed the town. By 1990, the town had declined. However, since then the town has had major regeneration.\nIt has a number of Grade II listed buildings. An example is the Parish Church of St Thomas in Bath Street. It is listed as Grade II*.\nVery old documents refer to a small dwelling in the area called \"Ty'n Rhyl\". There is a manor house with that name that still exists in the town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Denbighshire","surface_form":"Denbighshire","offset":65},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":87},{"uri":"Flintshire_(historic)","surface_form":"Flintshire","offset":126},{"uri":"Preserved_counties_of_Wales","surface_form":"preserved county","offset":145},{"uri":"Clwyd","surface_form":"Clwyd","offset":165},{"uri":"Victorian_era","surface_form":"Victorian","offset":305},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":339},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":353},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":380},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":395},{"uri":"Listed_building","surface_form":"listed building","offset":543}]}
