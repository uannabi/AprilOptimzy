{"id":387360,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking","text":"Mesh networking is a kind of network topology, a way computer networks and other networks are laid out. In mesh networking, each node is connected to one or more other nodes. Information is passed from one node to the next, until it reaches its target destination. Such networks can be very reliable because there is usually more than one path from one node to another. When a node fails, the data will simply take another route.\nThe disadvantage of such networks is that building them can be very expensive. A network in which each node is directly connected to every other node is called a fully connected network. Another type of a mesh network is a mobile ad hoc network. In such a network the nodes are mobile, and the network may reorganize itself while it is running.\nAccording to Reed's Law, the value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers. Metcalf's Law, in contrast asserts that the value is proportional to the square of the number of subscibers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Network_topology","surface_form":"network topology","offset":29},{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"computer network","offset":53},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"Information","offset":175},{"uri":"Fully_connected_network","surface_form":"fully connected network","offset":592},{"uri":"Mobile_ad_hoc_network","surface_form":"mobile ad hoc network","offset":653},{"uri":"Reed%27s_Law","surface_form":"Reed's Law","offset":788},{"uri":"Metcalf%27s_Law","surface_form":"Metcalf's Law","offset":897}]}
