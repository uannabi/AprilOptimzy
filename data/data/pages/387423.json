It is a spin-off of the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". It first aired on 20 April 2009. It is hosted by Eddie McGuire.\nGameplay.\nSix players compete for a prize of $1,000,000. Players are asked multiple choice questions with four possible answers. Each question has a time limit. The time limit is 15 seconds for the first five questions, 30 seconds for the next five questions, and 45 seconds for the last five. Players have one \"pass\" that they can use. If a player uses a pass, the question goes to the next player in line. That player can not use their pass on the question. If a player answers a question incorrectly, they are removed from the game, go home with nothing, and the top prize is lowered. If a player does not give an answer in the time limit, it is considered a pass. If they can not pass, they are removed from the game.\nIf the first player answers the first five questions correctly, they win a $1,000 bonus.\nThe game ends when all of the players are removed from the game or the last question is answered. If the question is answered correctly, the player wins the amount of money the question is worth. If it is answered incorrectly, the player goes home with nothing. If the 5th question was answered correctly, they leave with $1,000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":29},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":40},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":51},{"uri":"Spin-off","surface_form":"spin-off","offset":70},{"uri":"Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F","surface_form":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?","offset":97},{"uri":"Eddie_McGuire","surface_form":"Eddie McGuire","offset":179}]}
