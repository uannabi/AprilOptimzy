She was also against the current leader of Russia, president Vladimir Putin. Many of her texts asked for human rights.\nIn 2002 Politkovskaya won the Courage in Journalism Award.\nDeath.\nOn 7 October 2006, she was shot dead at her house in Moscow. It is possible she was murdered for political reasons. Some Western countries have asked for a thorough investigation of her death. They see it as an attempt to end opposition to the current Russian regime, as perhaps one of the last chances to save the freedom of the press in Russia. The \"Noyava Gazeta\" has put up a reward for information that can explain why she was killed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":72},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"journalist","offset":80},{"uri":"Novaya_Gazeta","surface_form":"Novaya Gazeta","offset":136},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":172},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":187},{"uri":"Diplomat","surface_form":"diplomat","offset":219},{"uri":"Chechnya","surface_form":"Chechnya","offset":365},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":443},{"uri":"Vladimir_Putin","surface_form":"Vladimir Putin","offset":453},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":497},{"uri":"Courage_in_Journalism_Award","surface_form":"Courage in Journalism Award","offset":541},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":630},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":661},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":674},{"uri":"Investigate","surface_form":"investigation","offset":742},{"uri":"Freedom_of_the_press","surface_form":"freedom of the press","offset":892}]}
