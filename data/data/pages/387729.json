{"id":387729,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchausen_syndrome","text":"M\u00FCnchausen Syndrome (pronounced \"MUNCH-house-in\") is a mental illness in which a person repeatedly fakes disease, illness, or psychological trauma to get attention or sympathy from others. It is sometimes called hospital addiction syndrome, thick chart syndrome, or hospital hopper syndrome.\nA related mental illness is M\u00FCnchausen Syndrome by proxy. People with this condition abuse another person, usually a child, in order to get sympathy or attention for themselves. For example, a parent might make their own child sick in order to get attention and sympathy from friends and medical professionals.\nSymptoms.\nPeople with M\u00FCnchausen Syndrome exaggerate or create symptoms of mental or physical illness. Some people with M\u00FCnchausen make up detailed stories about medical problems they have had, or they may fake symptoms. However, others may harm themselves in many different ways in order to make it seem like they are sick. For example, they might take laxatives to make it seem like they have diarrhea, or take blood-thinning medications to cause bleeding. They might inject themselves with bacteria so that they get an infection. They might cut or burn themselves in order to create wounds. Sometimes, after getting medical treatment, people with M\u00FCnchausen also do things to slow down or prevent their recovery - for example, by ripping out stitches.\nThe goal of this behavior is to get treatment, attention, sympathy, and comfort from medical professionals. For a person with M\u00FCnchausen, being a patient feels familiar and comfortable. This meets a deep psychological need that the person has.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronounced","offset":21},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":55},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":105},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"illness","offset":114},{"uri":"Psychological_trauma","surface_form":"psychological trauma","offset":126},{"uri":"Sympathy","surface_form":"sympathy","offset":167},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnchausen_Syndrome_by_proxy","surface_form":"M\u00FCnchausen Syndrome by proxy","offset":320},{"uri":"Abuse","surface_form":"abuse","offset":377},{"uri":"Child_abuse","surface_form":"child","offset":409},{"uri":"Exaggeration","surface_form":"exaggerate","offset":645},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":666},{"uri":"Laxative","surface_form":"laxative","offset":957},{"uri":"Diarrhea","surface_form":"diarrhea","offset":998},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medication","offset":1031},{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":1052},{"uri":"Injection","surface_form":"inject","offset":1073},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":1096},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":1125},{"uri":"Burn","surface_form":"burn","offset":1154},{"uri":"Wound","surface_form":"wound","offset":1189},{"uri":"Recovery","surface_form":"recovery","offset":1309},{"uri":"Stitches","surface_form":"stitches","offset":1348}]}
