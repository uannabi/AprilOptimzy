He is remembered for his iconic designs of Blue Note record covers.\nEarly years and education.\nJohn Bancroft Hermansader was born on November 1, 1915 near Reading, Pennsylvania.

John became the first president.\nIn 1951, when Blue Note Records began issuing 10 inch records, Hermansader was one of their first designers, along with Paul Bacon and Gil Melle. Looking back at this era, Michael Cuscuna of Mosaic Records said, \u201C What John Hermansader and Paul Bacon really did was evoke the feeling of the music. They used everything from Bauhaus designs to things that were really otherworldly.\u201D Angelynn Grant adds, \u201CWhen people think of Blue Note covers they think of Frank Wolff\u201Ds photography and Reid Miles design. But John Hermansader laid the groundwork that got them going along that path.\u201D Richard Cook, who wrote Blue Note Records: The Biography states, \u201CHermansader in particular balanced the twin issues of photography and type in a way that would mirror the concerns of the Blue Note of the years ahead.\u201D\n\u201CJohn Hermansader was passionate about oil painting, \u201Cbeautiful lyrical abstractions, full of color and movement.\u201D5 He was an abstract expressionist painter who drew inspiration for his work from listening to jazz.\u201D\nHis exhibitions included and the Gallery of Contemporary Art at Sunken Meadow, Long Island, 1951\u201358, Panoras Gallery 1956, Art USA 1958.
