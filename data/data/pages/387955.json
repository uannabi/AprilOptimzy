It is linked to population areas by two major roads. The northern exit links the airport with Qatif as a 4-lane highway. The southern exit links the Airport with Dammam as a 6-lane highway to King Fahd Road which is now considered as the main road to the airport. Abu Hadriyah Highway, serves as the airport's eastern border while Dammam-Riyadh Highway serves as a southern border.\nOn the airport's southern border, Saudi Aramco occupies an area of 250\u00A0km\u00B2 (97\u00A0mi\u00B2) which is used for oil drilling and transportation facilities.\nTerminals.\nThe terminal has six stories, three of which are allocated for passenger processing. The third level is for arrivals, the sixth level is for departures, and the fourth level is for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine level (which is the uppermost level).\nThe passenger terminal\u2019s total area is 327,000 m\u00B2 (3,519,798\u00A0ft\u00B2). Approximately 247,500 m\u00B2 (2,664,067\u00A0ft\u00B2) were built in the first phase, in addition to 11 fixed passenger boarding bridges serving 15 gates out of an original design capacity of 31 fixed boarding bridges.\nThe terminal has several customer counters of which 66 were allocated to Saudia (now shared with Nas Air), 44 to foreign airlines and the rest for Customs and Immigration.\nServices and amenities.\nThe airport has several duty-free stores.

A distance of separates the two runways to facilitate simultaneous takeoff and landing operations. For more convenience and shorter taxiing durations, the east runway is usually used by Saudi Aramco while commercial airlines use the west one, however situation changes if one of the runways is undergoing maintenance. Space has been set aside for the construction of a third parallel runway.\nThe airport is classified as Code E by ICAO which makes it designed to accommodate large aircraft lke Boeing 747-400 and A340-600.
