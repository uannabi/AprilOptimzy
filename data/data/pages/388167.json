{"id":388167,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriaria","text":"\"Coriaria\" is a genus of plants. It is the only genus currently known in the Coriariaceae family. About 15-20 species are currently known.\nDescription.\nMost of the species are shrubs but some are subshrubs (small shrubs) or small trees. Leaves are simple, opposite or whorled, with 3 to 9 major veins coming from the base.\nThe fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes) protected by enlarged and colored petals. Fruits cannot be eaten because their seeds are poisonous; in some species, mainly those from New Zealand, the petals that protect the true fruits can be eaten. Several species of this genus can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria of genus \"Frankia\" in their roots.\nName.\nThe name of the genus \"Coriaria\" was given by Linnaeus in 1753 in \"Species Plantarum\" (Vol. 2, page 1037). The type species is \"Coriaria myrtifolia\" L.\n\"Coriaria\" comes from the Latin word \"corium\", meaning \"leather\" because these plants have a substance named tannin which is used to make leather from skins.\nThe several New Zealand species are known by the M\u0101ori name of \"tutu\".\nUses.\nSome species of \"Coriaria\" are used to produce leather from skins of different animals (cattle, horses).\nIn New Zealand, the Maori people make a juice with the \"fruits\" (actually the petals) of \"tutu\". In Chile, the nuts are used to make poison for rats and mice.\nBecause they produce many bright, colored fruits, some species of \"Coriaria\" are used as ornamental plants.\nSpecies.\nIn the genus \"Coriaria\" (y en la familia \"Coriariaceae\") there are about 17 species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus_(biology)","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":25},{"uri":"Coriariaceae","surface_form":"Coriariaceae","offset":77},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":176},{"uri":"Subshrub","surface_form":"subshrub","offset":196},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":230},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"Leaves","offset":237},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":344},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nut","offset":371},{"uri":"Achene","surface_form":"achene","offset":377},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"petal","offset":420},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":465},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":475},{"uri":"Nitrogen_fixation","surface_form":"fix nitrogen","offset":622},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":666},{"uri":"Carolus_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Linnaeus","offset":762},{"uri":"Species_Plantarum","surface_form":"Species Plantarum","offset":783},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":827},{"uri":"Coriaria_myrtifolia","surface_form":"Coriaria myrtifolia","offset":844},{"uri":"Carolus_Linnaeus","surface_form":"L.","offset":865},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":894},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":924},{"uri":"Tannin","surface_form":"tannin","offset":977},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":1019},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":1038},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_language","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":1075},{"uri":"Tutu_(plant)","surface_form":"tutu","offset":1090},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":1191},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":1199},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":1319},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":1352},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":1361},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":1456}]}
