{"id":3882,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet","text":"A healthy diet or balanced diet is a diet (what you eat) that contains the right amounts of all the food groups. It includes fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and protein. It does not include too much or too little of any kind of food. Eating wrong amounts of a food group, whether it be too much or too little, is called an \"unhealthy diet\" or an \"imbalanced diet\". A healthy diet is one that includes more foods that come from plants and fewer convenience foods.\nBasic nutrition.\nWhat is known about nutrition and diet keeps changing as more is learned. However, basic nutrition remains much the same. The best advice is to talk to a doctor or dietitian for personalized information based on an individual's lifestyle, health, and food likes and dislikes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diet_(nutrition)","surface_form":"diet","offset":37},{"uri":"Food_group","surface_form":"food group","offset":100},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":125},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":132},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":144},{"uri":"Dairy_products","surface_form":"dairy products","offset":152},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":172},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":438},{"uri":"Convenience_food","surface_form":"convenience food","offset":455},{"uri":"Nutrition","surface_form":"nutrition","offset":511},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":645},{"uri":"Dietitian","surface_form":"dietitian","offset":655},{"uri":"Lifestyle","surface_form":"lifestyle","offset":719},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":730}]}
