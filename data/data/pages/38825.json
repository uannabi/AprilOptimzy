The substance in which the solute is dissolved (shown as the water in the example) is known as the solvent.\nTo concentrate a solution, one must add more solute, or reduce the amount of solvent. To dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":3},{"uri":"Chemical_substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":45},{"uri":"Mix","surface_form":"mix","offset":58},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolved","offset":110},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solute","offset":174},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":281},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":307}]}
