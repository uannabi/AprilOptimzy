{"id":388310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system","text":"In physics, a physical system is any object or part of an object that can be analysed with the laws of physics. An atom or the water in a lake can both be considered as physical systems. Everything outside the system is called the environment, which in the analysis is ignored except for its effects on the system.\nPhysical systems are different to conceptual systems, which study theoretical objects, ideas or concepts (such as the Turing machine).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":3},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysed","offset":77},{"uri":"Laws_of_physics","surface_form":"laws of physics","offset":95},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":115},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":127},{"uri":"Environment_(systems)","surface_form":"environment","offset":231},{"uri":"Effect","surface_form":"effects","offset":292},{"uri":"Conceptual_system","surface_form":"conceptual system","offset":349},{"uri":"Theoretical_physics","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":381},{"uri":"Turing_machine","surface_form":"Turing machine","offset":433}]}
