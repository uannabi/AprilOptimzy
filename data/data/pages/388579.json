{"id":388579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylily","text":"Daylily is the common name of a \"Hemerocallis\". Daylily flowers can have different colors and shapes. The flowers are popular around gardener groups because they are easy to grow and can be easily mutated.\nThe name Hemerocallis comes from the Greek words \u1F21\u03BC\u03AD\u03C1\u03B1 (h\u0113mera) \"day\" and \u03BA\u03B1\u03BB\u03CC\u03C2 (kalos) \"beautiful\". The name suggest that this flower will bloom only for one day, as in \"H. fulva\", also called ditch lily.\nThe flowers of some daylilies can be eaten and are used in the Chinese kitchen. They are sold in Asian markets as gum jum or golden needles (\u91D1\u9488 in Chinese; pinyin: j\u012Bnzh\u0113n) or yellow flower vegetables (\u9EC3\u82B1\u83DC in Chinese; pinyin: hu\u00E1nghu\u0101c\u00E0i).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
