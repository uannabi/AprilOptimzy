He was best known for writing the novel, \"Things Fall Apart\" which was first printed in 1958. It is the most widely read book in modern African literature. Achebe went to Nigeria's first university, University College. Achebe wrote his first short story, \"In a Village Church,\" at university.\nLife.\nAchebe was an Igbo man. The Igbo are one of the biggest tribes in Nigeria. His parents were Christians. They gave him the English name Albert. His full Igbo name is \"Chinualumogu,\" which means \"may God fight on my behalf.\"\nUniversity.\nAchebe went to University College in Ibadan to study medicine on a scholarship, but then decided to study English, history, and theology after reading a book written by a white man that made Nigerians and Africans look bad. He wanted to tell the world stories that did not make Africans look bad. Because he switched his field of study, he lost his scholarship.\nWriting style.\nAchebe's writing style is based on how the Igbo tell stories orally (by word of mouth). The Igbo did not write down their stories before Europeans came to Africa. His stories use a lot of folk tales, songs, and proverbs. The characters in his book also make long speeches.\nUse of the English language.\nMany other African writers criticized Achebe for writing in English instead of in an African language. They said that by using the colonizer's language, he was spreading neo-colonial ideas that were preventing progress in Africa.\nAchebe said that writing in English let everyone in Nigeria read in one language. Before colonization, the different tribes spoke different languages. He also said that writing in English allowed for people in other countries read his stories. However, he says that there are many African concepts and words that cannot be fully expressed in English.\nAchebe wrote in English but used it in ways that reflected an African style.\nThemes.\nThemes are the ideas or topics that are present in a story.\nCulture and colonialism.\nIn his writing, Achebe talks about African culture and the effects of European colonization on African societies.\nMasculinity and Femininity.\nAchebe's stories also talk about gender roles.\nInfluence.\nAchebe has influenced many other modern African writers. He got a lot of awards for his stories. Even to this day, people still talk about him and the stories he wrote.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":88},{"uri":"Novelist","surface_form":"novelist","offset":97},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":107},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":113},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"critic","offset":128},{"uri":"Things_Fall_Apart","surface_form":"Things Fall Apart","offset":178},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":723},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":737},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":785},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":798},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1409},{"uri":"Neocolonialism","surface_form":"neo-colonial","offset":1519}]}
