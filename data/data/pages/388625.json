{"id":388625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilbara","text":"The Pilbara is a large, thinly populated region in the north of Western Australia. The region has (2010) a population of about 48,600.\nPilbara is known for Aboriginal peoples, its stunning landscapes, its red earth and its vast mineral deposits, in particular iron ore. It is a dry region, but it has cyclones every year or two. The cyclones bring a great deal of rain when they do occur.\nThe area is known for its petroleum, natural gas and iron ore deposits, which make up much of the economy of Western Australia. Other than mining, pastoral activities as well as fishing and tourism are the main industries.\nThe Pilbara covers an area of 502,000\u00A0km\u00B2. It includes some of Earth's oldest rock formations in the Pilbara craton. This is one of the world's oldest undisturbed rock formations, dating back to the Archaean eon. It includes landscapes of coastal plains and mountain ranges with cliffs and gorges. The major settlements of the region are Port Hedland, Karratha and Newman.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":64},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Aboriginal peoples","offset":156},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":189},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":228},{"uri":"Iron_ore","surface_form":"iron ore","offset":260},{"uri":"Cyclone","surface_form":"cyclone","offset":301},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"petroleum","offset":415},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":426},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":528},{"uri":"Pilbara_craton","surface_form":"Pilbara craton","offset":713},{"uri":"Archaean","surface_form":"Archaean","offset":811},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":820},{"uri":"Port_Hedland%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Port Hedland","offset":950},{"uri":"Karratha%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Karratha","offset":964},{"uri":"Newman%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Newman","offset":977}]}
