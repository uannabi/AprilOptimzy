His mother, Katherine Levison, was of English and Irish Jewish descent. His father, the pianist Micha\u0142 Bergson, was of Polish Jewish descent.\nHis early childhood was spent mostly in London after his birth. He learned the English language from his mother. He returned to Paris when he was nine years old, and became a naturalized French citizen.\nHe attended the \"Lyc\u00E9e Fontanes\" in Paris from 1868 to 1878. There he was given the 1877 prize for school mathematics, for the solution of a mathematical problem. When he was nineteen, he studied at \u00C9cole Normale Sup\u00E9rieure (ENS). He read many philosophy books, especially Herbert Spencer.\nHe was given the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature.\nIn 4 January 1941, Bergson died in occupied Paris from bronchitis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":62},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":69},{"uri":"Rationalism","surface_form":"rationalism","offset":206},{"uri":"Reality","surface_form":"reality","offset":248},{"uri":"Rue_Lamartine","surface_form":"Rue Lamartine","offset":276},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":293},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":300},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":364},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":490},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":529},{"uri":"Mathematical","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":794},{"uri":"%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure","surface_form":"\u00C9cole Normale Sup\u00E9rieure","offset":852},{"uri":"Herbert_Spencer","surface_form":"Herbert Spencer","offset":926},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":965}]}
