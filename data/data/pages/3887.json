{"id":3887,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature","text":"Literature is a group of works of art made up of words. Most are written, but some are passed on by word of mouth. Literature usually means works of poetry and prose that are especially well written. There are many different kinds of literature, such as poetry, plays, or novels. They can also be put into groups through their language, historical period, origin, genre, and subject. The word \"literature\" comes from the Latin word \"learning, writing, grammar\".\nMost of the earliest works were epic poems. Epic poems are long stories or myths about adventures. \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharta\", two Indian epics, are still read today. \"Odyssey\" and \"Iliad\" are two famous Greek poems by Homer. They were passed down through speaking and written down around the 8th century BC.\nLiterature can also mean imaginative or creative writing, which is looked at for its artistic value.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":34},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":49},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":149},{"uri":"Prose","surface_form":"prose","offset":160},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":272},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":327},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":337},{"uri":"Literary_genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":364},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":421},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":443},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":452},{"uri":"Epic_poem","surface_form":"epic poem","offset":494},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":537},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":682},{"uri":"Imagination","surface_form":"imaginative","offset":797},{"uri":"Creative","surface_form":"creative","offset":812},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":857}]}
