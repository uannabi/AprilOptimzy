{"id":388819,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herm%C3%B3%C3%B0r","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hermodr (Old Norse:\u00A0\"Herm\u00F3\u00F0r\"\u00A0- \u201CSpirit of War\u201D) is the messenger of the gods in Norse mythology, and is the fastest among the\u00A0\u00C6sir. When Baldr died, Herm\u00F3\u00F0r volunteered to go to Niflheimr to ask Hel to release Odin's beloved son. Herm\u00F3\u00F0r was said to have galloped on the horse Sleipnir for nine days and nine nights.\nJourney to Hel.\nUpon reaching the dreaded world of ice and mist, Herm\u00F3\u00F0r encountered the female j\u00F6tunn M\u00F3\u00F0gu\u00F0r (Old Norse: \u201CFurious Battler\u201D), guardian of Gjallarbr\u00FA, the bridge which spans the river Gj\u00F6ll (Old Norse: Gj\u01EBll - \u201CNoisy\u201D), which separates the realm of the living and the dead. When Herm\u00F3\u00F0r stated his business as to why he wished to enter Hel, M\u00F3\u00F0gu\u00F0r let him pass. He finally met with Hel, and begged her to release Baldr. Hel eventually agreed to his request, on the condition that all of creation weep for Baldr.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":22},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":94},{"uri":"%C3%86sir","surface_form":"\u00C6sir","offset":140},{"uri":"Balder","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":151},{"uri":"Niflheim","surface_form":"Niflheimr","offset":192},{"uri":"Hel","surface_form":"Hel","offset":209},{"uri":"Sleipnir","surface_form":"Sleipnir","offset":291},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tunn","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunn","offset":427},{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":538}]}
