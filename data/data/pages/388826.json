{"id":388826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%93nir","text":"e=\"preserve\">H\u0153nir is a warrior god in Norse mythology. He is sometimes confused with Vili. H\u0153nir is part of the Aesir. H\u0153nir and Mimir were hostages in a war between the Aesir and Vanir gods. He was also an original Aesir god himself. H\u0153nir usually relied on Mimir. H\u0153nir is the god of silence, spirituality, poetry and of passion.\nHoenir is the travel companion of Odin and Loki and was also part of the creation of Ask and Embla.\nH\u0153nir goes with M\u00EDmir to the Vanir as hostage, in order to seal a truce to the \u00C6sir-Vanir war. During the negotiations, H\u0153nir heavily relies on M\u00EDmir to address any query, as the latter was better informed and knowledgeable. The Vanir perceived this indecision and thus noticing a character flaw within H\u0153nir, which resulted in beheading M\u00EDmir as retaliation, thinking the \u00C6sir cheated them in their hostage exchange. H\u0153nir is one of the few gods to survive Ragnar\u00F6k.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":39},{"uri":"Vili","surface_form":"Vili","offset":86},{"uri":"Silence","surface_form":"silence","offset":287},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":367}]}
