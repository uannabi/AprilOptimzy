A port was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986. It was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in North America and Europe in 2008 and 2009.\nGameplay.\nDonkey Kong has taken cover in Stanley's greenhouse. Stanley is a bugman, and must stop insects from destroying his flowers. He does this by killing them with bug spray. The main goal is to shoot Donkey Kong with the bug spray and force him to the top of the vine he is on while killing the insects. When Donkey Kong gets to the top, the player moves on to the next stage. The player can also complete a stage by killing all of the insects, which forces Donkey Kong to the top. At the start of a stage, Stanley can get a special bug spray which allows him to shoot Donkey Kong up at a faster rate. It is on one of Donkey Kong's vines. It is dropped when Donkey Kong reaches the point on the vine where the bug spray is. It only lasts for a certain amount of shots.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arcade_game","surface_form":"arcade","offset":22},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":29},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":48},{"uri":"Donkey_Kong_(video_game)","surface_form":"Donkey Kong","offset":95},{"uri":"Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"Nintendo Entertainment System","offset":151},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":223},{"uri":"Virtual_Console","surface_form":"Virtual Console","offset":227},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":246},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":264},{"uri":"Donkey_Kong","surface_form":"Donkey Kong","offset":299},{"uri":"Greenhouse","surface_form":"greenhouse","offset":340},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":387},{"uri":"Bug_spray","surface_form":"bug spray","offset":458},{"uri":"Vine","surface_form":"vine","offset":558}]}
