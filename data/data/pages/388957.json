It is part of the Joliette Regional County Municipality. It is located along the western shores of the L'Assomption River.\nHistory.\nSainte-M\u00E9lanie used to be part of the territory of the Ailleboust Seignory, which was given to Jean d'Ailleboust d'Argenteuil (1694-1785) in 1736. By 1800, Pierre-Louis Panet (1761-1812) was Lord of Ailleboust. His daughter Charlotte-M\u00E9lanie Panet (1794-1872) may have been the source of the name Sainte-M\u00E9lanie, also a reference to Melania the Younger (383-439). Charlotte-M\u00E9lanie's husband, Marc-Antoine-Louis L\u00E9vesque (1782-1833), donated the land in 1814 for a chapel that was built in 1830. The Parish of Sainte-M\u00E9lanie was founded in 1832. Four years later, in 1836, the post office opened under the name Daillebout.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":20},{"uri":"Lanaudi%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Lanaudi\u00E8re","offset":40},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":61},{"uri":"Joliette_Regional_County_Municipality","surface_form":"Joliette Regional County Municipality","offset":95},{"uri":"L%27Assomption_River","surface_form":"L'Assomption River","offset":180},{"uri":"Seigneurial_system_of_New_France","surface_form":"Ailleboust Seignory","offset":264},{"uri":"Pierre-Louis_Panet","surface_form":"Pierre-Louis Panet","offset":365},{"uri":"Melania_the_Younger","surface_form":"Melania the Younger","offset":542}]}
