{"id":388961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_river_stingray","text":"The long-tailed river stingray (\"Plesiotrygon iwamae\"), also known as the antenna ray, is a species of freshwater stingray in the family Potamotrygonidae.\nThese animals have a long tail, small eyes, and few pectoral-fin radials.\nThey eat worms, crustaceans, mollusks, and small bottom fish (such as small catfish). They can detect electrical and chemical signals from prey in mud and sand.\nThe species was mentioned in 1987 by Hugo P. Castello from Museu de Zoologia, University of S\u00E3o Paulo. Examples were then found in other museums that had been given wrong names or identified incorrectly.\nThis fish does not appear often in the aquarium trade.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":92},{"uri":"River_stingray","surface_form":"freshwater stingray","offset":103},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":130},{"uri":"Potamotrygonidae","surface_form":"Potamotrygonidae","offset":137},{"uri":"Pectoral_fin","surface_form":"pectoral-fin","offset":207},{"uri":"Worm","surface_form":"worm","offset":238},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":245},{"uri":"Mollusk","surface_form":"mollusk","offset":258},{"uri":"Catfish","surface_form":"catfish","offset":305},{"uri":"University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo","surface_form":"University of S\u00E3o Paulo","offset":468}]}
