{"id":389022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(geometry)","text":"A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape. It has triangular sides that come together in a point at the top, call the \"apex\". A pyramid with a square base (bottom) and four sides is called a square pyramid. A pyramid with a triangular base and is called a tetrahedron.\nThis means that one must find the volume by multiplying the base (B) by the height (h), then dividing the product by three.\nEither way works, but the technical formula for the volume of a pyramid is the former, due to its use of the capital B, which is shorthand for length and width as previously mentioned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":33},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangular","offset":47},{"uri":"Apex","surface_form":"apex","offset":116},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":140},{"uri":"Base","surface_form":"base","offset":147},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedron","offset":253}]}
