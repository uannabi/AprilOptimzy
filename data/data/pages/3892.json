{"id":3892,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease","text":"e=\"preserve\">A protease is a digestive enzyme. It breaks down long chains of proteins into shorter amino acids. Proteases have evolved a number of times. We know this because different kinds of protease can do the same reaction in completely different ways. Proteases are found in animals, plants, bacteria, archaea and viruses.\nNow more than 50 types of protease are known. Each is a separate evolutionary origin of proteolysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":39},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":77},{"uri":"Amino_acids","surface_form":"amino acids","offset":99},{"uri":"Convergent_evolution","surface_form":"evolved","offset":127},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":281},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":290},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":298},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":308},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":320}]}
