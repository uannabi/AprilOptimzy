{"id":38933,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alto_flute","text":"The alto flute is a flute that plays a fourth (half an octave) lower than the regular flute. It is longer than the regular flute. Sometimes alto flutes have a bent part at the top end.\nThe alto flute is a transposing instrument. This makes it easy for someone who plays the flute to play on the alto flute. The fingering for the note C on the flute will give a G on the alto flute.\nThe alto flute is not very often used, and only in very large orchestras. Maurice Ravel wrote a beautiful tune for alto flute in \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00E9\". Igor Stravinsky used one in \"The Rite of Spring\". In \"The Planets\" by Gustav Holst there is a passage with three flutes and alto flute playing 4 part harmony.\nThe alto flute must not be confused with a bass flute which is even bigger and lower and very unusual indeed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":20},{"uri":"Octave","surface_form":"octave","offset":55},{"uri":"Transposing_instrument","surface_form":"transposing instrument","offset":205},{"uri":"Maurice_Ravel","surface_form":"Maurice Ravel","offset":456},{"uri":"Daphnis_et_Chlo%C3%A9","surface_form":"Daphnis et Chlo\u00E9","offset":512},{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Igor Stravinsky","offset":531},{"uri":"The_Rite_of_Spring","surface_form":"The Rite of Spring","offset":560},{"uri":"The_Planets","surface_form":"The Planets","offset":585},{"uri":"Gustav_Holst","surface_form":"Gustav Holst","offset":601},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmony","offset":681}]}
