{"id":389448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order","text":"\"Law & Order\" was an American television show and is aired on NBC from September 13, 1990 to May 24, 2010. It is a police procedural, violence, bloody violence and drama. It's the longest primetime crime drama show ever in America. Season 0 (Pre-1) (Pilot) could've been aired in 1988.\nMany of the crimes in the episodes were \"ripped from the headlines\", meaning they were based on crimes that really happened. Episodes of the show were usually split into two parts. The first part would show the crime, the police looking for the suspect (the person they think did the crime), and the suspect being arrested. This is the \"Law\" part. The second part, the \"Order\" part, would show the trial and whether or not the suspect did the crime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":21},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":62},{"uri":"Police_procedural","surface_form":"police procedural","offset":115},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":134},{"uri":"Bloody_violence","surface_form":"bloody violence","offset":144},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":164},{"uri":"Primetime","surface_form":"primetime","offset":188},{"uri":"Suspect","surface_form":"suspect","offset":531}]}
