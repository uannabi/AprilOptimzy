It is secreted from the liver of most vertebrate animals, and is often stored in the gall bladder. Bile helps digest fat.\nThe name \"gall\" comes from the Greek word \"chol\u00E8\" meaning green or yellow.\nThe term cholesterol and the illness cholera were named after gall.\nBile is also stored in bile ducts. Often after liver transplants, bile comes out of the body.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":43},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":74},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":88},{"uri":"Gall_bladder","surface_form":"gall bladder","offset":135},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digest","offset":160},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":167},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":203},{"uri":"Cholera","surface_form":"cholera","offset":284}]}
