{"id":389647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bures","text":"Mount Bures is a village and civil parish in Colchester borough, Essex, England. It is above the River Stour, north-west from Colchester and south-east of Sudbury.\nMount Bures takes its name from the \"Mount\" or \"Mound\" which is at the centre of the village, and \"bur\" which means building or dwelling. Mount Bures was previously called Bures Saint John, Little Bures or Bures Sackville to distinguish it from Bures Hamlet and Bures Saint Mary.\nThe railway opened in 1848 and runs through the centre of the village. The nearest railway station is at Bures Hamlet. The village has a church called St John's Baptist Church. It is close to the mount.\nThe parish has no main focus of settlement, but many scattered small settlements around tyes or greens; for example, Downing Tye, Mount Green, Janks Green, and Piotts Green. In 2011, there were 249 people living in Mount Bures.\nMount Bures has a rich historical background in relation to the Boudiccan revolt. The \"motte\" (mound) of Mount Bures is most commonly recognised as Boudicca\u2019s Mount; due to the ideology that the queen\u2019s warriors were buried here.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civil_parish","surface_form":"civil parish","offset":29},{"uri":"Colchester_borough","surface_form":"Colchester borough","offset":45},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":65},{"uri":"River_Stour","surface_form":"River Stour","offset":97},{"uri":"Colchester","surface_form":"Colchester","offset":126},{"uri":"Sudbury","surface_form":"Sudbury","offset":155},{"uri":"Boudicca","surface_form":"Boudicca","offset":939}]}
