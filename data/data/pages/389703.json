{"id":389703,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_Arm","text":"The Perseus Arm is one of two major spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. The second major arm is called the Scutum\u2013Centaurus Arm.\nThe Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms and a number of minor arms or spurs. The Perseus Spiral Arm, with a radius of about 10,700 parsecs, is between the minor Cygnus and Carina\u2013Sagittarius Arms. It is so named because it is seen in the same direction as the constellation Perseus.\nThe local spur known as the Orion\u2013Cygnus Arm, which includes the Solar System and Earth, may be a branch of the Perseus Arm, but this is unconfirmed.\nIt also contains a star 100 times larger than the sun.
