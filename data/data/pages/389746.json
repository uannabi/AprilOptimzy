{"id":389746,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","text":"The Russian Academy of Sciences (, shortened to, \"RAN\") consists of the national academy of Russia and a network of scientific research institutes from across the country. It also includes other scientific and social groups like libraries, publishing units and hospitals.\nLike the French Academy of Sciences and unlike The Royal Society in Britain, the Russian Academy of Sciences has two types of membership. The top-level members are academicians (861 scientists, as of November 2020). The next-level members are corresponding members (1114 scientists). There are also professors of the RAN (605 scientists). 3 professors became academicians and 104 professors became corresponding members. These are now counted twice: as professors and as members. The last elections were organized in November 2019. To be elected to the Academy is a great honor for any researcher.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_academy","surface_form":"national academy","offset":72},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":92},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":127},{"uri":"Institution","surface_form":"institutes","offset":136},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"libraries","offset":229},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishing","offset":240},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":261},{"uri":"French_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"French Academy of Sciences","offset":281},{"uri":"The_Royal_Society","surface_form":"The Royal Society","offset":319},{"uri":"Academician","surface_form":"academicians","offset":436},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":571}]}
