{"id":390023,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_Next_Generation","text":"The Boeing 737 Next Generation, often called the 737NG, is a family of Boeing 737s. The 737-600, -700, -800 and -900 are all 737NG aircraft. It is the third family of Boeing 737. The family which came before it is the 737 Classic (\u2212300/-400/-500) family. They have been made since 1996 by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. All 737s are twin-engined, narrow-body airliner<nowiki/>s. This means that they all have two engines and only have one aisle between seats.\n4,293 737NG aircraft have been delivered (as of December 2012). More than 6,300 have been ordered by airlines. Southwest Airlines has more 737NGs than any other airline. Ryanair, a low-cost airline from Ireland, also has a lot of 737NGs. The only planes Ryanair has are 737-800s. The main rival of the 737NG family is the Airbus A320 family. The Boeing 737 MAX will eventually replace the 737NG.\nBackground.\nAfter Airbus launched the Airbus A320, Boeing started designing a new series of Boeing 737. The \"737 Next Generation\" (NG) program was announced on November 17, 1993. Boeing made many changes from the 737 Classic. The wing was changed. These changes made its area bigger by 25%. The wingspan was made bigger by 16\u00A0ft (4.88\u00A0m). These changes meant that it could carry 30% more fuel. CFM56-7B engines were used. These improvements allowed the 737 to fly 900\u00A0nmi farther.\nInside.\nThe inside of the 737 Next Generation was better than the style used on the Boeing 757-200 and the Boeing 737 Classic. It used certain parts of the Boeing 777's inside style. The style of the 737 Next Generation was made the usual style of the Boeing 757-300.\nIn 2010, the inside of the 737NG was changed to look like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new design was called the Boeing Sky Interior. The Sky Interior can only be put into new aircraft. However, a different company has made a style for 737 and 757 aircraft which looks like the Sky Interior.\nMaking and testing.\nThe first 737NG was a 737\u2212700. The prototype \u2212800 was finished on June 30, 1997 and first flew on July 31, 1997. The smallest 737NG, the 737\u2212600 series, is the same size as the \u2212500. The FAA said it was allowed to fly on August 18, 1998.\nFurther developments.\nIn July 2008, Boeing brought out new brakes for 737NGs. They are supposed to replace the steel brakes. They will make the brakes lighter. less weight on a Boeing 737-800 means that 0.5% less fuel will be burned. Delta Air Lines got the first 737NG with these brakes. The plane was a 737-700.\nOn August 21, 2006, Sky News said that some 737NGs had faulty parts. The report said that Boeing had found some parts of the plane to be faulty, but they did not fix it. Boeing said that these statements were \"without merit\". This means that Boeing thinks Sky News is wrong. However, another show looked at 737NGs and also thought that some things were faulty.\nReplacement.\nSince 2006, Boeing has been thinking about replacing the 737 with a completely new design.\nOn July 20, 2011, Boeing said it would make a new version of the 737. It would have the CFM International LEAP-X engine.American Airlines said it would order 100 of these planes. The plane will probably be finished in 2016 or 2017.\nOn August 30, 2011, Boeing said it would definitely make this new plane. They called it the Boeing 737 MAX. The CFM International LEAP-1B engines that it will use burns 16% less fuel than the Airbus A320. The 737 MAX's main rival will be the Airbus A320neo family.\n737-600.\nThe 737-600 replaces the 737-500. Its main rival is the Airbus A318. 69 737-600s have been made.\nAs of 2012, Boeing has taken the 737-600 out of its list of prices. This might mean that the 737-600 is not being made anymore.\n737-700.\nThe 737-700 replaces the 737-300. It began being used in 1998. Its main rival is the Airbus A319. Southwest Airlines has the most 737-700s. They have more than 400 of them.\nThe \"737-700C\" is a version where the seats can be taken out to carry cargo instead. There is a big door on the left of the aircraft. The United States Navy got the first 737-700C. The Navy planes are called the C-40 Clipper.\n737-700ER.\nThe \"737-700ER\" (\"ER\" means \"extended range\") came out on January 31, 2006. It can fly for. The 737-700ER's main rival is the Airbus A319LR.\n737-800.\nThe 737-800 is a longer version of the 737-700. It replaces the 737-400. For many airlines in the United States, the 737-800 replaced Boeing 727-200s.\nThe 737-800 is one of the planes which replaces the McDonnell Douglas MD-80. It burns of fuel every hour. That is about 80% less fuel than an MD-80.\nOn August 14, 2008, American Airlines said it was ordering 26 737-800s. 2,135 -800s have been delivered.\nThe 737-800's main rival is the Airbus A320.\n737-900.\nThe 737-900 is the longest 737 ever made. Alaska Airlines got the first -900 on May 15, 2001. The 737-900 has the same MTOW as the \u2212800. It also does not carry any more fuel. The 737-900 can carry more luggage but cannot fly as far. This meant that it could not be a rival to the Airbus A321.\n737-900ER.\nThe \"737-900ER\" (\"ER\" for \"extended range\") is the newest Boeing 737. It was made to replace the 757-200. It was also made to be a rival to the Airbus A321.\nThe 737-900ER can carry more fuel than other 737s. It also has winglets.\nThe first 737-900ER was finished on August 8, 2006. Lion Air got the first 737-900ER on April 27, 2007. Lion Air has ordered 166 737-900ERs as of August 2011.\nOn August 22, 2011, it was said that Delta Air Lines ordered 100 737-900ERs. That is the biggest single order for this type of 737.\nUsers.\nAs of July 2010, 3,119 Boeing 737 Next Generation planes are being used by airlines. There are 62 -600s, 1,019 -700s, 1,915 -800s and 123 -900s.\nOrders and deliveries.\n\"Data through December 31, 2012. Updated on January 7, 2013.\"\nAccidents.\nThe Boeing 737 Next Generation series has been involved in 8 hull-loss accidents and 7 hijackings. people have died in these. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is damaged so much it cannot be repaired, or if it is completely destroyed.The most notable accidents are shown here.\nDetails.\nSources: Boeing 737 Specifications, 737 Airport Planning Report","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Boeing_737","surface_form":"Boeing 737","offset":71},{"uri":"Boeing_737_Classic","surface_form":"737 Classic","offset":218},{"uri":"Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes","surface_form":"Boeing Commercial Airplanes","offset":289},{"uri":"Airliner","surface_form":"airliner","offset":357},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":411},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":559},{"uri":"Southwest_Airlines","surface_form":"Southwest Airlines","offset":569},{"uri":"Ryanair","surface_form":"Ryanair","offset":628},{"uri":"Low-cost_airline","surface_form":"low-cost airline","offset":639},{"uri":"Airbus_A320_family","surface_form":"Airbus A320 family","offset":780},{"uri":"Boeing_737_MAX","surface_form":"Boeing 737 MAX","offset":804},{"uri":"Airbus","surface_form":"Airbus","offset":872},{"uri":"Airbus_A320","surface_form":"Airbus A320","offset":892},{"uri":"Boeing_737","surface_form":"Boeing 737","offset":946},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":1125},{"uri":"Boeing_757","surface_form":"Boeing 757-200","offset":1419},{"uri":"Boeing_737_Classic","surface_form":"Boeing 737 Classic","offset":1442},{"uri":"Boeing_777","surface_form":"Boeing 777","offset":1491},{"uri":"Boeing_787_Dreamliner","surface_form":"Boeing 787 Dreamliner","offset":1665},{"uri":"Prototype","surface_form":"prototype","offset":1952},{"uri":"FAA","surface_form":"FAA","offset":2104},{"uri":"Delta_Air_Lines","surface_form":"Delta Air Lines","offset":2389},{"uri":"Sky_News","surface_form":"Sky News","offset":2489},{"uri":"CFM_International_LEAP-X","surface_form":"CFM International LEAP-X","offset":3022},{"uri":"American_Airlines","surface_form":"American Airlines","offset":3054},{"uri":"Boeing_737_MAX","surface_form":"Boeing 737 MAX","offset":3258},{"uri":"Airbus_A320","surface_form":"Airbus A320","offset":3358},{"uri":"Airbus_A320neo_family","surface_form":"Airbus A320neo family","offset":3408},{"uri":"Airbus_A318","surface_form":"Airbus A318","offset":3496},{"uri":"737-300","surface_form":"737-300","offset":3699},{"uri":"Airbus_A319","surface_form":"Airbus A319","offset":3759},{"uri":"Southwest_Airlines","surface_form":"Southwest Airlines","offset":3772},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":3985},{"uri":"C-40_Clipper","surface_form":"C-40 Clipper","offset":4059},{"uri":"Boeing_737-400","surface_form":"737-400","offset":4298},{"uri":"Boeing_727","surface_form":"Boeing 727-200","offset":4368},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas_MD-80","surface_form":"McDonnell Douglas MD-80","offset":4437},{"uri":"American_Airlines","surface_form":"American Airlines","offset":4554},{"uri":"Airbus_A320","surface_form":"Airbus A320","offset":4671},{"uri":"Alaska_Airlines","surface_form":"Alaska Airlines","offset":4735},{"uri":"Maximum_Takeoff_Weight","surface_form":"MTOW","offset":4812},{"uri":"Airbus_A320_family","surface_form":"Airbus A321","offset":4973},{"uri":"Boeing_757","surface_form":"757-200","offset":5094},{"uri":"Winglet","surface_form":"winglet","offset":5217},{"uri":"Lion_Air","surface_form":"Lion Air","offset":5279},{"uri":"Delta_Air_Lines","surface_form":"Delta Air Lines","offset":5423},{"uri":"Aviation_accidents_and_incidents","surface_form":"hull-loss accidents","offset":5827},{"uri":"Aircraft_hijacking","surface_form":"hijackings","offset":5853}]}
