{"id":39009,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McMahon","text":"Sir William McMahon (23 February 1908 \u2013 31 March 1988) was the 20th Prime Minister of Australia. He was elected to the Australian parliament in 1949, and stayed as Member for Lowe, in Sydney, for 33 years. He challenged John Gorton for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1971 and won. He was 63 years old. He lost the next election in December 1972 to Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party. This made him the first Prime Minister not to win an election since Labor's Ben Chifley (who lost in 1949). McMahon was married to (Lady) Sonia McMahon from 1965 until his death from cancer. Actor Julian McMahon is their son.\nThe Liberal party had won lots of elections since 1949, but had some popularity problems by 1971. Australian soldiers were still in the Vietnam War. McMahon replaced John Gorton, then made him defence minister, but soon after made him resign for talking about problems in the Liberal Party. McMahon's government was the first to have a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Aboriginal land rights were an important topic of debate at this time. On foreign affairs, McMahon said the Opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, was wrong to visit communist China in 1972 - but soon after U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China and McMahon was embarrassed. The economy was not looking too good when the government went to the 1972 election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":68},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":86},{"uri":"Australian_parliament","surface_form":"Australian parliament","offset":119},{"uri":"Division_of_Lowe","surface_form":"Lowe","offset":175},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":184},{"uri":"John_Gorton","surface_form":"John Gorton","offset":220},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Liberal Party of Australia","offset":258},{"uri":"Gough_Whitlam","surface_form":"Gough Whitlam","offset":369},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Australian Labor Party","offset":390},{"uri":"Ben_Chifley","surface_form":"Ben Chifley","offset":490},{"uri":"Sonia_McMahon","surface_form":"Sonia McMahon","offset":552},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":597},{"uri":"Julian_McMahon","surface_form":"Julian McMahon","offset":611},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":776},{"uri":"Gough_Whitlam","surface_form":"Gough Whitlam","offset":1136},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":1170},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1180},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":1211},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":1226}]}
