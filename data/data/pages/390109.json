{"id":390109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Ranges","text":"The Mann Ranges are mountain ranges in central Australia. They are in the far northwest of South Australia, with a small section running over the border into the Northern Territory. Tha ranges are part of the geological region known as the Musgrave Block, which also includes the Petermann and Musgrave Ranges. Mountains in this region were formed in the Petermann Orogeny (600\u2013550 million years ago).\nThis area is part of the traditional country of the Pitjantjatjara nation. They associate it with spiritual stories about Wati Ngi\u1E49\u1E6Faka (the perentie lizard man), a creation spirit from the Dreamtime. He is said to have created the landforms while travelling through the area during the Dreamtime. His route forms a network of songlines that are spiritually important to native people. The largest communities in the area are Ka\u1E49pi and Nyapa\u1E5Fi.\nThe first European person to visit the area was William Gosse in 1873. With the help of local Aboriginal people, Gosse and his team explored the Mann Ranges after seeing the range from the top of Ulu\u1E5Fu. From the Mann Ranges, he went west to the Tomkinson Ranges, but turned back rather than trying to cross the Great Victoria Desert. He came back to the Mann Ranges and then went eastward to the Musgrave Ranges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":20},{"uri":"Central_Australia","surface_form":"central Australia","offset":39},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":91},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":162},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":209},{"uri":"Musgrave_Block","surface_form":"Musgrave Block","offset":240},{"uri":"Petermann_Ranges","surface_form":"Petermann","offset":280},{"uri":"Musgrave_Ranges","surface_form":"Musgrave Ranges","offset":294},{"uri":"Petermann_Orogeny","surface_form":"Petermann Orogeny","offset":355},{"uri":"Homeland","surface_form":"traditional country","offset":427},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":454},{"uri":"Australian_Aboriginal_mythology","surface_form":"spiritual stories","offset":500},{"uri":"Ngi%E1%B9%89%E1%B9%AFaka","surface_form":"Ngi\u1E49\u1E6Faka","offset":529},{"uri":"Goanna","surface_form":"perentie lizard","offset":543},{"uri":"Creation_story","surface_form":"creation","offset":567},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":576},{"uri":"Dreamtime","surface_form":"Dreamtime","offset":592},{"uri":"Songlines","surface_form":"songlines","offset":729},{"uri":"Ka%E1%B9%89pi%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Ka\u1E49pi","offset":828},{"uri":"Nyapa%E1%B9%9Fi%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Nyapa\u1E5Fi","offset":838},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":857},{"uri":"William_Gosse","surface_form":"William Gosse","offset":895},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu","offset":1043},{"uri":"Tomkinson_Ranges","surface_form":"Tomkinson Ranges","offset":1092},{"uri":"Great_Victoria_Desert","surface_form":"Great Victoria Desert","offset":1158}]}
