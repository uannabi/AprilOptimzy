{"id":390211,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_London","text":"The Port of London was the main port of London. It no longer operates as a port: see London Docklands for an account. The river now operates as an alternative means of travel for work and recreation. It is not a major commercial port for importing and exporting goods. The Port of London Authority is still the legal authority controlling all use of the river.\nThe port was in the Thames at the city center. Major import and export trade is now done at the container port at Felixstowe in Suffolk. In 2010 the British government started building a new port outside the city, on the north bank of the river in Thurrock, Essex. The new project is called: London Gateway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":32},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":40},{"uri":"London_Docklands","surface_form":"London Docklands","offset":85},{"uri":"Thames","surface_form":"Thames","offset":381},{"uri":"Containerization","surface_form":"container port","offset":457},{"uri":"Felixstowe","surface_form":"Felixstowe","offset":475},{"uri":"Suffolk","surface_form":"Suffolk","offset":489},{"uri":"Thurrock","surface_form":"Thurrock","offset":609},{"uri":"Essex","surface_form":"Essex","offset":619},{"uri":"London_Gateway","surface_form":"London Gateway","offset":653}]}
