In February 2003, Lane accomplished one of his life long dreams and toured over India with his band. When they left India, they were called \"true rock heroes\" by the people. In September 2003, when getting ready to make an album with the Swedish bassist Jonas Hellborg and drummer Ginger Baker, Lane had bad breathing problems.
