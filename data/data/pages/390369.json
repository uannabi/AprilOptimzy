{"id":390369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_(U.S._game_show)","text":"\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" (sometimes called \"Millionaire\") is an American quiz show based on the British show of the same name. One can win up to one million United States dollars ($1,000,000) on the show for answering fourteen (or fifteen in older versions) multiple choice trivia questions in a row.\nThe first version of the show was hosted by Regis Philbin and it aired on primetime on ABC. It aired from August 16, 1999 to June 27, 2002. The current syndicated version started airing on September 16, 2002. Meredith Vieira hosted it for eleven seasons, leaving to work on other projects. Cedric the Entertainer was signed up to be the next host, and episodes with Cedric started in September 2013. Cedric announced on April 30, 2014 that he would not return for a second season because of his busy schedule. Terry Crews was signed up to be the next host, and episodes with he started in September 2014. Terry announced then that he would not return for another season because of his busy schedule. Chris Harrison was signed up to be the next host, and episodes with him started in September 2015.\nThe format of the show has changed several times since the show has been on the air. The original format featured fifteen multiple choice questions that got harder as a player continued, and the money amounts got higher. Starting in 2008, the show started using a clock and contestants were timed. If time ran out, they were forced to walk away with the last prize amount they won. The format changed again in 2010 where the first ten questions had random money amounts and difficulty. The second round is then similar to the older Millionaire shows. There are only fourteen questions in this version.\nThe format was changed back in 2015, the format featured fourteen multiple choice questions that got harder as a player continued, the money amounts got higher, the first 10 question amounts are no longer randomized.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":71},{"uri":"Quiz_show","surface_form":"quiz show","offset":80},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":103},{"uri":"Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F","surface_form":"show of the same name","offset":111},{"uri":"Multiple_choice","surface_form":"multiple choice","offset":265},{"uri":"Trivia","surface_form":"trivia","offset":281},{"uri":"Regis_Philbin","surface_form":"Regis Philbin","offset":352},{"uri":"Primetime","surface_form":"primetime","offset":382},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":395},{"uri":"Syndicated","surface_form":"syndicated","offset":460},{"uri":"Meredith_Vieira","surface_form":"Meredith Vieira","offset":517},{"uri":"Cedric_the_Entertainer","surface_form":"Cedric the Entertainer","offset":598},{"uri":"Terry_Crews","surface_form":"Terry Crews","offset":818},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":1556}]}
