{"id":390443,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tjunti","text":"Tjunti is a soakage site near Ka\u1E3B\u1E6Fukatjara, in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is where the Hull River cuts through the Petermann Ranges. It is about to the southeast of Ka\u1E3B\u1E6Fukatjara (41\u00A0km by road, along the Tjukaruru Road). Tjunti is the site where the famous gold prospector Harold B. Lasseter took refuge on his fatal search for Lasseter's Reef. An outstation was established here in 1977, and belongs to a Pitjantjatjara family.\nThe gap in the mountains is formed here by the Hull River, a sandy creek that is usually dry. It splits the Curdie Range in the south from the Mannanana Range in the north. There are several soaks and rockholes in the area.\nThe small cave where Lasseter took refuge is (now commonly called Lasseter's Cave in English). This is an opening in a rock formation in the Mannanana Range (). Lasseter took shelter here for about 25 days during January 1931. He was trying to find a rich gold deposit that he claimed to have discovered in the area on an earlier expedition. His camels ran away, and he was stranded in the desert without food. While taking shelter in the cave, Lasseter wrote about his journey in his diary. He was later found by a local Pitjantjatjara family, who gave him food and water. After this, Lasseter decided to leave the cave and tried to walk the to Kata Tju\u1E6Fa. He was weak from dehydration, malnutrition and exhaustion, and he died three days later, after walking about.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soakage","surface_form":"soakage","offset":12},{"uri":"Kaltukatjara%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Ka\u1E3B\u1E6Fukatjara","offset":30},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":51},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":73},{"uri":"Hull_River","surface_form":"Hull River","offset":100},{"uri":"Petermann_Ranges","surface_form":"Petermann Ranges","offset":128},{"uri":"Great_Central_Road","surface_form":"Tjukaruru Road","offset":217},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":270},{"uri":"Prospecting","surface_form":"prospector","offset":275},{"uri":"Lasseter%27s_Reef","surface_form":"Lasseter's Reef","offset":341},{"uri":"Outstation","surface_form":"outstation","offset":361},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":419},{"uri":"Mountain_pass","surface_form":"gap","offset":446},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":503},{"uri":"Creek","surface_form":"creek","offset":509},{"uri":"Mount_Curdie","surface_form":"Curdie Range","offset":550},{"uri":"Mannanana_Range","surface_form":"Mannanana Range","offset":585},{"uri":"Rockhole","surface_form":"rockholes","offset":643},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":676},{"uri":"Rock_formation","surface_form":"rock formation","offset":785},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":996},{"uri":"Camel","surface_form":"camel","offset":1012},{"uri":"Stranded","surface_form":"stranded","offset":1040},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":1056},{"uri":"Diary","surface_form":"diary","offset":1151},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":1188},{"uri":"Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa","surface_form":"Kata Tju\u1E6Fa","offset":1312},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":1341},{"uri":"Malnutrition","surface_form":"malnutrition","offset":1354},{"uri":"Exhaust","surface_form":"exhaustion","offset":1371}]}
