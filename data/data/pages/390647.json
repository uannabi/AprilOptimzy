She was a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered to be a founder of the Discalced Carmelites along with John of the Cross.\nIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV and was in 1970 named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI. Her books, which include her autobiography (The Life of Teresa of Jesus) and her seminal work El Castillo Interior (The Interior Castle) are an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature as well as Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practices as she entails in her other important work, Camino de Perfecci\u00F3n (The Way of Perfection).\nQuote.\n'Would it not be gross ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country, or parents, he could not answer?
