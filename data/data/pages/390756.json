It is located at 10 Rockefeller Center in New York City. It is owned by Nintendo. It opened on May 14, 2005, replacing the Pok\u00E9mon Center that was there before.\nThe store is a two-story building. The first floor has Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and \"Pok\u00E9mon Black 2 and White 2\" sections. The second floor has a section with Wii consoles available for anyone to play. In addition, there are also Nintendo 3DS consoles available to play in the store. Some of the things that are sold there are exclusive to the store, meaning that they can only be bought there.\nThe store holds special tournaments and shows for new games. Early copies of the game and prizes are given out to the winners.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":70},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":79},{"uri":"Rockefeller_Center","surface_form":"Rockefeller Center","offset":128},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":150},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":180},{"uri":"Wii_U","surface_form":"Wii U","offset":324},{"uri":"Nintendo_3DS","surface_form":"Nintendo 3DS","offset":331},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Black_2_and_White_2","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Black 2 and White 2","offset":350},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":425},{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":685}]}
