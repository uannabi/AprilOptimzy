{"id":390843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Pinnacle","text":"Gill Pinnacle (or Gill's Pinnacle) is an inselberg in the far east of Western Australia, on the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. It is part of the Petermann Ranges. It consists of a dome-shaped hill, surrounded by dense shrub; its top is bare rock. The hill has been useful as a landmark, because it marks the location of one of the area's most reliable freshwater rockholes, Gordon's Springs. This is a few hundred meters to the north of the rock. The area is called (also spelled ' or ') in Pitjantjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra.\nThe first European people to visit the area were the explorers Ernest Giles and W. H. Tietkens, in 1874. They saw the rock from Weld Pass, which is further to the west. Giles named the rock after his brother-in-law. He named the waterhole, Gordon's Springs, after his nephew.\nThe closest town to Gill's Pinnacle is Kaltukatjara, Northern Territory, which is about to the east.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["mountain"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":70},{"uri":"Petermann_Ranges","surface_form":"Petermann Ranges","offset":135},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":208},{"uri":"Landmark","surface_form":"landmark","offset":267},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":342},{"uri":"Rockhole","surface_form":"rockholes","offset":353},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara_language","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":481},{"uri":"Ngaanyatjarra","surface_form":"Ngaanyatjarra","offset":500},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"European","offset":525},{"uri":"Ernest_Giles","surface_form":"Ernest Giles","offset":578},{"uri":"Brother-in-law","surface_form":"brother-in-law","offset":715},{"uri":"Kaltukatjara%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Kaltukatjara, Northern Territory","offset":830}]}
