{"id":390869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star","text":"A giant star is a star with much larger radius and luminosity than a main-sequence star of the same surface temperature.\nGiant stars are up to a few hundred times the diameter of the Sun and between 10 and a few thousand times brighter than the Sun. They don't last as long as most main sequence stars. Stars still more luminous than giants are referred to as supergiants and hypergiants.\nA hot, luminous main-sequence star may also be referred to as a giant.\nThere are a wide range of giant class stars, and sub-divisions are often used to identify particular types. Astronomers use such terms as: sub-giants, bright giants, red giants, yellow giants and blue giants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":18},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":40},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"luminosity","offset":51},{"uri":"Main_sequence","surface_form":"main-sequence","offset":69},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":167},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":183},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"brighter","offset":227},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":245},{"uri":"Supergiants","surface_form":"supergiants","offset":360},{"uri":"Hypergiants","surface_form":"hypergiants","offset":376},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red giant","offset":626}]}
