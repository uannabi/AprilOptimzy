It is most famous as the location of Ascot Racecourse, which hosts the Royal Ascot meeting. Ascot Racecourse was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne, with the first race, \u2018Her Majesty\u2019s Plate\u2019 running in August of that year.\nThe name Ascot is Anglo-Saxon and derives from East-Cote meaning the Eastern Cottage, probably a reference to being east of the royal estate at Easthampstead. Ascot has always been the western portion of Sunninghill parish (now called Sunninghill and Ascot) and, for most of its history, largely consisted of dangerous heathland frequented by highwaymen.\nAscot has 20% more Higher and Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional households than the national average. Ascot has a higher rate of home ownership, either outright or via a mortgage than the national average, which suggests that Ascot is a relatively affluent area. The population of Ascot as a whole, is older than the national average. The population of Ascot is also older than the average, making Ascot a older persons location.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":30},{"uri":"Royal_Borough_of_Windsor_and_Maidenhead","surface_form":"Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead","offset":45},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":88},{"uri":"Ascot_Racecourse","surface_form":"Ascot Racecourse","offset":136}]}
