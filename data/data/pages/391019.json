His first book, \u201CYour Best Life Now\u201D has sold 5 million copies. Lakewood Church now occupies the former Compaq Center, once home to the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets. The venue seats 16,000 people.\nOsteen was born on March 5, 1963 in Houston, Texas. He has been married to Victoria Osteen since 1987. They have two children. He lives in Houston, Texas.\nIn August 2017, Osteen received significant backlash on social media after he did not initially open Lakewood Church as an emergency shelter following Hurricane Harvey. A post on the church's Facebook page and an Instagram post by associate pastor John Gray, which was later deleted, claimed that flooded highways had made the church inaccessible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Televangelist","surface_form":"televangelist","offset":75},{"uri":"Pastor","surface_form":"pastor","offset":105},{"uri":"Lakewood_Church","surface_form":"Lakewood Church","offset":115},{"uri":"Houston%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Houston, Texas","offset":134},{"uri":"NBA","surface_form":"NBA","offset":395},{"uri":"Hurricane_Harvey","surface_form":"Hurricane Harvey","offset":755}]}
