Anyone can edit articles. The name \"Wikivoyage\" is a combination of the words \"wiki\" and \"voyage\", the French word for travel, journey, or trip.\nWikivoyage started publicly in December 2006 as a German-language version that was supported by German and Swiss authors. It was owned by a German non-profit association named Wikivoyage e.V. The Italian version started in December 2007.\nIn 2012, the content of Wikitravel in other languages was copied to Wikivoyage. At the same time Wikivoyage became hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization that hosts other wikis such as Wikipedia. Wikivoyage was officially re-launched by Wikimedia on January 15, 2013. At that time Wikivoyage was available in German, Italian, English, French, Dutch, Russian, Swedish, Portuguese and Spanish languages.
