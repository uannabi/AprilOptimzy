Sir Henry Irving was an actor and friend of Bram Stoker. The character 'Dracula' may have been based in part on Irving, and on Vlad III the Impaler. The story begins with a journey from England to Transylvania in Romania in 1893.\nPlot.\nThe young solicitor (a type of lawyer) Jonathan Harker goes to the country Transylvania to sell a house to a nobleman named Dracula. He realizes that Dracula is a vampire (or devil). Dracula catches Harker in his castle and goes to England, then bites the young woman Lucy Westenra and turns her into a vampire. Then Dracula bites Jonathan's wife Mina. Because of this, the other characters in the book, including Abraham von Helsing and Jonathan Harker, try to defeat Dracula.\nHere is a wel-known phrase in the story: \u201CDo you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway(=influence) ?\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":22},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":43},{"uri":"Bram_Stoker","surface_form":"Bram Stoker","offset":56},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":81},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":104},{"uri":"1897","surface_form":"1897","offset":115},{"uri":"Sir_Henry_Irving","surface_form":"Sir Henry Irving","offset":121},{"uri":"Vlad_III_the_Impaler","surface_form":"Vlad III the Impaler","offset":248},{"uri":"Transylvania","surface_form":"Transylvania","offset":318},{"uri":"Solicitor","surface_form":"solicitor","offset":367},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":388},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":466},{"uri":"Vampire","surface_form":"vampire","offset":520},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"characters","offset":737}]}
