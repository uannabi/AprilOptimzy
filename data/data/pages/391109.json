{"id":391109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma","text":"\"Mycoplasma\" is a genus of bacteria. They do not have a cell wall around their cell membrane.\nThey are gram-negative, and need sterols such as cholesterol for growth. Many common antibiotics such as penicillin that target cell walls do not affect mycoplasma. \"Mycoplasma\" are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered. They are typically about 0.1\u00A0 \u00B5m in diameter.\nMany species are parasitic, pathogenic or saprophytic, and can survive without oxygen. In humans, \"M. genitalium\" causes urethritis, and \"M. pneumoniae\" is a common cause of pneumonia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":18},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":27},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":56},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":79},{"uri":"Gram-negative","surface_form":"gram-negative","offset":103},{"uri":"Sterol","surface_form":"sterol","offset":127},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":143},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":179},{"uri":"Penicillin","surface_form":"penicillin","offset":199},{"uri":"%C2%B5m","surface_form":"\u00B5m","offset":351},{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":384},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":395},{"uri":"Saprophyte","surface_form":"saprophytic","offset":409},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":446},{"uri":"Mycoplasma_genitalium","surface_form":"M. genitalium","offset":466},{"uri":"Urethra","surface_form":"urethritis","offset":488},{"uri":"Mycoplasma_pneumoniae","surface_form":"M. pneumoniae","offset":505},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":541}]}
