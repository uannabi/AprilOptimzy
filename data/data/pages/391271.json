{"id":391271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder","text":"e=\"preserve\">Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is a cluster B personality disorder. The name is derived from Latin \"histrio\", which is usually translated as actor. People with this condition constantly seek to direct attention to their own person. Very often they also flirt and try to seduce others in inappropriate ways to get this attention, for example by being exhibitionist. These attempts at seduction usually start when they are teenagers. Histrionics feel a strong need to receive a lot of appreciation, admiration and reassurance. HPD affects about four times as many women (4%) as men (1%). It has a prevalence of between two and three percent in the general population, and between ten and fifteen percent in mental health institutions.\nHPD lies in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders. People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs.\nComorbidity.\nMost histrionics also have other mental disorders. HPD is comorbid (often occurs alongside): mood disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other personality disorders - especially antisocial, borderline, narcissistic and dependent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cluster_B","surface_form":"cluster B","offset":56},{"uri":"Personality_disorder","surface_form":"personality disorder","offset":66},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":113},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":161},{"uri":"Seduction","surface_form":"seduce","offset":290},{"uri":"Exhibitionism","surface_form":"exhibitionist","offset":370},{"uri":"Appreciation","surface_form":"appreciation","offset":503},{"uri":"Admiration","surface_form":"admiration","offset":517},{"uri":"Reassurance","surface_form":"reassurance","offset":532},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":582},{"uri":"Men","surface_form":"men","offset":596},{"uri":"Prevalence","surface_form":"prevalence","offset":615},{"uri":"Exaggerate","surface_form":"exaggerate","offset":901},{"uri":"Egocentrism","surface_form":"egocentrism","offset":1136},{"uri":"Self-indulgence","surface_form":"self-indulgence","offset":1149},{"uri":"Psychological_manipulation","surface_form":"manipulative","offset":1218},{"uri":"Comorbid","surface_form":"comorbid","offset":1339},{"uri":"Mood_disorder","surface_form":"mood disorder","offset":1374},{"uri":"Eating_disorder","surface_form":"eating disorder","offset":1390},{"uri":"Somatoform_disorder","surface_form":"somatoform disorder","offset":1408},{"uri":"Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","surface_form":"attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","offset":1430},{"uri":"Antisocial_personality_disorder","surface_form":"antisocial","offset":1516},{"uri":"Borderline_personality_disorder","surface_form":"borderline","offset":1528},{"uri":"Narcissistic_personality_disorder","surface_form":"narcissistic","offset":1540},{"uri":"Dependent_personality_disorder","surface_form":"dependent","offset":1557}]}
