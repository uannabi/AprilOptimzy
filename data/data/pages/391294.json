{"id":391294,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_League","text":"\"Pok\u00E9mon Puzzle League\" is a puzzle video game for the Nintendo 64 game console. It was released in North America and Europe in 2000. Unlike most \"Pok\u00E9mon\" games, it was never released in Japan. It is based upon Nintendo's \"Panel de Pon\" puzzle video game series, with a \"Pok\u00E9mon\" theme. It is the only game to take place in the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" anime universe. It was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008.\nGameplay.\nPlayers clear blocks that come down by lining them up in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. The lines have to have the same kind of block. As new blocks come down, the playfield rises. If it makes it to the top, the player loses. The player can stop the playfield from rising by clearing blocks. In two-player games, clearing more than one line at once causes \"garbage\" blocks to come down on the opponent's side of the field. Garbage blocks can be cleared by clearing lines below it.\nThe game has 2D and 3D modes. In 3D mode, the playfield is a cylinder that is 18 blocks wide.\nIn two-player games, players can select one of fourteen Pok\u00E9mon trainers to play as. Unlike other \"Pok\u00E9mon\" games, trainers and their Pok\u00E9mon do not have an effect on the gameplay.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["VG"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puzzle","surface_form":"puzzle","offset":29},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":36},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":55},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":100},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":118},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":147},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":188},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":212},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)","surface_form":"\"Pok\u00E9mon\" anime","offset":329},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":379},{"uri":"Virtual_Console","surface_form":"Virtual Console","offset":385},{"uri":"Cylinder","surface_form":"cylinder","offset":985}]}
