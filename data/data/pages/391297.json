{"id":391297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_Challenge","text":"\"Pok\u00E9mon Puzzle Challenge\" is a puzzle video game for the Game Boy Color game console. It was released in Japan on September 21, 2000, in North America on December 4, 2000, and in Europe on June 15, 2001. It is based upon Nintendo's \"Panel de Pon\" video game series, with a \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\" theme.\nGameplay.\nPlayers clear blocks that come down by lining them up in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. The lines have to be of the same kind of block. As new blocks come down, the playfield goes up. If the playfield reaches the top, the game ends. The player can stop the playfield by clearing blocks. The more lines a player clears at once, the higher their score will be.\nThere are three modes of play: single-player, multi-player, and training. Players can play as a number of different Pok\u00E9mon from \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\", including Pikachu, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. New Pok\u00E9mon can be unlocked by winning against other Pok\u00E9mon trainers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["VG"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puzzle","surface_form":"puzzle","offset":32},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":39},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Color","surface_form":"Game Boy Color","offset":58},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":106},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":138},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":180},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver","offset":275},{"uri":"Pikachu","surface_form":"Pikachu","offset":865}]}
