{"id":391393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd","text":"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born 16 February 1990), better known by his stage name The Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer. Tesfaye has helped broadened R&B's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles; his work has been categorized with the alternative R&B tag.\nTesfaye anonymously uploaded several songs to YouTube under the name \"The Weeknd\" in 2010 and released the critically acclaimed mixtapes \"House of Balloons\", \"Thursday\", and \"Echoes of Silence\" in 2011. The mixtapes were later remastered and rereleased on the compilation album \"Trilogy\" (2012), after he signed with Republic Records and created his own record label XO. Tesfaye has had three No. 1 releases (\"Beauty Behind the Madness\" in 2015, \"Starboy\" in 2016, and \"My Dear Melancholy\" in 2018) and a No. 2 release (\"Kiss Land\" in 2013) on the US \"Billboard\" 200. He has earned eight top-ten entries on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"Love Me Harder\" with Ariana Grande; \"Earned It\"; \"I Feel It Coming\"; \"Pray for Me\" with Kendrick Lamar; \"Call Out My Name\"; and the number one singles \"The Hills\", \"Can't Feel My Face\", and \"Starboy\". In 2015, Tesfaye became the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B Songs chart with \"Can't Feel My Face\", \"Earned It\", and \"The Hills\".\nTesfaye has won three Grammy Awards, eight \"Billboard\" Music Awards, two American Music Awards, nine Juno Awards, and has been nominated for one Academy Award.\nEarly life.\nTesfaye was born on 16 February 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, and was raised in the district of Scarborough, in the city's east end. He is the only child of Makkonen and Samra Tesfaye, who were Ethiopian immigrants to Canada in the late 1980s.\nDuring Tesfaye's youth, his mother worked several jobs in order to support the family, including jobs as a nurse and caterer. This was alongside attending night school to learn English. Tesfaye's father abandoned the family when he was a toddler, resulting in Tesfaye being cared for by his grandmother and mother. While living with his grandmother Tesfaye learned Amharic, which he also spoke with his mother, and attended Ethiopian Orthodox church services. Tesfaye stated this in an interview regarding his father, \"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived \u2014 I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive; he wasn't an alcoholic; he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there.\"\nTesfaye self-describes his teenage years as the film \"Kids\" without the AIDS\". Tesfaye states he began smoking marijuana at age 11, and later moved on to harder drugs. Tesfaye claims he often shoplifted to supplement his use of ecstasy, oxycodone, xanax, cocaine, psilocybin, and ketamine.\nTesfaye attended West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Toronto, from which he did not graduate, leaving altogether in 2007., after which Tesfaye also left home. Tesfaye moved to the Parkdale neighborhood of Toronto. Tesfaye has credited his stage name as being inspired by his high school dropout status, claiming \"after [he] left one weekend and never came home\", though producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The spelling was modified in order to avoid trademark issues with the Canadian band The Weekend.\n2010\u20132011: Career beginnings.\nTesfaye met Jeremy Rose in 2010, a producer who had an idea for a dark R&B musical project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. This led to the two collaborating on an album. Rose produced three songs \u2013 \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\", and \"The Morning\" \u2013 and others that Tesfaye had rapped on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would ultimately be credited for them. In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Morning\" to YouTube under his stage name, although his identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from Drake. The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including \"Pitchfork\" and \"The New York Times\". Before adopting the stage name \"The Weeknd\", he worked under the aliasses of \"The Noise\" and \"Kin Kane\".\nOn 21 March 2011, Tesfaye self-released his debut mixtape \"House of Balloons\". The mixtape included production from Canadian producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although, he did not receive production credits. \"House of Balloons\" was met with critical acclaim. It was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.\nTesfaye began a tour of Toronto, with his first live performance at the city's Mod Club venue. Drake was in attendance to view the performance, which ran for a total of ninety minutes. Drake approached Tesfaye and described a potential musical collaboration between the pair. Tesfaye accompanied Drake at his various shows, often performing as the opening act for shows scheduled at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre, as well as appearing at the second annual OVO Fest in July. Over the summer of 2011, Tesfaye contributed to five songs on Drake's \"Take Care\", both as a writer and a featured artist.\nTesfaye refrained from participating in interviews, choosing to communicate via Twitter, after the album was released. This was credited as a successful advertising tactic for Tesfaye second mixtape \"Thursday\", which was released on 18 August 2011. It was also subject to acclaim from music critics. Tesfaye's third mixtape \"Echoes of Silence\" was released on 21 December 2011, a year after his debut singles, and also saw positive critical reception.\nFollowing this release, the three mixtapes were collectively known as the \"Balloons Trilogy\", and saw Tesfaye receiving offers from various record labels.\n2012\u20132014: \"Trilogy\" and \"Kiss Land\".\nIn April 2012, Tesfaye began his first tour of the United States, with a performance at the Coachella Festival. The tour culminated in New York with back-to-back sold-out shows, which were positively reviewed by \"Rolling Stone\". Tesfaye expanded his tour to accompany Europe, performing at various European festivals, including the Primavera Sound Festivals in Spain and Portugal, and the Wireless Festival in London. Covering \"Dirty Diana\" at his performance in London, he received positive responses from both Katy Perry and Florence Welch, who noted the singer's ability to successfully undertake a complex song. In June, the \"Balloons Trilogy\" was revealed to have been downloaded over 8 million times, which allowed Tesfaye to initiate formal commercial release of the projects later that year.\nIn September 2012, Tesfaye signed with Republic Records in a joint venture with his own imprint XO. The compilation album for the mixtapes entitled \"Trilogy\", was released two months later, and consisted of several remastered versions of songs, as well as three additional ones. It also officially credited Rose as a producer and writer on the three songs from \"House of Balloons\" for which he did not initially receive credit. \"Trilogy\" charted at number four on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies. It also debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, with similar sales. \"Trilogy\" was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double-platinum by Music Canada in May 2013. He had also gained a nomination for the Sound of 2013 poll award by the BBC a week later.\nOn 16 May 2013, Tesfaye premiered the title track to his debut studio album \"Kiss Land\", and announced the album's release date as 10 September. The album was later promoted by the singles \"Belong to the World\" and \"Live For\" featuring Drake, as well as with Tesfaye embarking on The Fall tour a week prior to the album's release. Upon release, \"Kiss Land\" debuted at number two on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200, selling 96,000 copies. It was later confirmed to have sold over 273,000 copies in the United States, as well as receiving generally positive reviews from music critics.\nTesfaye appeared on 20 Experience World Tour, joining headline act Justin Timberlake for six shows. This was three weeks prior to his contributions to the soundtrack for ' (2013), contributing \"Devil May Cry\", as well as featuring on Sia's \"Elastic Heart\". The latter proved to be the second lead single from the soundtrack.\nIn 2014, Tesfaye remixed \"Drunk in Love\", a single by Beyonc\u00E9 from her eponymous studio album. Retaining the theme and concept of the song, he detailed the synopsis through the perspective of a male. The remix was well-received, and came days prior to the announcement of Tesfaye's first headlining tour, entitled the King of the Fall tour. The tour was held across the United States in September and October, and saw Schoolboy Q and Jhen\u00E9 Aiko as supporting acts. This oversaw his release of the single \"Often\", leading to speculation it was the first single from his second studio album. He later collaborated with Ariana Grande on a duet titled \"Love Me Harder\", which peaked at number seven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Days later, he released \"Earned It\", a single from \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" (2015). This marked his second contribution to a movie, and peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n2015: \"Beauty Behind the Madness\".\nAfter Tesfaye won the Centric Award at the 2015 BET Awards, he performed \"Earned It\" with Alicia Keys, as well as debuting the song \"The Hills\". \"The Hills\" was later released for digital download, and debuted at number twenty on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single later went on to top the chart, marking Tesfaye's first number-one single. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nA further three songs were leaked online in the corresponding days. On 8 June, \"Can't Feel My Face\", one of the leaked tracks, was released as a second single, following its performance at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. The song debuted at number twenty-four on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and reached number-one on the Hot 100, making it his third top 10 hit, and his second number-one hit in the United States. He occupied all three slots on \"Billboard's\" Hot R&B Songs chart simultaneously with the aforementioned singles, becoming the first artist in history to accomplish this. He headlined FVDED in the Park, a festival in Surrey, British Columbia. Tesfaye was unveiled as one of the musical faces of the streaming service Apple Music, a position he harbored with frequent collaborator Drake. During the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Apple debuted a two-part promotional commercial featuring Tesfaye, which had a guest appearance from John Travolta. It was revealed that his second studio album would be titled \"Beauty Behind the Madness\".\n\"Beauty Behind the Madness\" was released on 28 August 2015, and debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200, earning 412,000 album equivalent units in its first week. It reached the top 10 in over ten countries, as well as reaching number one in Canada, Australia, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The album was promoted by Tesfaye headlining various summer music festivals, including Lollapalooza, the Hard Summer Music Festival, and the Bumbershoot Festival. He announced his first large-scale tour across the United States, which began in November, and concluded in December. The album went double platinum in the US, and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. It was reported to be the most-streamed album throughout 2015, with over 60 million, as well as being ranked on multiple lists concerned with detailing albums of the year.\nOn 8 September, Tesfaye became the first male artist to have simultaneously held the top three spots on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart, with the three singles that preceded the release of his album. They all went platinum in the United States.

Ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, mushrooms and cough syrup\". Speaking in December 2013, Tesfaye said that drugs were a \"crutch\" for him when it came to writing music. On social media he typically suffixed his first name with \"xo\".
