{"id":3914,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence","text":"Evidence is something that is used to support an argument. It gives examples of why something is true.\nFor example, if someone come across a cup of spilled milk, that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled. If hairs of a cat and paw prints were found on the ground, they could be evidence that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk. If a witness saw the cat spilling the milk, her testimony would also be evidence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":49},{"uri":"Truth","surface_form":"true","offset":97},{"uri":"Cup","surface_form":"cup","offset":141},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":156},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":233},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":244},{"uri":"Print","surface_form":"prints","offset":256},{"uri":"Ground","surface_form":"ground","offset":281},{"uri":"Witness","surface_form":"witness","offset":363},{"uri":"Testimony","surface_form":"testimony","offset":406}]}
