{"id":391447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bronchoscopy is a medical procedure which is used to look at the inside of a person's airway's. It can be used to see the inside of the trachea, and the bronchi and bronchioles within the lungs. There are three types of bronchoscopy: rigid, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and CT virtual bronchoscopy (CTVB).\nRigid bronchoscopy.\nRigid bronchoscopy is a straight rigid tube used to see into the trachea and proximal bronchi. It is usually done in an operating room under general anesthesia. It is usually used when there is a blockage in either the trachea or the primary bronchi. The diameter of the tube is large enough to insert instruments to remove obstructions.\nFlexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\nDuring the procedure, a thin, flexible fiberoptic tube called a bronchoscope. is passed through the nose or mouth nose into the airways. The bronchoscope has a light and a camera which lets the doctor see into the airway.\nCT virtual bronchoscopy.\nThis technique uses data from multiple CT scans to create a three dimensional (3D) image. This allows doctors to see what is going on without having to operate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trachea","surface_form":"trachea","offset":149},{"uri":"Bronchi","surface_form":"bronchi","offset":166},{"uri":"Bronchiole","surface_form":"bronchiole","offset":178},{"uri":"Anesthesia","surface_form":"anesthesia","offset":492},{"uri":"Fiber_optic","surface_form":"fiberoptic","offset":754},{"uri":"CT","surface_form":"CT","offset":1001}]}
