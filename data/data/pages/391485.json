It was located in inner eastern suburban Melbourne, and was named after the Yarra River. It originally covered the suburbs of Abbotsford, Collingwood, Richmond and part of Fitzroy. By 1969, it no longer covered Abbotsford or Fitzroy, but included Burnley and Hawthorn. Yarra was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It was abolished in 1969.\nMembers.\nIt was a very safe Labor seat. It was held by only four people--Frank Tudor, a leader of the Australian Labor Party; James Scullin, the 13th Prime Minister of Australia; Stan Keon, an important figure in the ALP-DLP Split; and Jim Cairns, who later became Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":29},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":66},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":75},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":126},{"uri":"Yarra_River","surface_form":"Yarra River","offset":161},{"uri":"Abbotsford%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Abbotsford","offset":211},{"uri":"Collingwood%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Collingwood","offset":223},{"uri":"Richmond%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Richmond","offset":236},{"uri":"Fitzroy%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Fitzroy","offset":257},{"uri":"Burnley%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Burnley","offset":332},{"uri":"Hawthorn%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Hawthorn","offset":344},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Labor","offset":498},{"uri":"Frank_Tudor","surface_form":"Frank Tudor","offset":543},{"uri":"James_Scullin","surface_form":"James Scullin","offset":596},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Australia","offset":620},{"uri":"Stan_Keon","surface_form":"Stan Keon","offset":649},{"uri":"Democratic_Labor_Party","surface_form":"DLP","offset":691},{"uri":"Jim_Cairns","surface_form":"Jim Cairns","offset":706},{"uri":"Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Deputy Prime Minister of Australia","offset":735}]}
