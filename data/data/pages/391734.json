{"id":391734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy","text":"=\"preserve\">Demarchy is a political system based on many decision-making groups that deal with specific functions in a given area (transport, parks, land use, etc.) The members that make up each group are chosen randomly every year. Democracy in Athens used this method to appoint officials.\nThis system is advantageous because it can not be influenced by pressure groups, media and others. In demarchy \"political machines\" or special preparation of candidates are not important because nobody can predict who will be in government next.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":26},{"uri":"Decision-making","surface_form":"decision-making","offset":57},{"uri":"Democracy_in_Athens","surface_form":"Democracy in Athens","offset":233}]}
