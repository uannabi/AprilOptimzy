{"id":39182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics","text":"The 2004 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad, were held in Athens, Greece from August 13 2004, until August 29 2004. It was the first time since 1896 that the Olympics were held in Greece. 10,625 athletes took part. There were 301 medal events.\nBids.\nThe four other candidate cities were Rome, Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires. Six other cities had applied, but were turned down by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro, San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.\nAthens won every round of voting and easily beat Rome in round 5, the final vote. Round 2 was to settle a tie break between Cape Town and Buenos Aires from round 1.\nMedal count.\nThe ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee.\nThe total number of bronze medals is greater than the total of gold or silver because in boxing and judo, two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class.\nCountries are ranked firstly by the number of gold medals they have, then by the number of silver, and then by the number of bronze. Where countries have the same number of each type of medal, they are listed alphabetically and given the same ranking.\nMedal numbers shown in bold are the highest in their section. Greece, the host nation is highlighted in lavender.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":93},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":101},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":322},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":328},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":339},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":354},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":457},{"uri":"Lille","surface_form":"Lille","offset":467},{"uri":"Rio_de_Janeiro","surface_form":"Rio de Janeiro","offset":474},{"uri":"San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"San Juan","offset":490},{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":500},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg","offset":513},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":775}]}
