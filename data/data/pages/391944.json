{"id":391944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate","text":"Google Translate is a machine translation website from Google that can translate text between different languages. It can translate words, sentences, documents and web pages between any combination of more than 185 supported languages. It was launched on April 28, 2006 and has always been free to use.\nGoogle Translate can do more than just show the translation of words. It can also show how to pronounce (say) the word using text-to-speech, and show the definition (meaning) like a dictionary. More recently, it also lets the community make changes or suggestions, for example, if the computer made a wrong translation. This is very much like how one can contribute to websites like Google Maps and Wikimedia Foundation websites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Machine_translation","surface_form":"machine translation","offset":22},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":55},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translate","offset":71},{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":81},{"uri":"Languages","surface_form":"languages","offset":104},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":132},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":139},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":150},{"uri":"Web_page","surface_form":"web page","offset":164},{"uri":"Free","surface_form":"free","offset":290},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronounce","offset":397},{"uri":"Text_to_Speech","surface_form":"text-to-speech","offset":428},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":457},{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionary","offset":485},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":529},{"uri":"Suggestion","surface_form":"suggestion","offset":555},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":588},{"uri":"Google_Maps","surface_form":"Google Maps","offset":686},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Foundation","surface_form":"Wikimedia Foundation","offset":702}]}
