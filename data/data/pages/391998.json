{"id":391998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)","text":"A lens is a clear (transparent) object (like glass, plastic or even a drop of water) that changes the way things look by bending the light that goes through it. They may make things appear larger, smaller, or upside-down. Some places lenses are used include spectacles (eyeglasses), contact lenses, cameras, projectors, microscopes, telescopes, magnifying glasses, etc. Each eye also has a lens.\nThey work by refraction, or the bending of light.\nHistory.\nThe word \"lens\" comes from the Latin word for \"lentil,\" because the earliest [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convex convex] lenses in common use were shaped like the bean.\nThe oldest written record of lenses is in the ancient Greek play by Aristophanes called \"Clouds\", where lenses were used with sunlight to make fire.\nGalileo Galilei is commonly believed to have used lenses to make the first known refracting telescope. However, he merely adapted and improved a design he learned from Dutch lensmakers such as Hans Lippershey. He was probably the first to use telescopes to make accurate astronomical observations, though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Transparency","surface_form":"transparent","offset":19},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":45},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":52},{"uri":"Eyeglasses","surface_form":"eyeglasses","offset":270},{"uri":"Cameras","surface_form":"cameras","offset":299},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscopes","offset":320},{"uri":"Telescopes","surface_form":"telescopes","offset":333},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":375},{"uri":"Lens_(eye)","surface_form":"lens","offset":390},{"uri":"Refraction","surface_form":"refraction","offset":409},{"uri":"Lentil","surface_form":"lentil","offset":502},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":672},{"uri":"Aristophanes","surface_form":"Aristophanes","offset":694},{"uri":"Galileo_Galilei","surface_form":"Galileo Galilei","offset":775},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":867},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":943},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomical","offset":1046}]}
