The 649 area code was created during a split from the original Area code 809 area code, which was done in or around May 1997.\nLike many Caribbean countries Turks and Caicos Islands uses +1 followed by the area code as the international direct dial phone code.\nWhen in Turks and Caicos Islands, use the seven digits alone.
