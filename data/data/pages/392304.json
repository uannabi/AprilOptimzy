{"id":392304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasseter_Highway","text":"The Lasseter Highway is a highway in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is a sealed road that runs for. It connects Yulara, Kata Tju\u1E6Fa and Ulu\u1E5Fu to the Stuart Highway. It is the major access route for tourists heading to Ulu\u1E5Fu-Kata Tju\u1E6Fa National Park. The highway is named after the prospector Harold Bell Lasseter, who claimed to have discovered a rich gold deposit (Lasseter's Reef) west of Kata Tju\u1E6Fa.\nThe highway begins in Erldunda, a roadhouse and hotel, on the Stuart Highway (N87). The Stuart Highway connects Darwin in the north and Adelaide in the south and is therefore one of Australia's major highways. From Erldunda, the Lasseter Highway leads west along the southern side of the Basedow and Kernot Ranges. After about 110\u00A0km, next to the Kernot Range, there is the junction with the Luritja Highway (S3), which leads north to Kings Canyon. Another 25\u00A0km towards the southwest is a rest area that has a view of Mount Conner. A further 22\u00A0km away is the Curtin Springs, a cattle station with a roadhouse. A further 100\u00A0km west along the highway is the tourist town Yulara. After Yulara, the road meets the Great Central Road, a dirt road that leads into Western Australia through the Petermann Ranges and across the Gibson and Great Victoria Deserts.\nThere are petrol stations at Erldunda (at the start of the highway), Mount Ebenezer (km\u00A057) and Curtin Springs (km\u00A0245).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Highway","surface_form":"highway","offset":26},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":41},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":63},{"uri":"Yulara%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Yulara","offset":121},{"uri":"Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa","surface_form":"Kata Tju\u1E6Fa","offset":129},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu","offset":144},{"uri":"Stuart_Highway","surface_form":"Stuart Highway","offset":157},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":206},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu-Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa_National_Park","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu-Kata Tju\u1E6Fa National Park","offset":226},{"uri":"Prospecting","surface_form":"prospector","offset":289},{"uri":"Harold_Bell_Lasseter","surface_form":"Harold Bell Lasseter","offset":300},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":360},{"uri":"Lasseter%27s_Reef","surface_form":"Lasseter's Reef","offset":374},{"uri":"Erldunda","surface_form":"Erldunda","offset":433},{"uri":"Roadhouse","surface_form":"roadhouse","offset":445},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":459},{"uri":"Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Darwin","offset":523},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":547},{"uri":"Basedow_Range","surface_form":"Basedow","offset":699},{"uri":"Kernot_Range","surface_form":"Kernot Range","offset":711},{"uri":"Junction","surface_form":"junction","offset":785},{"uri":"Luritja_Road","surface_form":"Luritja Highway","offset":803},{"uri":"Kings_Canyon_(Australia)","surface_form":"Kings Canyon","offset":846},{"uri":"Mount_Conner","surface_form":"Mount Conner","offset":930},{"uri":"Curtin_Springs","surface_form":"Curtin Springs","offset":972},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":990},{"uri":"Station_(agriculture)","surface_form":"station","offset":997},{"uri":"Yulara","surface_form":"Yulara","offset":1083},{"uri":"Great_Central_Road","surface_form":"Great Central Road","offset":1124},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":1172},{"uri":"Petermann_Ranges","surface_form":"Petermann Ranges","offset":1202},{"uri":"Gibson_Desert","surface_form":"Gibson","offset":1234},{"uri":"Great_Victoria_Desert","surface_form":"Great Victoria Desert","offset":1245},{"uri":"Petrol_station","surface_form":"petrol station","offset":1279},{"uri":"Mount_Ebenezer","surface_form":"Mount Ebenezer","offset":1338},{"uri":"Curtin_Springs","surface_form":"Curtin Springs","offset":1365}]}
