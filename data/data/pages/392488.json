{"id":392488,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor","text":"e=\"preserve\">A dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) is a drug. Dopamine is a type of brain chemical called a neurotransmitter. Dopamine has many jobs and responsibilities in the brain. Scientists think dopamine controls movement and the human sense of punishment and reward. Dopamine affects dreams, motivation, and sexual gratification, too.\nA lack of dopamine is responsible for many diseases and conditions. Sometimes dopamine does not work correctly in the brain. Sometimes the brain does not have enough dopamine. Doctors prescribe dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRI's or DARI's) to help control symptoms. Psychostimulants and antidepressants are types of DRI's. DRI's help manage symptoms of ADHD, narcolepsy, Parkinson's Disease, obesity, substance abuse withdrawal and some mood disorders. Users can become addicted to DRI's sometimes.\nDRI's do not have dopamine inside the pills. They help the body make more dopamine, and they change the way dopamine is re-used in the brain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dopamine","surface_form":"Dopamine","offset":60},{"uri":"Neurotransmitter","surface_form":"neurotransmitter","offset":106},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"movement","offset":217},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":249},{"uri":"Reward","surface_form":"reward","offset":264},{"uri":"Dreams","surface_form":"dreams","offset":289},{"uri":"Motivation","surface_form":"motivation","offset":297},{"uri":"Sexual_gratification","surface_form":"sexual gratification","offset":313},{"uri":"Psychostimulants","surface_form":"Psychostimulants","offset":607},{"uri":"Antidepressants","surface_form":"antidepressants","offset":628},{"uri":"ADHD","surface_form":"ADHD","offset":694},{"uri":"Narcolepsy","surface_form":"narcolepsy","offset":700},{"uri":"Parkinson%27s_Disease","surface_form":"Parkinson's Disease","offset":712},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":733},{"uri":"Substance_abuse","surface_form":"substance abuse","offset":742},{"uri":"Withdrawal","surface_form":"withdrawal","offset":758},{"uri":"Mood_disorders","surface_form":"mood disorders","offset":778},{"uri":"Dopamine","surface_form":"dopamine","offset":858}]}
