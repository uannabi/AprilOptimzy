{"id":392498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The gauss (symbol G) is the CGS unit used to measure magnetic fields. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter. The tesla (symbol T) is the SI derived unit used to measure the strength of magnetic fields. There are 10,000 (104) gauss in one tesla.\nThe unit is named in honor of the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units","surface_form":"CGS","offset":41},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":66},{"uri":"Maxwell_(unit)","surface_form":"maxwell","offset":111},{"uri":"SI_derived_unit","surface_form":"SI derived unit","offset":170},{"uri":"Tesla_(unit)","surface_form":"tesla","offset":271},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":319},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":337},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":347}]}
