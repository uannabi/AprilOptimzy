{"id":392502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruners","text":"Pruners are a cutting tool for pruning plants. A common form is held in one hand; it is also called \"snippers\" or \"secateurs\". It has two handles, one connected to a blade and the other to a blunt surface. Like the word \"scissors\", \"pruners\" is used as a plural.\nA pole pruner is like a pair of pruners, but at the end of a pole. It is operated by pulling on a rope.\nPruners are used for cutting plants and small branches, such as roses and grapevines. Stems thicker than a pencil will need to be cut with loppers or a saw instead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":22},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":361},{"uri":"Rose","surface_form":"rose","offset":431},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":441},{"uri":"Loppers","surface_form":"loppers","offset":506},{"uri":"Saw","surface_form":"saw","offset":519}]}
