The game was an MMORPG, where a lot of people play at one time. It was released in 2003, and closed in 2013.\nPlayers live life as a toon in Toontown. Players can make a duck, bear, mouse, rabbit, dog, cat, horse, pig, or monkey.\nGame's purpose.\nPlayers try to live life as a toon, play games on the Trolley and make new friends. But it's not all paradise. Evil robots called \"Cogs\" have taken over, and \"gags\" (cartoon fun) are used to defeat them. There is not a purpose that players have to go by. A player can choose to be the top racer or to have the most \"laff points\". Many people like it because of this. Some users even dare to become \"ubers\", toons with better gags but poor laff.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Online","surface_form":"online","offset":83},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":90},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"The Walt Disney Company","offset":112},{"uri":"MMORPG","surface_form":"MMORPG","offset":153},{"uri":"Toon","surface_form":"toon","offset":269},{"uri":"Toontown","surface_form":"Toontown","offset":277},{"uri":"Toon","surface_form":"toon","offset":412},{"uri":"Trolley","surface_form":"Trolley","offset":436},{"uri":"Paradise","surface_form":"paradise","offset":483},{"uri":"Robot","surface_form":"robot","offset":498}]}
