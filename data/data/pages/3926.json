{"id":3926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area","text":"e=\"preserve\">Area is the amount of space a two dimensional (flat) surface takes up. It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container. Area is the amount of surface covered by a close object or shape.\nSmall areas can be measured in square centimetre and large areas in square kilometre. The area of a planar figure is often written as formula_1. Areas of regular shapes such as square, rectangle, triangle and circle can be calculated through formulas. The area of an irregular shape can be approximated through grid or graph paper.\nThe area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three-dimensional object.\nThe area under a curve can be found using integration, a concept from calculus.\nSome units used to measure area are square foot, square mile, square metre and square kilometre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Space_(physics)","surface_form":"space","offset":35},{"uri":"Two_dimensional","surface_form":"two dimensional","offset":43},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":125},{"uri":"Square","surface_form":"square","offset":415},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangle","offset":423},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":434},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":447},{"uri":"Scientific_method","surface_form":"formulas","offset":480},{"uri":"Surface_area","surface_form":"surface area","offset":614},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":631},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":686},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integration","offset":711},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":739},{"uri":"Square_foot","surface_form":"square foot","offset":785},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"square mile","offset":798},{"uri":"Square_metre","surface_form":"square metre","offset":811},{"uri":"Square_kilometre","surface_form":"square kilometre","offset":828}]}
