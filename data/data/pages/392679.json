{"id":392679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulkana_Range","text":"The Indulkana Range is a range of hills in the northwest of South Australia. It is sometimes called the Mount Chandler Range after its highest peak. It is located to the southwest of Indulkana, on the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands. The mountains of the Indulkana area are part of the traditional country of the Yankunytjatjara and Antakarinya.\nThe range consists of a series of parallel ridges running east to west. The southern side of the range ends in an escarpment, the most prominent point of which is Chambers Bluff. The rock is made up of quartzite and sandstone rock, resting on slates of kaolinised clay. At the eastern end of the range is Mount Chandler, which overlooks the settlement of Indulkana and the Indulkana Creek. It rises about from its base. It is made up of quartzite, quartz sandstone and sandstone. Slightly north of the escarpment, and following its path from east to west, is a series of gorges that split the hills. The gorges contain several reliable springs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"range of hills","offset":25},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":60},{"uri":"Indulkana%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Indulkana","offset":183},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara","offset":201},{"uri":"Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"Yankunytjatjara","offset":325},{"uri":"Antakarinya","surface_form":"Antakarinya","offset":345},{"uri":"Escarpment","surface_form":"escarpment","offset":472},{"uri":"Quartzite","surface_form":"quartzite","offset":560},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":574},{"uri":"Slate","surface_form":"slate","offset":601},{"uri":"Kaolinite","surface_form":"kaolinised","offset":611},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":622},{"uri":"Quartzite","surface_form":"quartzite","offset":795},{"uri":"Quartz","surface_form":"quartz","offset":806},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":813},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":827},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":929},{"uri":"Spring_(water)","surface_form":"springs","offset":994}]}
