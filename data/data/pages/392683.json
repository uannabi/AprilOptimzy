{"id":392683,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate","text":"=\"preserve\">A reaction intermediate or simply intermediate is a molecule that is formed during a chemical reaction. It is not the final product, but it is something that is more like the product than the reactants. After every step in a reaction mechanism, an intermediate is formed.\nIntermediates usually stay around for a little time because they are very reactive. However, it is important not to confuse an intermediate with a transition state. The latter is at a point of maximum energy. An intermediate instead is at a point of minimum energy, i.e. it is a stable molecule. Intermediates can be isolated from a reaction if needed.\nA + B \u2192 X \u2192 C + D\nX is the intermediate. In going from A + B to X and from X to C + D, the reaction will go through a transition state.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":64},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":97},{"uri":"Product_(chemistry)","surface_form":"product","offset":136},{"uri":"Reactant","surface_form":"reactant","offset":204},{"uri":"Reaction_mechanism","surface_form":"reaction mechanism","offset":237},{"uri":"Transition_state","surface_form":"transition state","offset":431}]}
