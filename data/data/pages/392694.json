{"id":392694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capella","text":"Capella (\u03B1 Aurigae, \u03B1 Aur, Alpha Aurigae) is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the eleventh brightest star in the night sky and the third brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus and Vega.\nAlthough it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a star system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright, large type-G giant stars, both with a radius about 10 times the Sun's, in close orbit around each other. These two stars are thought to be cooling and expanding on their way to becoming red giants.\nThe second pair, around 10,000 astronomical units from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. The Capella system is relatively close, at only from Earth.\nThe system is a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alpha_(letter)","surface_form":"Alpha","offset":27},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":71},{"uri":"Auriga_(constellation)","surface_form":"Auriga","offset":85},{"uri":"Celestial_sphere","surface_form":"celestial hemisphere","offset":183},{"uri":"Arcturus","surface_form":"Arcturus","offset":211},{"uri":"Vega","surface_form":"Vega","offset":224},{"uri":"Star_system","surface_form":"star system","offset":305},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary pair","offset":338},{"uri":"Stellar_classification","surface_form":"type-G","offset":397},{"uri":"Giant_star","surface_form":"giant star","offset":404},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red giant","offset":577},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"astronomical unit","offset":620},{"uri":"Red_dwarf","surface_form":"red dwarf","offset":704},{"uri":"Hyades_cluster","surface_form":"Hyades cluster","offset":880}]}
