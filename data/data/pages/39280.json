{"id":39280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaggeration","text":"e=\"preserve\">Exaggeration is a term for a figure of speech. It means the describing of something and making it more than it really is. The verb is to exaggerate.\nAn example of exaggeration would be: \u201CI was walking along when suddenly this enormous dog walked along. It was as big as an elephant\u201D. The dog may have been big, but it was certainly not as big as that. Another example of exaggeration would be: \u201CI caught a fish as big as my house.\u201D\nOverstatement is another word that means almost the same thing. The opposite of overstatement is understatement.\nA hyperbole (IPA:[ha\u0131'p\u025D.b\u0259.li]) is a type of exaggeration that is used in literature. It is a figure of speech. The opposite of hyperbole is hypobole, which is an understatement.\nIn modern slang, the word \u201Chype\u201D is sometimes used about something that is getting more publicity than it really deserves. The word hype comes from the word \u201Chyperbole\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Figure_of_speech","surface_form":"figure of speech","offset":42},{"uri":"IPA","surface_form":"IPA","offset":571},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":748},{"uri":"Publicity","surface_form":"publicity","offset":826}]}
