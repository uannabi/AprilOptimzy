He studied at DeWitt Clinton High School and at The New School. Baldwin was gay. He married and had no children. Baldwin died on December 1, 1987 in Saint-Paul de Vence, France from esophageal cancer, aged 63.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":64},{"uri":"Harlem","surface_form":"Harlem","offset":482},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":490},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":501},{"uri":"DeWitt_Clinton_High_School","surface_form":"DeWitt Clinton High School","offset":530},{"uri":"The_New_School","surface_form":"The New School","offset":564},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":592},{"uri":"Saint-Paul_de_Vence","surface_form":"Saint-Paul de Vence","offset":665},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":686},{"uri":"Esophageal_cancer","surface_form":"esophageal cancer","offset":698}]}
