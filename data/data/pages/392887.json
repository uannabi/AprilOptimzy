It was created by law in July 1978. The block of land (called Northern Territory Portion 1634) covers an area of. It makes up most of the area of the old Petermann Reserve (1920\u20131977). The land's traditional owners are mostly Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Luritja people. This includes residents of Kaltukatjara and over 50 family outstations.\nThe block held by the Petermann ALT is surrounded by other Aboriginal land blocks on all sides. It borders the Ngaanyatjarra Lands to the west (in Western Australia), the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands to the south (in South Australia), Haasts Bluff Aboriginal Land Trust to the north, and Katiti and Urrampinyi Iltjiltajarri Aboriginal Land Trusts to the east.\nHistory.\nIn March 1920, an area of land in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory was made into an aboriginal reservation, called the Petermann Reserve. It was meant to be a temporary refuge (safe place) for the Aboriginal families living in the area, many of whom were still living traditional, nomadic lifestyles. It bordered other large reserves created in Western Australia and South Australia, and together the area was known as the Central Australian Aboriginal Reserve. In 1940, the Petermann Reserve was made smaller, to allow people to look for gold. It was made smaller again in 1958, when the government excised the area around Ulu\u1E5Fu and Kata Tju\u1E6Fa to create the Ayers Rock\u2013Mt Olga National Park.\nIn 1976, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which allowed for Aboriginal communities to be granted freehold title to land if they could show that they lived on the land for many years. Section 4 of the act gave the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the power to establish Aboriginal Land Trusts to look after the title. The trusts would be established by publishing notices in the government gazette. In 1977, the old Petermann Reserve land was transferred to the Petermann Land Trust and to other Aboriginal land-owning corporations. The boundaries of the Petermann trust were first described in the \"Gazette\" on 21 July 1978. They were later made into law by Act No. 109 of 1985, which went into effect on 16 October 1985.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"land trust","offset":54},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":122},{"uri":"Aboriginal_title","surface_form":"traditional owners","offset":349},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":379},{"uri":"Yankunytjatjara","surface_form":"Yankunytjatjara","offset":395},{"uri":"Luritja","surface_form":"Luritja","offset":415},{"uri":"Kaltukatjara%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Kaltukatjara","offset":458},{"uri":"Outstation","surface_form":"outstation","offset":490},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":650},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara_Lands","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":674},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":735},{"uri":"Haasts_Bluff_Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"Haasts Bluff Aboriginal Land Trust","offset":753},{"uri":"Katiti_Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"Katiti","offset":806},{"uri":"Urrampinyi_Iltjiltajarri_Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"Urrampinyi Iltjiltajarri Aboriginal Land Trust","offset":817},{"uri":"Refuge","surface_form":"refuge","offset":1070},{"uri":"Nomadic_people","surface_form":"nomadic","offset":1182},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":1440},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu","offset":1525},{"uri":"Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa","surface_form":"Kata Tju\u1E6Fa","offset":1535},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu-Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa_National_Park","surface_form":"Ayers Rock\u2013Mt Olga National Park","offset":1560},{"uri":"Freehold_title","surface_form":"freehold title","offset":1725},{"uri":"Public_journal","surface_form":"gazette","offset":2016},{"uri":"Legislation","surface_form":"Act","offset":2285}]}
