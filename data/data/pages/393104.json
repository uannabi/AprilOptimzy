{"id":393104,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_journal","text":"e=\"preserve\">Public journal (official gazette, official journal, or official diary) is the daily record of the work of an official public organization, especially of legislatures of countries and/or its administrative divisions.\nJournals of this sort are also often called gazettes (state or government newspapers).\nIn some countries, the publication in the official journal is a condition for a law to \"come into effect\" or \"come into force\" (in which the law becomes a reality), so that people know the law (or treaty) exists, which generally releases it into the public domain. But sometimes a public journal is not always released into the public domain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Record","surface_form":"record","offset":97},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":122},{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"public","offset":131},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":138},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":166},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":182},{"uri":"Administrative_division","surface_form":"administrative division","offset":203},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":283},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":292},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":303},{"uri":"Publication","surface_form":"publication","offset":339},{"uri":"Condition","surface_form":"condition","offset":380},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":396},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":513},{"uri":"Public_domain","surface_form":"public domain","offset":566}]}
