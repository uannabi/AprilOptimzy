{"id":393124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Amidah (, \"standing\") is one of the two main prayers of Judaism. It has that name because people say it standing up. Jews say it at every prayer service of the year.\nIt is also called \"Shemoneh Esrei\" (, \"eighteen\") because at first the weekday version of the prayer had eighteen blessings. (It now has nineteen.) In the Talmud, it is called \"Tefilah\" (). This simply means \"prayer\". It has that name because it is so central to Judaism.\nBlessings of the Amidah.\nThe Amidah always has three sections.\nSaying the Amidah.\nThe Amidah is said at least three times every day: at the morning, afternoon and evening prayer services. A person should say it standing. A person should say it loud enough to hear it. But it should be quiet enough that other people cannot hear it.\nThe Amidah is not said out loud at night.\nIn Reform Judaism the Amidah is not said quietly. It is said out loud at every prayer service.\nChanges on Shabbat and Jewish holidays.\nOn Shabbat and important Jewish holidays, the Amidah prayer changes in two important ways.\nThere are two Amidah prayers during the year that are different from any others. See the pages on these holidays for more information.\nReference.\nIt is a very good English/Hebrew siddur to use for learning about prayers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":62},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":73},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":134},{"uri":"Jewish_prayer_services","surface_form":"prayer service","offset":155},{"uri":"Version","surface_form":"version","offset":262},{"uri":"Blessing","surface_form":"blessing","offset":297},{"uri":"Talmud","surface_form":"Talmud","offset":338},{"uri":"Central","surface_form":"central","offset":435},{"uri":"Reform_Judaism","surface_form":"Reform Judaism","offset":832},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":1177}]}
