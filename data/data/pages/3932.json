{"id":3932,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_rod","text":"=\"preserve\">Glass rods are sometimes used as stirrers in laboratory environments.\nGlass rods are often used to spread liquids evenly onto something. An example would be to coat glass surfaces with liquids to look at them under a microscope.\nGlass rods rubbed with silk or fur were used in early demonstrations of electrical energy.\nGlass rods are commonly manufactured in diameters of 3 mm, 6 mm, and 10 mm.\nGlass is used for these rods because it does not react with most laboratory chemicals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stir","surface_form":"stir","offset":45},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":57},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":68},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"Glass","offset":82},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":118},{"uri":"Even","surface_form":"even","offset":126},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscope","offset":229},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":264},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":272}]}
