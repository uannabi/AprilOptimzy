{"id":393319,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat","text":"\"Donkey Kong Jungle Beat\" is a platform video game for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It was released in Japan on December 16, 2004, in Europe on February 4, 2005, and in North America on March 14, 2005. It is played with the DK Bongos controller.\nThe game involves combat, platforming, and counterattacking (attacking enemies after they attack you). Players use the left drum to move left, the right drum to move right, and both drums to jump. Clapping or hitting the sides of the drums causes Donkey Kong to clap. Clapping produces a small small red ring and a bigger green one. Enemies that are in the red ring are usually defeated, and those that are in the green ring are usually stunned. Stunned enemies can be killed by jumping on them and hitting the drums repeatedly. The goal is not just to get to the end of the level, but also to get as many \"beats\" (points) as the player can. Beats are gotten by grabbing bananas, and lost by being hit or falling. More beats can be gotten by doing combos while grabbing bananas.\nIn 2008 and 2009, \"Donkey Kong Jungle Beat\" was one of the games released as part of the \"New Play Control!\" series of remade Nintendo GameCube games for the Wii. It features new and changed levels along with more traditional controls that use the analog stick to move and the A button to jump.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Platform_video_game","surface_form":"platform video game","offset":31},{"uri":"Nintendo_GameCube","surface_form":"Nintendo GameCube","offset":59},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":110},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":141},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":176},{"uri":"DK_Bongos","surface_form":"DK Bongos","offset":231},{"uri":"Donkey_Kong","surface_form":"Donkey Kong","offset":500},{"uri":"Bananas","surface_form":"bananas","offset":924},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":1190}]}
