{"id":393410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Pinball_Land","text":"\"Kirby's Pinball Land\" is a pinball video game that was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo in 1993. It is for the Game Boy game console. It is the first spin-off game in the \"Kirby\" series. It was later released for the Virtual Console service on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.\nThe game features three pinball tables. Each table has three floors. The player earns points by bouncing off of walls and bumpers, and by defeating enemies. Players can also earn Maxim Tomatoes, which stops the player from losing a ball for a short amount of time. On the middle and top floors is a Warp Star. If the player takes the Warp Star on the middle floor, the player can play a minigame to earn extra points and multipliers. The Warp Star on the top floor takes the player to the boss of the table. After defeating a boss, the player can earn another life by spelling out the word \"Extra\" with the letters that appear on the table selection screen. After the player plays all three tables, they face against King Dedede. Defeating King Dedede allows the player to play the tables again for a higher score.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pinball","surface_form":"pinball","offset":28},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":36},{"uri":"HAL_Laboratory","surface_form":"HAL Laboratory","offset":69},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":101},{"uri":"Game_Boy","surface_form":"Game Boy","offset":133},{"uri":"Spin-off","surface_form":"spin-off","offset":172},{"uri":"Kirby_(series)","surface_form":"\"Kirby\" series","offset":193},{"uri":"Virtual_Console","surface_form":"Virtual Console","offset":239},{"uri":"Nintendo_3DS","surface_form":"Nintendo 3DS","offset":270}]}
