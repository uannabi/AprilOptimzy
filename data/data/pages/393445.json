{"id":393445,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust_of_Australia","text":"The Australian Council of National Trusts (ACNT) is a national organization for community-based, non-government organisations that promote and conserve Australia's natural and historic heritage.\nBegun in 1965, it joined together the eight National Trusts in each Australian state and territory. It provides them with a national office and national and international presence.\nTogether, the National Trusts own or manage over 300 heritage places. About 7000 people work as volunteers with and there are 350 paid employees. Around 1,000,000 people visit the properties and their collections in Australia each year.\nHistory.\nIt was based on the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England. Local campaigns to conserve native bushland and save old buildings were the forces that led to the first Australian national trusts in New South Wales in 1947, South Australia in 1955 and Victoria in 1956. They were followed later by Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland.\nAnnie Forsyth Wyatt (1885-1961) was the driving force behind the beginning of the National Trust in Australia. She lived for much of her life in a cottage in Gordon, New South Wales, which is still standing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conserve","offset":143},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":152},{"uri":"Volunteer","surface_form":"volunteers","offset":472},{"uri":"National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty","surface_form":"National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty","offset":642},{"uri":"Annie_Forsyth_Wyatt","surface_form":"Annie Forsyth Wyatt","offset":997},{"uri":"Gordon%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gordon, New South Wales","offset":1155}]}
