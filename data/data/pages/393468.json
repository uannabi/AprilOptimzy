He lived and worked in Alexandria when Alexander the Great ruled. He is known for for his inventions and experiments. One of his well known inventions was the Aeolipile (a simple steam turbine). He also discovered a way to calculate square root<nowiki/>s, and Heron's formula for finding the area of a triangle.\nCajori says \"Hero was a practical surveyor, so it is not surprising to find little resemblance between his writing and those of Euclid or Apollonius\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":56},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":67},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":81},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":99},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":132},{"uri":"Alexander_the_Great","surface_form":"Alexander the Great","offset":148},{"uri":"Inventions","surface_form":"inventions","offset":199},{"uri":"Experiments","surface_form":"experiments","offset":214},{"uri":"Aeolipile","surface_form":"Aeolipile","offset":268},{"uri":"Steam_turbine","surface_form":"steam turbine","offset":288},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":342},{"uri":"Heron%27s_formula","surface_form":"Heron's formula","offset":369},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":411},{"uri":"Surveyor","surface_form":"surveyor","offset":455},{"uri":"Euclid","surface_form":"Euclid","offset":549},{"uri":"Apollonius","surface_form":"Apollonius","offset":559}]}
