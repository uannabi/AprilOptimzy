{"id":393642,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantarur","text":"Mantarur is a hilly area in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It forms the southeastern end of the Olia Chain of mountains. This outcrop includes Butler's Dome (; 1102\u00A0metres above sea level). The granite escarpment called Foster's Cliff is nearby to the east. Mantarur is located about southwest of Kata Tju\u1E6Fa. It is on Pitjantjatjara land, part of the Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust. A family outstation was established here in the 1980s, at a rockhole in the western slopes. It has since been abandoned.\nFrank Rees George led a prospecting expedition through the area between 1905 and 1906. George gave names to several of the landforms, including Butler's Dome, which is believed to have been named after Richard Butler, who was a minister of South Australia. He named Foster's Cliff after R. W. Foster, the South Australian Commissioner of Public Works. The expedition found traces of gold at Foster's Cliff, but not enough of it to warrant mining. It was the only place in the Petermann Ranges found to contain any gold.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":49},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":69},{"uri":"Olia_Chain","surface_form":"Olia Chain","offset":117},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":186},{"uri":"Above_sea_level","surface_form":"above sea level","offset":193},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":215},{"uri":"Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa","surface_form":"Kata Tju\u1E6Fa","offset":318},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":339},{"uri":"Petermann_Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust","offset":372},{"uri":"Outstation","surface_form":"outstation","offset":414},{"uri":"Rockhole","surface_form":"rockhole","offset":465},{"uri":"Prospecting","surface_form":"prospecting","offset":550},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":562},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":909},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":965},{"uri":"Petermann_Ranges","surface_form":"Petermann Ranges","offset":1002}]}
