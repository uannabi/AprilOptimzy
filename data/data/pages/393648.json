{"id":393648,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olia_chain","text":"The Olia Chain (or The Olias) is a mountain range in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It forms the southeastern end of the Petermann Ranges, and connects these ranges with the Musgrave Ranges further south. The Olia Chain consists of scattered outcrops of rocky hills, separated and surrounded by sandy plains. It extends from Katamala Cone (828\u00A0m) at its northern end to Mantarur (including Butler's Dome, 1102\u00A0m) in the south. The centre of the chain is dominated by Stevenson Peak (1025\u00A0m). A few kilometres northeast of this peak is a Pitjantjatjara outstation, called Pirrulpakalarintja.\nThe Olia Chain mostly consist of flat-topped ridges composed of sandstone, slate, quartzite, and limestone rock beds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":35},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":74},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":94},{"uri":"Petermann_Ranges","surface_form":"Petermann Ranges","offset":142},{"uri":"Musgrave_Ranges","surface_form":"Musgrave Ranges","offset":195},{"uri":"Sand_dune","surface_form":"sandy","offset":316},{"uri":"Plains","surface_form":"plains","offset":322},{"uri":"Mantarur","surface_form":"Mantarur","offset":391},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":558},{"uri":"Outstation","surface_form":"outstation","offset":573},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":676},{"uri":"Slate","surface_form":"slate","offset":687},{"uri":"Quartzite","surface_form":"quartzite","offset":694},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":709}]}
