{"id":39367,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion","text":"Recursion is a word from mathematics and computer science. It is used to define a thing, such as a function or a set. A recursive definition uses the thing it is defining as part of the definition.\nDescription.\nUsually, a recursive function refers to itself in some cases (or inputs), but not in every case. A function that referred to itself in every case would never terminate.\nWhen a function refers to itself, it often uses a smaller input than the input it was given. In this way, it can solve a problem by first solving a simpler version of the problem.\nExample.\nThis function computes the factorial of a natural number. It works because formula_1 and formula_1.\nThe definition has two cases: a recursive case for formula_1, and a case for formula_1 that is not recursive. The case that is not recursive is called a \"base case\".\nUses.\nRecursion can be used to write computer programs. A program that uses recursion may be easier to write and understand than a program that does the same thing without recursion.\nRecursion is used in mathematics to prove theorems. This method is called induction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":25},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":41},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"define","offset":73},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":99},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":113},{"uri":"Factorial","surface_form":"factorial","offset":596},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":611},{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"computer programs","offset":872},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":1039},{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorems","offset":1060},{"uri":"Mathematical_induction","surface_form":"induction","offset":1092}]}
