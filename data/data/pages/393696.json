{"id":393696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Currie","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mount Currie is a mountain in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is about above sea level. It is part of the same line of conglomerate hills that includes Ulu\u1E5Fu and Kata Tju\u1E6Fa. These three formations have very similar compositions. The sheet of conglomerate that is shared by all three is called Mount Currie Conglomerate.\nThe peak was named Mount Currie by the explorer William H. Tietkens, who led an expedition through the area in 1889. He named the peak from a distance, and did not actually approach it. The first White explorers to reach Mount Currie were the Mackay Expedition in June 1926, which was led by Donald Mackay and Herbert Basedow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":31},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":64},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":84},{"uri":"Above_sea_level","surface_form":"above sea level","offset":107},{"uri":"Conglomerate_(geology)","surface_form":"conglomerate","offset":155},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":168},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu","offset":188},{"uri":"Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa","surface_form":"Kata Tju\u1E6Fa","offset":198},{"uri":"Geological_formation","surface_form":"formations","offset":222},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":395},{"uri":"William_Harry_Tietkens","surface_form":"William H.
