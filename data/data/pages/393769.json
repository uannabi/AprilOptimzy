{"id":393769,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_religion","text":"e=\"preserve\">Yoruba religion is a traditional West African religion, mainly from Nigeria. It is the religion of the Yoruba people. It has influenced some off-shoot religious groups. It is nowadays a minority religion. A central idea behind the Yoruba religion is that natural objects, like trees, rivers, stones, and iron have a spiritual existence.\nThe Yoruba religion has had great influence among black people in Cuba, many of whom are Yoruba descendants. It has some usage in other Caribbean islands, and in the United States. In Cuba the religion is known locally as \"regla d'ocha\", (meaning 'the way of the spirits'). \"Santer\u00EDa\" is a slightly wider term referring to the merging (\"syncretism\") of African spirits and Catholic saints. Adherents in countries like Cuba may be received into the Catholic church and initiated into the Yoruban religion, sometimes on successive days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":46},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":59},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":81},{"uri":"Yoruba_people","surface_form":"Yoruba people","offset":116},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":416},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":486},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":516},{"uri":"Santer%C3%ADa","surface_form":"Santer\u00EDa","offset":625},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":723}]}
