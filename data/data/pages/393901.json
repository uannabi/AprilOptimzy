Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and are responsible for about 70 percent of the US casino's income.\nThe first slot machine was invented by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California, U.S in 1894. The following year Fey built the 4-11-44 in his basement; it proved so successful at a local saloon that he soon quit his job and opened a factory to produce more units. In 1898 Fey built the Card Bell, the first three-reel slot machine with automatic cash payouts. The Card Bell had a handle that set the reels in motion when it was pushed down and\u00A0playing card\u00A0suitmarks that lined up to form\u00A0poker\u00A0hands. His next slot machine, the\u00A0Liberty Bell, was built in 1899 and used horseshoes and bells as well as playing card suitmarks on the reels. Three bells lined up in a row meant the top payout. Chiefly because of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, only 4 of more than 100 Liberty Bell machines built by Fey survive. The Liberty Bell proved immensely popular among saloon patrons in San Francisco and was quickly copied by Fey\u2019s competitors, such as the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":16},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":62},{"uri":"Canadian_English","surface_form":"Canadian English","offset":91},{"uri":"Australian_English","surface_form":"Australian English","offset":145},{"uri":"New_Zealand_English","surface_form":"New Zealand English","offset":168},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":205},{"uri":"Casino","surface_form":"casino","offset":229},{"uri":"Casino","surface_form":"casinos","offset":947},{"uri":"Casino","surface_form":"casino","offset":1082}]}
