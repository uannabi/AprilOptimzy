The trust is the legal landowner and holds the title on behalf of the people who are recognised as the land's traditional owners. It was created on 26 October 1985.\nThe land was originally claimed as part of the Katiti Land Claim in 1979. It was sumbitted by the Central Land Council on the behalf of several hundred people, most of whom lived at Mu\u1E6Fitjulu. The claim was judged in 1980, and Commissioner Justice John Toohey formally recognised 104 traditional owners for Ulu\u1E5Fu and 57 for Kata Tju\u1E6Fa. He granted them freehold title to the land now held by the Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust. They were not granted the title to Ulu\u1E5Fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1E6Fa because it was already being used as a national park.\nThere was then a long legal case over the freehold title (actual ownership) of the park lands. The case continued until November 1983, when Prime Minister Bob Hawke acknowledged that the traditional owners had the rights to Ulu\u1E5Fu. In 1985, the Territory passed two amendments: one for the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and one for the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The freehold title to the land in the park was passed to the Ulu\u1E5Fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1E6Fa Aboriginal Land Trust on 26 October 1985. As part of the agreement, the land was immediately leased back to the Director of National Parks for a period of 99 years. The title is inalienable, which means that it can not be sold, traded or given away; it is inherited continuously by the community's descendants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"land trust","offset":59},{"uri":"Freehold_title","surface_form":"freehold title","offset":85},{"uri":"Ulu%E1%B9%9Fu%E2%80%93Kata_Tju%E1%B9%AFa_National_Park","surface_form":"Ulu\u1E5Fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1E6Fa National Park","offset":115},{"uri":"Aboriginal_title","surface_form":"traditional owners","offset":306},{"uri":"Katiti_Aboriginal_Land_Trust","surface_form":"Katiti Land Claim","offset":408},{"uri":"Central_Land_Council","surface_form":"Central Land Council","offset":459},{"uri":"Mu%E1%B9%AFitjulu","surface_form":"Mu\u1E6Fitjulu","offset":543},{"uri":"John_Toohey_(judge)","surface_form":"John Toohey","offset":609},{"uri":"Aboriginal_title","surface_form":"traditional owners","offset":645},{"uri":"Legal_case","surface_form":"legal case","offset":914},{"uri":"Bob_Hawke","surface_form":"Bob Hawke","offset":1047},{"uri":"Amendment","surface_form":"amendment","offset":1157},{"uri":"Lease","surface_form":"leased","offset":1441},{"uri":"Parks_Australia","surface_form":"Director of National Parks","offset":1460},{"uri":"Inalienable","surface_form":"inalienable","offset":1526},{"uri":"Inheritance","surface_form":"inherited","offset":1604},{"uri":"Descendant","surface_form":"descendant","offset":1646}]}
