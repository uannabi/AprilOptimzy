{"id":394275,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_(law)","text":"=\"preserve\">In property law, a freehold (also called frank-tenement) is the ownership of real property. This includes land and everything that naturally comes with it, such as buildings, trees and natural resources. Freehold is different to a leasehold, in which the property is kept by the owner of the land after the lease has expired. Ownership of a freehold estate is indefinite amount of time.\nFreehold is used in the laws of many Commonwealth countries. It comes from the United Kingdom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"property","offset":15},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":24},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"ownership","offset":76},{"uri":"Real_property","surface_form":"real property","offset":89},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":118},{"uri":"Natural_resource","surface_form":"natural resource","offset":197},{"uri":"Leasehold","surface_form":"leasehold","offset":243},{"uri":"Renting","surface_form":"lease","offset":319},{"uri":"Indefinite","surface_form":"indefinite","offset":372},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":436},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":478}]}
