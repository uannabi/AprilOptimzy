{"id":394329,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Kelly","text":"James Edward Kelly (born February 14, 1960) is a former American football quarterback in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills and in the USFL for the Houston Gamblers. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes. While Kelly was drafted by the Bills in 1983, he did not want to play for them at first, instead joining the Gamblers in the USFL. He was a star player for Houston until the USFL went out of business in 1986, after which he finally joined the Bills.\nKelly continued playing at a high level, helping the Bills become one of the NFL's best teams for some time. From 1990 to 1993, the Bills appeared in four straight Super Bowls with Kelly at quarterback. Though the Bills failed to win every time, they remain the only team in NFL history to make it to four or more Super Bowls as of 2019. Long after retiring in 1997, Kelly is still considered the greatest quarterback in Buffalo Bills team history by many people, as he still holds many passing records for the team.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":56},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":74},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"NFL","offset":93},{"uri":"Buffalo_Bills","surface_form":"Buffalo Bills","offset":105},{"uri":"USFL","surface_form":"USFL","offset":130},{"uri":"Houston_Gamblers","surface_form":"Houston Gamblers","offset":143},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":171},{"uri":"Miami_Hurricanes_football","surface_form":"Miami Hurricanes","offset":196},{"uri":"Super_Bowl","surface_form":"Super Bowl","offset":628}]}
