{"id":394370,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iltur%2C_South_Australia","text":"Iltur is the name of a remote Pitjantjatjara homeland in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. It is also known as Ilturnga or Coffin Hill after the rocky outcrop where it is located. It is located at the southern end of the Birksgate Range, and is one of the most southerly locations on the A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. It was visited by the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition in 1981, led by the explorer David Lindsay.\nMany of the families who had lived in this region historically were forced to leave the area due to nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga. They were moved to Fregon in the north and to Yalata, very far to the south. Not all of them left, however, and some still living around Iltur reported that they were affected by the fallout of the tests. In 1976, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs offered AU$10,000 for the establishment of an outstation community at Iltur. An outstation was built, but is not always occupied.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Remote","surface_form":"remote","offset":23},{"uri":"Pitjantjatjara","surface_form":"Pitjantjatjara","offset":30},{"uri":"Outstation","surface_form":"homeland","offset":45},{"uri":"Great_Victoria_Desert","surface_form":"Great Victoria Desert","offset":61},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":86},{"uri":"Birksgate_Range","surface_form":"Birksgate Range","offset":233},{"uri":"A%E1%B9%89angu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara_Lands","surface_form":"A\u1E49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands","offset":300},{"uri":"David_Lindsay_(explorer)","surface_form":"David Lindsay","offset":434},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"nuclear weapon","offset":549},{"uri":"Maralinga","surface_form":"Maralinga","offset":574},{"uri":"Kaltjiti%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Fregon","offset":604},{"uri":"Yalata%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Yalata","offset":631},{"uri":"Nuclear_fallout","surface_form":"fallout","offset":768}]}
