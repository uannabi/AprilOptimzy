{"id":394456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflation","text":"Conflation is what happens when two or more individuals, concepts, or places seem to be a single identity. Although they may share one or more characteristics, the differences somehow seem to be lost.\nIn logic, conflation is the practice of treating two distinct concepts as if they were one. This produces errors or misunderstandings. The fusion or merge of distinct subjects tends to obscure analysis of relationships which are emphasized by contrasts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":204},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":263}]}
