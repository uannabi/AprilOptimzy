The band's decision stemmed from disillusionment with the music industry and the constant promotion of fourth record \"Folie \u00E0 Deux\". The band's, specifically bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz, every movement had become fodder for gossip in tabloids, and lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump recalled that \"We found ourselves running on fumes a little bit -- creatively and probably as people, too.\"\nOn February 4, 2013, the band called off the hiatus announcing a new single, new album, and a new tour.\nArena tour.\nFall Out Boy did a concert tour in support of the album. It consisted of 16 shows in September 2013. The opening acts were Big Sean, who assists on the track \"The Mighty Fall\" on the album, and Panic! at the Disco.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":26},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":51},{"uri":"Fall_Out_Boy","surface_form":"Fall Out Boy","offset":75},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":134},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":175},{"uri":"My_Songs_Know_What_You_Did_in_the_Dark_(Light_%27Em_Up)","surface_form":"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light 'Em Up)","offset":479},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard Hot 100","offset":633},{"uri":"2_Chainz","surface_form":"2 Chainz","offset":684},{"uri":"Save_Rock_and_Roll_Fall_Arena_Tour","surface_form":"Save Rock and Roll Fall Arena Tour","offset":837},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":890},{"uri":"Panic%21_at_the_Disco","surface_form":"Panic! at the Disco","offset":904},{"uri":"Big_Sean","surface_form":"Big Sean","offset":935},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"promotional single","offset":986},{"uri":"The_Phoenix_(song)","surface_form":"The Phoenix","offset":1006},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard Hot 100","offset":1098},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":1315},{"uri":"Folie_%C3%A0_Deux","surface_form":"Folie \u00E0 Deux","offset":1595},{"uri":"Pete_Wentz","surface_form":"Pete Wentz","offset":1652},{"uri":"Patrick_Stump","surface_form":"Patrick Stump","offset":1749},{"uri":"Concert_tour","surface_form":"concert tour","offset":2006},{"uri":"Opening_act","surface_form":"opening act","offset":2092},{"uri":"Big_Sean","surface_form":"Big Sean","offset":2110},{"uri":"Panic%21_at_the_Disco","surface_form":"Panic! at the Disco","offset":2181}]}
