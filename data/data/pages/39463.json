From March 11, 1983 to December 20, 1991, he served as the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia as leader of the Australian Labor Party. He was the third longest serving Prime Minister of Australia.\nPolitical career.\nHe was a union leader before he entered parliament in 1980. He became leader only a little while before the 1983 election but he defeated Malcolm Fraser. His government made many changes, like the Whitlam government, but did it more slowly and with more planning. His government moved Labor to the right economically. His leadership was challenged twice by Paul Keating. He lost the second time and retired.\nBy July 1990, Hawke had overtaken Malcolm Fraser as the second longest-serving Australian Prime Minister but on 21 December 2004 the record was overtaken by John Howard, making Hawke the third longest serving Prime Minister.\nPersonal life and death.\nHawke has been married twice. During office, he was married to Hazel Hawke (\"n\u00E9e\" Masterson), a respected \"first lady\". Just before Hawke became prime minister, author Blanche d'Alpuget wrote a biography about him. Hawke married d'Alpuget in 1995.\nIn late December 2018, Hawke revealed that he was in \"terrible health\". He supported Labor in the upcoming 2019 election and said he \"may not witness the party's success\". He died on 16 May 2019 in Sydney, at the age of 89. His death happened two days before the election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australian","offset":64},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":151},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":169},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Australian Labor Party","offset":196},{"uri":"Trade_union","surface_form":"union","offset":309},{"uri":"Malcolm_Fraser","surface_form":"Malcolm Fraser","offset":438},{"uri":"Gough_Whitlam","surface_form":"Whitlam","offset":497},{"uri":"Paul_Keating","surface_form":"Paul Keating","offset":657},{"uri":"Malcolm_Fraser","surface_form":"Malcolm Fraser","offset":742},{"uri":"John_Howard","surface_form":"John Howard","offset":865},{"uri":"Hazel_Hawke","surface_form":"Hazel Hawke","offset":1021},{"uri":"N%C3%A9e","surface_form":"n\u00E9e","offset":1035},{"uri":"Blanche_d%27Alpuget","surface_form":"Blanche d'Alpuget","offset":1126},{"uri":"2019_Australian_federal_election","surface_form":"2019 election","offset":1313},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":1404}]}
