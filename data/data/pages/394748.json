He uses a magic paintbrush to fight enemies. The game is intended to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by focusing his adventurous side rather than his pleasant, cheerful side, doing so by showing him as an heroic character. The game is darker and more complex than previous Mickey Mouse games. It features the first appearance of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's first successful cartoon character, as a major character since 1943.\nA sequel, \"Epic Mickey: The Power of Two\", was released for the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in 2012.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Platform_game","surface_form":"platform","offset":19},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":28},{"uri":"Nintendo_Wii","surface_form":"Nintendo Wii","offset":47},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":181},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":213},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":256},{"uri":"Mickey_Mouse","surface_form":"Mickey Mouse","offset":296},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":356},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":826},{"uri":"PlayStation_3","surface_form":"PlayStation 3","offset":893},{"uri":"Xbox_360","surface_form":"Xbox 360","offset":908},{"uri":"Wii_U","surface_form":"Wii U","offset":922}]}
