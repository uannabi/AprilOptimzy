{"id":394863,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Fusion","text":"\"Metroid Fusion\" is an action-adventure video game for the Game Boy Advance console. It was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 and published by Nintendo. It was released in North America on November 17, 2002, in Europe on November 22, 2002, in Australia on November 29, 2002, and in Japan on February 14, 2003. It is the fourth game in the main \"Metroid\" series.\nIn \"Metroid Fusion\", Samus Aran is sent to the Biologic Space Laboratories space station because an explosion has happened there. The station contains X Parasites, viruses that can make a copy of the appearance and memories of living things that they are in. The Galactic Federation plans to capture the X Parasites to do further study of them. Because of how dangerous the X Parasites are, Samus has to destroy the space station to protect the federation from them.\nUnlike the other \"Metroid\" games, \"Metroid Fusion\" focuses more on storyline than on exploration. The gameplay focuses on puzzle solving, platform jumping, and shooting enemies. Players have to find power-ups to get to new areas. Samus is able to absorb X Parasites to regain health, bombs, and missiles. Abilities new to the \"Metroid\" series include grabbing ledges and climbing ladders.\n\"Metroid Fusion\" can be connected to \"Metroid Prime\" with the Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable to unlock new features in \"Metroid Prime\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Action_adventure_game","surface_form":"action-adventure","offset":23},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":40},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance","offset":59},{"uri":"Nintendo_Research_%26amp%3B_Development_1","surface_form":"Nintendo Research & Development 1","offset":105},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":156},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":185},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":224},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":256},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":295},{"uri":"Metroid","surface_form":"\"Metroid\" series","offset":357},{"uri":"Samus_Aran","surface_form":"Samus Aran","offset":396},{"uri":"Space_station","surface_form":"space station","offset":450},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explosion","offset":475},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":539},{"uri":"Metroid_Prime","surface_form":"Metroid Prime","offset":1269},{"uri":"Nintendo_GameCube-Game_Boy_Advance_cable","surface_form":"Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable","offset":1293}]}
