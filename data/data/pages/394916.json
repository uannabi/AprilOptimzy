{"id":394916,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Prime_Hunters","text":"\"Metroid Prime Hunters\" is a first-person action-adventure video game for the Nintendo DS console. It was developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo. It was released in North America on March 20, 2006, in Europe on May 5, 2006, and in Japan on June 1, 2006. When the Nintendo DS launched in 2004, it included an early demo of \"Metroid Prime Hunters\", which at that point was titled \"Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt\".\nLike the other titles in the \"Metroid Prime\" series, \"Metroid Prime Hunters\" is a first-person adventure game where the focus is on exploration and discovery. However, it differs from other titles in that there is no assisted aiming, a bigger focus on gameplay, and online multiplayer. Samus Aran, the main character that the player plays as, can access her gunship from anywhere. The game uses both screens of the Nintendo DS: the top screen is used to show Samus' health and the amount of a weapon remaining, while the bottom screen shows the radar. The player moves Samus with the D-pad, and aiming is done with the use of the touch screen on the Nintendo DS' bottom screen.\nOnline multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play as Samus or one of six bounty hunters. Each bounty hunter has different forms and weapons. The game's host is able to set options for points and time limits, as well as determine whether or not players can use the radar. If less than four players join a game, computer-controlled characters are placed into the game. In multiplayer, the bottom screen shows the number of kills a player has made and the time remaining in the round.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"first-person","offset":29},{"uri":"Action_adventure_game","surface_form":"action-adventure","offset":42},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":59},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":78},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":165},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":194},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":230},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":260},{"uri":"Metroid_Prime","surface_form":"\"Metroid Prime\" series","offset":473},{"uri":"Multiplayer","surface_form":"multiplayer","offset":717},{"uri":"Samus_Aran","surface_form":"Samus Aran","offset":730}]}
