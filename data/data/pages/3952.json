{"id":3952,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality","text":"Spirituality is a name given to matters of the spirit. These can be any kind of meaningful personal activity or peaceful experience. There is not one agreed upon way to explain what happens. It is a concept so people can see and understand it in different ways. Some people believe spirituality is a part of religion. Others who are not religious, still seek and have spiritual experiences.\nMatters of the Spirit.\n\"Matters of the spirit\" may include the meaning in a person's life (or in all life), and how to find and improve on it. They may also include someone's search for God, the supernatural, a divine influence in their lives, or information about the afterlife, and how to best deal with each. \"Matters of the spirit\" may also include how to live among others as a group, or in a certain environment.\n\"Spiritual, but not religious\".\nSome who do not believe in an organized religion may still be interested in the \"spirits\" of humanity or of nature and live a certain way, or worship ancestors or creation because it gives them a sense of happiness to do so.\nAnother common usage refers to people who ascribe to ideals \"greater than themselves.\" For many, this leads to a pursuit of some form of enlightenment, often through meditation, yoga, philosophy or, in some cases, a study of Metaphysics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":47},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":199},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":308},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":577},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"supernatural","offset":586},{"uri":"Divine","surface_form":"divine","offset":602},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":609},{"uri":"Afterlife","surface_form":"afterlife","offset":660},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":797},{"uri":"Human_race","surface_form":"humanity","offset":935},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":950},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":984},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":992},{"uri":"Creation","surface_form":"creation","offset":1005},{"uri":"Happiness","surface_form":"happiness","offset":1047},{"uri":"Enlightenment","surface_form":"enlightenment","offset":1204},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"meditation","offset":1233},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"yoga","offset":1245},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":1251},{"uri":"Metaphysics","surface_form":"Metaphysics","offset":1292}]}
