The point in orbit where an object is nearest to the sun is called the perihelion. The word \"aphelion\" derives from the Greek words, \"apo\" meaning \"away, off, apart\" and \"Helios\".\nThe Earth's orbit has its aphelion around July 5, at which it is approximately 152.1 million kilometers or 94.5 million miles from the Sun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":33},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":82},{"uri":"Perihelion","surface_form":"perihelion","offset":158},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":207},{"uri":"Helios","surface_form":"Helios","offset":258},{"uri":"Earth%27s_orbit","surface_form":"Earth's orbit","offset":271}]}
