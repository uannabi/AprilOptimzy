{"id":395403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azorina_vidalii","text":"\"Azorina vidalii\" (also known as the Azores bellflower) is the only species of the genus \"Azorina\" within the Campanulaceae, the bellflower family. This endemic species of the Azores is used as an ornamental plant in other countries besides the Azores.\nIt was first given the name \"Campanula vidalii\" by Hewett Cottrell Watson in \"Hooker's Icones Plantarum\", table DCLXXXIV (684); Watson gave it the specific name \"vidalii\" after \"Capt. Vidal, R.N.\", who collected the original plant. Heinrich Feer changed the name to \"Azorina vidalii\", creating a new genus \"Azorina\", in \"Botanische Jahrb\u00FCcher f\u00FCr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie\", 12, S. 611.\nDescription.\nThe Azores bellflower is an evergreen, perennial herbaceous plant that grows to a height of 80 to 150 centimetres. It produces branches at the base and these branches are woody in the lower part. The plant has dark green leaves.\nThe plant flowers from May to October. The inflorescence has many hanging, waxy, pale pink, bell-shaped flowers. The \"Azorina vidalii\" forma \"alba\" has, as the name suggests, white flowers.\nWhere it grows.\nThe Azores bellflower is rare and usually grows in holes in cliffs near the sea, below the 50 metres of altitude. It is usually accompanied by the plant \"Salicornia\", which also tolerate the salt in the wind coming from the sea. The plant is found in all the islands of the Azores archipelago, but not on the island of Graciosa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus_(biology)","surface_form":"genus","offset":83},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":140},{"uri":"Azores","surface_form":"Azores","offset":176},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":197},{"uri":"Hewett_Cottrell_Watson","surface_form":"Hewett Cottrell Watson","offset":304},{"uri":"Heinrich_Feer","surface_form":"Heinrich Feer","offset":485},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":709},{"uri":"Perennial","surface_form":"perennial","offset":720},{"uri":"Herbaceous_plant","surface_form":"herbaceous plant","offset":730},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"centimetre","offset":783},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":808},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"woody","offset":852},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":920},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"inflorescence","offset":953},{"uri":"Wax","surface_form":"wax","offset":985},{"uri":"Bell","surface_form":"bell","offset":1002},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":1176},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":1210},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":1220},{"uri":"Salicornia","surface_form":"Salicornia","offset":1270},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":1319},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":1397},{"uri":"Graciosa_(island)","surface_form":"Graciosa","offset":1435}]}
