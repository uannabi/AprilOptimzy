His father worked as a construction worker and a cotton farmer. After moving often, the family settled in 1967 in the town of Southaven in De Soto County, Mississippi, and he graduated from Southaven High School. Young Grisham loved to read. In 1977, Grisham received a degree from Mississippi State University. He earned his law degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981. After leaving law school, he entered a small-town general law practice for nearly 10 years in Southaven, MS where he paid a lot of attention on criminal law and civil law.\nIn 1983, he was elected as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives, where he served until 1990. During this time, he continued his private law practice in Southaven.\nIn 1984 at the De Soto County courthouse in Hernando, Grisham witnessed the testimony of a 12-year-old girl who was raped. In his spare time, Grisham began work on his first novel, which explored what would have happened if the girl's father had murdered her attackers. He spent three years on \"A Time to Kill\" and finished it in 1987. The book was bought by Wynwood Press, which published it in June 1988.\nThe day after Grisham finished \"A Time to Kill\", he began work on another novel, the story of a young attorney lured to what seemed to be a perfect law firm. That second book, \"The Firm\", became the bestselling novel of 1991. Grisham then went on to write at least one work a year, most of them popular bestsellers.\nGrisham has been declared \"the bestselling novelist of the 90s,\" selling a total of 60,742,288 copies. Grisham's 1992 novel \"The Pelican Brief\" sold 11,232,480 books in the United States alone, making it the bestselling novel of the decade and the only novel to sell ten million books or more during a period of 10 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":60},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":72},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":84},{"uri":"Jonesboro%2C_Arkansas","surface_form":"Jonesboro","offset":129},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":140},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":199},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":206},{"uri":"Southaven%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Southaven","offset":276},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"De Soto County","offset":289},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":305},{"uri":"Mississippi_State_University","surface_form":"Mississippi State University","offset":432},{"uri":"University_of_Mississippi","surface_form":"University of Mississippi","offset":496},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"criminal","offset":689},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":698},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":746},{"uri":"Mississippi_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Mississippi House of Representatives","offset":762},{"uri":"Hernando%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Hernando","offset":942},{"uri":"Testimony","surface_form":"testimony","offset":974},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":1072},{"uri":"A_Time_to_Kill","surface_form":"A Time to Kill","offset":1193},{"uri":"The_Firm_(book)","surface_form":"The Firm","offset":1482},{"uri":"The_Pelican_Brief","surface_form":"The Pelican Brief","offset":1746},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1794}]}
