{"id":395783,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill-out_music","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chill-out music began in Europe during the early-1990s. It includes different types of electronic music that are meant to have a mellow style as well as mid-tempo beats. Ambient, ambient house, trip-hop, nu jazz, New Age and some other sub-genres of downtempo are mainly associated with chill-out music.\nThis genre of music is played in \"chill rooms\" at dance clubs to allow dancers a chance to relax and take a break from the more vigorous and fast-tempo type of music that is played on the main dance floor. In 1992, a UK regulation required dance clubs to have chill-out rooms and free water because of a number of Ecstasy-related injuries and deaths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":38},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":62},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic music","offset":100},{"uri":"Ambient_music","surface_form":"Ambient","offset":183},{"uri":"Ambient_house","surface_form":"ambient house","offset":192},{"uri":"Trip-hop","surface_form":"trip-hop","offset":207},{"uri":"Nu_jazz","surface_form":"nu jazz","offset":217},{"uri":"New_Age","surface_form":"New Age","offset":226},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"sub-genres","offset":249},{"uri":"Downtempo","surface_form":"downtempo","offset":263},{"uri":"Ecstasy","surface_form":"Ecstasy","offset":631}]}
