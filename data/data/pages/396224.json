{"id":396224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirkel_(Studentenverbindung)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Zirkel is a symbol used in Central European student societies (Studentenverbindungen).\nLook and meaning.\nA \"Zirkel\" consists of interwined lines, mostly followed by an exclamation mark. The lines mostly show the first letters of the name of the \"Studentenverbindung\" and/or the letters v, c, f or e, f, v.\nThe meaning of the exclamation mark is not quite clear.\nUsing.\nThe members of the \"Studentenverbindung\" use the \"Zirkel\" as sign on Couleur or other things (such as beer glasses, etc). If a member signs in affairs of its \"Studentenverbindung\" it places the \"Zirkel\" after its signature. This use is similar to the use of postnominals in Anglo-Saxon countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":27},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":42},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":59},{"uri":"Studentenverbindung","surface_form":"Studentenverbindung","offset":78},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":154},{"uri":"Exclamation_mark","surface_form":"exclamation mark","offset":183},{"uri":"Couleur","surface_form":"Couleur","offset":453},{"uri":"Post-nominal_letters","surface_form":"postnominals","offset":642},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":658}]}
