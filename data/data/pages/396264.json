{"id":396264,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Calder%C3%B3n","text":"Felipe de Jes\u00FAs Calder\u00F3n Hinojosa Nick name Comandante Borolas (born August 18, 1962) is a Mexican politician. He was President of Mexico from 1 December 2006 to 30 November 2012. He is a member of the Partido Acci\u00F3n Nacional (PAN), one of the three major Mexican political parties.\nCalder\u00F3n was born on August 18, 1962 in Morelia, Mexico. He studied at Free School of Law, at Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, and at Harvard University. Calder\u00F3n has been married to Margarita Zavala since 1993. She ran for president in the 2018 election, but dropped out of the race.\nCalder\u00F3n is Chairperson of Global Commission for the Economy and Climate which issued The New Climate Economy Report.\nPersonal background[edit].\nFelipe Calder\u00F3n was born in Morelia, Michoac\u00E1n, Mexico on August 18, 1962. He is the youngest of five brothers and son of Carmen Hinojosa Calder\u00F3n and the late Luis Calder\u00F3n Vega.\nHis father was a co-founder of the National Action Party and an important political figure. The elder Calder\u00F3n occupied state posts and served a term as federal deputy. He spent most of his life working within the party and spent most of his free time promoting the PAN. The young Calder\u00F3n was active in his father's campaigns. As a boy, he distributed party pamphlets and flyers, rode PAN campaign vehicles and chanted slogans at rallies.\nAfter growing up in Morelia, Calder\u00F3n moved to Mexico City, where he received a bachelor's degree in law from the Escuela Libre de Derecho. Later, he received a master's degree in economics from the Instituto Tecnol\u00F3gico Aut\u00F3nomo de M\u00E9xico (ITAM) and a Master of Public Administration degree in 2000 from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\nFollowing his father's example, he joined the PAN, with the desire of one day becoming Mexico's president. It was in the National Action Party that Calder\u00F3n met his wife, Margarita Zavala, who served in Congress as a federal deputy. They have three children, Mar\u00EDa, Luis Felipe and Juan Pablo.\nPolitical and social views.\nTo demands for detailed revelation of his personal positions on abortion, Calder\u00F3n responded that he voted for life. Calder\u00F3n's administration sought to maintain moderate positions on social policy and supported Mexican legislation guaranteeing abortion for rape victims, when pregnancy endangers a woman's life or in cases of severe fetal deformity; has publicly advocated the legalization of small quantities of cocaine and other drugs for addicts who agree to undergo treatment; and has approved a right-to-die initiative for ill patients to refuse invasive treatment or extraordinary efforts to prolong their lives. As for his economic policies, he supports balanced fiscal policies, flat taxes, lower taxes, and free trade.\nPolitical career.\nHe was a local representative in the Legislative Assembly and, on two different occasions, in the federal Chamber of Deputies. He ran for the governorship of Michoac\u00E1n in 1995 and served as national president of the PAN from 1996 to 1999. During his tenure, his party maintained control of 14 state capitals, but also faced a reduced presence in the federal Chamber of Deputies.\nSoon after Vicente Fox took office as president, Calder\u00F3n was appointed director of Banobras, a state-owned development bank. He was accused by political opponents of committing abuse, disputing use of certain legal procedures to finance property valued between three and five million Mexican pesos (between US$300,000 and $500,000); however, once political objections arose, he used other means to formalize his transaction.\nHe joined the presidential cabinet as Secretary of Energy, replacing Ernesto Martens. He left the post in May 2004 in protest of Vicente Fox's criticism of his presidential ambitions while supporting those of Santiago Creel.\n2006 presidential campaign.\nMembers of his party chose him as the PAN presidential candidate. In a series of three primary elections, he defeated the favored former Secretary of the Interior under President Vicente Fox, and thus the election of Calder\u00F3n as party candidate surprised many analysts. The PAN pointed to his competitive primary election as a sign of internal democracy. In other major parties, there was one candidate or all strong candidates but one were eliminated.\nCalder\u00F3n's campaign gained momentum after the first presidential debate. Subsequent poll numbers put him ahead of L\u00F3pez Obrador from March to May; some polls favored him by as much as 9 percentage points. This trend in his favor was contained after the second presidential debate when L\u00F3pez Obrador decided to start joining the debates. Final poll numbers days ahead of the results indicated that his opponent's prior lead had shrunk further; some polls gave L\u00F3pez Obrador the lead, while others favored Calder\u00F3n and still others indicated a technical tie.\nInauguration.\nMexican Constitution states that the President must be inaugurated by taking the oath of office before Congress in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. The PRD opposition had threatened to not allow Calder\u00F3n to take the oath of office and be inaugurated as president. Ahead of claims that the PRD would disrupt the precedings, the PAN took control of Congress's main floor three days before the inauguration was scheduled.\nOn November 30, 2006, outgoing President Vicente Fox Quesada and still President-elect Felipe Calder\u00F3n Hinojosa stood side-by-side on national television as Fox turned over the presidential sash to a cadet, who handed it to Calder\u00F3n. Afterwards, Fox read a short speech indicating that he had concluded his mandate by receiving the flag \"that had accompanied him during the last six years which he had devoted himself completely to the service of Mexico and had the utmost honor of being the president of the republic\". Calder\u00F3n then made a speech to the Mexican public indicating that he would still attend the inauguration ceremony at the Chamber of Deputies. He made a call to unity.\nCalder\u00F3n's inauguration ceremony on 1 December at the Congress of the Union was tense and lasted less than five minutes, as he barely managed to recite the oath of office while the PRD legislators shouted in protest against the alleged electoral fraud and attempted to impede his inauguration, and afterward he quickly left the building for security reasons as some of the legislators engaged in violent brawls. Besides the claims of fraud, Calder\u00F3n took office with the smallest percentage of votes for a winning presidential candidate in Mexican history (35.8%), which meant that his administration would face severe legitimacy problems. Only a month after taking office, Calder\u00F3n declared war on the drug cartels and organized crime, thus beginning the Mexican Drug War. This was considered by many as an immediate strategy to gain popular legitimacy and acceptation for the new President after the convoluted elections.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["President styles"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":91},{"uri":"President_of_Mexico","surface_form":"President of Mexico","offset":118},{"uri":"National_Action_Party_(Mexico)","surface_form":"Partido Acci\u00F3n Nacional","offset":202},{"uri":"Morelia","surface_form":"Morelia","offset":323},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":332},{"uri":"Escuela_Libre_de_Derecho","surface_form":"Free School of Law","offset":354},{"uri":"Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_Aut%C3%B3nomo_de_M%C3%A9xico","surface_form":"Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico","offset":377},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":430},{"uri":"Margarita_Zavala","surface_form":"Margarita Zavala","offset":479},{"uri":"Mexican_general_election%2C_2018","surface_form":"2018 election","offset":537},{"uri":"Chairperson","surface_form":"Chairperson","offset":593},{"uri":"The_New_Climate_Economy_Report","surface_form":"The New Climate Economy Report","offset":667}]}
