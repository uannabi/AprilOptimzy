{"id":396268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages","text":"The Ry\u016Bky\u016Ban languages (Okinawan: \u7409\u7403\u53E3, \"Ruuchuuguchi\") are a group of Japonic languages spoken in the Ry\u016Bky\u016B Islands, the southernmost part of Japan. The languages are Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni.\nAlthough Japan says the Ryukyuan languages are dialects of Japanese, most linguists see them as languages. This is because Japanese speakers would not be able to understand Ryukyuan without learning it.\nIn the past, the Ryukyuan languages were spoken all over Ryukyu but due to the languages being discriminated against, most Ryukyuans now speak Japanese.\nHistory.\nWhen a group people called the Yayoi came to Japan, they brought over a language called Proto-Japonic. This language diverged into Japanese and Ryukyuan overtime.\nSound Changes.\nJapanese and Ryukyuan has different sound changes. For example, Japanese \u201Co\u201D becomes Okinawan \u201Cu\u201D. This is why the Japanese word \u201Cto\u201D (and) is \u201Ctu\u201D in Okinawan.\nIt\u2019s also common for Japanese \u201Ck\u201D to become Okinawan \u201Cch\u201D. This causes \u201COkinawa\u201D to become \u201CUchinaa\u201D.\nIn the Yonaguni language, Japanese \u201Cy\u201D becomes \u201Cd\u201D. Japanese \u201Cyama\u201D (mountain) is \u201Cdama\u201D in Yonaguni.\nLanguage Usage.\nMost older Ryukyuans can speak a Ryukyuan language, while younger people speak Japanese. Ryukyuan languages are also spoken in Hawaii and South America as many Ryukyuans live there too.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Okinawan_language","surface_form":"Okinawan","offset":24},{"uri":"Japonic_languages","surface_form":"Japonic languages","offset":70},{"uri":"Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB_Islands","surface_form":"Ry\u016Bky\u016B Islands","offset":102},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":143},{"uri":"Amami_language","surface_form":"Amami","offset":168},{"uri":"Kunigami_language","surface_form":"Kunigami","offset":175},{"uri":"Okinawan_language","surface_form":"Okinawan","offset":185},{"uri":"Miyako_language","surface_form":"Miyako","offset":195},{"uri":"Yaeyama_language","surface_form":"Yaeyama","offset":203},{"uri":"Yonaguni_language","surface_form":"Yonaguni","offset":215},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":284},{"uri":"Yayoi_people","surface_form":"Yayoi","offset":621},{"uri":"Proto-Japonic","surface_form":"Proto-Japonic","offset":678},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":1276},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1287}]}
