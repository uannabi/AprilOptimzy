{"id":39654,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_algorithm","text":"=\"preserve\">A Las Vegas algorithm is an algorithm that uses randomness which has the consequence that the algorithm terminates with probability $p<1$. If the algorithm does terminate then it does so with a correct result (unlike a Monte Carlo algorithm which definitely terminates but with a result that is only correct with probability $p<1$). The algorithm gambles with the resources used. It may take a very long times to give back a result, or it may not give back a result at all.\nA simple example would be a version of the Quicksort. Quicksort is used to quickly sort things (mostly numbers). For this, each element is compared to a central element (called \"pivot\"). Depending on how this element is selected the sorting can take more time or less.\nMost often, a Las Vegas algorithm is used to pick the pivot randomly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":40},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":60},{"uri":"Monte_Carlo_algorithm","surface_form":"Monte Carlo algorithm","offset":231},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"gambles","offset":359},{"uri":"Resource","surface_form":"resource","offset":376},{"uri":"Quicksort","surface_form":"Quicksort","offset":529}]}
