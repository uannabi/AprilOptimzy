{"id":39669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6r%C3%B0","text":"=\"preserve\">J\u00F6r\u00F0 (or Jord) is a giantess (j\u00F6tun) and goddess in Norse mythology. Her name means \"earth\". She is also called Fj\u00F6rgyn.\nJ\u00F6r\u00F0 is the wife of Odin, king of the gods, and the mother of Thor. Her parents are Annar and N\u00F3tt.\nSnorri Sturluson says J\u00F6r\u00F0 was included among the Asynjur. Her name occurs most often in Skaldic and Eddic poetry in phrases that refer to Thor as \"the son of J\u00F6r\u00F0\". There is some confusion, however, because in some parts of the Poetic Edda the word \"Fj\u00F6rgyn\" appears in phrases referring to Thor, such as in the poem \"Voluspa\", where Thor is described as \"the son of Fj\u00F6rgyn\". Scholars explain the confusion by pointing out that Fj\u00F6rgyn, as an Old Norse noun, means \"earth\" when used in the feminine form.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Giant","surface_form":"giant","offset":32},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tnar","surface_form":"j\u00F6tun","offset":42},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":53},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":64},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":153},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":195},{"uri":"Annar","surface_form":"Annar","offset":217},{"uri":"N%C3%B3tt","surface_form":"N\u00F3tt","offset":227},{"uri":"Snorri_Sturluson","surface_form":"Snorri Sturluson","offset":233},{"uri":"Asynjur","surface_form":"Asynjur","offset":283},{"uri":"Skaldic_poetry","surface_form":"Skaldic","offset":322},{"uri":"Edda","surface_form":"Edda","offset":469},{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":678}]}
