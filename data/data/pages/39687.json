{"id":39687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_of_Castile","text":"Isabella of Castile (22 April 1451 \u2013 26 November 1504) was a queen of Castile and Le\u00F3n. She was the daughter of John II of Castile and his second wife Isabel of Portugal.\nHer brother, Enrique IV, who was the king of Castile, wanted her to marry her off. She wanted to marry someone from Portugal to make a political ally. She secretly married Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469, and had five children with him. The youngest was Catherine of Aragon, who married Henry VIII of England in 1509. Isabella was the grandmother of Carlos I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor).\nWhen Isabella\u2019s brother died, she was supposed to be the new queen. Her brother Enriques\u2019s daughter, Juana, wanted to become queen instead. After a war, Isabella became queen. At the same time, Isabella\u2019s husband, Ferdinand, became king of Aragon. They united the lands of Castile and Aragon into present-day Spain. Isabella helped pay for four of Christopher Columbus\u2019 trips to find the Americas. In their time, the Americas were called \u201CThe New World\u201D. She signed a truce in 1492 that made Spain a Christian country. After she died, her daughter Joanna of Castile became queen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Castile","surface_form":"Castile","offset":70},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Le\u00F3n","offset":82},{"uri":"John_II_of_Castile","surface_form":"John II of Castile","offset":112},{"uri":"Isabel_of_Portugal","surface_form":"Isabel of Portugal","offset":151},{"uri":"Enrique_IV_of_Castile","surface_form":"Enrique IV","offset":184},{"uri":"Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Ferdinand II of Aragon","offset":343},{"uri":"Catherine_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Catherine of Aragon","offset":424},{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII of England","offset":457},{"uri":"Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor","offset":539},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":919},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":959},{"uri":"Joanna_of_Castile","surface_form":"Joanna of Castile","offset":1119}]}
