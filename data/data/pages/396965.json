The decision for a new aircraft system was made by the Minister of Defence, Torsten Gustafsson. It was approved by Parliament in 1982.\nUsage.\nThe Gripen is one of the first multi-role combat aircraft that can be used for fighter, attack and reconnaissance missions as well as switching between them during flight, hence the name of the JAS 39. \u2018J\u2019 stands for the initial of the Swedish language word for \"Hunting\", meaning attack against air targets, \"attack\" to attack ground and sea targets, and \u2018S\u2019 stands for the Swedish word for \"reconnaissance\", to take photos and films. The name \"Gripen\" is the result of a contest held in the early 1980s, and means \u2018griffin\u2019.\nThe Gripen aircraft fighter system has for years been the backbone in the Swedish air force. Recently the Swedish government decided to acquire the latest version of the system, Gripen E, and Saab signed an agreement with the Swedish Defence Material Administration about development and modification of Gripen E.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":46},{"uri":"Saab","surface_form":"Saab","offset":91},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":99},{"uri":"Aerospace","surface_form":"aerospace","offset":107},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":390},{"uri":"Reconnaissance","surface_form":"reconnaissance","offset":401},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish language","offset":538},{"uri":"Griffin","surface_form":"griffin","offset":819},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":943},{"uri":"Saab","surface_form":"Saab","offset":1021}]}
