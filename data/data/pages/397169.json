{"id":397169,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buford%2C_Georgia","text":"Buford is a city in the U.S. state of Georgia. Most of the city is in Gwinnett County. A small part of it is in Hall County. In the 2010 census, the city had a population of 12,225.\nHistory.\nAfter the American Civil War a railroad was built that travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Richmond, Virginia. While the railroad was being built two railroad stockholders bought land around the railroad, and began building a town. The town was named after the railroad company's president, Algernon Sidney Buford. The railroad was completed in 1871, and Buford officially became a town on August 24, 1872. The Town of Buford was renamed the City of Buford in 1896.\nIn the later part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s Buford became famous for making leather products, including saddles which were sold through the Sears mail order catalog. Many famous actors during that time period used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company in Buford, including Gene Autry, the case of the television show Bonanza, and Roy Rogers' horse Trigger.\nAfter the Great Depression ended the horses were not used for farming as much and tractors were used instead, which meant that there was less need for leather products, and the companies that made leather in Buford closed.\nGeography.\nBuford is in north Georgia. It is in the northern part of Gwinnett county and in the southern part of Hall county. It is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":24},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":38},{"uri":"Gwinnett_County%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Gwinnett County","offset":70},{"uri":"Hall_County%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Hall County","offset":112},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":132},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":201},{"uri":"Atlanta%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Atlanta, Georgia","offset":261},{"uri":"Richmond%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Richmond, Virginia","offset":281},{"uri":"Gene_Autry","surface_form":"Gene Autry","offset":949},{"uri":"Bonanza","surface_form":"Bonanza","offset":993},{"uri":"Roy_Rogers","surface_form":"Roy Rogers","offset":1006},{"uri":"Trigger_(horse)","surface_form":"Trigger","offset":1024},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":1043},{"uri":"Atlanta_metropolitan_area","surface_form":"Atlanta metropolitan area","offset":1400}]}
