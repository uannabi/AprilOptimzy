{"id":397321,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WINS_(AM)","text":"e=\"preserve\">WINS is a radio station in New York City, New York. It first started in 1924. It is an all-news station, using that format since 1965. It is the oldest all-news station in the United States. It is known on-air as Ten-Ten Wins. It is owned by CBS Radio.\nWhen the station first started, it played rock and roll music. It switched to the all-news format on April 19, 1965, going with that format around the clock. Since then, the format has not seen a lot of changes, and it has been a very successful format.\nWINS is known for its teletype sound effect that plays in the background and its slogans \"All News, All the Time,\" \"The Newswatch Never Stops,\" \"Listen 2, 3, 4 times a day,\" and \"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world.\" The latter slogan refers to how a segment plays every 20 minutes. While other stations have stopped using the teletype sound effect, WINS has kept it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio station","offset":23},{"uri":"New_York_City%2C_New_York","surface_form":"New York City, New York","offset":40},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news","offset":104},{"uri":"CBS_Radio","surface_form":"CBS Radio","offset":255},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":308},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":322},{"uri":"Teleprinter","surface_form":"teletype","offset":542},{"uri":"Sound_effect","surface_form":"sound effect","offset":551}]}
