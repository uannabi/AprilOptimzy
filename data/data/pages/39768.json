{"id":39768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebern","text":"Ebern is a German town in the north of Franconia. It is between Ha\u00DFfurt and Coburg. It has about 8,000 people living in it. Its mayor is Robert Herrmann. Ebern is about 1,000 years old. It has an intact defense wall. Ebern was named after a boar (\"Eber\" in German).\nCreation legend.\nThe legend is that one day two hunters were chasing a wild boar. It was finally hit, but with two spears, one from each of the hunters. They could not decide who threw the spear that caused the boar to die. The boar finally broke down exactly at the border between Se\u00DFlach and Ebern, with its head in Ebern, and its body in Se\u00DFlach, so they divided it. That is why the town Ebern is named after the boar, and the town's flag carries the head of the boar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":11},{"uri":"Franconia","surface_form":"Franconia","offset":39},{"uri":"Hassfurt","surface_form":"Ha\u00DFfurt","offset":64},{"uri":"Coburg","surface_form":"Coburg","offset":76},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":287},{"uri":"Hunter","surface_form":"hunter","offset":314},{"uri":"Boar","surface_form":"boar","offset":342},{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":381},{"uri":"Se%C3%9Flach","surface_form":"Se\u00DFlach","offset":548},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":652},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":703},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":720}]}
