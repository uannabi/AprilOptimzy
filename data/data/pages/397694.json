{"id":397694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mary%27s_Peak","text":"Queen Mary's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha, in the South Atlantic Ocean. The top of it is 2,062 metres (6,765\u00A0feet) above sea level. It is named after Mary of Teck, the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nThe mountain is the peak of the large shield volcano which forms the island. The crater at the top is wide, with a heart-shaped lake. This lake is normally frozen during the winter, and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow.\nThe only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a small crater on the north shore of the island. The island community had to be evacuated.\nQueen Mary's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid. In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan.\nClimbing the peak.\nThe first known attempt to go up to the peak was in 1793 by the French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars. He could not get to the top. However, he collected hundreds of plants. Today, Queen Mary's Peak makes a wonderful but steep climbing route. Climbing it can take 5 to 10 hours, depending on the ability of the walker. Visitors are required to use a local guide if they want to go to \"The Peak\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tristan_da_Cunha","surface_form":"Tristan da Cunha","offset":49},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":80},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":145},{"uri":"Mary_of_Teck","surface_form":"Mary of Teck","offset":174},{"uri":"Queen_consort","surface_form":"Queen consort","offset":192},{"uri":"George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George V","offset":209},{"uri":"British_overseas_territories","surface_form":"British overseas territory","offset":255},{"uri":"Saint_Helena%2C_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha","surface_form":"Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha","offset":285},{"uri":"Peak","surface_form":"peak","offset":351},{"uri":"Shield_volcano","surface_form":"shield volcano","offset":369},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":412},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":459},{"uri":"Slope","surface_form":"slope","offset":527},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":564},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruption","offset":599},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":777},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":791},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":820},{"uri":"British_East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":862},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":1005},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":1012},{"uri":"Louis-Marie_Aubert_du_Petit-Thouars","surface_form":"Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars","offset":1023},{"uri":"Climbing_route","surface_form":"climbing route","offset":1184}]}
