The group is made up of three brothers. Their names are Alejandro, Fabian and Daniel Manzano. The group began in 2004. They are becoming more and more known by everyone. They chose to call the group \"Boyce Avenue\" because it is a combination of the two streets they have grown up on. Boyce Avenue usually play music in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.\nIn 2007, they had decided to put their music on Youtube. Since this moment, they have filmed themselves playing songs that they made or songs that they like from some artists like Rihanna, Coldplay, Lifehouse and Bruno Mars. They also invite new artists like Hannah Trigwell to play as guests.\nAlmost of the songs that they play are acoustic. The singer, Alejandro, plays the guitar with his other brother Fabian. The oldest brother, Daniel, does all the percussion and sometimes, he plays the bass. Alejandro plays also the piano. Their first big show was in New York City in January of 2009.
