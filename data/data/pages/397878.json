{"id":397878,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_of_the_Seven_Seas","text":"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is the only settlement of the island of Tristan da Cunha, in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Locally it is always called \"The Settlement\".\nEdinburgh of the Seven Seas is regarded as the most remote permanent settlement on Earth, being from the nearest human settlement, on Saint Helena.\nHistory.\nThe first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert, from Salem, Massachusetts, United States, who came to the islands in December 1810. He declared the islands his property and named them the \"Islands of Refreshment\". Lambert's rule was short-lived, as he died in 1812.\nThe settlement was founded on the island of Tristan da Cunha in 1816 by a Corporal William Glass (with his South African wife and two children) after the UK annexed Tristan da Cunha. A military garrison was maintained on the islands as a guard against any French attempts to rescue Napoleon, imprisoned on Saint Helena. The military garrison remained until the end of World War II.\nIt is named after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria, in honour of his visit to the island in 1867, after which the Settlement was officially (but never locally!) known as \"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas\".\nIt was damaged in a volcanic eruption near the Settlement in 1961 which forced the entire population to abandon the settlement and move to the UK. The eruption destroyed the settlement's crayfish factory. The following year a Royal Society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage, and reported that the settlement of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had been only marginally affected. Most families returned in 1963.\nAfter the return of most of the islanders in 1963, the Settlement was rebuilt. The harbour at Edinburgh was named Calshot Harbour, after the place in Hampshire where the islanders temporarily stayed.\nEdinburgh of the Seven Seas is the only major settlement of Tristan da Cunha, and contains a small port, the Administrator's residence, and the post office. There is a school, St Mary's School, with five classrooms, a computer room and other facilities.\nClimate.\nEdinburgh of the Seven Seas has a mild and humid oceanic climate, with moderate temperatures throughout the year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tristan_da_Cunha","surface_form":"Tristan da Cunha","offset":68},{"uri":"Saint_Helena%2C_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha","surface_form":"Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha","offset":89},{"uri":"British_overseas_territories","surface_form":"overseas territory","offset":138},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":164},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":193},{"uri":"Saint_Helena","surface_form":"Saint Helena","offset":389},{"uri":"Salem%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Salem","offset":467},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":474},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":489},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":787},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":936},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":962},{"uri":"Saint_Helena","surface_form":"Saint Helena","offset":986},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1048},{"uri":"Alfred%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh","offset":1080},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":1132},{"uri":"Tristan_rock_lobster","surface_form":"crayfish","offset":1484},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":1523},{"uri":"Harbour","surface_form":"harbour","offset":1804},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":1871},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":2233},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":2241}]}
