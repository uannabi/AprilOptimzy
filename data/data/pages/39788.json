{"id":39788,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Bellini","text":"Vincenzo Bellini (Catania, November 3 1801 - Puteaux, near Paris, September 23 1835) was an Italian composer and opera composer.\nBellini was well liked for his melodies. His first success was \"Il pirata\" in 1827. It was followed by \"I Capuleti e Montecchi\" in 1830. Then came his most famous operas \"La sonnambula\" (1831), \"Norma\" (1831) and his last \"I puritani\" (1835).\nHis second to last work \"Beatrice di Tenda\" (1833) was less successful.\nAlthough his operas never left the repertoire, they became popular again in the 1950s due largely to soprano Maria Callas, followed by Joan Sutherland in the 1960s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Catania","surface_form":"Catania","offset":18},{"uri":"November_3","surface_form":"November 3","offset":27},{"uri":"1801","surface_form":"1801","offset":38},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":59},{"uri":"September_23","surface_form":"September 23","offset":66},{"uri":"1835","surface_form":"1835","offset":79},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":92},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":100},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":113},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":119},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melodies","offset":160},{"uri":"La_sonnambula","surface_form":"La sonnambula","offset":300},{"uri":"Norma_(opera)","surface_form":"Norma","offset":324},{"uri":"I_puritani","surface_form":"I puritani","offset":352},{"uri":"Repertoire","surface_form":"repertoire","offset":479},{"uri":"Soprano","surface_form":"soprano","offset":545},{"uri":"Maria_Callas","surface_form":"Maria Callas","offset":553},{"uri":"Joan_Sutherland","surface_form":"Joan Sutherland","offset":579}]}
