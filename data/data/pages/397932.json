It is the only Sum 41 album that has a parental advisory sticker on it. Drummer Steve Jocz is featured on the cover dressed as a zombie. The band said on the DVD Sake Bombs And Happy Endings that the song title \"A.N.I.C.\" stood for Anna Nicole is a Cunt. The band stopped including the song in their live performances after Smith died.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":41},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":57},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":66},{"uri":"Sum_41","surface_form":"Sum 41","offset":82},{"uri":"All_Killer%2C_No_Filler","surface_form":"All Killer, No Filler","offset":189},{"uri":"Still_Waiting_(Sum_41_song)","surface_form":"Still Waiting","offset":244},{"uri":"The_Hell_Song","surface_form":"The Hell Song","offset":261},{"uri":"Over_My_Head_(Better_Off_Dead)","surface_form":"Over My Head (Better Off Dead)","offset":281},{"uri":"Parental_advisory","surface_form":"parental advisory","offset":353},{"uri":"Steve_Jocz","surface_form":"Steve Jocz","offset":394},{"uri":"Anna_Nicole_Smith","surface_form":"Anna Nicole","offset":546}]}
