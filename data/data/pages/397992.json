{"id":397992,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chur","text":"Chur or Coire is the capital city of the canton of Graub\u00FCnden (also called \"Grisons\"). About 34.000 people live in the city, which is probably the oldest in Switzerland. The city is on the Rhine River.\nThe name \"chur\" may come from the Celtic word \"kora\" or \"koria\", meaning \"tribe\", or from the Latin \"curia\"\nArchaeological evidence that people lived here goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900-3500 BC), Various artefacts from the Bronze Age and Iron Age have been found in the city. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur was created in the 4th century. It was probably the first Roman Catholic diocese to be created north of the Alps.\nOn 1 January 2020 the municipality Maladers became part of Chur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":21},{"uri":"Graub%C3%BCnden","surface_form":"Graub\u00FCnden","offset":51},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":119},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":189},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":296},{"uri":"Curia","surface_form":"\"curia\"","offset":302},{"uri":"Archeology","surface_form":"Archaeological","offset":310},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":325},{"uri":"Pfyn_culture","surface_form":"Pfyn culture","offset":381},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":437},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":452},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Chur","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur","offset":494},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":583},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":598},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":633},{"uri":"Maladers","surface_form":"Maladers","offset":674}]}
