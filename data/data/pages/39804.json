{"id":39804,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order","text":"e=\"preserve\">Alphabetical order is a way to sort (organize) a list. It helps a reader to find a name or a title in the list. It is done by following the standard (usual) order of letters in an alphabet. Some lists in alphabetical order were used during the early Roman Empire. It became commonplace after the Renaissance.\nSorting things in English is done using the Roman alphabet. Different languages have different rules for sorting.\nEnglish.\nIf many words have the same first letter, they are sorted by their second letters.\nAfter that, the third and fourth letters are used until the whole list is sorted.\nThe words a, an and the are ignored. Sometimes they are written at the end, after a comma. Spaces and hyphens (-) are ignored, too.\nNames are usually ordered by Family name, not given name.\nNames are often written with the last names first.\nNumbers can be sorted in two ways. Sometimes, they are listed in order from smallest to largest. This is the normal way to sort numbers.\nOther times, they can be sorted as if they were normal, spelled-out words. This way is often used for numbers in titles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sort","surface_form":"sort","offset":44},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organize","offset":50},{"uri":"List","surface_form":"list","offset":62},{"uri":"Title","surface_form":"title","offset":106},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":153},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":193},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":263},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":309},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Roman alphabet","offset":366},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":512},{"uri":"Article_(grammar)","surface_form":"a","offset":620},{"uri":"Article_(grammar)","surface_form":"an","offset":623},{"uri":"Article_(grammar)","surface_form":"the","offset":630},{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"comma","offset":694},{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"hyphens","offset":712},{"uri":"Family_name","surface_form":"Family name","offset":771},{"uri":"Given_name","surface_form":"given name","offset":788}]}
