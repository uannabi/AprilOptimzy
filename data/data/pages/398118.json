By 2002, Christie had campaigned for Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Bush appointed him as United States Attorney for New Jersey, a position he held from 2002 to 2008.

He won the Republican primary, and defeated incumbent Governor Jon Corzine in the election that November. In 2013, he won re-election as Governor, defeating Democrat Barbara Buono by a margin of over 22%. He was sworn in to a second term as governor on January 21, 2014.\nAs governor, Christie has promised not to raise taxes. He has also vowed to lower the state income and business taxes. On September 18, 2013, Christie signed legislation to overhaul the state's business tax incentive programs.\nChristie is a strong supporter of the state granting tax credits to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools.\nHe also supports the introduction of state-funded vouchers, which parents of students in failing school districts could use to pay the tuition of private schools.\nChristie has stated that he believes that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is too big and is \"killing business\" with permit delays. In January 2013 Christie vetoed a New Jersey Legislature bill that would have raised the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 per hour. Christie supports gay marriage, but said that he would not pass a bill allowing gay marriage in New Jersey.

On May 9, 2016, Trump named Christie to head up a transition team in the event of a Trump presidency. He soon emerged as a major power with the Trump campaign.
