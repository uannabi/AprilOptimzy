Otaku have a deep, complex knowledge around a particular subject or area of study, and is oftentimes (esp. in the West) used to refer to avid consumers of anime and manga. The term can be compared with Hikikomori\".\"\nIn Japan, \"otaku\" has generally regarded as an offensive word, due to the negative cultural perception of withdrawal from society. However, the otaku philosophy of living has gained traction among Japanese youth and adolescents, likely as a reaction to the established culture of intense work and academic studies. Under 30\u2019s have developed a neo-otaku identity with more positive associations of being a geek or nerd. In the West, the word usually describes an anime or manga \"fanatic\" and is not typically perceived as derogatory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":24},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":33},{"uri":"Hobby","surface_form":"hobby","offset":194},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"the West","offset":311},{"uri":"Anime","surface_form":"anime","offset":356},{"uri":"Manga","surface_form":"manga","offset":366},{"uri":"Hikikomori","surface_form":"Hikikomori","offset":403},{"uri":"Geek","surface_form":"geek","offset":822},{"uri":"Nerd","surface_form":"nerd","offset":830}]}
