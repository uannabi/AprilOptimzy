{"id":398561,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine","text":"e=\"preserve\">Quarantine is where animals, people or an area of land are isolated to prevent the spread of disease or pests. Countries often stop animals and plants from being brought in from elsewhere, unless they are known not to carry a disease.\nBackground.\nThe word \"quarantine\" comes from \"quarantena\", the Venetian language meaning \"forty days\". This is because of the 40-day isolation of ships and people practiced as a measure of disease prevention related to the plague.\nIt is different from medical isolation, which is for people who have been infected with the disease.\nThe quarantining of people often raises questions of civil rights. Quarantine can have bad psychological effects on the quarantined. These include post-traumatic stress disorder, confusion and anger.\nCOVID-19.\nSelf quarantine (or self-isolation) is a term that became popular during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, which spread to most countries in 2020. Citizens were either encouraged or forced by law to stay home to lower the spread of the disease. Some countries went into lockdowns as a form of quarantine.\n, more than 280\u00A0million people, or about 86% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, 59\u00A0million people are in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3\u00A0billion people are in lockdown in India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Isolation","surface_form":"isolated","offset":72},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":106},{"uri":"Pest_(biology)","surface_form":"pests","offset":117},{"uri":"Venetian_language","surface_form":"Venetian language","offset":311},{"uri":"Plague_(disease)","surface_form":"plague","offset":471},{"uri":"Isolation_(health_care)","surface_form":"medical isolation","offset":500},{"uri":"Civil_rights","surface_form":"civil rights","offset":633},{"uri":"Post-traumatic_stress_disorder","surface_form":"post-traumatic stress disorder","offset":727},{"uri":"2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic","surface_form":"2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic","offset":867},{"uri":"Coronavirus_disease_2019","surface_form":"disease","offset":1026},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1198},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1250},{"uri":"2020_coronavirus_lockdown_in_India","surface_form":"lockdown","offset":1294},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1306}]}
