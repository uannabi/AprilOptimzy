{"id":398574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Viyaru","text":"Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, formerly known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen, was an active tropical cyclone. It passed over the Bay of Bengal. It threatened Myanmar and Bangladesh. Its origin was a low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal. The low pressure area was created in the first week of May. Viyaru slowly developed. It became a depression on May\u00A010 by almost remaining still. Gradually it gained speed on May\u00A011 and became a cyclonic storm. It was the first storm of the season. At first the system's ultimate direction was not clear, but moved closer to eastern India. On May\u00A014, the circulation of Viyaru turned northeastward.\nMyanmar recommended a large evacuation in order to be prepared for the storm; however, for this reason people wanted to escape by boat. As a result, they made boats overcrowded, and one or more boats capsized. This killed at least eight people. The storm had extensive cloud mass, which brought unsettled weather to Sri Lanka, Thailand, and southeastern India. Severe storms in India and Sri Lanka killed 15\u00A0people and caused major damage. One person was killed in Thailand.\nThe name \"Mahasen\" caused some argument from nationalists and officials in Sri Lanka. They claimed that the name Mahasen comes from a Sinhala king. He brought prosperity to the island. So naming a destructive force of nature after him would be improper. Sri Lankan authorities instead have not given the storm a name.\nCyclone Viyaru struck Southern Bangladesh on 16 May 2013. The speed of the wind was about 100 kph.\nWeather history.\nAn area of convection first appeared on May\u00A04. It slowly moved eastwards and organized into a low pressure area on May\u00A08. A pulse in the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, together with a convective Kelvin wave allowed the system to develop. These oscillations also caused Tropical Storm Jamala to form. The JTWC later issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on May\u00A010, after the system became more organized. The IMD upgraded it to a well-marked low pressure area. Later the same day, JTWC issued the first warning for the storm. JTWC designed it 01B, followed by the IMD upgrading the storm into a depression, and later into a deep depression.\nRecent storm information.\nAs of 0830 IST (0300 UTC), 16 May 2013, Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was located near latitude 21\u00B0N and longitude 90\u00B0E, about south-southeast of Kolkata and southwest of Chittagong. The storm is forecast to maintain power. It is moving northeastwards. It is expected to cross the Bangladesh coast close to Chittagong by evening of 16 May. Sustained maximum surface wind speed is estimated at, gusting to. Estimated minimum central pressure is at 988 mbar. Dvorak intensity of the storm is at T2.5.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":79},{"uri":"Bay_of_Bengal","surface_form":"Bay of Bengal","offset":116},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":145},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":157},{"uri":"Low_pressure_area","surface_form":"low pressure area","offset":186},{"uri":"Tropical_depression","surface_form":"depression","offset":323},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalists","offset":1144},{"uri":"Sinhalese","surface_form":"Sinhala","offset":1233},{"uri":"Madden%E2%80%93Julian_oscillation","surface_form":"Madden\u2013Julian oscillation","offset":1670},{"uri":"Kelvin_wave","surface_form":"convective Kelvin wave","offset":1713},{"uri":"Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert","surface_form":"Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert","offset":1853},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":2286},{"uri":"Longitude","surface_form":"longitude","offset":2304},{"uri":"Kolkata","surface_form":"Kolkata","offset":2345},{"uri":"Chittagong","surface_form":"Chittagong","offset":2370},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":2480},{"uri":"Dvorak_technique","surface_form":"Dvorak intensity","offset":2656}]}
