{"id":39902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glans_penis","text":"The glans penis (or just \"glans\") is the sensitive tip of the penis. It is also called the \"head\" of the penis. Slang names include \"helmet\" and \"bell end\". Usually, the glans is covered by the foreskin, except in men who have been circumcised.\nDiseases.\nThe glans can become irritated or infected which occurs in a small number of males. It is more common in males who have poor hygene or are uncircumcised.\nThe opening of the urethra is at the tip of the glans. In children who have been circumcised and wear diapers, the opening of the penis has no protection. This can cause the urethra to get very narrow in a small amount of boys which can need surgery to reopen later.\nThe skin on the glans penis is very sensitive, and washing it too much with soap can cause dermatitis.\nAnatomy.\nThe glans penis is a cap around the corpus spongiosum. It is attached to the Corpus cavernosum penis and at the tip of the glans is the urethra opening. The foreskin helps keeps the glans moist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"sensitive","offset":41},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":62},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"Slang","offset":112},{"uri":"Foreskin","surface_form":"foreskin","offset":194},{"uri":"Circumcision","surface_form":"circumcised","offset":232},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infected","offset":289},{"uri":"Urethra","surface_form":"urethra","offset":428},{"uri":"Diaper","surface_form":"diaper","offset":511},{"uri":"Narrow","surface_form":"narrow","offset":603},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":651},{"uri":"Dermatitis","surface_form":"dermatitis","offset":767},{"uri":"Corpus_spongiosum","surface_form":"corpus spongiosum","offset":824},{"uri":"Corpus_cavernosum_penis","surface_form":"Corpus cavernosum penis","offset":865}]}
