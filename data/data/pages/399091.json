{"id":399091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz_(music)","text":"Waltz music is written in 3/4 time (three beats per bar). The music is both dance music and art music. The Strauss family were perhaps the most famous of all waltz composers: notably Johann Strauss I, and Johann Strauss II the composer of the famous \"The Blue Danube\".\nWaltzes typically have one chord per measure, and the accompaniment style particularly associated with the waltz is (as seen in the example to the right) to play the root of the chord on the first beat, the upper notes on the second and third beats.\nThe origins of the dance are in late 18th century Germany, probably from a folk dance called the \"Lander\". Today the music is danced in two forms, the Viennese waltz and the English or Slow waltz (now often called the International waltz). The choreography of these modern forms is different from the original dance. There are also a number of ballets which feature waltz music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Johann_Strauss_I","surface_form":"Johann Strauss I","offset":183},{"uri":"Johann_Strauss_II","surface_form":"Johann Strauss II","offset":205},{"uri":"Chord_(music)","surface_form":"chord","offset":296},{"uri":"Bar_(music)","surface_form":"measure","offset":306},{"uri":"Root_(chord)","surface_form":"root","offset":435},{"uri":"Viennese_waltz","surface_form":"Viennese waltz","offset":670},{"uri":"International_waltz","surface_form":"International waltz","offset":737},{"uri":"Choreography","surface_form":"choreography","offset":763},{"uri":"Ballets","surface_form":"ballets","offset":863}]}
