{"id":399168,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Cooke","text":"Francis Cooke (ca. 1583 - April 7, 1663) was a passenger on the \"Mayflower\". He was a signer of the Mayflower Compact and was an important member of Plymouth Colony.\nFrancis Cooke lived in England and then in Leiden Netherlands.\nCooke married Hester Mahieu at the French Walloon Church in Leiden. In August 1606 Francis Cooke and his wife moved to Norwich in county Norfolk in England. They did not live there long and returned to Netherlands. Their son John was baptized at the Walloon Church in Leiden in 1607.\nOn the \"Mayflower\".\nWhen the English Separatist Church members in Leiden decided to go to America in 1620, Cooke decided he would go with them. He brought his thirteen year\u2013old son, John, with him. Cooke's wife and the younger children stayed in Leiden and came to Plymouth Colony on the ship \"Anne\" in July 1623.\nThe Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 6 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Cooke was one of the signers. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.\nIn Plymouth Colony.\nIn Plymouth Colony, the settlers were given land. In that Division of Land in 1623, Cooke received two acres, one for himself and one acre for his son John. He also received 4 acres for his wife and children who came over on the ship called \"Anne\" in 1623.\nCooke's children were named John, Jacob, Jane, Hester and Mary.\nCooke seemed to have been trusted and liked by the other colonist because in early 1633, Cooke was assigned by the court to help resolve a dispute of a financial nature between Peter Browne and Dr. Samuel Fuller.\nIn 1640/41 Cooke was one of twelve men tasked by the court to make official travel routes, and make a formal survey and mark the boundaries of plots of land and for the Jones River. In 1645 he was again road surveyor for Plymouth. In June 1650, when he was almost seventy, he was still doing survey work. In August 1659, in his late 70s, he was again called upon by the Plymouth Court to help to decide a land boundary dispute between Thomas Pope and William Shurtliff.\nCooke also did other public service work, being on several petty and grand juries. He also served on civil case juries up to March 1643. Most of the civil case involved debts or slander. He was also on grand juries in 1638, 1640, 1642 and 1643 which involved more serious crimes.\nIn the 1643 Able to Bear Arms List, Francis Cooke and his sons Jacob and John Jr., are listed with those from Plymouth.\nOn December 7, 1659 Francis Cooke made out his will, saying he was weak in body. The will was very simple and he gave everything to Hester, his loving wife. 1609.\nFrancis Cooke died in Plymouth on April 7, 1663 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mayflower","surface_form":"Mayflower","offset":65},{"uri":"Mayflower_Compact","surface_form":"Mayflower Compact","offset":100},{"uri":"Plymouth_Colony","surface_form":"Plymouth Colony","offset":149},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":189},{"uri":"Leiden","surface_form":"Leiden","offset":209},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":216},{"uri":"Norwich","surface_form":"Norwich","offset":348},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":377},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptized","offset":463},{"uri":"Separatist_(religion)","surface_form":"Separatist","offset":550},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"Church","offset":561},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"America","offset":603},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":801},{"uri":"Plymouth%2C_Devon","surface_form":"Plymouth","offset":846},{"uri":"Cape_Cod","surface_form":"Cape Cod","offset":980},{"uri":"Mayflower_Compact","surface_form":"Mayflower Compact","offset":1038},{"uri":"Virginia_Colony","surface_form":"Virginia Colony","offset":1189},{"uri":"Harbor","surface_form":"Harbor","offset":1300},{"uri":"Acre","surface_form":"acre","offset":1431},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":1764},{"uri":"Peter_Browne","surface_form":"Peter Browne","offset":1826},{"uri":"List_of_Mayflower_passengers","surface_form":"Dr. Samuel Fuller","offset":1843},{"uri":"Surveyor","surface_form":"survey","offset":1971},{"uri":"Boundary","surface_form":"boundary","offset":2272},{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"dispute","offset":2281},{"uri":"Jury","surface_form":"juries","offset":2407},{"uri":"Debt","surface_form":"debt","offset":2501},{"uri":"Slander","surface_form":"slander","offset":2510},{"uri":"Will_(law)","surface_form":"will","offset":2779},{"uri":"Burial_Hill","surface_form":"Burial Hill","offset":2961},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":2986}]}
