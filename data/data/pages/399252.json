{"id":399252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton","text":"Harry Dean Stanton (July 14, 1926 \u2013 September 15, 2017) was an American actor, musician, and singer. He was known for his roles in \"Paris, Texas\", \"Kelly's Heroes\", \"Dillinger\", \"Straight Time\", \"Alien\", \"Repo Man\", \"Pretty in Pink\", \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", \"Wild at Heart\", \"The Green Mile\", \"The Pledge\", \"Rango\" and \"Lucky\".\nStanton was a favorite of the late movie critic Roger Ebert who has said that \"no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad.\" However, Ebert later admitted that \"Dream a Little Dream\" (1989), in which Stanton appeared, was a \"clear violation\" of this rule.\nFor his role in \"Lucky\", Stanton was posthumously awarded the Satellite Award in 2018 alongside Gary Oldman.\nStanton was born on July 14, 1926 in West Irvine, Kentucky. He studied at the University of Kentucky.\nStanton died on the afternoon of September 15, 2017 at a hospital in Los Angeles, California of respiratory failure at the age of 91.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Paris%2C_Texas_(movie)","surface_form":"Paris, Texas","offset":132},{"uri":"Kelly%27s_Heroes","surface_form":"Kelly's Heroes","offset":148},{"uri":"Dillinger_(movie)","surface_form":"Dillinger","offset":166},{"uri":"Straight_Time","surface_form":"Straight Time","offset":179},{"uri":"Alien_(movie)","surface_form":"Alien","offset":196},{"uri":"Repo_Man","surface_form":"Repo Man","offset":205},{"uri":"Pretty_in_Pink","surface_form":"Pretty in Pink","offset":217},{"uri":"The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ","surface_form":"The Last Temptation of Christ","offset":235},{"uri":"Wild_at_Heart","surface_form":"Wild at Heart","offset":268},{"uri":"The_Green_Mile_(movie)","surface_form":"The Green Mile","offset":285},{"uri":"The_Pledge","surface_form":"The Pledge","offset":303},{"uri":"Rango_(2011_movie)","surface_form":"Rango","offset":317},{"uri":"Lucky_(2017_movie)","surface_form":"Lucky","offset":329},{"uri":"Roger_Ebert","surface_form":"Roger Ebert","offset":385},{"uri":"M._Emmet_Walsh","surface_form":"M.
