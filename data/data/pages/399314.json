This event happened at 6:10 PM (EST). An east-bound Metro-North train went off its tracks and collided with a west-bound train near Fairfield, Connecticut.\nOn May 17, 2013, officials shut down the train which usually carries between 125,000 people daily. It is one of the most busiest trains in the area. Metro-North was also shut down. All Amtrak trains that uses the New York City-New Haven path are shut down. This is to avoid further collisions. Because of a bridge replacement, the two trains were the only way going and coming from New York City.\nInvestigators believe the trains collided because the tracks were damaged. Some say the damage was done when the trains collided. Others believe it was damaged before the two trains collided with each other. The wreckage of the trains were found to be as far as 200 yards away from the area the accident happened. Many cars that were near the event were heavily damaged. Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy, believes this investigation will last several days. The FBI were part of the investigations.

Nine people are currently in the hospital, with 70 injured. Some reports state 60 people were injured. Many people saw broken limbs after this happened.\nMany people on the train had to break one of the trains windows to get out. There are no reported deaths. Many bodies flew out of the two trains.\nAbout the event.\nThe Metro-North train left from Grand Central Station in New York City at 4:41 p.m (EST) on May 17, 2013.
