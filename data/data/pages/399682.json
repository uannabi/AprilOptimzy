{"id":399682,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_violin","text":"An electric violin is a string instrument which is played with a bow, like a normal violin. The strings are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E, but it could have its pitches changed as it is electric. It is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers. Players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand and memorise them. Luthiers tend to fix electric violins as well.\nThe modern electric violin is about 10 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1,000 years. It became the most enjoyable electric instrument played along with the electric bass. It is used as a solo instrument, in rock and sometimes blues. It is also used in folk music.\nAn electric violin is normally not in the shape of a normal violin, but in wacky shapes and colours.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"String_instrument","surface_form":"string instrument","offset":24},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":84},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":258},{"uri":"Chin","surface_form":"chin","offset":276},{"uri":"Fret","surface_form":"fret","offset":378},{"uri":"Luthier","surface_form":"Luthier","offset":495},{"uri":"Bass_(instrument)","surface_form":"bass","offset":740},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":782},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":801},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":827}]}
