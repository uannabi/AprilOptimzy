{"id":399908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)","text":"The third generation of video game consoles began on July 15, 1983. The third generation began with the release of the Nintendo Family Computer, or better known as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Sega SG-1000. This generation helped end the North American video crash of 1983. This resulted in a shift from the United States to Japan as the leading country for home video games. In the third generation the displays changed from single-screen (or flip-screen) graphics to scrolling graphics.\nThe best-selling console of this generation was the NES/Famicom. This was followed by the Sega Master System and the Atari 7800. The NES/Famicom system remained the best-selling home console until the PlayStation in 1996. Some of the consoles in the third generation used 8-bit processors. However, systems like the Genesis used 16-bit processors. The NES/Famicom system was the most popular video game console in the United States.\nHandheld systems.\nNintendo's Game & Watch was very popular in the third generation. It continued to do so until 1991, when it was discontinued.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game console","offset":24},{"uri":"Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"Nintendo Entertainment System","offset":168},{"uri":"SG-1000","surface_form":"Sega SG-1000","offset":208},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":253},{"uri":"Video_crash_of_1983","surface_form":"video crash of 1983","offset":268},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":323},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":340},{"uri":"Flip-screen","surface_form":"flip-screen","offset":459},{"uri":"Graphics","surface_form":"graphics","offset":472},{"uri":"Scrolling","surface_form":"scrolling","offset":484},{"uri":"Sega_Master_System","surface_form":"Sega Master System","offset":594},{"uri":"Atari_7800","surface_form":"Atari 7800","offset":621},{"uri":"PlayStation","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":705},{"uri":"8-bit","surface_form":"8-bit","offset":776},{"uri":"Processors","surface_form":"processors","offset":782},{"uri":"Sega_Mega_Drive","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":820},{"uri":"16-bit","surface_form":"16-bit","offset":833},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":922},{"uri":"Game_%26amp%3B_Watch","surface_form":"Game & Watch","offset":966}]}
