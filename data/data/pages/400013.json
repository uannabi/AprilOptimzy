{"id":400013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen","text":"=\"preserve\">Fibrinogen is the clotting element present in blood. When blood comes out of a wound in a vessel, the fibrinogen is activated and forms fibrin, which clots the blood. Although this is fibrinogen's main job, it also forms bridges between platelets. Fibrinogen is a protein made by the liver. It is a dimer (made up of two similar units). Each unit has an alpha, beta, and gamma chain. The alpha and beta chains have a small peptide called fibrinopeptide.\nWhen fibrinogen is activated to form fibrin, an enzyme called thrombin cleaves the fibrinopeptides off of the alpha and beta chains.\nIt is possible to examine a small sample of a person's blood to find out how much fibrinogen is in the blood. This helps medical professionals to know if too much or too little fibrinogen is the cause of a patient's medical problems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":58},{"uri":"Fibrin","surface_form":"fibrin","offset":148},{"uri":"Platelets","surface_form":"platelets","offset":249},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":276},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":296},{"uri":"Dimer","surface_form":"dimer","offset":311},{"uri":"Peptide","surface_form":"peptide","offset":435},{"uri":"Thrombin","surface_form":"thrombin","offset":528},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":654}]}
