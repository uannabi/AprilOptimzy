He was in the military in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth army from 1630 until the late 1640's. He was forced to move to the Ukraine. He was in the military under Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski for one year in 1637. While in the military he helped rebuild the Kodak Fortress. He also built other fortresses in Bar, Ukraine. He also helped build Brody Castle and other buildings in Kremenchuk, Ukraine.\nHe created the first well described map of the Ukraine in 1639. In 1648 he made another map of the Ukraine that was very detailed. He moved to Danzig. He made two other very detailed maps and they were engraved by Willem Hondius. He wrote a book called \"Description d'Ukranie\". It was originally named \"Description des contr\u00E9s du Royaume de Pologne\", when it was first published in 1651. It was published two more times, until 1861. It was the first book to write about the Ukraine in great detail. It's still in print today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cartographer","surface_form":"cartographer","offset":83},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":97},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":110},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":125},{"uri":"Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth","surface_form":"Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth","offset":163},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":261},{"uri":"Stanis%C5%82aw_Koniecpolski","surface_form":"Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski","offset":299},{"uri":"Kodak_Fortress","surface_form":"Kodak Fortress","offset":388},{"uri":"Bar%2C_Ukraine","surface_form":"Bar, Ukraine","offset":438},{"uri":"Brody_Castle","surface_form":"Brody Castle","offset":473},{"uri":"Kremenchuk","surface_form":"Kremenchuk","offset":509},{"uri":"Danzig","surface_form":"Danzig","offset":673},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"engraved","offset":732},{"uri":"Willem_Hondius","surface_form":"Willem Hondius","offset":744}]}
