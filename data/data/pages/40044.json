{"id":40044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soxhlet_extractor","text":"A Soxhlet extractor is a kind of laboratory equipment. It is made of glass. Franz von Soxhlet invented it in 1879. It has a flask, an extraction chamber, and a condenser. It can be used for solid-liquid extractions.\nIn this discontinuous extraction process, the extraction solvent inside the boiling flask is evaporated and re-condensed in the distillation column above. It then falls down onto the solid material requiring extraction. The chamber containing the solid material is connected to the boiling flask below by a syphoning mechanism seen in the Pythagorean cup, which allows the chamber to fill to a point, at which it will empty its contents and start to fill again and the extracted compounds will accumulate in the boiling flask below.\nUses.\nChemists use it to remove a material from a solid. It is useful when removing materials that do not dissolve well in any solvent. Chemists use a solvent such as ether or alcohol in the extractor. The Soxhlet extractor applies the solvent repeatedly to the solid until enough of the material dissolves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Laboratory_equipment","surface_form":"laboratory equipment","offset":33},{"uri":"Franz_von_Soxhlet","surface_form":"Franz von Soxhlet","offset":76},{"uri":"1879","surface_form":"1879","offset":109},{"uri":"Flask","surface_form":"flask","offset":124},{"uri":"Extraction_chamber","surface_form":"extraction chamber","offset":134},{"uri":"Condenser","surface_form":"condenser","offset":160},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":900},{"uri":"Ether","surface_form":"ether","offset":916},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":925}]}
