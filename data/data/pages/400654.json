{"id":400654,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensete","text":"\"Ensete\" is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is one of the three genera in the banana family, Musaceae, and includes the false banana or enset (\"E. ventricosum\"), an economically important foodcrop in Ethiopia.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus \"Ensete\" was first described by Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (1796-1865) in his \"Prodromus Monographiae Scitaminarum\" of 1862 in which he created a single species, \"Ensete edule\". However, the genus did not receive general recognition until 1947 when it was revived by E. E. Cheesman in the first of a series of papers in the \"Kew Bulletin\" on the classification of the bananas, with a total of 25 species.\nTaxonomically, the genus \"Ensete\" has been reduced since Cheesman restore the taxon. Cheesman acknowledged that field study might reveal synonymy and the most recent review of the genus by Simmonds (1960) listed just six. [http://www.theplantlist.org The Plant List] accepts eight species as valid.\nDescription.\nThe plants of \"Ensete\" are very large herbs without branches that die after producing seeds; They have only one stem that remains short until flowering.\nThey have very big leaves; the lower parts of the leaves form a false stem so they look as trees. Their fruits are leathery and dry berries with few big and hard seeds.\nSpecies.\nIt is possible to separate \"Ensete\" into its African and Asian species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":14},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":23},{"uri":"Native_plant","surface_form":"native","offset":40},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":70},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":81},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":124},{"uri":"Musaceae","surface_form":"Musaceae","offset":139},{"uri":"Ensete_ventricosum","surface_form":"E. ventricosum","offset":190},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":246},{"uri":"Paul_Fedorowitsch_Horaninow","surface_form":"Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow","offset":308},{"uri":"Ernest_Entwistle_Cheesman","surface_form":"E.
