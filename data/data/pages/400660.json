The city of Fremantle in Fremantle was the son of Admiral Thomas Fremantle, a friend of Nelson. His mother was Elizabeth, the diarist. He was a nephew of William Henry Fremantle. His elder brother was Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe. His middle name, Howe, is because his birth date was the anniversary of Lord Howe's victory over the French on the Glorious First of June in 1794. He joined the Royal Navy in 1812.\nFremantle was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl in April 1826. To avoid a scandal, his family paid off witnesses and put pressure on the judge. In August 1826 he was promoted to captain. In 1828 he was given command of the 26-gun frigate HMS \"Challenger\", and sent to claim the west coast of Australia for the United Kingdom.\nCareer.\nHMS \"Challenger\" left the Cape of Good Hope on 20 March 1829. It arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 May, and Fremantle went ashore at Garden Island. One week later, Fremantle raised the British flag at the mouth of the Swan River and claimed Western Australia for King George IV.\nThe new lieutenant governor James Stirling arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 June on the \"Parmelia\", bring 69 new settlers. They planned to start a colony at the Swan River in Western Australia. On 8 June they were joined by 56 officers and men from the HMS \"Sulphur\". On 17 June, Stirling read out loud a legal document which supported Fremantle's earlier proclamation. This was the beginning of the history of Western Australia as a British colony, and later as a state of federal Australia.\nFremantle left the Swan River Colony on 25 August 1829, for the British Army base of Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) where he was based the next couple of years.\nWhile he was there he visited many places including Kowloon. He told the British government that this would be a good site for a British settlement. They agreed and Hong Kong was settled in 1841.\nOn his way back to England in September 1832, he made his second and final visit to the Swan River Colony.\nIn 1833 he stopped at Pitcairn Island, where he attempted to make peace in the leadership dispute between Joshua Hill and George Hunn Nobbs.\nIn 1843 he was given command of HMS \"Inconstant\" in the Mediterranean Fleet and in 1847 he took command of HMS \"Albion\". In 1853 he became Captain of HMS \"Juno\" on the Australia Station.\nIn 1855 he served as Rear-Admiral controlling the naval transport service for the Crimean War from Balaklava (a city in the Ukraine).\nIn July 1858 he was given command of the Channel Squadron and in 1863 he became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.\nLater life.\nHe died in 1869 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Admiral_(Royal_Navy)","surface_form":"Admiral","offset":0},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Bath","surface_form":"GCB","offset":35},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"RN","offset":39},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":76},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":84},{"uri":"Fremantle%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Fremantle","offset":116},{"uri":"Thomas_Fremantle_(Royal_Navy_officer)","surface_form":"Admiral Thomas Fremantle","offset":154},{"uri":"Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson","surface_form":"Nelson","offset":192},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Wynne_Fremantle","surface_form":"Elizabeth","offset":215},{"uri":"William_Henry_Fremantle","surface_form":"William Henry Fremantle","offset":258},{"uri":"Thomas_Fremantle%2C_1st_Baron_Cottesloe","surface_form":"Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe","offset":305},{"uri":"Richard_Howe%2C_1st_Earl_Howe","surface_form":"Lord Howe","offset":416},{"uri":"Glorious_First_of_June","surface_form":"Glorious First of June","offset":459},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":505},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"raping","offset":552},{"uri":"HMS_Challenger_(1826)","surface_form":"HMS \"Challenger\"","offset":768},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":840},{"uri":"Cape_of_Good_Hope","surface_form":"Cape of Good Hope","offset":890},{"uri":"Cockburn_Sound","surface_form":"Cockburn Sound","offset":940},{"uri":"Garden_Island%2C_Western_Australia","surface_form":"Garden Island","offset":994},{"uri":"Swan_River_(Western_Australia)","surface_form":"Swan River","offset":1079},{"uri":"George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George IV","offset":1129},{"uri":"James_Stirling_(Australian_governor)","surface_form":"James Stirling","offset":1168},{"uri":"Parmelia_(barque)","surface_form":"Parmelia","offset":1227},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":1313},{"uri":"HMS_Sulphur_(1826)","surface_form":"HMS \"Sulphur\"","offset":1391},{"uri":"Swan_River_Colony","surface_form":"Swan River Colony","offset":1650},{"uri":"Trincomalee","surface_form":"Trincomalee","offset":1716},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":1741},{"uri":"Kowloon","surface_form":"Kowloon","offset":1849},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":1962},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":2012},{"uri":"Pitcairn_Island","surface_form":"Pitcairn Island","offset":2122},{"uri":"Joshua_Hill_(Pitcairn_Island_leader)","surface_form":"Joshua Hill","offset":2206},{"uri":"George_Hunn_Nobbs","surface_form":"George Hunn Nobbs","offset":2222},{"uri":"HMS_Inconstant_(1836)","surface_form":"HMS \"Inconstant\"","offset":2273},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Fleet","surface_form":"Mediterranean Fleet","offset":2297},{"uri":"HMS_Albion_(1842)","surface_form":"HMS \"Albion\"","offset":2348},{"uri":"HMS_Juno_(1844)","surface_form":"HMS \"Juno\"","offset":2391},{"uri":"Australia_Station","surface_form":"Australia Station","offset":2409},{"uri":"Crimean_War","surface_form":"Crimean War","offset":2510},{"uri":"Balaklava","surface_form":"Balaklava","offset":2527},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":2552},{"uri":"Channel_Fleet","surface_form":"Channel Squadron","offset":2603},{"uri":"Commander-in-Chief%2C_Plymouth","surface_form":"Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth","offset":2642},{"uri":"Brompton_Cemetery","surface_form":"Brompton Cemetery","offset":2717}]}
