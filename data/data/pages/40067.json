{"id":40067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenulum","text":"A frenulum (or frenum) is a small fold of tissue that prevents an organ in the body from moving too far.\n\"Frenulum\" as a term in zoology is dealt with under wing coupling.\nHuman anatomy.\nThere are several frenula in the body, including several in the mouth, some in the digestive tract, and some connected to the external genitalia.\nOral tissue.\nFrenula of the mouth are found under the tongue and inside the upper and lower lip. These can easily be torn by blows to the face or mouth. A torn frenulum is sometimes a warning sign of physical abuse.\nVulvular tissue.\nIn the female, genital frenula can be found in the clitoris and where the labia minora meet at the back.\nPenile tissue.\nThe word frenulum on its own is often used for the \"frenulum preputii penis\". This is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the prepuce, or foreskin to the vernal mucosa. It help contract the prepuce over the glans. It may be removed during circumcision.\nIt is possible for the frenulum of the penis to tear during sexual activity. This does not cause a great deal of pain but can cause an alarming amount of blood loss. This is not a medical emergency. The frenulum will heal by itself after the bleeding has stopped.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organ","offset":66},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":79},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoology","offset":129},{"uri":"Wing_coupling","surface_form":"wing coupling","offset":157},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":251},{"uri":"Digestive_tract","surface_form":"digestive tract","offset":270},{"uri":"Sex_organ","surface_form":"external genitalia","offset":313},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":361},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":387},{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"physical","offset":533},{"uri":"Abuse","surface_form":"abuse","offset":542},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoris","offset":617},{"uri":"Labia_minora","surface_form":"labia minora","offset":640},{"uri":"Glans_penis","surface_form":"glans penis","offset":808},{"uri":"Prepuce","surface_form":"prepuce","offset":841},{"uri":"Foreskin","surface_form":"foreskin","offset":853},{"uri":"Vernal_mucosa","surface_form":"vernal mucosa","offset":869},{"uri":"Circumcision","surface_form":"circumcision","offset":954}]}
