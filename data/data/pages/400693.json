{"id":400693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoarchaean","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Mesoarchaean (Mesoarchean) is the third geological era in the Archaean eon. It began 3.2 billion years ago, and ended 2.8 billion years ago. Before the Mesoarchaean era was the Palaeoarchaean era. After the Mesoarchaean era was the Neoarchaean.\nFossils from Australia show that stromatolites have lived on Earth since the Mesoarchaean. The Pongola glaciation occurred 2.9 billion years ago. The first supercontinent Vaalbara broke up during this time, around 3.2 billion years ago. The second supercontinent Ur existed during this era, 3.1 billion years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":57},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":68},{"uri":"Archaean","surface_form":"Archaean","offset":79},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":106},{"uri":"Palaeoarchaean","surface_form":"Palaeoarchaean","offset":194},{"uri":"Neoarchaean","surface_form":"Neoarchaean","offset":249},{"uri":"Stromatolite","surface_form":"stromatolite","offset":295},{"uri":"Pongola_glaciation","surface_form":"Pongola glaciation","offset":357},{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":418},{"uri":"Vaalbara","surface_form":"Vaalbara","offset":433},{"uri":"Ur_(supercontinent)","surface_form":"Ur","offset":525}]}
