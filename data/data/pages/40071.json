{"id":40071,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbourethral_gland","text":"A bulbourethral gland (or Cowper's gland) is one of two small glands found in the reproductive system of human males. They are like Bartholin's glands.\nAnatomy.\nBulbourethral glands are found near the urethra at the base of the penis, between the two layers of the fascia. The bulbourethral glands are about the size of a pea. They appear to slowly get smaller as a person gets older.\nThey are made of several lobules held together by a fibres.\nUses.\nDuring sexual arousal each gland makes a clear liquid known as pre-ejaculate or \"pre-cum\". This fluid helps to lubricate the urethra for sperm to pass through. It also helps clean out any urine or dirt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":62},{"uri":"Reproductive_system","surface_form":"reproductive system","offset":82},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":105},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":111},{"uri":"Bartholin%27s_gland","surface_form":"Bartholin's gland","offset":132},{"uri":"Urethra","surface_form":"urethra","offset":201},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":228},{"uri":"Fascia","surface_form":"fascia","offset":265},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":322},{"uri":"Lobe","surface_form":"lobules","offset":410},{"uri":"Sexual","surface_form":"sexual","offset":458},{"uri":"Pre-ejaculate","surface_form":"pre-ejaculate","offset":514},{"uri":"Lubricate","surface_form":"lubricate","offset":562},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":588}]}
