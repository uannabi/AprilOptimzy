{"id":400834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw_biker_movie","text":"=\"preserve\">Outlaw biker movie is a movie genre. Such movies are about motorcycle riding rebels. The characters are typically members of an outlaw motorcycle club. The first such movie was \"The Wild One\" (1954). Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin starred in this movie as rival biker gang leaders. Harvey Lembeck parodied Brando in the AIP \"beach party\" movies of the early 1960s starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon.\nBiker movies were aimed at teenage audiences and the drive-in crowd. The genre took off in the 1960s when the real world Hells Angels received much media attention. Hollywood cranked out dozens of low-budget exploitation outlaw biker movies during this decade. Novelty movies of the genre featured all-female gangs, horror and zombie crossovers, and one featured a gay gang. The biker outlaw genre played itself out in the 1970s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":71},{"uri":"Outlaw_motorcycle_club","surface_form":"outlaw motorcycle club","offset":140},{"uri":"The_Wild_One","surface_form":"The Wild One","offset":190},{"uri":"Marlon_Brando","surface_form":"Marlon Brando","offset":212},{"uri":"Lee_Marvin","surface_form":"Lee Marvin","offset":230},{"uri":"AIP","surface_form":"AIP","offset":330},{"uri":"Beach_movie","surface_form":"\"beach party\" movies","offset":334},{"uri":"Annette_Funicello","surface_form":"Annette Funicello","offset":383},{"uri":"Frankie_Avalon","surface_form":"Frankie Avalon","offset":405},{"uri":"Hells_Angels","surface_form":"Hells Angels","offset":542},{"uri":"Zombie","surface_form":"zombie","offset":748}]}
