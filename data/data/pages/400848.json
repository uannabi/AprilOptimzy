It stars Ed Wood as Glen and Glenda, and features Bela Lugosi and Wood's then-girlfriend Dolores Fuller.\nThe movie was inspired by the Christine Jorgensen's sex reassignment surgery in 1952. George Weiss was a Hollywood producer of low-budget films. He wanted a movie made to exploit the event. He made Jorgensen several offers to appear in the movie. These offers were turned down.\nThis was the only movie Wood directed but did not also produce. Wood himself played the title character, but under the pseudonym \"Daniel Davis\". Lugosi is credited as \"The Scientist\". He acts as a sort of narrator but gives no narration relevant to the plot.\nStory.\nGlen is shown looking at women's clothes in a shop window. He reads about sex change operations in a newspaper. He meets with Barbara, his girlfriend. She asks if Glen's secret problem is another woman. A transvestite friend tells Glen how crossdressing ended his marriage. A dream sequence containing some BDSM scenes full of flagellation and bondage follows. Glen tells Barbara the truth. She offers Glen an Angora wool sweater as a sign of acceptance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crossdressing","surface_form":"transvestite","offset":46},{"uri":"Ed_Wood","surface_form":"Ed Wood","offset":91},{"uri":"Bela_Lugosi","surface_form":"Bela Lugosi","offset":150},{"uri":"Christine_Jorgensen","surface_form":"Christine Jorgensen","offset":235},{"uri":"Sex_reassignment_surgery","surface_form":"sex reassignment surgery","offset":257},{"uri":"George_Weiss","surface_form":"George Weiss","offset":291},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":310},{"uri":"Pseudonym","surface_form":"pseudonym","offset":602},{"uri":"Crossdressing","surface_form":"crossdressing","offset":989},{"uri":"BDSM","surface_form":"BDSM","offset":1056},{"uri":"Flagellation","surface_form":"flagellation","offset":1076},{"uri":"Bondage","surface_form":"bondage","offset":1093}]}
