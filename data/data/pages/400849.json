The mountain is surrounded by the towns of Wallibou and Chateaubelair to the southwest, Fancy to the north, Orange Hill and Georgetown to the southeast and the Richmond Peak and Mount Brisbane to the south.\nSoufri\u00E8re is an active composite volcano (or stratovolcano) with a lake in the crater and is the island's youngest and northernmost volcano. It has a main crater of 1.6 km in diameter, with the northeast edge cut by another smaller crater in 1812.\nHistory.\nThe first historical eruption of the volcano took place during 1718; it and the 1812 eruption produced major explosions. Much of the northern end of the island was devastated by a major eruption in 1902 that killed 1,680 people; this eruption was just hours before the eruption of Mount Pel\u00E9e on Martinique.\nThe last recorded eruption was in April 1979; due to advance warning there were no casualties.\nSeveral volcanoes in the Caribbean are named Soufri\u00E8re (French: \"sulphur mine\"). Two of them are Soufri\u00E8re Hills on Montserrat and La Grande Soufri\u00E8re on Guadeloupe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["mountain"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":70},{"uri":"Saint_Vincent_(island)","surface_form":"Saint Vincent","offset":95},{"uri":"Windward_Islands","surface_form":"Windward Islands","offset":116},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":140},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":266},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":273},{"uri":"Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines","surface_form":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","offset":284},{"uri":"Parish","surface_form":"parish","offset":409},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"composite","offset":649},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":659},{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":671},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":693},{"uri":"Volcanic_crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":705},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":801},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruption","offset":904},{"uri":"Mount_Pel%C3%A9e","surface_form":"Mount Pel\u00E9e","offset":1164},{"uri":"Martinique","surface_form":"Martinique","offset":1179},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":1311},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1342},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulphur","offset":1351},{"uri":"Soufri%C3%A8re_Hills","surface_form":"Soufri\u00E8re Hills","offset":1383},{"uri":"Montserrat","surface_form":"Montserrat","offset":1402},{"uri":"La_Grande_Soufri%C3%A8re","surface_form":"La Grande Soufri\u00E8re","offset":1417},{"uri":"Guadeloupe","surface_form":"Guadeloupe","offset":1440}]}
