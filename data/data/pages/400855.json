The gang dresses in men's clothes, robs gas stations, and terrorizes couples in a local lovers' lane. Paula even rapes a young man.\nPaula and her pals wreck a few classrooms in a public school. The police arrive and a deadly shootout takes place. Two members of Paula's gang are killed. Paula shoots and kills a policeman.\nPaula is captured, convicted, and dies in the hospital giving birth to the child she conceived during the rape.

This is one of them. It makes you want to go back in time and beat Ed Wood Jr. to death with one of his own angora sweaters.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Exploitation_movie","surface_form":"exploitation movie","offset":39},{"uri":"Jean_Moorhead","surface_form":"Jean Moorhead","offset":67},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":143},{"uri":"Ed_Wood","surface_form":"Ed Wood, Jr.","offset":162},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"director","offset":180},{"uri":"Glen_or_Glenda","surface_form":"Glen or Glenda","offset":193},{"uri":"Plan_9_from_Outer_Space","surface_form":"Plan 9 from Outer Space","offset":214},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"screenplay","offset":250},{"uri":"Playboy","surface_form":"Playboy","offset":335}]}
