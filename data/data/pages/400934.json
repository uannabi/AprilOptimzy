It is the only state theatre to have its own company of actors. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. The theatre is part of the Palais-Royal complex at 2 rue de Richelieu on the Place Andr\u00E9-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.\nThe theatre has also been known as the \"Th\u00E9\u00E2tre de la R\u00E9publique\" and \"La maison de Moli\u00E8re\" (English: House of Moli\u00E8re). It inherited the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Com\u00E9die-Fran\u00E7aise, Moli\u00E8re. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before \u201CLa maison de Moli\u00E8re\u201D was rechristened the \u201CCom\u00E9die-Fran\u00E7aise,\u201D and the company continued to be known popularly by the former name long after the official change of name.\nThe Com\u00E9die-Fran\u00E7aise today has a repertoire of 3,000 works and three theatre locations in Paris (salle Richelieu; th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Vieux-Colombier; Studio-Th\u00E9\u00E2tre)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"state","offset":60},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":66},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":78},{"uri":"Actors","surface_form":"actors","offset":142},{"uri":"Palais-Royal","surface_form":"Palais-Royal","offset":229},{"uri":"Rue_de_Richelieu","surface_form":"rue de Richelieu","offset":255},{"uri":"1st_arrondissement","surface_form":"1st arrondissement","offset":306},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":328},{"uri":"Moli%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Moli\u00E8re","offset":570},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_du_Vieux-Colombier","surface_form":"th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Vieux-Colombier","offset":940}]}
