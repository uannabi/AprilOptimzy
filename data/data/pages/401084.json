{"id":401084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_monofluoroacetate","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sodium fluoroacetate is a chemical compound that is a poison for many organisms. Pesticides used kill rodents sometimes contain Sodium monofluoroacetate. Sometimes the chemical substance is used as a marker for cancer cells in Positron emission tomography. TO act as a marker, only very small quantities of a substance are needed. For this reason, the toxicity of Sodium fluoroacetate is not a problem.\nFluoroacetate occurs naturally in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. It was first identified in the poison leaf (gifblaar) \"Dichapetalum cymosum\" by Marais in 1944. As early as 1904, colonists in Sierra Leone used extracts of \"Chailletia toxicaria\" which also contains fluoroacetic acid or its salts to poison rats. Several native Australian plant genera contain the toxin, including: \"Gastrolobium\", \"Gompholobium\", \"Oxylobium\", \"Nemcia\" and \"Acacia\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":39},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":67},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":83},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"Pesticide","offset":94},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":115},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":224},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":231},{"uri":"Positron_emission_tomography","surface_form":"Positron emission tomography","offset":240},{"uri":"Toxicity","surface_form":"toxicity","offset":365},{"uri":"Plant_defence_against_herbivores","surface_form":"naturally","offset":437},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":472},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":483},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":495},{"uri":"Dichapetalum_cymosum","surface_form":"Dichapetalum cymosum","offset":558},{"uri":"Sierra_Leone","surface_form":"Sierra Leone","offset":630},{"uri":"Chailletia_toxicaria","surface_form":"Chailletia toxicaria","offset":661},{"uri":"Gastrolobium","surface_form":"Gastrolobium","offset":820},{"uri":"Gompholobium","surface_form":"Gompholobium","offset":836},{"uri":"Oxylobium","surface_form":"Oxylobium","offset":852},{"uri":"Nemcia","surface_form":"Nemcia","offset":865},{"uri":"Acacia","surface_form":"Acacia","offset":878}]}
