{"id":401212,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloy_Alfaro","text":"Jos\u00E9 Eloy Alfaro Delgado (June 25, 1842 \u2013 January 28, 1912) served as President of Ecuador from 1895 to 1901 and from 1906 to 1911. He became one the strongest opponents of pro-Catholic conservative President Gabriel Garc\u00EDa Moreno. For his central role in the Liberal Revolution of 1895 and for having fought conservatism for almost 30 years, he is known as the \"Viejo Luchador\".\nAlfaro was born on June 25, 1842 in Montecristi, Ecuador. He was married to Ana Paredes y Arosemena until his death in 1912. On January 28, 1912, a mob broke out and busted into the prison cell where Alfaro was held at. They dragged him along the streets of Quito, Ecuador. Alfaro was killed during the attack, aged 69.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":83},{"uri":"Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_Moreno","surface_form":"Gabriel Garc\u00EDa Moreno","offset":209},{"uri":"Liberal_Revolution_of_1895","surface_form":"Liberal Revolution of 1895","offset":260},{"uri":"Montecristi%2C_Ecuador","surface_form":"Montecristi","offset":416},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":429},{"uri":"Quito","surface_form":"Quito","offset":638},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":645}]}
