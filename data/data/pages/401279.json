{"id":401279,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia_(dinosaur)","text":"\"Saturnalia\" is an extinct genus of basal prosauropod dinosaur from the Triassic of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The deposits are dated to the early Upper Triassic, about 225\u00A0million years ago (mya). The dinsaur grew to about 1.5\u00A0meters (5\u00A0ft) long.\nPhylogeny.\nThe primitive nature of \"Saturnalia\", and its mixture of sauropodomorph and theropod characteristics, has made it difficult to classify.\nThe first (1999) description of the genus assigned it to the Sauropodomorpha. However, in a 2003 paper, Langer noted that features of its skull and hand were more similar to the sister group of sauropodomorphs, the theropods, and that \"Saturnalia\" could be considered a member of the sauropodomorph \"stem-lineage\", rather than a true member of that group.\nJos\u00E9 Bonaparte and colleagues, in a 2007 study, found \"Saturnalia\" to be very similar to the primitive saurischian \"Guaibasaurus\". Bonaparte placed the two in the same family, Guaibasauridae. Like Langer, Bonaparte found that these forms may have been primitive sauropodomorphs, or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods. Overall, Bonaparte found that both \"Saturnalia\" and \"Guaibasaurus\" were more theropod-like than prosauropod-like. However, all more recent cladistic analyses found it to be a very basal sauropodomorph,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":19},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":27},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":36},{"uri":"Prosauropod","surface_form":"prosauropod","offset":42},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":54},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":72},{"uri":"Rio_Grande_do_Sul","surface_form":"Rio Grande do Sul","offset":84},{"uri":"Southern_Brazil","surface_form":"southern Brazil","offset":103},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":156},{"uri":"Sauropodomorph","surface_form":"sauropodomorph","offset":325},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":344},{"uri":"Sister_group","surface_form":"sister group","offset":583},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":620},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Bonaparte","offset":761},{"uri":"Saurischia","surface_form":"saurischia","offset":864},{"uri":"Guaibasaurus","surface_form":"Guaibasaurus","offset":877},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":929},{"uri":"Guaibasauridae","surface_form":"Guaibasauridae","offset":937},{"uri":"Common_ancestor","surface_form":"common ancestor","offset":1079},{"uri":"Cladistic","surface_form":"cladistic","offset":1272}]}
