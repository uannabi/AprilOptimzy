He began appearing in movies in 1934, usually as boxers or wrestlers. In the 1940s, he played lumbering thugs and scowling plug-uglies. He appeared with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in \"Road to Rio\" (1947), in \"Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion\" (1950), and with Shirley Jones in the movie version of \"Carousel\" (1956).\nHe is best known though for his appearances in the low budget movies directed by Ed Wood. He played Lobo in \"Bride of the Monster\" and \"Night of the Ghouls\", and the zombified Inspector Clay in \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".\nIn the early 1960s, he had guest appearances as wrestlers, thugs, and circus strongmen in various television series including \"Peter Gunn\", \"Bonanza\", and \"The Shirley Temple Show\".
