{"id":401476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Marco","text":"Paul Marco (June 10, 1927 \u2013 May 14, 2006) was an American actor. He often appeared in movies made by Ed Wood, including the \"Kelton Trilogy\": \"Bride of the Monster\", \"Night of the Ghouls\" and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". In this trilogy, he played a bumbling, fearful policeman named Kelton.\nBiography.\nMarco was born in Los Angeles. He took lessons in drama, singing, and dancing at an early age. After graduating from Hollywood High School, he served in the United States Navy during World War II.\nHis first known movie role was a small part in the 1944 movie \"Sweet and Low-Down\" with Benny Goodman. In the early 1950s, The Amazing Criswell predicted on national television that Paul Marco would go far in the movie business. Criswell introduced Marco to Ed Wood. In turn, Marco introduced Ed Wood to Bunny Breckinridge, a gay Shakespearean actor. Breckinridge lived with Marco for a time and co-starred in Wood's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".\nMarco depended on Wood for parts. He more or less retired as an actor as Ed Wood's movies shifted more and more towards pornography. In 1995, Marco recorded \"Home on the Strange\", in which he reprised his Kelton character for Dionysus Records. He revived Kelton once more in the 2005 science fiction satire/tribute film \"The Naked Monster\". On May 14, 2006, Paul Marco died after a battle with hip problems and chronic illness. He was 78.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":58},{"uri":"Ed_Wood","surface_form":"Ed Wood","offset":101},{"uri":"Bride_of_the_Monster","surface_form":"Bride of the Monster","offset":143},{"uri":"Night_of_the_Ghouls","surface_form":"Night of the Ghouls","offset":167},{"uri":"Plan_9_from_Outer_Space","surface_form":"Plan 9 from Outer Space","offset":193},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":319},{"uri":"Hollywood_High_School","surface_form":"Hollywood High School","offset":418},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":458},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":484},{"uri":"Benny_Goodman","surface_form":"Benny Goodman","offset":586},{"uri":"The_Amazing_Criswell","surface_form":"The Amazing Criswell","offset":621},{"uri":"Ed_Wood","surface_form":"Ed Wood","offset":756},{"uri":"Bunny_Breckinridge","surface_form":"Bunny Breckinridge","offset":802},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":824},{"uri":"Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare","offset":828},{"uri":"Plan_9_from_Outer_Space","surface_form":"Plan 9 from Outer Space","offset":916},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":1062},{"uri":"Dionysus_Records","surface_form":"Dionysus Records","offset":1168},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":1226},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":1242},{"uri":"The_Naked_Monster","surface_form":"The Naked Monster","offset":1263}]}
