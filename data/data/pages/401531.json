{"id":401531,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriaria_ruscifolia","text":"\"Coriaria ruscifolia\" are shrubs or small trees with bright red fruits like berries. The fruits and the leaves are very poisonous.\nSystematics.\n\"Coriaria ruscifolia\" was described for the first time by Linnaeus in 1753 in \"Species Plantarum\" (Vol. 2, page 1037), from a plant from Peru.\nDescription.\nShrub up to 4 metres high. Dark green leaves on the top and pale gray on the underside. Flowers grouped in terminal inflorescences on lateral branches, sepals are green to red, small petals, yellow or red anthers. Fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes). The fruits are covered by the petals.\nThe number of chromosomes is 40.\nThe plants of \"C. ruscifolia\" subsp. \"microphylla\" can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria in their roots.\nUses.\nIt is a very toxic plant. Fruits are hallucinogens exciting the nervous system. The leaves have tannin and serve for tanning (making leather out of skins). It is recommended as an ornamental.\nIn Chile, the fruits are used mixed with bread to kill mice and rats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":26},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":42},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":64},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":76},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":104},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":120},{"uri":"Carolus_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Linnaeus","offset":202},{"uri":"Species_Plantarum","surface_form":"Species Plantarum","offset":223},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"Shrub","offset":300},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":338},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"Flower","offset":388},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"inflorescence","offset":416},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":442},{"uri":"Sepal","surface_form":"sepal","offset":452},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"petal","offset":483},{"uri":"Stamen","surface_form":"anther","offset":505},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"Fruit","offset":514},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":531},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nut","offset":558},{"uri":"Achene","surface_form":"achene","offset":564},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":626},{"uri":"Nitrogen_fixation","surface_form":"fix nitrogen","offset":700},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":744},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":788},{"uri":"Hallucinogen","surface_form":"hallucinogen","offset":812},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":839},{"uri":"Tannin","surface_form":"tannin","offset":871},{"uri":"Tanning","surface_form":"tanning","offset":892},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":908},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":923},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":955},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":1022},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":1031}]}
