{"id":401630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenosome","text":"A hydrogenosome is a membrane-enclosed organelle of some anaerobic ciliates, trichomonads, fungi and a few metazoa. The hydrogenosomes of trichomonads (the best studied) produce ATP by a complex metabolic cycle. Unlike mitochondria, this cycle does not use oxygen. It is thought that hydrogenosomes evolved from mitochondria; their structure is rather similar.\nIn 2010, scientists reported their discovery of the first known anaerobic metazoans with hydrogenosome-like organelles. These organisms were Loricifera living in sediments under deep-water brine pools like the L'Atalante basin. These brine pools are completely without any oxygen (anoxic).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":39},{"uri":"Anaerobic_organism","surface_form":"anaerobic","offset":57},{"uri":"Ciliate","surface_form":"ciliate","offset":67},{"uri":"Trichomonas","surface_form":"trichomonads","offset":77},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":91},{"uri":"Metazoa","surface_form":"metazoa","offset":107},{"uri":"Adenosine_triphosphate","surface_form":"ATP","offset":178},{"uri":"Metabolic","surface_form":"metabolic","offset":195},{"uri":"Eumetazoa","surface_form":"metazoans","offset":435},{"uri":"Loricifera","surface_form":"Loricifera","offset":502},{"uri":"L%27Atalante_basin","surface_form":"L'Atalante basin","offset":571},{"uri":"Anoxic","surface_form":"anoxic","offset":642}]}
