It is run by the \"M\u00FCnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft\", or MVG for short. It has 6 lines and has a network of 103,1\u00A0km (64,1 miles) and has exactly 100 stations. Only one line, the U6 crosses the city border in Garching.\nLines.\nThe trains can go 80\u00A0km/h, which is the fastest in Germany.\nOnly the lines U5 and U6 are partly above ground. The U5 comes over ground only at the last station, the U6 for the last six stations in the north.\nTrains run every 10 minutes, in rush hours every 5 minutes. In the early morning and late evening trains run every 20 minutes.\nThere are 3 \"line families\". They share the tunnel in the city centre. Each family has a colour. It is used in the stations.\nAlmost every station has a platform in the middle. Only the stations \"Olympia-Einkaufszentrum\" (U1), \"Richard-Strauss-Stra\u00DFe\" (U4), \"Neuperlach S\u00FCd\" (U5), \"Garching-Hochbr\u00FCck\" and \"Nordfriedhof\" (both U6) have platforms on the side.\nAt the stations \"Innsbrucker Ring\" (U2/U5) and \"Scheidplatz\" (U2/U3) there are four tracks with two platforms. To change trains you only have to go to the other side of the platforms. Two lines cross at these stations. The stations \"Hauptbahnhof (Central Station)\" (U1/U2) and \"M\u00FCnchner Freiheit\" (U3/U6) have four tracks. At the \"Hauptbahnhof\" there are two more tracks on another level for the U4 and U5. Here two lines separate. The stations \"Kolumbusplatz\" (U1/U2), \"Implerstra\u00DFe\" (U3/U6) and \"Max-Weber-Platz\" (U4/U5) have three platforms. Two for trains to the city and one for trains from the city. Two lines separate at these stations.\nU1.\nIn 1980 the U1 started running with the U8 (now the U2).
