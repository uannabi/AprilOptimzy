{"id":401812,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightstand","text":"A nightstand, (could also be called a night table or bedside table) is a small type of table. It is usually placed next to a bed or somewhere else in a bedroom. It is a coffee table which is used next to a person's bed at night time.\nBefore flushing toilets became common, nightstands usually had a chamber pot in them. Nightstands which were made a long time ago sometimes had a drawer, and they usually had a small cupboard at the bottom.\nNightstands used today usually also have a drawer. Things like lamps, alarm clocks, mobile phones, water or medication, which could be useful during the night, are often put either on top of or inside nightstands.\nFrench, Italian and Spanish antique nightstands usually have a drawer and a small cupboard with only one door. They can also have special finishes, like bronze.\nHistory.\nIt is thought that the word \"nightstand\" was first used in 1892.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Table_(furniture)","surface_form":"table","offset":87},{"uri":"Bed","surface_form":"bed","offset":125},{"uri":"Bedroom","surface_form":"bedroom","offset":152},{"uri":"Coffee_table","surface_form":"coffee table","offset":169},{"uri":"Flushing_toilet","surface_form":"flushing toilet","offset":241},{"uri":"Common","surface_form":"common","offset":265},{"uri":"Chamber_pot","surface_form":"chamber pot","offset":299},{"uri":"Drawer","surface_form":"drawer","offset":380},{"uri":"Cupboard","surface_form":"cupboard","offset":417},{"uri":"Lamp","surface_form":"lamp","offset":504},{"uri":"Alarm_clock","surface_form":"alarm clock","offset":511},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":525},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medication","offset":549},{"uri":"Antique","surface_form":"antique","offset":683},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":808}]}
