{"id":4019,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS","text":"=\"preserve\">The Generic Universal RolePlaying System, or GURPS, is a role-playing game system created by Steve Jackson Games. It emphasizes a set of rules that can be used in any time or world. Characters are created using a point-based system. There have been four releases of the GURPS core rules and dozens of game supplements that extend the core rules with genre or setting-specific information.\nIn 1990, GURPS became the focus of a Secret Service investigation when an as yet unreleased GURPS Cyberpunk game supplement was misconstrued by the Secret service as being a handbook for computer crime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Role-playing_game_system","surface_form":"role-playing game system","offset":69},{"uri":"Rules","surface_form":"rules","offset":149},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"Characters","offset":194},{"uri":"Score_(gaming)","surface_form":"point","offset":225}]}
