{"id":402014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste","text":"Electronic waste or e-waste is electronics that have been discarded. This includes any electronics e.g. computers, power tools and etc.\nE-waste is a concern for every country in the 21st century. Because of Moore's law, the rule that states transistor numbers double every two years, people upgrade computers every 3 years on average. People usually throw away their old laptops, cameras, computers, cell phones and televisions. This creates a large amount of practically useless waste. Most countries have methods to combat e waste and find a use for obsolete technology. When you take in to account all the computer users in the world, over 30 million tons of e-waste is created nearly every year, along with a few billions of tons of other waste.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Waste","surface_form":"waste","offset":11},{"uri":"Moore%27s_law","surface_form":"Moore's law","offset":207},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":241}]}
