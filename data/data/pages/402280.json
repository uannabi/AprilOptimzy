{"id":402280,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon","text":"A harpoon is a long spear-like instrument used in fishing to catch fish or large marine mammals such as whales. It does this task by impaling the target animal, allowing the fishermen to use a rope or chain attached to the butt of the projectile to catch the animal. A harpoon can also be used as a weapon.\nTypically, a harpoon for fishing has backwards-pointing barbs which stop the fish getting free.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":20},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":50},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":67},{"uri":"Marine_biology","surface_form":"marine","offset":81},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":88},{"uri":"Whale","surface_form":"whale","offset":104},{"uri":"Projectile","surface_form":"projectile","offset":235},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":299},{"uri":"Barb","surface_form":"barb","offset":363}]}
