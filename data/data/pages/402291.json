{"id":402291,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)","text":"The Libertarian Party is a political party in the United States, founded in 1971. The current Chairperson of the Libertarian National Committee is Nicholas Sarwark of Arizona since June 2014.\nIt is the third largest party in the United States in terms of the popular vote in the country's elections and number of candidates run per election, and it is also identified by many as the fastest growing political party in the United States.\nIdeas.\nThe political ideas of the Libertarian Party reflect the ideas of libertarianism: supporting less regulated markets, a less powerful state, strong civil liberties (favoring same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights), the legalization of cannabis, separation of church and state, open immigration, neutrality in diplomatic issues, staying out of other countries' wars, freedom of trade and travel to all foreign countries, and a better democracy. They also support more lenient gun laws.\nThe Libertarian Party has also supported the United States' exit from the United Nations and other organizations. Although there is not a \"left\" or \"right\" wing label to the party, it is considered by many to be more left-wing than the Republican Party but more right-wing than the Democratic Party. Many members say they are more socially liberal than the Republicans, but more conservative with money than the Democrats.\nAs of March 2016, there are over 410,000 voters registered as Libertarians. Hundreds of Libertarian candidates have been elected or appointed to public office, and thousands have run for office under the Libertarian banner.\nPresidential elections.\nThe Libertarian Party has had a number of records, such as being the first party to get an electoral vote for a woman in a United States presidential election. On May 5, 2012, Gary Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In 2016, Johnson once again became the party's nominee with running mate William Weld. In the United States presidential election, 2016 they won more popular votes than ever before.\nReferences.\nNotes 9. reference is a dead link on the internet","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":27},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":50},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":76},{"uri":"Libertarian_National_Committee","surface_form":"Libertarian National Committee","offset":113},{"uri":"Nicholas_Sarwark","surface_form":"Nicholas Sarwark","offset":147},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":167},{"uri":"Third_party_(politics)","surface_form":"third largest party","offset":202},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":229},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":289},{"uri":"Libertarianism","surface_form":"libertarianism","offset":510},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":552},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":577},{"uri":"Cannabis","surface_form":"cannabis","offset":679},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":703},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":726},{"uri":"Neutral","surface_form":"neutrality","offset":739},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":821},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":877},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1003},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":1165},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":1211},{"uri":"Social_liberalism","surface_form":"socially liberal","offset":1260},{"uri":"Conservative","surface_form":"conservative","offset":1308},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":1763},{"uri":"2012","surface_form":"2012","offset":1770},{"uri":"Gary_Johnson","surface_form":"Gary Johnson","offset":1776},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":1846},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2012","surface_form":"2012 election","offset":1884},{"uri":"William_Weld","surface_form":"William Weld","offset":1972},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"United States presidential election, 2016","offset":1993}]}
