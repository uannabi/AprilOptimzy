Archeological findings suggest that there was a settlement from the Bronze age, probably relating to the La T\u00E8ne culture.\nToday, Bludenz is an important railway hub, at the point where the Klostertal, Brandnertal and Montafon join. It is the start of the railway line that links Vorarlberg to Tyrol, over a mountain pass called Arlberg. In the year 1274, Bludenz was awarded city rights.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":13},{"uri":"Vorarlberg","surface_form":"Vorarlberg","offset":21},{"uri":"Archeology","surface_form":"Archeological findings","offset":113},{"uri":"Bronze_age","surface_form":"Bronze age","offset":181},{"uri":"La_T%C3%A8ne_culture","surface_form":"La T\u00E8ne culture","offset":218},{"uri":"Railway_hub","surface_form":"railway hub","offset":266},{"uri":"Klostertal","surface_form":"Klostertal","offset":302},{"uri":"Brandnertal","surface_form":"Brandnertal","offset":314},{"uri":"Montafon","surface_form":"Montafon","offset":330},{"uri":"Vorarlberg","surface_form":"Vorarlberg","offset":392},{"uri":"Tyrol_(state)","surface_form":"Tyrol","offset":406},{"uri":"Arlberg","surface_form":"Arlberg","offset":441},{"uri":"City_rights","surface_form":"city rights","offset":488}]}
