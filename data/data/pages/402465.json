{"id":402465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacup","text":"A teacup is a porcelain cup that is used to hold liquid for drinking. It is usually used for drinking tea. It is also used for drinking coffee or some other hot drink. A teacup has a handle on the side that stays cool when the rest of the cup is too hot to hold. It also has its own small plate to sit on, called a \"saucer\".\nThese can be made from ceramic, clay, glass or even plastic. Noted: usually its ceramic for safety purposes.\nNowadays, Teacups are made for aesthetic purposes. Just like how you hang them from the ceiling, you can also customize your own by painting, engraving, etc.\nTeacups are often decorated with patterns or pictures. Those painted by hand can be expensive. A few people collect such cups, and do not use them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":14},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"cup","offset":24},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":49},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":60},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":102},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":136},{"uri":"Handle_(grip)","surface_form":"handle","offset":183},{"uri":"Plate","surface_form":"plate","offset":289},{"uri":"Saucer","surface_form":"saucer","offset":316},{"uri":"Decoration","surface_form":"decorated","offset":610}]}
