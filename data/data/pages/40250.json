{"id":40250,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot","text":"Riots happen when many people meet to be violent. This can happen after sports events, demonstrations or as a protest. Rioters damage cars, buildings and attack other people, among other things.\nThe police are brought out to stop riots. In the Western world, they use shields and fight with soft weapons, for example with water cannons or rubber bullets, as well as with batons. When riots really get out of control, police also use tools that can hurt people, such as tear gas and pepper spray, and they put the rioters under arrest.\nThere have been many riots all over the world, especially in England, Northern Ireland, the United States, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, France, Hong Kong and mainland China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violent","offset":41},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":72},{"uri":"Events","surface_form":"events","offset":79},{"uri":"Demonstration","surface_form":"demonstration","offset":87},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":110},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":134},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":140},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":167},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":199},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"Western world","offset":244},{"uri":"Shield","surface_form":"shield","offset":268},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":296},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":322},{"uri":"Cannon","surface_form":"cannon","offset":328},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":339},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":346},{"uri":"Baton","surface_form":"baton","offset":371},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"hurt","offset":448},{"uri":"Tear_gas","surface_form":"tear gas","offset":469},{"uri":"Pepper_spray","surface_form":"pepper spray","offset":482},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":527},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":596},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":605},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":627},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":642},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":649},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":659},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":671},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":682},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":690},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"mainland China","offset":704}]}
