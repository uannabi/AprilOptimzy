In 2011 there were 2,741 people living in Deloraine.\nHistory.\nThe region was explored in 1821 by Captain Roland, who was searching for farm land. Land was granted to new settlers, and the town is now a major farming centre. There are a large number of farms of all types in the area.\nDeloraine Post Office opened on 29 October 1836.\nEconomy and Infrastructure.\nThe town won the State Tidy Towns award in 1992, 1993 and 1995, and the Australian Community of the Year award in 1997.\nThe town is a cultural centre and is home to the largest craft fair in the Southern Hemisphere. About 40,000 people come to the annual fair which has 13 venues and over 200 stalls around the town.\nThe town was bypassed by the new Bass Highway in the early 1990s.
