{"id":402956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_diabetes_mellitus","text":"e=\"preserve\">Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a type of diabetes. It happens during the first 6 months of human life. Infants with this condition do not produce enough insulin. This causes an increase of blood sugar. NDM is often mistaken for the much more common Type 1 diabetes, although type 1 often happens after the first 6 months of life. In almost 60% of those with NDM, this condition lasts their whole life.\nSymptoms of NDM include thirst, frequent urination and dehydration. Most fetuses with NDM do not grow properly in the uterus. Newborns are much smaller than most other newborns. After birth, many babies do not gain enough weight or grow as rapidly as other babies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":59},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":171},{"uri":"Blood_sugar","surface_form":"blood sugar","offset":207},{"uri":"Type_1_diabetes","surface_form":"Type 1 diabetes","offset":267},{"uri":"Thirst","surface_form":"thirst","offset":444},{"uri":"Urination","surface_form":"urination","offset":461},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":475},{"uri":"Fetus","surface_form":"fetus","offset":493},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":538}]}
