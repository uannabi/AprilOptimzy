{"id":402992,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur_(supercontinent)","text":"e=\"preserve\">UR was a supercontinent, on the Earth, that formed 3.1 billion years ago in the early Archaean eon (during the Mesoarchaean era). It might have been the oldest continent on Earth, half a billion years older than Arctica. However, one other supercontinent, Vaalbara, may have come before Ur. Vaalbara might have formed about 3.6 billion years ago.\nUr joined with the continents Nena and Atlantica about 1 billion years ago to form the supercontinent Rodinia. Ur had survived as a single unit, until it was separated when the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart into Laurasia and Gondwana.\nLifetime.\nRocks that made up Ur are now parts of Africa, Australia, and India.\nIn the early period of Ur's existence, it was probably the only continent on Earth. Therefore, scientists call Ur a supercontinent, even though it was probably smaller than Australia is now. Today's New Zealand is similar to Ur, but rotated 90 degrees out of phase, and about too far south.\nWhen Ur was the only continent on Earth, all other land was in the form of small granite islands and small land-masses like Vaalbara, which were not large enough to be continents.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":22},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":45},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":68},{"uri":"Archaean","surface_form":"Archaean","offset":99},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":108},{"uri":"Mesoarchaean","surface_form":"Mesoarchaean","offset":124},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":173},{"uri":"Arctica","surface_form":"Arctica","offset":225},{"uri":"Vaalbara","surface_form":"Vaalbara","offset":269},{"uri":"Nena_(continent)","surface_form":"Nena","offset":390},{"uri":"Atlantica","surface_form":"Atlantica","offset":399},{"uri":"Rodinia","surface_form":"Rodinia","offset":462},{"uri":"Pangaea","surface_form":"Pangaea","offset":552},{"uri":"Laurasia","surface_form":"Laurasia","offset":577},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":590},{"uri":"Rocks","surface_form":"Rocks","offset":610},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":649},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":657},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"India","offset":672},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":774},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":878},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotated","offset":912},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":963},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":1051},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":1059},{"uri":"Vaalbara","surface_form":"Vaalbara","offset":1094}]}
