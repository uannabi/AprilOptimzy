{"id":403133,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kaufman","text":"Andrew Geoffrey \"Andy\" Kaufman (January 17, 1949 \u2013 May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, comedian, actor, and singer. Kaufman was known for his role as Latka Gravas in the comedy television series \"Taxi\" and for creating Tony Clifton, a fictional character.\nKaufman was born in New York City to a Jewish family. He was raised in Great Neck, Long Island, New York. Kaufman studied at Grahm Junior College. He was never married and had no children.\nKaufman died on May 16, 1984 in West Hollywood, California from a rare case of lung cancer, aged 35. He was buried at Beth David Cemetery, Elmont, New York.\nKaufman allegedly told many people\u2014including Bob Zmuda\u2014that he wished to fake his own death. This had caused some fans to believe Kaufman was still alive when he died. Kaufman himself said that if he were to fake his death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004. Many of Kaufman's fans saw a picture that looks similar to that of Andy.\nThere is a website related to this theory, and, recently, \"a grainy video has surfaced that purports to show Kaufman living under an assumed name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":72},{"uri":"Taxi_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Taxi","offset":203},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":283},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":302},{"uri":"Great_Neck%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Great Neck","offset":334},{"uri":"Long_Island","surface_form":"Long Island","offset":346},{"uri":"Grahm_Junior_College","surface_form":"Grahm Junior College","offset":388},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"West Hollywood","offset":484},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":500},{"uri":"Lung_cancer","surface_form":"lung cancer","offset":531},{"uri":"Elmont%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Elmont, New York","offset":591},{"uri":"Bob_Zmuda","surface_form":"Bob Zmuda","offset":654},{"uri":"Albuquerque","surface_form":"Albuquerque","offset":1118},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":1131}]}
