{"id":403149,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Edouard_(1996)","text":"=\"preserve\">Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane in 1996. Its winds reached 145 miles an hour. Edouard was at major hurricane status for around eight days. The storm was originally forecast to slam the Northeastern United States. It was much less severe there.\nEdouard generated strong waves that killed two people on the coastal shore of New Jersey. The southeast coast of Massachusetts received minor hurricane force winds that caused minimal damage on Nantucket Island.\nThe name Edouard was not retired due to lack of serious damage. The name was used again in the 2002, 2008 and 2014 Atlantic hurricane seasons, and will be again during 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":48},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":348},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":383},{"uri":"2002_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2002","offset":577},{"uri":"2008_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2008","offset":583},{"uri":"2014_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2014 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":592}]}
