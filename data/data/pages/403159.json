It is 32 \"fouett\u00E9s en tournant\" performed without stopping.\nMovement.\nOne \"fouett\u00E9 rond de jambe en tournant\" is an action where the dancer stands for a moment on flat foot with the supporting knee bent as the other \"working\" leg is whipped around to the side, creating the impetus to spin one turn. The working leg is then pulled in to touch the supporting knee as the dancer rises up \"en pointe\" on the supporting foot.\nHistory.\n32 fouett\u00E9s were first performed by Pierina Legnani in Marius Petipa's \"Cinderella\" in 1893.\nKonstantin Skalkovsky, the dance critic for the \"St. Petersburg Gazette\", went to the first performance of \"Cinderella\". He reported that \"...in the last act Legnani positively outdid herself. When Emma Bessone danced the lead in \"The Haarlem Tulip\" she did 14 fouett\u00E9s. In her variation Legnani performed 32 of them without stopping, and without travelling one inch! The public delightedly applauded the Ballerina and compelled her to repeat this variation as well. On the repetition she nevertheless did 28 fouett\u00E9s. To count them became the favourite occupation of the public.\"\nLegnani repeated this feat again in many other ballets during her career. She performed them as Odile in the \"Black Swan Pas de Deux\" from \"Swan Lake\" (1895).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classical_ballet","surface_form":"classical ballet","offset":41},{"uri":"Impetus","surface_form":"impetus","offset":333},{"uri":"En_pointe","surface_form":"en pointe","offset":446},{"uri":"Pierina_Legnani","surface_form":"Pierina Legnani","offset":526},{"uri":"Marius_Petipa","surface_form":"Marius Petipa","offset":545},{"uri":"Swan_Lake","surface_form":"Swan Lake","offset":1304}]}
