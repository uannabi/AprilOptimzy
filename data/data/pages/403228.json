{"id":403228,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity","text":"Water scarcity is a lack of fresh water to meet what is needed in a given area. For us, fresh water is drinkable, and sea water is not. This is because sea water has a high salt content, which humans (and many other land animals) cannot deal with.\nThere are arid and deserted areas, and places where the water is too polluted to drink. It is a social, environmental and economic problem in many countries.\nWater scarcity can be the result of both human and natural causes. Changes in climate and weather patterns can cause the availability of water to drop. Common human causes include over-consumption, bad governance, pollution, and increases in the demand for water.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with total water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions. The World Bank has said that climate change could heavily change the future of water availability and use, and therefore increase water stress on a global scale.\nFresh water scarcity has negative affects on ecology, biodiversity, agriculture and human health. It has also led to armed conflicts in several cases. Some countries upriver have built dams to satisfy their needs for drinking water, irrigation and electric power. These needs have grown as populations has grown, and as climate changes has reduced rain in some places. Down river from the dam, supply is usually reduced. This creates tension between countries. The River Jordan in the Middle East, and the Nile are two good examples of where this is happening.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fresh__water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":28},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":103},{"uri":"Sea_water","surface_form":"sea water","offset":118},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":173},{"uri":"Arid","surface_form":"arid","offset":258},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":267},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"polluted","offset":317},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"social","offset":344},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":352},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economic","offset":370},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":484},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":496},{"uri":"Sustainability","surface_form":"over-consumption","offset":586},{"uri":"Governance","surface_form":"governance","offset":608},{"uri":"Supply_and_demand","surface_form":"demand","offset":652},{"uri":"Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","surface_form":"Food and Agriculture Organization","offset":674},{"uri":"World_Bank","surface_form":"World Bank","offset":900},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":925},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":1103},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":1112},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1126},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":1142},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":1148},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"armed conflicts","offset":1175},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":1243},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":1291},{"uri":"River_Jordan","surface_form":"River Jordan","offset":1523},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":1564}]}
