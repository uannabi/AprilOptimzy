{"id":403285,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouache","text":"Gouache, also spelled guache, is a type of paint. It is also commonly called poster paint. It consists of pigment, a binding agent (usually gum arabic), and some additives to make it opaque. An inert, white pigment such as chalk is usually added. The essential idea is that gouache covers up whatever is underneath. Water colours, in contrast, are somewhat transparent.\nAfter gouache has dried, any form of paint can be used on the surface, also pastels and crayons. Watercolours on top of a gouache surface are not so runny (fluid) as they are on plain paper.\nThe fast-drying quality of gouache makes it a favourite for \"en plein air\" (outdoor) paintings. It was also a favourite of J.M.W. Turner.\nGouache also refers to paintings that use this type of paint.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":106},{"uri":"Binding_agent","surface_form":"binding agent","offset":117},{"uri":"Gum_arabic","surface_form":"gum arabic","offset":140},{"uri":"Opaque","surface_form":"opaque","offset":183},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":223},{"uri":"Water_colours","surface_form":"Water colours","offset":316},{"uri":"Transparent","surface_form":"transparent","offset":357},{"uri":"Pastels","surface_form":"pastels","offset":446},{"uri":"Crayons","surface_form":"crayons","offset":458},{"uri":"Watercolour","surface_form":"Watercolour","offset":467},{"uri":"J.M.W._Turner","surface_form":"J.M.W.
