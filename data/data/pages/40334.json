{"id":40334,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger","text":"A hamburger or burger is a type of sandwich with a patty of cooked ground meat between the two halves of a bun. Tomatoes, onions, cheese, salad and dips may also be added. The hamburger may be eaten without a knife and fork, so it is a fast food which can be eaten anywhere.\nHamburgers are named for a city in Germany called Hamburg. They were probably invented in Germany, though what we now know as a hamburger was created in the United States in the 19th century. Hamburgers appeared on menus in England and the United States in the 19th century, and became a popular food after the 1904 World's Fair. What is called a hamburger throughout the world today was different than the first German hamburgers; German dishes often involved a steak or sausage between pieces of bread instead of ground meat.\nMany fast food restaurants, such as Burger King, KFC and McDonald's, serve hamburgers.\nA cheeseburger is a hamburger that also has cheese. Hamburgers can be served with other things besides cheese, such as chili.\nEven though the name has the word ham in it, it doesn\u2019t have ham.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sandwich","surface_form":"sandwich","offset":35},{"uri":"Ground_meat","surface_form":"ground meat","offset":67},{"uri":"Bun","surface_form":"bun","offset":107},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"Tomatoes","offset":112},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":122},{"uri":"Salad","surface_form":"salad","offset":138},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"dips","offset":148},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":209},{"uri":"Fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":219},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":236},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":325},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":365},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":432},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":499},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":808},{"uri":"Burger_King","surface_form":"Burger King","offset":839},{"uri":"Wendy%27s","surface_form":"KFC","offset":852},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":860},{"uri":"Cheeseburger","surface_form":"cheeseburger","offset":892},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":934},{"uri":"Chili","surface_form":"chili","offset":1009},{"uri":"Ham","surface_form":"ham","offset":1050}]}
