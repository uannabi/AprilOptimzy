{"id":40356,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience","text":"e=\"preserve\">Experience is knowledge a person gets by doing something or watching someone else do it. Experience is learning through actions.\nSome religious groups and teaching methods value learning by experiencing.\nFor example, if someone wants to learn about the game chess, they would play several games. By making mistakes and learning from them, they learn more rather than just reading about playing.\nTypes of experience.\nSomeone who experienced by watching or doing something himself is said to have \"first-hand experience\".\nWhen one person tells another person, the other person has \"second-hand experience\".\nWhen an experience is felt or enjoyed through imagined participation, the person has had a \"vicarious experience\".\nA religious experience is a spiritual event seen by someone. Holy books like the Bible talk about visions or dreams where men like Moses, Daniel or Jesus met God. Mystics also describe these events, and offer advice. William James wrote a famous book about the kinds of religious experience.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Learning","surface_form":"learning","offset":116},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":147},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":271},{"uri":"Error","surface_form":"mistake","offset":319},{"uri":"Read","surface_form":"read","offset":385},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":735},{"uri":"Spiritual","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":761},{"uri":"Holy","surface_form":"Holy","offset":794},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":814},{"uri":"Vision","surface_form":"vision","offset":831},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":842},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":864},{"uri":"Daniel","surface_form":"Daniel","offset":871},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":881},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":891},{"uri":"Mysticism","surface_form":"Mystics","offset":896},{"uri":"William_James","surface_form":"William James","offset":950}]}
