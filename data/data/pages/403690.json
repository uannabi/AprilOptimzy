{"id":403690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSSP","text":"A GSSP, more fully a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, is an internationally agreed point which defines the start of a stage on the geologic time scale.\nThe work is done by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, a part of the International Union of Geological Sciences. As of 2012, 64 of the 101 stages that need a GSSP have been decided.\nList.\nThis list shows some of the GSSPs.\nGlobal Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSAs).\nBecause defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more harder as one goes farther back in time. Before 640 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as \"Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages\". The oldest GSSP is the one that marks the start of the Ediacaran at 635 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stage_(stratigraphy)","surface_form":"stage","offset":131},{"uri":"Geologic_time_scale","surface_form":"geologic time scale","offset":144},{"uri":"International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","surface_form":"International Commission on Stratigraphy","offset":189},{"uri":"International_Union_of_Geological_Sciences","surface_form":"International Union of Geological Sciences","offset":245},{"uri":"Ediacaran","surface_form":"Ediacaran","offset":827}]}
