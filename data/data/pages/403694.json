{"id":403694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity","text":"Neurodiversity is a word for differences in people's brains. It is a type of biodiversity (diversity in living creatures).\nExamples of neurodiverse conditions include autism, Tourette syndrome\u00A0 and dyslexia.\nMovement.\nThe neurodiversity movement is an approach to mental disability in which some neurological conditions are variations of the human genome. The term was first used in the late 1990s as a challenge to the idea that neurological differences are disorders instead of features. The movement believes that these variations should be recognised as a social category along with gender, human race and sexual orientation.\nSome people claim that neurodiversity would not be good for individuals with severe disabilities, such as low-functioning autism. They state that the difficulties are far greater than any potential strengths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":77},{"uri":"Autism","surface_form":"autism","offset":167},{"uri":"Tourette_syndrome","surface_form":"Tourette syndrome","offset":175},{"uri":"Dyslexia","surface_form":"dyslexia","offset":198},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental disability","offset":264},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":348},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":587},{"uri":"Human_race","surface_form":"human race","offset":595},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":610}]}
