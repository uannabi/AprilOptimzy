The Wii U game was released on November 21, 2014.\nLike the past games in the series, \"Super Smash Bros.\" involves characters from Nintendo series fighting against each other, with the object of knocking opponents off of the stage in some way. Characters from past \"Super Smash Bros.\" games that are in these games include Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Link, Princess Zelda, Sheik, Toon Link, Fox McCloud, Kirby, King Dedede, Pikachu, Lucario, Charizard, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Samus Aran, Zero Suit Samus, Marth, Ike, Pit, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Olimar.

The Nintendo 3DS version has cel-shaded (computer graphics made to look like they were drawn by hand) graphics. Both versions have the same number of characters, but have stages that are only in either version. The Nintendo 3DS version has more stages based on Nintendo's handheld video games. The Wii U version has more stages based on their console video games. For the first time in the series, players can change the movesets of characters.
