It is a left-hand tributary of the Po River, and is about long.\nGeography.\nDora Baltea is formed on the Mont Blanc massif by the confluence, near Entr\u00E8ves, of two small rivers: Dora di Ferret, that comes from the Pr\u00E9 de Bar Glacier in Val Ferret; and Dora di Veny, that comes from the Miage Glacier in Val Veny.\nAs it crosses the Aosta Valley, the Dora Baltea flows through the city of Aosta (where the Buthier, a small river, runs into it) and near all the main cities of the lower Aosta Valley: Ch\u00E2tillon, Saint-Vincent, Verr\u00E8s and Pont-Saint-Martin. After it enters the Piedmont region, it passes through the city of Ivrea and a good part of Canavese, gets from its right hand the waters of the Chiusella and reaches the Po at Crescentino.\nThe watershed has an area of, and its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 96 cubic metres per second when it gets to the Po river.\nSports.\nDora Baltea is a popular place for the practice of sports like canoeing, kayaking and similar water sports.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":112},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":130},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"left-hand tributary","offset":145},{"uri":"Po_River","surface_form":"Po River","offset":172},{"uri":"Mont_Blanc","surface_form":"Mont Blanc","offset":241},{"uri":"Massif","surface_form":"massif","offset":252},{"uri":"Confluence","surface_form":"confluence","offset":266},{"uri":"Entr%C3%A8ves","surface_form":"Entr\u00E8ves","offset":283},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"Glacier","offset":361},{"uri":"Valle_d%27Aosta","surface_form":"Aosta Valley","offset":467},{"uri":"Aosta","surface_form":"Aosta","offset":523},{"uri":"Buthier","surface_form":"Buthier","offset":540},{"uri":"Piedmont","surface_form":"Piedmont","offset":710},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":719},{"uri":"Ivrea","surface_form":"Ivrea","offset":757},{"uri":"Canavese","surface_form":"Canavese","offset":782},{"uri":"Chiusella","surface_form":"Chiusella","offset":835},{"uri":"Crescentino","surface_form":"Crescentino","offset":867},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":884},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":918},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":929},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":939},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":993},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":1001},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":1013},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":1030},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":1126},{"uri":"Canoe","surface_form":"canoe","offset":1138},{"uri":"Kayak","surface_form":"kayak","offset":1148},{"uri":"Water_sports","surface_form":"water sports","offset":1169}]}
