The carefree and adventurous family live in their house in Moominvalley, though in the past, their part-time residences have included a lighthouse and a theatre. They have had many adventures along with their various friends.\nIn all, nine books were released in the series, together with five picture books and a comic strip being released between 1945 and 1993.\nThe Moomins have since been the subject for many television series, movies and even a theme park called Moomin World in Naantali, Finland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":54},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comic strip","offset":66},{"uri":"Swedish-Finn","surface_form":"Swedish-speaking Finnish","offset":81},{"uri":"Tove_Jansson","surface_form":"Tove Jansson","offset":129},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":167},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":190},{"uri":"Snouts","surface_form":"snouts","offset":269},{"uri":"Hippopotamus","surface_form":"hippopotamus","offset":301},{"uri":"Moominvalley","surface_form":"Moominvalley","offset":376},{"uri":"Lighthouse","surface_form":"lighthouse","offset":453},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":470},{"uri":"Moomin_comic_strips","surface_form":"comic strip","offset":630},{"uri":"Moomin_World","surface_form":"Moomin World","offset":784},{"uri":"Naantali","surface_form":"Naantali","offset":800},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":810}]}
