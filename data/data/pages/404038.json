She joined the judging panel of talent shows \"X Factor Indonesia\" (2013) and \"Asia's Got Talent\" (2015); the former made her the highest-paid judge in Indonesian television history.\nAnggun is the Asian artist with the highest album sales outside Asia, with her releases being certified gold and platinum in some European countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received a number of accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France and the World Music Award for World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist.
