{"id":404070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A300","text":"The Airbus A300 is a jet airliner which was made by Airbus. Airbus Industries launched the plane in 1972, and it was the first plane with two engines to have more than one isle between the seats (the first twin-engined wide-body aircraft). The A300 can hold 266 passengers in two classes. It can fly for a maximum of when it is full, but this depends on the type of A300.\nAir France was the first airline to get an A300. Air France began to use its A300s on 30 May 1974. Airbus stopped making A300s in July 2007. When Airbus stopped making A300s, it also stopped making A310s. The freighter version of the A300 has been replaced by the A330-200F.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1966, Frank Kolk, a member of American Airlines, asked for a plane to replace the Boeing 727. He wanted a plane which could hold 250 to 300 passengers, with two engines. American plane makers made planes with three engines, like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, because the FAA had banned planes with two engines from flying on certain routes.\nIn September 1967, the British, French, and German governments agreed to begin designing the Airbus A300, which would have 300 seats.\nAfter this agreement, both the French and British governments were worried about the plane. The plane needed a new type of engine from Rolls-Royce, the RB207. In December 1968, the French and British companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) thought of a different design: the Airbus A250, which would have 250 seats. This design had its name changed to the A300B, and it did not need a new type of engine, which saved money. To get more U.S. airlines to buy the plane, American General Electric CF6-50 engines were used for the A300 instead of Rolls-Royce engines. The British government was upset and decided to stop supporting the A300. However, Hawker-Siddeley did not leave, and designed the wings for the A300.\nIn 1972, the A300 flew for the first time. The first type of A300 to be made, the A300B2, began to be used by airlines in 1974. The A300B4 began to be used one year later. At first, Airbus Industrie did not sell many planes. However, by 1979, 81 aircraft were being used. It was the A320 which made Airbus the very big company that it is today.\nParts of the A300 were made by many different companies from all over Europe. These were taken to Toulouse-Blagnac by some Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft so that the parts could all be put together to make the plane. This method turned out to be much better than simply building the aircraft in one place. (Source?)\nHistory.\nThe A300 did not sell very well at first. Most of the orders were from airlines of countries which made up Airbus Industrie, like Air France and Lufthansa.\nIn 1974, Korean Air ordered 4 A300s. This made it the first airline outside of Europe to order an Airbus Industrie plane. Airbus Industrie thought that South-East-Asia was a good place to sell planes. It also thought that Korean Air was the 'key' to selling planes in that area.\nAirlines which used the A300 to fly on short flights needed to have fewer flights so that the aircraft could be filled, so these airlines lost customers to other airlines which used smaller aircraft and had flights more often. Eventually, Airbus had to make the A320 to rival the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80.\nIn 1977, Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s. Frank Borman, who was the CEO of Eastern, was happy that the A300 used much less fuel than the planes the airline already had. He ordered 23 A300s. After this, Pan Am also ordered some A300s. From then on, many A300s were sold, and 878 planes were given to airlines.\nThe body of the A300 was made longer (on the A330 and A340), shorter (on the A310), or was changed (for the A300-600ST \"Beluga\" Super Transporter).\nIn March 2006, Airbus said that it was no longer making the A300/A310. The last A300 first flew on 18 April 2007. It was delivered to FedEx on 12 July 2007.\nA300B1.\nOnly two of these were built: the prototype, and a second aircraft. It can hold 300 passengers or 323 passengers, and it has two General Electric CF6-50A engines.\nA300B2.\nThe first version to be made for airlines. It had General Electric CF6 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines. Air France was the first airline to use it, in May 1974.\nA300B4.\nThe version which was made the most. The first A300B4 made its first flight on 25 December 1974. Germanair got the first one on 23 May 1975.\nA300-600.\nThis type's official name is the A300B4-600. It has more powerful CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines, and it has the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU). The A300-600 began being used in 1983 by Saudi Arabian Airlines The A300-600 also has a different cockpit (similar to the A310), so the flight engineer was not needed for this type.\nA300B10 (A310).\nThis type is shorter and does not need a flight engineer.\nIt can also be used as a military plane. It is currently being used by the Canadian Forces and German Air Force. 260 of these planes were sold, but five of these were never made.\nAccidents.\nAs of 2010, the A300 has had 54 accidents. There have been 26 hull-losses. 1,434 people have died on A300s. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is completely destroyed, or if it is damaged so much that it cannot be fixed.\nAircraft still flying.\nAs of July 2020, there are more than 200 A300s still flying.\nDeliveries.\n\"Data until the end of December 2007.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jet","surface_form":"jet","offset":21},{"uri":"Airliner","surface_form":"airliner","offset":25},{"uri":"Airbus","surface_form":"Airbus","offset":52},{"uri":"Class","surface_form":"class","offset":280},{"uri":"Maximum","surface_form":"maximum","offset":306},{"uri":"Air_France","surface_form":"Air France","offset":372},{"uri":"Airbus_A310","surface_form":"A310","offset":570},{"uri":"Cargo_aircraft","surface_form":"freighter","offset":581},{"uri":"American_Airlines","surface_form":"American Airlines","offset":693},{"uri":"Boeing_727","surface_form":"Boeing 727","offset":745},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10","surface_form":"McDonnell Douglas DC-10","offset":896},{"uri":"Lockheed_L-1011_Tristar","surface_form":"Lockheed L-1011 Tristar","offset":928},{"uri":"FAA","surface_form":"FAA","offset":965},{"uri":"Route","surface_form":"route","offset":1027},{"uri":"Rolls-Royce_plc","surface_form":"Rolls-Royce","offset":1304},{"uri":"Sud_Aviation","surface_form":"Sud Aviation","offset":1380},{"uri":"Hawker_Siddeley","surface_form":"Hawker Siddeley","offset":1397},{"uri":"GE-Aviation","surface_form":"General Electric","offset":1651},{"uri":"General_Electric_CF6","surface_form":"CF6-50","offset":1668},{"uri":"Airbus_A320_family","surface_form":"A320","offset":2172},{"uri":"Toulouse_Blagnac_International_Airport","surface_form":"Toulouse-Blagnac","offset":2332},{"uri":"Aero_Spacelines_Super_Guppy","surface_form":"Aero Spacelines Super Guppy","offset":2357},{"uri":"Lufthansa","surface_form":"Lufthansa","offset":2710},{"uri":"Korean_Air","surface_form":"Korean Air","offset":2730},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":3280},{"uri":"Boeing_737","surface_form":"737","offset":3287},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas","surface_form":"McDonnell Douglas","offset":3295},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9","surface_form":"DC-9","offset":3313},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas_MD-80","surface_form":"MD-80","offset":3318},{"uri":"Eastern_Air_Lines","surface_form":"Eastern Air Lines","offset":3334},{"uri":"Lease","surface_form":"lease","offset":3352},{"uri":"Frank_Borman","surface_form":"Frank Borman","offset":3371},{"uri":"Pan_American_World_Airways","surface_form":"Pan Am","offset":3531},{"uri":"Airbus_A330","surface_form":"A330","offset":3683},{"uri":"Airbus_A340","surface_form":"A340","offset":3692},{"uri":"Airbus_Beluga","surface_form":"A300-600ST \"Beluga\" Super Transporter","offset":3746},{"uri":"FedEx","surface_form":"FedEx","offset":3920},{"uri":"Prototype","surface_form":"prototype","offset":3985},{"uri":"General_Electric_CF6","surface_form":"General Electric CF6-50A","offset":4080},{"uri":"Pratt_%26amp%3B_Whitney_JT9D","surface_form":"Pratt & Whitney JT9D","offset":4196},{"uri":"General_Electric_CF6","surface_form":"CF6-80","offset":4508},{"uri":"Pratt_%26amp%3B_Whitney_PW4000","surface_form":"Pratt & Whitney PW4000","offset":4518},{"uri":"Honeywell","surface_form":"Honeywell","offset":4565},{"uri":"Auxiliary_power_unit","surface_form":"auxiliary power unit","offset":4583},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabian_Airlines","surface_form":"Saudi Arabian Airlines","offset":4652},{"uri":"Flight_engineer","surface_form":"flight engineer","offset":4747},{"uri":"Canadian_Forces","surface_form":"Canadian Forces","offset":4942},{"uri":"German_Air_Force","surface_form":"German Air Force","offset":4962}]}
