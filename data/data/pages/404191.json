{"id":404191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollemia","text":"\"Wollemia\" is a genus of coniferous tree in the family Araucariaceae. It is a \"living fossil\", recently found in 1994. Its fossil record dates back 200 million years, and it was thought to be long extinct.\n\"Wollemia nobilis\" was discovered in 1994 in a temperate rainforest wilderness area of the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales. in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided sandstone gorges near Lithgow, 150 kilometres north-west of Sydney.\nIn both botanical and popular literature the tree has been called the Wollemi Pine. It is not a true pine (genus \"Pinus\") nor a member of the pine family (Pinaceae), but is related to \"Agathis\" and \"Araucaria\" in the family Araucariaceae.\nThe Wollemi pine is classified as Critically Endangered (CR \u2013 D) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List 2002. It is legally protected in Australia. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up, outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pinophyta","surface_form":"coniferous","offset":25},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":36},{"uri":"Araucariaceae","surface_form":"Araucariaceae","offset":55},{"uri":"Living_fossil","surface_form":"living fossil","offset":79},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":263},{"uri":"Wollemi_National_Park","surface_form":"Wollemi National Park","offset":297},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":322},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":391},{"uri":"Lithgow","surface_form":"Lithgow","offset":403},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":441},{"uri":"Pinus","surface_form":"Pinus","offset":563},{"uri":"Pinaceae","surface_form":"Pinaceae","offset":604},{"uri":"Agathis","surface_form":"Agathis","offset":634},{"uri":"Araucaria","surface_form":"Araucaria","offset":648},{"uri":"Araucariaceae","surface_form":"Araucariaceae","offset":673},{"uri":"Critically_Endangered","surface_form":"Critically Endangered","offset":722},{"uri":"IUCN_Red_List","surface_form":"Red List","offset":809}]}
