{"id":404344,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia","text":"Smelling things depends on two nerves (Nervus olfactorius and Nervus trigeminus), as well as the part of the brain which processes the information. Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of small.\nThere are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem.\nThe sense of smell also affects the sense of taste. People who cannot small smell have only the basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.\nNote also that the sense of smell changes with age. Anosmia can also point to different neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease,\nAlzheimer's disease, or Schizophrenia. Certain plants, such as tobacco also contain substances which change olfaction.\nIn general, anosmia which has its cause in the brain cannot be treated. Anosmia which is caused by blocking the nose can be treated by removing the block. In some cases, accupuncture was successfully used to treat anosmia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":31},{"uri":"Nervus_olfactorius","surface_form":"Nervus olfactorius","offset":39},{"uri":"Nervus_trigeminus","surface_form":"Nervus trigeminus","offset":62},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":109},{"uri":"Taste","surface_form":"taste","offset":383},{"uri":"Sour","surface_form":"sour","offset":455},{"uri":"Bitter","surface_form":"bitter","offset":461},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":469},{"uri":"Umami","surface_form":"umami","offset":480},{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurological conditions","offset":575},{"uri":"Parkinson%27s_disease","surface_form":"Parkinson's disease","offset":607},{"uri":"Alzheimer%27s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer's disease","offset":628},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"Schizophrenia","offset":652},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":675},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":691},{"uri":"Accupuncture","surface_form":"accupuncture","offset":917}]}
