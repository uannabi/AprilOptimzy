{"id":404345,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Post","text":"\"The Boston Post\" was a newspaper published in Boston, Massachusetts between 1831 and 1956. It was one of the most popular daily newspaper in New England for over a hundred years. The \"Post\" was founded in November 1831 by two businessmen: Charles G. Greene and William Beals. By the 1930s, \"The Boston Post\" had grown to be one of the largest newspapers in the country, with well over a million readers.\nDuring the 1940s, the newspaper faced more and more competition from papers published by William Hearst. More people began listening to the news on radio and television, and the paper's business began to suffer. It stopped being published in October 1956. At the time, it was printing about 255,000 copies of its daily issue, and about 260,000 of its Sunday edition.\nSunday magazine.\nIn the Sunday paper every week was included a weekly magazine. It was originally called \"The Sunday Magazine of \"The Boston Sunday Post\" and later \"The Boston Sunday Post\" Sunday Magazine\".\n\"Boston Post\" Cane.\nThe \"Boston Post\" Cane was an award given by many New England towns to their oldest citizen. It was originally done in 1909, when the newspaper was owned by Edwin A. Grozier. The newspaper had several hundred ornate, gold-tipped canes made, and then given presented in a ceremony to each town's oldest living man. The custom was expanded to include a community's oldest women in 1930. Many towns in New England still carry on the \"Boston Post\" cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909. When a recipient dies (or leaves the community), the cane passes to a successor who is the town's next oldest living resident.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":24},{"uri":"Boston%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Boston, Massachusetts","offset":47},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":142},{"uri":"Charles_Gordon_Greene","surface_form":"Charles G.
