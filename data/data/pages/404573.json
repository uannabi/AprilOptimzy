A dog can have a \"double coat\" that has short, soft hair underneath a layer of long, coarse hair, or a \"single coat\" that has only the long, coarse hair. A dog's coat may also be called hair or fur.\nFour main coat attributes.\nDog coats can come in many different colors, patterns, lengths, and textures.\nCoat colors.\nDog coats come in four main colors: black, brown, white, and red. The same main color can have many shades. These shades are sometimes common enough that they are given their own color names, such as gold, yellow, cream, blue, and grey.\nThere may be several of these colors on one dog.\nCoat patterns.\nDog coats can also have many different patterns based on spots, patches, and mixing colors.\nCoat lengths and textures.\nA dog's coat can be long or short. For most dogs, their hair reaches one length and then stops growing, but there are some dogs whose hair will keep growing longer and longer.\nSome breeds of dog do not grow hair on parts of their bodies. These dogs are called \"hairless\". Examples of \"hairless\" dogs are the Xoloitzcuintli (Mexican Hairless Dog), the Peruvian Inca Orchid (Peruvian Hairless Dog) and the Chinese Crested.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":20},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":230},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":238},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":307},{"uri":"Pattern","surface_form":"pattern","offset":315},{"uri":"Texture","surface_form":"texture","offset":338},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":397},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":404},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":411},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":422},{"uri":"Shade","surface_form":"shade","offset":461},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":561},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":567},{"uri":"Cream","surface_form":"cream","offset":575},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":582},{"uri":"Grey","surface_form":"grey","offset":592},{"uri":"Pattern","surface_form":"pattern","offset":701},{"uri":"Spot","surface_form":"spot","offset":719},{"uri":"Patch","surface_form":"patch","offset":726},{"uri":"Xoloitzcuintli","surface_form":"Xoloitzcuintli","offset":1089},{"uri":"Peruvian_Inca_Orchid","surface_form":"Peruvian Inca Orchid","offset":1132},{"uri":"Chinese_Crested","surface_form":"Chinese Crested","offset":1185}]}
