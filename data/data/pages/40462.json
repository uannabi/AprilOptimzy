{"id":40462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glinde","text":"Glinde is a town in the province of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, about 20 km away from Hamburg.\nHistory.\nThe name Glinde is found in a document from March 25 1229 for the first time. In the document, Earl Adolf IV. of Schauenburg and Holstein gave the village to a Cistercian convent. (The convent moved to today's town of Reinbek.) The King of Denmark and Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Frederick I of Denmark, got all the convent had during the Protestant Reformation. In 1544 his son Christian III gave a part of it to each of his brothers. The owner changed again several times.\nIn 1948, the town administration of Glinde, Oststeinbek, Havighorst and Sch\u00F6nningstedt were brought together to the Amt Glinde. Sch\u00F6nningstedt left that combination in 1949 and Havighorst left it in 1973. So Glinde und Oststeinbek became independent villages.\nOn June 24, 1979, (on the 750th anniversary of the village), Glinde became a town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Schleswig-Holstein","surface_form":"Schleswig-Holstein","offset":36},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":58},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":89},{"uri":"March_25","surface_form":"March 25","offset":151},{"uri":"1229","surface_form":"1229","offset":160},{"uri":"Earl","surface_form":"Earl","offset":202},{"uri":"Adolf_IV._of_Schauenburg_and_Holstein","surface_form":"Adolf IV. of Schauenburg and Holstein","offset":207},{"uri":"Cistercian","surface_form":"Cistercian","offset":267},{"uri":"Reinbek","surface_form":"Reinbek","offset":325},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":347},{"uri":"Duke","surface_form":"Duke","offset":359},{"uri":"Schleswig-Holstein","surface_form":"Schleswig-Holstein","offset":367},{"uri":"Frederick_I_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Frederick I of Denmark","offset":387},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Protestant Reformation","offset":446},{"uri":"1544","surface_form":"1544","offset":473},{"uri":"Christian_III_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Christian III","offset":486},{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":585},{"uri":"Oststeinbek","surface_form":"Oststeinbek","offset":626},{"uri":"Havighorst","surface_form":"Havighorst","offset":639},{"uri":"Amt_(country_subdivision)","surface_form":"Amt","offset":698},{"uri":"1949","surface_form":"1949","offset":750},{"uri":"June_24","surface_form":"June 24","offset":845},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":854},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":919}]}
