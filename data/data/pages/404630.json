{"id":404630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monal","text":"A monal is a bird of the genus \"Lophophorus\" of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. The type species of this genus is the Himalayan monal (\"Lophophorus impejanus\").\nAll the adult males have very atractive and shiny feathers of different metallic colors (colors appearing to be made of a metal). The females and the young males do not have feathers with many colors; they are reddish brown with some white parts.\nTheir diet consists of insects and plant parts such as roots, tubers, bulbs and seed.\nThey live in the rhododendron forests in the high altitudes of the Himalayas and of Sichuan (China).\nDue to habitat destruction and hunting, they have already become quite rare and threatened in their existence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":13},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":25},{"uri":"Pheasant","surface_form":"pheasant","offset":52},{"uri":"Phasianidae","surface_form":"Phasianidae","offset":69},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":86},{"uri":"Himalayan_monal","surface_form":"Himalayan monal","offset":120},{"uri":"Atractive","surface_form":"atractive","offset":193},{"uri":"Shiny","surface_form":"shiny","offset":207},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":213},{"uri":"Metallic","surface_form":"metallic","offset":235},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":244},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":285},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":373},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":381},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":416},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":433},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":445},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":465},{"uri":"Tuber","surface_form":"tuber","offset":472},{"uri":"Bulb","surface_form":"bulb","offset":480},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":490},{"uri":"Rhododendron","surface_form":"rhododendron","offset":513},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":526},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":546},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":563},{"uri":"Sichuan","surface_form":"Sichuan","offset":580},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":589},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":604},{"uri":"Hunt","surface_form":"hunt","offset":628}]}
