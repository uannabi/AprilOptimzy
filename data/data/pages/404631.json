It often involves a move from shows aimed at viewers that know a lot about the channel's subject to shows aimed at a wider audience. Most examples of channel drift have a channel add infotainment or reality shows to their schedule.\nA well-known example of channel drift is MTV. When it started in 1981, MTV was a channel that showed music videos. In the 1990s, it started adding entertainment and reality shows aimed at a young adult audience. This was the start of a move towards the channel's current focus on shows aimed at adolescents and young adults.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television_channel","surface_form":"television channel","offset":65},{"uri":"Infotainment","surface_form":"infotainment","offset":351},{"uri":"Reality_television","surface_form":"reality","offset":367},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":441},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":501},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":596},{"uri":"Adolescence","surface_form":"adolescent","offset":695}]}
