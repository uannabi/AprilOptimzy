{"id":40476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire_College","text":"Hampshire College is a private college in Amherst, Massachusetts. The current president of the college is Ralph Hexter. The motto of the college is \"Non Satis Scire\", which is Latin for \"to know is not enough\".\nHistory.\nHampshire was created in 1965 by four other colleges as an experiment in higher education. The campus opened and the first class of students arrived in 1970. The Presidents of Amherst College, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Massachusetts got together in the 1950s and early 1960s and realized that there were things their own schools did not do very well. They also thought that the world was changing a lot and needed a college where students would have a lot of responsibility for their own education to be successful in the future.\nFranklin Patterson and Charles Longsworth were chosen by these schools and wrote a book called \"The Making of a College\" that said how Hampshire was to be run and what kind of programs it would offer. Today, this book is considered an inspirational document by Hampshire students and faculty who try to live up to its ideals.\nProgram.\nHampshire College describes itself as an experimenting college because it is always changing and improving how it does things, rather than doing the same thing as other colleges. Students usually do individual projects in order to move towards graduation. There is some required coursework, but it is not the main point of the school. Students also do not receive grades for completing their work. Instead, they get something called a \"narrative evaluation\", which is a long written explanation of what they did right and what they did wrong. There are also no specific required classes for graduation, but students must take classes in different areas depending on where they are in their studies.\nThe program is divided into three \"Divisions\" rather than four years, and students complete each Division as they show that they are capable of harder work. Most students graduate in four years, but not everyone takes the same amount of time for each Division.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":31},{"uri":"Amherst%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Amherst, Massachusetts","offset":42},{"uri":"Ralph_Hexter","surface_form":"Ralph Hexter","offset":106},{"uri":"Motto","surface_form":"motto","offset":124},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":176},{"uri":"1965","surface_form":"1965","offset":245},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":372},{"uri":"Amherst_College","surface_form":"Amherst College","offset":396},{"uri":"Smith_College","surface_form":"Smith College","offset":413},{"uri":"Mount_Holyoke_College","surface_form":"Mount Holyoke College","offset":428},{"uri":"University_of_Massachusetts","surface_form":"University of Massachusetts","offset":459}]}
