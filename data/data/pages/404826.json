{"id":404826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people","text":"The Jewish belief of Jews as a chosen people is that Jews are the chosen people of God. Jews believe that God has given them a special job to repair the world. Their job is to make the world a better place with more good in it. They must use the things in the world to increase good and come closer to God. They call this \u201C\"tikkun olam\"\u201D \u2013 repairing the world. Jews see themselves as God\u2019s partner to repair the world in any way they can \u2013 to find ways to lessen suffering of people and animals, to make more peace and respect between people, and to protect the earth\u2019s environment from destruction.\nFrom the Bible.\nJews believe that God made an agreement called a \u201Ccovenant\u201D with Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish people. The Bible says that God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants if they worshipped God and were faithful to him. God made this covenant with Abraham's son, Isaac, and with Isaac's son, Jacob. God also gave Jacob another name \u2013 Israel. This is how Jacob\u2019s descendants got the name the \u201CChildren of Israel\u201D or \u201CIsraelites.\u201D God later gave the Israelites the Torah to the Israelites through their leader, Moses. The Torah told the Israelites how to live and build their community. God gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and other laws in the Torah.\nThe Jews are sometimes called the \u201CChosen People.\u201D This is because the Bible says God told them \u201Cyou will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\u201D (Exodus 19:6) and \u201CFor you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord chose you to be His own special nation out of all peoples on the earth\u201D (Deuteronomy 14:2). Jews understand this means that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by God. For example, Jews must build a just society and serve only God. Jews believe that this covenant works in two ways: if they follow God\u2019s laws, He will give them his love and protection, but they are also responsible for their sins \u2013 bad actions \u2013 and not doing what God told them. Jews believe that they must teach other people that God exists and that God wants all people to do good actions. Jews believe that their job in the world is to be \"a light to the nations\" (Isiah 49:6) by showing the people of the world ways to make the world a better place.\nModern views.\nThe idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other is that the Israelites chose God. Another opinion is that even though the Jews chose to follow God, the Kabbalah and Tanya teach that even prior to creation, the \"Jewish soul\" was already chosen.\nJews do not try to convince other people to believe in Judaism. Jews believe they have a special job to show all peoples that God exists, but people do not have to be Jewish to follow God. All people can serve God by following the Seven Commandments (rules) given to Noah. But, Judaism accepts people who choose to change their religion to Judaism.\nFrom other religions.\nO children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation. (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).\nMany Christians also believe that the Jews were God's chosen people (), but because of Jewish rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status (). This doctrine is known as Supersessionism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":4},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":53},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":83},{"uri":"Special","surface_form":"special","offset":127},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":135},{"uri":"Repair","surface_form":"repair","offset":142},{"uri":"Better","surface_form":"better","offset":193},{"uri":"Increase","surface_form":"increase","offset":269},{"uri":"Partner","surface_form":"partner","offset":390},{"uri":"Lessen","surface_form":"lessen","offset":456},{"uri":"Suffering","surface_form":"suffering","offset":463},{"uri":"Respect","surface_form":"respect","offset":519},{"uri":"Protect","surface_form":"protect","offset":550},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":570},{"uri":"Destruction","surface_form":"destruction","offset":587},{"uri":"Believe","surface_form":"believe","offset":621},{"uri":"Agreement","surface_form":"agreement","offset":646},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":681},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":694},{"uri":"Promise","surface_form":"promised","offset":749},{"uri":"Bless","surface_form":"bless","offset":761},{"uri":"Descendant","surface_form":"descendants","offset":783},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worshipped","offset":803},{"uri":"Faithful","surface_form":"faithful","offset":827},{"uri":"Israelite","surface_form":"Israelite","offset":1040},{"uri":"Torah","surface_form":"Torah","offset":1087},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":1133},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":1198},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":1237},{"uri":"Sometimes","surface_form":"sometimes","offset":1296},{"uri":"Choose","surface_form":"Chosen","offset":1318},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":1400},{"uri":"Holy","surface_form":"holy","offset":1425},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":1430},{"uri":"Special","surface_form":"special","offset":1542},{"uri":"Duty","surface_form":"duties","offset":1660},{"uri":"Responsibility","surface_form":"responsibilities","offset":1671},{"uri":"Command","surface_form":"commanded","offset":1688},{"uri":"Build","surface_form":"build","offset":1729},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"just","offset":1737},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":1742},{"uri":"Serve","surface_form":"serve","offset":1754},{"uri":"Agreement","surface_form":"covenant","offset":1793},{"uri":"Protection","surface_form":"protection","offset":1879},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":1931},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":2123},{"uri":"Show","surface_form":"showing","offset":2190},{"uri":"Way","surface_form":"ways","offset":2222},{"uri":"Better","surface_form":"better","offset":2247},{"uri":"Israelites","surface_form":"Israelites","offset":2384},{"uri":"Kabbalah","surface_form":"Kabbalah","offset":2516},{"uri":"Tanya","surface_form":"Tanya","offset":2529},{"uri":"Convince","surface_form":"convince","offset":2627},{"uri":"Exist","surface_form":"exists","offset":2738},{"uri":"Follow","surface_form":"follow","offset":2785},{"uri":"Seven_Commandments_of_the_Children_of_Noah","surface_form":"Seven Commandments (rules) given to Noah","offset":2839},{"uri":"Accept","surface_form":"accepts","offset":2894},{"uri":"Choose","surface_form":"choose","offset":2913},{"uri":"Religious_conversion","surface_form":"change their religion","offset":2923},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":3117},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":3219},{"uri":"Supersessionism","surface_form":"Supersessionism","offset":3308}]}
