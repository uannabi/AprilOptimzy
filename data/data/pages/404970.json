{"id":404970,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","text":"e=\"preserve\">Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (which is also known as \"B-cell\" and \"T-cell lymphomas\") is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. It is also part of the immune system. Clear fluid called \"lymph\" flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as \"lymphocytes\".\nIn lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way. A lot of them appear in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nThe usual way to know that a person has non-Hodgkin lymphoma is to do a biopsy (testing a sample of affected lymph node tissue).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lymphoma","surface_form":"lymphoma","offset":25},{"uri":"Lymphatic_system","surface_form":"lymphatic system","offset":110},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":177},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":235},{"uri":"White_blood_cell","surface_form":"white blood cell","offset":345},{"uri":"Lymphocyte","surface_form":"lymphocyte","offset":373},{"uri":"Lymph_node","surface_form":"lymph node","offset":531},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":589},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":676},{"uri":"Neck_(body_part)","surface_form":"neck","offset":763},{"uri":"Armpit","surface_form":"armpit","offset":769},{"uri":"Groin","surface_form":"groin","offset":779},{"uri":"Biopsy","surface_form":"biopsy","offset":858}]}
