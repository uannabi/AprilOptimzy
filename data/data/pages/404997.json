{"id":404997,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy%21_Tournament_of_Champions","text":"The \"Jeopardy!\" Tournament of Champions is a yearly tournament on the American television game show \"Jeopardy!\". It features 15 players who have won the most games from the past season. It started in 1964 when Art Fleming was host of the show; it is also played on the show now with Alex Trebek as host. With Trebek as host, winners of the College Championship and the Teachers Tournament also play in the Tournament of Champions.\n\"Jeopardy!s Tournament of Champions takes two weeks. The first five games are the quarterfinals, with three new contestants each day. The winners of the five games move on to the semi-finals. The four players with the highest scores who did not win their quarterfinal game also move on as \"wild card\" players. If there is a tie at the end of a game, a Final Jeopardy!-type answer is given, and the first player to ring in with the correct response wins the game. If all three players have a score of zero, none of the players move on to the semi-finals, and another wild card spot is added. The next three games are the semi-final games. The three winners of the semi-finals move on to the finals, which happens over two games and two days. In each finals game, the players start with zero scores; after the second finals game, each player's score is added to their score from the first game, with the highest score being the winner, or \"Grand Champion.\" The other two players win smaller cash prizes or their two-day total, whichever is higher.\nFrom time to time, special Tournaments of Champions have been played. In 2002, the show held a Million Dollar Masters tournament. This was a two-week tournament where the winner won $1,000,000. It was taped at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. In 2005, the show held an Ultimate Tournament of Champions. It was a 15-week tournament with 145 players. The two players who made it to the finals would play against Ken Jennings for $2,000,000.\nList of participants.\nThe following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Prize amounts for the non-winning finalists who won more than the minimum guarantees are as indicated in parentheses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":52},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":79},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":90},{"uri":"Jeopardy%21","surface_form":"Jeopardy!","offset":101},{"uri":"Art_Fleming","surface_form":"Art Fleming","offset":210},{"uri":"Alex_Trebek","surface_form":"Alex Trebek","offset":283},{"uri":"Jeopardy%21_College_Championship","surface_form":"College Championship","offset":340},{"uri":"Jeopardy%21_Teachers_Tournament","surface_form":"Teachers Tournament","offset":369},{"uri":"Radio_City_Music_Hall","surface_form":"Radio City Music Hall","offset":1687},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1712},{"uri":"Jeopardy%21_Ultimate_Tournament_of_Champions","surface_form":"Ultimate Tournament of Champions","offset":1753},{"uri":"Ken_Jennings","surface_form":"Ken Jennings","offset":1894}]}
