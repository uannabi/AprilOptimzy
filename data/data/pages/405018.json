{"id":405018,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive","text":"The Tet Offensive was a military campaign during the Vietnam War. It was started on 30 January 1968 by communist forces of the Viet Cong and North Vietnam against South Vietnam, the United States and their allies.\nThe purpose of it was to surprise the enemy with attacks against military and civilian commands and control centers in South Vietnam.\nEventually, the US and South Vietnam fought off the communist forces and won a military victory. However, the Tet Offensive was when the majority of Americans went from supporting the US fighting in Vietnam to standing against it. This was because the US military and government told its own citizens that the US was close to winning, but the Tet Offensive disproved that. It was said that it was during the Tet Offensive where the US won the battle but lost the war.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":53},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":103},{"uri":"Viet_Cong","surface_form":"Viet Cong","offset":127},{"uri":"North_Vietnam","surface_form":"North Vietnam","offset":141},{"uri":"South_Vietnam","surface_form":"South Vietnam","offset":163},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":182},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":603},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":616},{"uri":"Citizenship","surface_form":"citizens","offset":640}]}
