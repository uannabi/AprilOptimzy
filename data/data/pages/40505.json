{"id":40505,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_disjunction","text":"Exclusive disjunction (also called exclusive or, XOR) is a logic operation on two values. It is often represented by the symbol formula_1 (or formula_1). It will be true, if exactly one of the two values is true. Otherwise, it will be false. This also means that the result of 'XOR' will be true precisely both the values are different. Same values will result in a false.\nThe best way to remember a XOR operation is: \"One or the other, but not both\".\nBecause of that, this is different from inclusive disjunction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":59},{"uri":"Operation","surface_form":"operation","offset":65},{"uri":"Value","surface_form":"value","offset":82},{"uri":"Difference","surface_form":"different","offset":477},{"uri":"Inclusive_disjunction","surface_form":"inclusive disjunction","offset":492}]}
