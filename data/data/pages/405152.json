{"id":405152,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_the_River_and_Through_the_Wood","text":"\"Over the River and Through the Wood\" is a Thanksgiving poem by Lydia Maria Child. It appeared in the second volume of her \"Flowers for Children\" in 1844. The original title of the poem is, \"The New-England Boy's Song About Thanksgiving Day\".\nBoston College writes: \"Starting with the familiar line, \"Over the river and through the wood\", this poem is easily Child\u2019s most famous work. Child never revised the poem herself, but the verses changed over time, especially when they were set to music.\nWith its bouncing rhythms and high spirits, the poem draws on the writer\u2019s childhood memories of visiting her grandfather\u2019s house on Thanksgiving. Having gained notoriety for her ideas about race, Child kept her antislavery ideals out of this volume in an effort to avoid controversy and boost sales. \"Flowers for Children\" contains only two stories involving race, and they both avoid addressing racial prejudice head on. In this nostalgic poem, Child takes us back to the simple pleasures of a family holiday.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thanksgiving","surface_form":"Thanksgiving","offset":43},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":56},{"uri":"Lydia_Maria_Child","surface_form":"Lydia Maria Child","offset":64}]}
