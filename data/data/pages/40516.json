When he was ill he had more leisure to write music. He used to tell his friends: \u201CPlease do not say: \u2018I hope you are well\u2019, please say: \u2018I hope you are ill\u2019\u201D. Borodin\u2019s most famous opera is called \"Prince Igor\". He wrote many fine songs, chamber music and orchestral music, including two symphonies. The Nocturne from his String quartet no 2 is especially well-known.\nIn his music, Borodin showed Russian power and the heoric characters. His main means of expression was melody.\nWhen he was young he learned French, Swedish and English, but later Italian.\nBorodin died of a heart attack.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"St._Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":38},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":116},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":169},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":192},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"Professor","offset":227},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"Chemistry","offset":240},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":504},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":554},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber music","offset":561},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":579},{"uri":"Symphony","surface_form":"symphonies","offset":611},{"uri":"Nocturne","surface_form":"Nocturne","offset":627},{"uri":"String_quartet","surface_form":"String quartet","offset":645},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":897}]}
