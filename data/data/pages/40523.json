{"id":40523,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion","text":"Corrosion is the breakdown of materials due to chemical reactions. It is usually oxidation with air molecules and often in the presence of water. Corrosion also occurs when an acidic or basic material touches another material. When a material corrodes, its physical properties change. Problems with corrosion are mostly with metal, though other materials can corrode. Corrosion is a form of erosion. Some materials, such as stainless steel, are highly resistant to corrosion.\nOne form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes, which under certain circumstances reduces wear.\nIron corrosion is called rusting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":30},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":47},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":81},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":96},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":100},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":139},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":176},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":325},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":391},{"uri":"Stainless_steel","surface_form":"stainless steel","offset":424},{"uri":"Compacted_oxide_layer_glaze","surface_form":"compacted oxide layer glaze","offset":544},{"uri":"Rust","surface_form":"rust","offset":647}]}
