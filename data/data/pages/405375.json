It was developed by SuperBot Entertainment and published by Sony Computer Entertainment America. It was released in North America on November 20, 2012, in Europe on November 21, 2012, and in Japan on January 31, 2013.\nGameplay.\nThe game plays similar to Nintendo's \"Super Smash Bros.\" series. The point of the game is to beat the character(s) you are fighting by knocking them off of the stage. During a match, players can collect orbs that are in a stage. Collecting orbs builds up a power meter that is at the bottom of the screen. When a player is hit, their meter goes down. When the meter is full, the player can use one of three very powerful attacks that can be used to beat opponents and get points. Up to four players can battle with characters from Sony's video games, including \"God of War\", \"Sly Cooper\" and \"PaRappa the Rapper\".\nItems.\nThere are many different items from Sony's different series that can be picked up and used by players. They can be used by players to do better in the match or hurt opponents.\nStages.\nThere are 14 stages in the game. Each stage is based on a combination of two games. For example, the stage \"Stowaways\" is based on the games \"Uncharted\" and \"Bioshock Infinite\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_crossover","surface_form":"crossover","offset":43},{"uri":"Fighting_game","surface_form":"fighting","offset":53},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":62},{"uri":"PlayStation_3","surface_form":"PlayStation 3","offset":81},{"uri":"PlayStation_Vita","surface_form":"PlayStation Vita","offset":99},{"uri":"Sony_Computer_Entertainment_America","surface_form":"Sony Computer Entertainment America","offset":191},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":247},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":286},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":322},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":385},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._(series)","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.","offset":397},{"uri":"Orb","surface_form":"orb","offset":562},{"uri":"PaRappa_the_Rapper","surface_form":"PaRappa the Rapper","offset":952}]}
