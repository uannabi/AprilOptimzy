{"id":4054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise","text":"=\"preserve\">When a person agrees to do something or to \"not\" do something, that person is making a promise. A promise can be made (by saying it), or it can be written down as a contract. \"Breaking\" a promise, or not keeping it, is often just bad manners, but it can sometimes be illegal, such as when a contract is not kept.\nA vow is a special promise. It is mostly used in a religious sense or in ceremonies such as marriages when the couple who are being married make their \"marriage vows\", promising to be faithful to one another.\nAn oath is a promise in the legal sense. When someone has to give evidence in a court of law they \"swear an oath\". This means that they promise they will tell the truth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":19},{"uri":"Agreement","surface_form":"agrees","offset":26},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"written","offset":159},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":177},{"uri":"Manners","surface_form":"manners","offset":246},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":279},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":376},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremonies","offset":398},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":417},{"uri":"Faithful","surface_form":"faithful","offset":509},{"uri":"Oath","surface_form":"oath","offset":537},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":562},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":600},{"uri":"Court_of_law","surface_form":"court of law","offset":614},{"uri":"Truth","surface_form":"truth","offset":697}]}
