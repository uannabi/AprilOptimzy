It is the smallest type of mutation possible.\nA nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a DNA sequence that leads to an early stop codon. This appears as a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA. Most of the time, the protein that is translated from this mRNA does not work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":77},{"uri":"Stop_codon","surface_form":"stop codon","offset":177},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcribed","offset":229},{"uri":"MRNA","surface_form":"mRNA","offset":241},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":269},{"uri":"Translation_(genetics)","surface_form":"translated","offset":285}]}
