{"id":405482,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasaloppet","text":"Vasaloppet is an annual cross-country skiing competition in Sweden. It started off in 1922 and has been a part of Worldloppet as long as Worldloppet has been around. Nowadays it is held the first Sunday in March each year.\nThe competition runs from S\u00E4len to Mora. Women were banned from participating between 1924 and 1980, due to the length of the race (90 kilometers). In 1997, an official women's award was established.\nThe race is held to commemorate the historical events related to Gustav Vasa back in the early 1520's.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cross-country_skiing","surface_form":"cross-country skiing","offset":24},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":60},{"uri":"1922","surface_form":"1922","offset":86},{"uri":"Worldloppet_Ski_Federation","surface_form":"Worldloppet","offset":114},{"uri":"Sunday","surface_form":"Sunday","offset":196},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":206},{"uri":"S%C3%A4len","surface_form":"S\u00E4len","offset":249},{"uri":"Mora","surface_form":"Mora","offset":258},{"uri":"1924","surface_form":"1924","offset":309},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":318},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":374},{"uri":"Gustav_Vasa","surface_form":"Gustav Vasa","offset":488},{"uri":"1520%27s","surface_form":"1520's","offset":518}]}
