{"id":405673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun","text":"The M134 Minigun is an American 7.62x51mm six-barreled machine gun. Its rate of fire is 2000 to 6000 rounds (bullets) per minute. It is called \"mini\" as compared to the earlier, much bigger M61 Vulcan.\nIn movies and video games, the Minigun is sometimes called the chaingun, but this is a mistake. The chaingun is actually a completely different gun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":55},{"uri":"Rate_of_fire","surface_form":"rate of fire","offset":72},{"uri":"M61_Vulcan","surface_form":"M61 Vulcan","offset":190},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movies","offset":205},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video games","offset":216},{"uri":"Chaingun","surface_form":"chaingun","offset":302},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":346}]}
