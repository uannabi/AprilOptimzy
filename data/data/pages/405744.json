{"id":405744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term minority rights refers to the rights of minority groups. This includes the individual rights of a group's members and the collective rights of the group itself. These groups can be racial, ethnic, class, religious, linguistic or sexual minorities.\nFor the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protects their identities. For people with disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities exists to protect them, and for LGBT people, the Yogyakarta Principles were written down by the United Nations.\nAlso, the Council of Europe, European Union and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also affirm protection of minority rights as part of human rights and the rule of law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":52},{"uri":"Minority_group","surface_form":"minority group","offset":62},{"uri":"Race","surface_form":"racial","offset":203},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic","offset":211},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"class","offset":219},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":226},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"linguistic","offset":237},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"sexual minorities","offset":251},{"uri":"Ethnic","surface_form":"ethnic","offset":288},{"uri":"International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights","surface_form":"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights","offset":351},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disabilities","offset":447},{"uri":"Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","surface_form":"Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","offset":465},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":551},{"uri":"Yogyakarta_Principles","surface_form":"Yogyakarta Principles","offset":568},{"uri":"Council_of_Europe","surface_form":"Council of Europe","offset":641},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":660},{"uri":"Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe","surface_form":"Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe","offset":679},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":785},{"uri":"Rule_of_law","surface_form":"rule of law","offset":806}]}
