It is sometimes used to describe a hatred of the religion and its followers. \"Islamophobia\" can supposedly take the form of criticisms against certain ideological positions taken by believers but almost always state the religion itself as the actual problem.\nA study found that Muslim women experienced Islamophobic attacks more often than Muslim men, but almost all are committed by Muslim men.\nIn France it is illegal for Muslim women to wear veils (burkas and niqabs) that cover their faces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":114},{"uri":"Hatred","surface_form":"hatred","offset":158},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticism","offset":247},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideological","offset":274},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":373},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":522},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":535},{"uri":"Burka","surface_form":"burka","offset":575},{"uri":"Niq%C4%81b","surface_form":"niqabs","offset":586}]}
