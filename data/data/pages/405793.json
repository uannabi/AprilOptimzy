As a young man and an employee of the Schubert Theater in Chicago, Illinois, his carelessness with a lit cigarette caused a gasoline explosion that burned off his face.\nAfter a year in hospital and then a stay in a nursing home, Alexander began wearing a mask and joined a Peter Kortes sideshow. Alexander would tell his story to the audience then remove his mask. It was a shocking exhibition. Alexander was made the blow off for the show.\nAlexander went on to work with Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey. At Madison Square Garden in the 1960s, ladies were so shocked by his face he was ordered off the stage. He later worked with the Clyde Beatty Circus. He later started his own sideshow company. Alexander had 72 operations throughout his life to repair his face, all were unsuccessful. Eventually, he decided the remaining years of his life were not best spent behind the mask. He died in 1997.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sideshow","surface_form":"sideshow","offset":50},{"uri":"Stage_name","surface_form":"stage name","offset":75},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":174},{"uri":"Cigarette","surface_form":"cigarette","offset":221},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"gasoline","offset":240},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":301},{"uri":"Nursing_home","surface_form":"nursing home","offset":331},{"uri":"Mask","surface_form":"mask","offset":371},{"uri":"Madison_Square_Garden","surface_form":"Madison Square Garden","offset":630}]}
