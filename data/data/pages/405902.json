{"id":405902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function","text":"In mathematics a holomorphic function is a function that is defined on the complex numbers, and that can be differentiated everywhere where it is defined. Differentiating the function again leads to a function defined on the complex numbers. In older literature, these functions are sometimes called \"regular\".\nHolomorphic functions show a number of properties function defined on real numbers do not have.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":43},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":75},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":381}]}
