{"id":40596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede","text":"A centipede is a type of myriapod with many legs. Centipedes are predators. They hunt during the night; they are nocturnal. Some centipedes are venomous, but none can kill a person unless they are allergic. Centipedes are in the class Chilopoda, and related to millipedes, which are not poisonous. As the millipedes, they are segmented. They have between 5 and 173 segments, but only one pair of legs per segment. There may be 8,000 species in the world.\nThe house centipede is a carnivore that feeds on cockroaches, house flies and other domestic pests. It is therefore beneficial. But because it has a scary appearance it is often exterminated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Myriapod","surface_form":"myriapod","offset":25},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":65},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":113},{"uri":"Venomous","surface_form":"venomous","offset":144},{"uri":"Allergy","surface_form":"allergic","offset":197},{"uri":"Millipede","surface_form":"millipede","offset":261},{"uri":"Segmented","surface_form":"segmented","offset":326},{"uri":"House_centipede","surface_form":"house centipede","offset":459},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":480},{"uri":"Cockroach","surface_form":"cockroach","offset":504},{"uri":"Musca","surface_form":"house flies","offset":517},{"uri":"Pest","surface_form":"pest","offset":548}]}
