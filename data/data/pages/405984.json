{"id":405984,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_duck","text":"The Labrador duck (\"Camptorhynchus labradorius\") is an extinct duck that lived in North America.\nHabitat.\nThe Labrador duck lived along the sandy coasts and bays of New Jersey and New England. Audubon's son reported seeing a nest belonging to the species. Some believe that it may have laid its eggs on the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was a rare bird before European settlement, and the increase in humans probably finished it off.\nExtinction.\nThe duck became extinct after settlers became common along the eastern coast of North America. The reasons are not clear. The duck was eaten, although its flesh tasted bad. its eggs were probably harvested. It depended considerably on shellfish, which humans may have eaten in large quantities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":55},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":63},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":82},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":165},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":180},{"uri":"Audubon","surface_form":"Audubon","offset":193},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":225},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence","surface_form":"Gulf of Saint Lawrence","offset":322},{"uri":"Shellfish","surface_form":"shellfish","offset":693}]}
