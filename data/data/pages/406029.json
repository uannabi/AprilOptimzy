It was established in 1970, and is the oldest such theater and club in the United States of America. It is located at 1349 N. Wells St. in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood.\nIn January 1970, the Bijou opened on the first floor of a four story Victorian. The first movie shown was Richard Nixon's Checkers speech, named after Nixon's dog Checkers. The movie that followed was a gay porn movie.\nIn 1980, the Bijou expanded to the second floor, where a sexual playground was established. On this floor are booths, glory holes, a dungeon with slings, and a Saint Andrew's cross. The same year, the back yard was overhauled for summer frolicking. The Bijou was opened 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In 1984, the Bijou expanded to the third floor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":36},{"uri":"Adult_theater","surface_form":"adult theater","offset":40},{"uri":"Sex_club","surface_form":"sex club","offset":58},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":70},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":164},{"uri":"Victorian_era","surface_form":"Victorian","offset":330},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":367},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":464},{"uri":"Porn_movie","surface_form":"porn movie","offset":468},{"uri":"Glory_hole","surface_form":"glory hole","offset":598},{"uri":"Dungeon","surface_form":"dungeon","offset":613},{"uri":"Saint_Andrew%27s_cross","surface_form":"Saint Andrew's cross","offset":640}]}
