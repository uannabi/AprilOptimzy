{"id":406088,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder","text":"Schizoid personality disorder is a Cluster A personality disorder which involves not being interested in social relationships, tendency toward a solitary lifestyle, being secretive and being emotionally cold.\nThis condition is by no means the same as schizophrenia. People with SzPD will typically share some of the negative symptoms and characteristics of schizophrenia, such as blunted affect or detachment. However, schizoids do not have the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations.\nPeople who have SzPD do not want interpersonal relationships which require emotion and commitment. People with SzPD are introverts who feel the need to be independent or alone. Many schizoids are asexual or have little interest in sexual encounters. Any relationships they may have likely do not involve emotional attachment. SzPD is more common in men than women.\nSome of the negative symptoms of the disorder (such as low energy) may be treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs.\nTheodore Millon said that there are four types of schizoid: languid, remote, depersonalized, and affectless.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Personality_disorder","surface_form":"personality disorder","offset":45},{"uri":"Solitary","surface_form":"solitary","offset":145},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":251},{"uri":"Negative_symptom","surface_form":"negative symptom","offset":316},{"uri":"Detachment","surface_form":"detachment","offset":398},{"uri":"Positive_symptoms","surface_form":"positive symptoms","offset":445},{"uri":"Hallucination","surface_form":"hallucination","offset":488},{"uri":"Interpersonal_relationship","surface_form":"interpersonal relationship","offset":537},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":579},{"uri":"Introvert","surface_form":"introvert","offset":624},{"uri":"Asexual","surface_form":"asexual","offset":700},{"uri":"Antipsychotic","surface_form":"antipsychotic","offset":965},{"uri":"Theodore_Millon","surface_form":"Theodore Millon","offset":986}]}
