{"id":406166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD","text":"Antoni Gaud\u00ED i Cornet (25 June 1852 \u2013 10 June 1926) was a Spanish architect. He was born in Reus, in Catalonia, and became a leader of Catalan modernism. Gaud\u00ED's works are in his own style. Most are in the Catalan capital of Barcelona, especially his greatest work, the Sagrada Fam\u00EDlia.\nHe got some ideas from neo-Gothic art, Art Deco and Oriental techniques, and became part of the modernist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nBetween 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The seven works were: the Park G\u00FCell, the Palau G\u00FCell and the Casa Mil\u00E0; the Nativity facade, the crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Fam\u00EDlia, the Casa Vicens and the Casa Batll\u00F3 in Barcelona, and the crypt of the Col\u00F2nia G\u00FCell in Santa Coloma de Cervell\u00F3.\nGaud\u00ED's Roman Catholic faith grew during his life, and religious images are found in his work. This earned him the nickname \"God's Architect\", and eventually led to his beatification in 2011.\nHis work had a style inspired by nature. Gaud\u00ED rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he was conceiving them.\nGaud\u00ED died on 10 June 1926 in Barcelona, Spain, after being hit by a tram, aged 73.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spaniards","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":58},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":66},{"uri":"Reus","surface_form":"Reus","offset":92},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonia","offset":101},{"uri":"Modernism","surface_form":"modernism","offset":143},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":225},{"uri":"Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia","surface_form":"Sagrada Fam\u00EDlia","offset":270},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"neo-Gothic art","offset":310},{"uri":"Art_Deco","surface_form":"Art Deco","offset":326},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Sites","surface_form":"World Heritage Sites","offset":501},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":525},{"uri":"Crypt","surface_form":"crypt","offset":631},{"uri":"Santa_Coloma_de_Cervell%C3%B3","surface_form":"Santa Coloma de Cervell\u00F3","offset":762},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":796},{"uri":"Beatification","surface_form":"beatification","offset":957},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":1217},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"tram","offset":1256}]}
