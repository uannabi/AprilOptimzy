It has been in existence since 1912. Paramount is owned by media conglomerate ViacomCBS. Paramount is one of the Big Five movie studios\nHistory.\nParamount Pictures Inc. can trace its beginnings to the creation in May, 1912 of the Famous Players Film Company. Organized in 1914 by a Utah theater owner, W. W. Hodkinson, Paramount Pictures was the first successful nationwide distributor. Until this time, movies were sold on a statewide or regional basis. This was inefficient and costly to producers.\nIn 1916, Adolph Zukor created a three-way merger of his Famous Players Film Company, Jesse L. Lasky's Lasky Feature Play Company, and Paramount. The new company was called Famous Players-Lasky and grew quickly. Lasky ran the production side. Hiram Abrams was in charge of distribution and Zukor handled the business side of the company.\nIn 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took on the name Paramount-Famous Lasky Corporation. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix theater chain, it was later known as Paramount-Publix Corporation. The company went into bankruptcy in 1933. When the company emerged from bankruptcy, it was known as Paramount Pictures, Inc.\nParamount Pictures had been an early supporter of television. It created stations in 1939 in Los Angeles (later to become KTLA) and Chicago's WBKB.\nFrom the 1980s to the present day.\nParamount's successful run of lightweight pictures in the 1980s and 1990s created hits like \"Flashdance\", the \"Friday the 13th\" series; \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Beverly Hills Cop\" and the \"Star Trek\" features.\nIn 1993, entertainment conglomerate Viacom made a bought Paramount.\nParamount is the last major movie studio located in Hollywood. Other studios such as Warner Brothers and Columbia moved to Burbank, California.\nOn December 11, 2005, Paramount said it had purchased DreamWorks SKG in a deal worth $1.6 billion. On February 1, 2006, the studio announced that the DreamWorks acquisition was completed.\nIn March 2010, Paramount started Insurge Pictures, a low-budget label.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Production_company","surface_form":"production","offset":24},{"uri":"Distribution_company","surface_form":"distribution company","offset":39},{"uri":"Movie_studio","surface_form":"movie studio","offset":78},{"uri":"ViacomCBS","surface_form":"ViacomCBS","offset":191},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":395},{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"theater","offset":400},{"uri":"Adolph_Zukor","surface_form":"Adolph Zukor","offset":623},{"uri":"Merger","surface_form":"merger","offset":656},{"uri":"Jesse_L._Lasky","surface_form":"Jesse L.
