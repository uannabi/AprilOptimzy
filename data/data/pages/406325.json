{"id":406325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury","text":"History.\nThe treasury as a place to keep the king's (or city's) gold and valuables has a long history. The winners in a war would take back whatever they wanted, and slaves and booty were top of the list. The first recorded booty in history is a stele taken during 1160\u00A0BC.\nThe earliest found artefacts made of silver and gold are from Lake Varna in Bulgaria dated 4250\u20134000\u00A0BC, the earliest made of copper are dated 9000\u20137000\u00A0BC.\nThe term \"treasury\" was first used in classical antiquity to describe the places built for gifts to the gods. An example is the Siphnian Treasury in Delphi. Many similar buildings were put up in Olympia, Greece by city-states hoping to impress others during the ancient Olympic Games. In Ancient Greece treasuries were almost always inside religious buildings such as temples. This made state funds sacrosanct, and adding moral constraints to the punishment for thieves.\nThe sovereigns' treasury in the palace in ancient Jerusalem,was similar in nature to the temple treasury. Those treasuries had officials, and worked rather like a bank.\nIn excavations of Persopolis a text about to the activities of a treasury were discovered. It dates to the fifth century BC. The texts were written in the Elamite language.\nThe ancient Roman word \"aerarium\" signified the treasury of the Senate, \"fiscus\" was used to indicate the imperial treasury used by Caesar.\nThey had, as we do, the distinction between a treasury as a store of valuables, and the treasury as an office of finance.\nH.M. Treasury.\nIn the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Treasury is overseen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The traditional honorary title of First Lord of the Treasury is held by the Prime Minister. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs administers the taxation system.\nIn the United States, the Treasurer reports to an executive-appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The IRS is the revenue agency of the US Department of the Treasury.\nMinistry of Finance.\nIn many other countries, the treasury is called the Ministry of Finance. Its head is known as the Finance Minister. Examples include New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Japan.\nBoth.\nIn some other countries, a Treasury will co-exist with a separate Ministry of Finance, with divided functions.\nThe government of Poland includes the Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministry of State Treasury, as does the government of the Ukraine. It was the same in Italy before the creation of the united Ministry of Economy. In the Australian federal government a treasurer and a finance minister co-exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slaves","surface_form":"slaves","offset":166},{"uri":"Stele","surface_form":"stele","offset":246},{"uri":"Lake_Varna","surface_form":"Lake Varna","offset":336},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":350},{"uri":"Classical_antiquity","surface_form":"classical antiquity","offset":469},{"uri":"Sacrifice","surface_form":"gifts to the gods","offset":522},{"uri":"Siphnian_Treasury","surface_form":"Siphnian Treasury","offset":559},{"uri":"Delphi","surface_form":"Delphi","offset":580},{"uri":"Olympia%2C_Greece","surface_form":"Olympia, Greece","offset":626},{"uri":"Ancient_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"ancient Olympic Games","offset":693},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":719},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":952},{"uri":"Elamite","surface_form":"Elamite","offset":1226},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1528},{"uri":"Her_Majesty%27s_Treasury","surface_form":"Her Majesty's Treasury","offset":1544},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor of the Exchequer","offset":1586},{"uri":"First_Lord_of_the_Treasury","surface_form":"First Lord of the Treasury","offset":1649},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":1691},{"uri":"Her_Majesty%27s_Revenue_and_Customs","surface_form":"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs","offset":1707},{"uri":"Taxation","surface_form":"taxation","offset":1757},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1781},{"uri":"Treasurer_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Treasurer","offset":1800},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury","surface_form":"Secretary of the Treasury","offset":1844},{"uri":"U.S._Internal_Revenue_Service","surface_form":"IRS","offset":1875},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury","surface_form":"US Department of the Treasury","offset":1908},{"uri":"Ministry_of_Finance","surface_form":"Ministry of Finance","offset":2012},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":2093},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":2106},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":2114},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":2124},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":2135},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":2147},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":2154},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2168},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":2310},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":2423},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":2451},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":2519}]}
