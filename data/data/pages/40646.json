{"id":40646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations","text":"e=\"preserve\">The order of operations is a mathematical and algebraic set of rules. It is used to evaluate (solve) and simplify expressions and equations. The order of operations is the order that different mathematical operations are done. The standard mathematical operations are addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (* or \u00D7), division (/), brackets (grouping symbols used to indicate order of operations like (), [] and) and exponentiation (^n or n, also called orders or indices).\nMathematicians have agreed on a correct order to use operations, and it is very important that they know these rules. When people are solving a problem with more than one operation, they will need to know the correct order to solve the problem correctly. Otherwise, the answer will be wrong.\nRules.\nFollow all the rules in this order from left to right in the equation.\nBrackets and indices.\nUse operations inside brackets and solve any indices. You should always solve brackets first when solving an equation.\nExponents.\nWhen seeing an exponent, solve it first after solving the brackets. (53 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125)\nMultiplication and division.\nSolve any multiplication and division in the problem. Note that multiplication does not precede division; this is a common mistake. Both are solved from left to right as they occur.\nAddition and subtraction.\nLastly, solve any addition or subtraction.\nAcronyms.\nThe acronyms for the order of standard operations are GEMDAS or PEMDAS, which means Grouping/Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiply & Divide and Add & Subtract.\nWhen solving 8 - 7 + 5, some people say that 7 + 5 must take precedence, but this is incorrect. Instead, one should look from left to right to find the correct answer. This rule also applies to multiplication and division.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":42},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":59},{"uri":"Simplify","surface_form":"simplify","offset":118},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"expressions and equations","offset":127},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":281},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtraction","offset":295},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":312},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"division","offset":337},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"exponentiation","offset":436}]}
