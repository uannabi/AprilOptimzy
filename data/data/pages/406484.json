{"id":406484,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Be_Not_Proud","text":"\"Death Be Not Proud\" is a poem written by John Donne about 1610. It was published in 1663, after his death.\nPoem.\nDeath, be not proud, though some have called thee\nMighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\nFor those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow\nDie not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.\nFrom rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,\nMuch pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,\nAnd soonest our best men with thee do go,\nRest of their bones, and soul's delivery.\nThou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\nAnd dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\nAnd poppy or charms can make us sleep as well\nAnd better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?\nOne short sleep past, we wake eternally,\nAnd death shall be no more, death, thou shalt die.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Donne","surface_form":"John Donne","offset":42}]}
