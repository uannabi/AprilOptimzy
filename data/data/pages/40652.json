{"id":40652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution","text":"A revolution is a very sharp change made to something. The word comes from Latin, and is related to the word \"revolutio\" (which means \"a turn around\").\nRevolutions are usually political in their nature. Some people feel unhappy with their lives, some are not happy with whole system<nowiki/>s. They might join together, share their ideas, and make something change. Often, revolutions include fighting, and civil unrest. But there are also revolutions that happen without fighting.\nThe Soviet Union was made by the Russian Revolution that killed millions, and later fell apart in a counterrevolution without much fighting. But in the French Revolution (1789), there was much bloodshed. The years right after this Revolution in France are often called the Reign of Terror.\nThe opposing idea in politics is called 'gradualism'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":75},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":176},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":276},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":486},{"uri":"Russian_Revolution","surface_form":"Russian Revolution","offset":515},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":634},{"uri":"Reign_of_Terror","surface_form":"Reign of Terror","offset":755},{"uri":"Gradualism","surface_form":"gradualism","offset":813}]}
