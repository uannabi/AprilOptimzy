{"id":406681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_1_(Canada)","text":"\"Big Brother 1\" was the first season of the Canadian reality television game show, \"Big Brother\". It is based on the Dutch language show of the same name. The show is produced by Endemol USA and Insight Productions. \"Big Brother 1\" aired on Slice on February 27, 2013. It lasted for 71 days. The first season ended on May 2, 2013. Over 10,000 people applied to be on the show. Only fourteen HouseGuests were needed. However, because a lot of people tried out for the show, producers allowed fifteen people to enter the house. In January 2013, Arisa Cox was announced to be the host of the show.\nJillian McLaughlin was the winner of the first season. Gary Levy was the runner-up in a controversial finale vote of 4-3. Juror Emerald \"Topaz\" Brady voted for McLaughlin by mistake. She begged for producers so she can change her vote, which they did not allowed.\nFormat.\n\"Big Brother 1\" was similar to that of the one featured in the US version. A group of people, known as \"HouseGuests\", compete to win the show. They vote each other off to be the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto has the ability to change the nominations. If they choose to do so, the HoH must nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees. The HouseGuest with the most votes is removed from the show. There was a twist for this season. A phone was placed in the house, and the first person to answer would receive a secret task.\nControversy.\nDuring the final vote Topaz Brady voted for Jillian McLaughlin instead of Gary Levy. She said that she mistakenly voted for Jillian. Topaz pleaded with show producers to allow her vote be changed. However, because of the rules she was not allowed to do so. Topaz's vote for Jillian helped her win \"Big Brother\". Gary was runner-up and said that he is happy for Jillian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":44},{"uri":"Reality_television","surface_form":"reality television","offset":53},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":72},{"uri":"Big_Brother_Canada","surface_form":"Big Brother","offset":84},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch language","offset":117},{"uri":"Big_Brother_(Netherlands)","surface_form":"of the same name","offset":137},{"uri":"Endemol_USA","surface_form":"Endemol USA","offset":179},{"uri":"Insight_Productions","surface_form":"Insight Productions","offset":195},{"uri":"Slice_(TV_channel)","surface_form":"Slice","offset":241},{"uri":"Arisa_Cox","surface_form":"Arisa Cox","offset":543},{"uri":"Gary_Levy","surface_form":"Gary Levy","offset":650},{"uri":"Big_Brother_(U.S.)","surface_form":"US version","offset":930},{"uri":"Gary_Levy","surface_form":"Gary Levy","offset":1654}]}
