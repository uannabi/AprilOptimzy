From 1961 to 1994, the head of state was called the State President.\nThe role as President of South Africa was originally founded to be different from being prime minister. The two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which calls for a four-year term of office. The 1993 and later constitutions limit the president's time in office to two five-year terms. The first President to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela. The current president is Cyril Ramaphosa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":53},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":71},{"uri":"Constitution_of_South_Africa","surface_form":"Constitution of South Africa","offset":100},{"uri":"State_President_of_South_Africa","surface_form":"State President","offset":182},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_South_Africa","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":287},{"uri":"Nelson_Mandela","surface_form":"Nelson Mandela","offset":557},{"uri":"Cyril_Ramaphosa","surface_form":"Cyril Ramaphosa","offset":598}]}
