{"id":406755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries","text":"The term dental caries refers to tooth decay or cavities in teeth. The decay is made by bacteria destroying parts of the tooth. Dental caries usually lead to substandard breath and bad taste. Personal hygiene caring consists of brushing and flossing daily.\nAfter enamel and dentin are destroyed and cavity reaches the dental pulp and nerves of the tooth, the tooth becomes sensitive since the nerves are exposed. Cavity may infect the jaw and sometimes cause a tooth abscess.\nIf carbohydrates remain in your mouth for enough time, caries-causing bacteria may form plaque on the tooth surface and attack the tooth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":88},{"uri":"Breath","surface_form":"breath","offset":170},{"uri":"Hygiene","surface_form":"hygiene","offset":201},{"uri":"Toothbrush","surface_form":"brushing","offset":228},{"uri":"Dental_floss","surface_form":"flossing","offset":241},{"uri":"Tooth_enamel","surface_form":"enamel","offset":263},{"uri":"Dentin","surface_form":"dentin","offset":274},{"uri":"Dental_pulp","surface_form":"dental pulp","offset":318},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":334},{"uri":"Abscess","surface_form":"abscess","offset":467},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":479},{"uri":"Plaque","surface_form":"plaque","offset":564}]}
