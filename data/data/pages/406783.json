{"id":406783,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility","text":"Marginal utility is a concept from economics that describes the change in utility from consuming more or less of a good or service. Economists sometimes speak of a law of diminishing marginal utility, meaning that consuming the first unit usually has a higher utility than every other unit. When the number of units that are consumed increases, their marginal utility decreases.\nThe more we have a commodity or a service, the less we want to have more of it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":35},{"uri":"Utility","surface_form":"utility","offset":74},{"uri":"Good_(economics)","surface_form":"good","offset":115},{"uri":"Service","surface_form":"service","offset":123}]}
