{"id":406912,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious neurological illness. It is a type of dyskinesia - a disorder that causes movements that happen over and over again, which a person cannot control. \"Tardive\" means these movements do not start right away, or they start slowly.\nTardive dyskinesia is usually caused by taking antipsychotic medicines in high doses, or for a long time. This happens more often with older antipsychotic medicines. Usually, tardive dyskinesia happens when these medicines are taken for many months or years. But some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking these medicines for only 6 weeks.\nCauses.\nNewer antipsychotic medicines (also called \"atypical antipsychotics\") are less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia, but they still can.\nWho gets tardive dyskinesia?\nNobody knows why some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking antipsychotic medicines while others do not. But there are certain groups of people who are more likely to get tardive dyskinesia. The longer a person has been on antipsychotic medicines, the more likely they are to get TD.\nSymptoms.\nOften, people with tardive dyskinesia also have akathisia. This is a constant urge to move, or always being restless.\nTreatment.\nDiagnosing tardive dyskinesia early is very important. Sometimes, if the drug that is causing TD is stopped early enough, the tardive dyskinesia will go away. This is more likely to happen if the TD is diagnosed soon after its symptoms start.\nSometimes, even if the medication is stopped, the tardive dyskinesia never goes away.\nIf a person with TD still needs antipsychotic medicines, a medication called clozapine (Clozaril) is the best choice. It is a newer antipsychotic, it often works well for schizophrenia that is hard to treat, and it has less of a risk of causing or worsening TD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurological","offset":50},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"illness","offset":63},{"uri":"Antipsychotic","surface_form":"antipsychotic","offset":324},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medicines","offset":338}]}
