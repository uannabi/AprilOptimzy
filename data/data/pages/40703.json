{"id":40703,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procaine","text":"=\"preserve\">Procaine is a analgesic drug. It is used primarily to reduce the pain of getting certain shots, and is also used by dentists. The drug is usually sold under the name Novocaine, or Novacaine.\nProcaine was first made in 1905, and was the first man-made pain-killer that could be taken as a shot. It was created by the German scientist Alfred Einhorn (1857-1917) who gave the chemical the name Novacaine, from the Latin word \"novus\" (which means new) and caine, as in \"cocaine.\"\nProcaine is not often used today because other safer and better working pain-killing drugs now exist. Prior to the discovery of procaine, cocaine was the most commonly used pain-killer. Procaine (like cocaine) has the advantage of reducing bleeding, unlike other pain-killers and without the dangerous qualities of cocaine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Analgesic","surface_form":"analgesic","offset":26},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":36},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":328},{"uri":"Alfred_Einhorn","surface_form":"Alfred Einhorn","offset":345},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":423},{"uri":"Cocaine","surface_form":"cocaine","offset":478}]}
