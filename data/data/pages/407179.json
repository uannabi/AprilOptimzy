{"id":407179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi","text":"The renminbi (RMB, \u00A5; code: CNY; also CN\u00A5, \u5143 and CN\u5143) is the currency of the People's Republic of China. It is the main currency used in mainland China. It is also sometimes accepted in Hong Kong and Macau, and can be easily exchanged in those territories. The currency is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. Its name means \"people's currency\" ().\nThe main unit of renminbi is the \"yu\u00E1n\" (/). One yuan is divided into 10 \"ji\u01CEo\" (). One ji\u01CEo is subdivided into 10 \"f\u0113n\" (\u4EFD). Renminbi banknotes are available in denominations from 1 jiao to 100 yuan (\u00A50.1\u2013100). Coins have denominations from 1 fen to 1 yuan (\u00A50.01\u20131). Therefore, some denominations exist in both coin and banknote form. Coins under \u00A50.1 are rarely used.\nCurrently, only \u00A520,000 can be taken in or out of China without declaring it, or telling customs that you have it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"ISO_4217","surface_form":"code","offset":22},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":61},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":77},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"mainland China","offset":137},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":186},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":200},{"uri":"Exchange_rate","surface_form":"exchanged","offset":225},{"uri":"Political_divisions_of_China","surface_form":"territories","offset":244},{"uri":"People%27s_Bank_of_China","surface_form":"People's Bank of China","offset":287},{"uri":"Chinese_yuan","surface_form":"yu\u00E1n","offset":417},{"uri":"Banknote","surface_form":"banknote","offset":518},{"uri":"Customs","surface_form":"customs","offset":843}]}
