{"id":407183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher","text":"The tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are a clade of passerine birds from the Americas. They are the largest family of birds on Earth, with more than 400 species. They are the most diverse family of birds in every country in South and Central America. They also live in North America.\nThe family is named after the Old World flycatchers. Some members have similar features to the Old World flycatchers, but they are not related to them. They are members of suborder Tyranni. They do not have the vocal capabilities of most other songbirds.\nTyrant flycatchers are opportunistic feeders and often catch any insect they run across. Some, like the large great kiskadee, may eat fruit or small vertebrates such as frogs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":42},{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"passerine","offset":51},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":76},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":152},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"diverse","offset":179},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South","offset":223},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":233},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":268},{"uri":"Old_World_flycatcher","surface_form":"Old World flycatcher","offset":313},{"uri":"Tyranni","surface_form":"Tyranni","offset":464},{"uri":"Songbird","surface_form":"songbird","offset":527}]}
