From 1912 until his death in 1916, he lived in Odessa, where the sixth edition of his three-volume \"Complete Works\" was published in 1913.\nHis talent was at its best in Odessa. Frug's works were mainly written in Russian with a few stories written in Yiddish. In his writing, he described the life of the Jewish colonists, their relationships with their Ukrainian and Russian neighbors, and the disagreements and occasional arguments about various Yiddish dialects. Many of Frug's poems were set to music and performed on stage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":109},{"uri":"Odessa","surface_form":"Odessa","offset":165},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":331},{"uri":"Yiddish","surface_form":"Yiddish","offset":369}]}
