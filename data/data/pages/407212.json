{"id":407212,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_Jury","text":"\"Trial by Jury\" is one-act operetta by Gilbert and Sullivan. It is the second of their fourteen collaborations and their earliest work still performed today. It opened at the Royalty Theatre in London on 25 March 1875 with Jacques Offenbach's \"La P\u00E9richole\" and the farce, \"Cryptoconchoid Syphonostomata\".\n\"Trial by Jury\" moved about to several different theatres. It was performed about 300 times in its first two years. It was a popular and a critical success. It is only about 45 minutes long, has only one act, and has no spoken words.\n\"Trial\" is about a young man who is sued for jilting his bethrothed. The judge hearing the case decides to marry the young woman himself. Today, it is sometimes played with another Gilbert and Sullivan operetta such as \"H.M.S. Pinafore\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["play"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operetta","surface_form":"operetta","offset":27},{"uri":"Gilbert_and_Sullivan","surface_form":"Gilbert and Sullivan","offset":39},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":194},{"uri":"Jacques_Offenbach","surface_form":"Jacques Offenbach","offset":223},{"uri":"La_P%C3%A9richole","surface_form":"La P\u00E9richole","offset":244},{"uri":"Farce","surface_form":"farce","offset":266},{"uri":"H.M.S._Pinafore","surface_form":"H.M.S.
