{"id":407214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thespis","text":"\"Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old\" is an operetta by Gilbert and Sullivan. It is the first of their fourteen operettas. It was commissioned in 1871 by John Hollingshead, manager and owner of the Gaiety Theatre in the Strand. It was not well rehearsed, and lasted only 65 performances. It was generally well received by the critics.\n\"Thespis\" takes place on Mount Olympus and tells of a theatrical company which takes over the duties of the ancient Greek gods. Most of the music has been lost, making it impossible to reconstruct the operetta.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["play"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operetta","surface_form":"operetta","offset":39},{"uri":"Gilbert_and_Sullivan","surface_form":"Gilbert and Sullivan","offset":51},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"critic","offset":321},{"uri":"Mount_Olympus","surface_form":"Mount Olympus","offset":355}]}
