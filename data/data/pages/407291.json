{"id":407291,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory","text":"\"The Persistence of Memory\" (;) is a painting by artist Salvador Dal\u00ED. It was done in 1931. It is one of his most famous paintings.\nThe painting was first shown in 1932. It has been in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City since 1934. The painting typifies what critics call \"surrealism\".\nIt is easy to recognise and is often used in popular culture.\nDescription.\nThe painting was the first to have a melting pocket watch, called a \"soft watch\". Some people thought that the soft watch was inspired by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Dal\u00ED said that the watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by Camembert cheese melting in the sun.\nThere is a human in the middle of the painting. The orange clock at the bottom left is covered in ants. Dal\u00ED often used ants in his paintings as a symbol for death.\n\"The Persistence of Memory\" uses \"the exactitude of realist painting techniques\". In practice, the painting looks more like something a person might see in a dream, rather than awake.\nLandscape.\nThe rocks to the right are supposed to be a tip of the Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Many of Dal\u00ED's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of Catalonia. There is a strange shadow in the foreground of the painting, which is a reference to Mount Pani.\nVersions.\nDal\u00ED returned to this idea with \"The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory\" (1954). This painting is in the Dal\u00ED Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. The first \"Persistence of Memory\" is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dal\u00ED also made many lithographs and sculptures of soft watches.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":37},{"uri":"Salvador_Dal%C3%AD","surface_form":"Salvador Dal\u00ED","offset":56},{"uri":"Museum_of_Modern_Art","surface_form":"Museum of Modern Art","offset":189},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":220},{"uri":"Surrealism","surface_form":"surrealism","offset":287},{"uri":"Popular_culture","surface_form":"popular culture","offset":345},{"uri":"Pocket_watch","surface_form":"pocket watch","offset":420},{"uri":"Inspire","surface_form":"inspire","offset":501},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":513},{"uri":"Theory_of_relativity","surface_form":"theory of relativity","offset":531},{"uri":"Camembert_cheese","surface_form":"Camembert cheese","offset":634},{"uri":"Cap_de_Creus","surface_form":"Cap de Creus","offset":1086},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonia","offset":1126},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":1183},{"uri":"Foreground","surface_form":"foreground","offset":1241},{"uri":"Reference","surface_form":"reference","offset":1280},{"uri":"Mount_Pani","surface_form":"Mount Pani","offset":1293},{"uri":"Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_Museum","surface_form":"Dal\u00ED Museum","offset":1429},{"uri":"St._Petersburg%2C_Florida","surface_form":"St. Petersburg, Florida","offset":1444},{"uri":"Museum_of_Modern_Art","surface_form":"Museum of Modern Art","offset":1513},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1537},{"uri":"Lithograph","surface_form":"lithograph","offset":1572},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":1588}]}
