It refers to the economic policies created by U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s and still widely practiced.\nThese policies are commonly used with supply-side economics, referred to as trickle-down economics by political enemies and free market economics by political advocates.\nThe four main ideas of Reaganomics were to reduce the growth of government spending, reduce the federal income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation, and tighten the money supply in order to reduce inflation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portmanteau_word","surface_form":"portmanteau word","offset":17},{"uri":"Paul_Harvey","surface_form":"Paul Harvey","offset":73},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economic","offset":103},{"uri":"United_States_President","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":132},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":147},{"uri":"Supply-side_economics","surface_form":"supply-side economics","offset":244},{"uri":"Trickle-down_economics","surface_form":"trickle-down economics","offset":282},{"uri":"Free_market_economy","surface_form":"free market economics","offset":330},{"uri":"United_States_federal_budget","surface_form":"government spending","offset":440},{"uri":"Federal_income_tax","surface_form":"federal income tax","offset":472},{"uri":"Capital_gains_tax","surface_form":"capital gains tax","offset":495},{"uri":"Regulation","surface_form":"regulation","offset":532},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":592}]}
