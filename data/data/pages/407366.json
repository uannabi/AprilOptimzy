Meanwhile, a female slave called Yocheved and her children, Miriam and Aaron, witness several male infants being ruthlessly taken and butchered by the soldiers of Pharaoh Seti I, who fears that an increase in Hebrew men would culminate in rebellion. Fearing for her own son's safety, she places him in a basket on the Nile. The basket arrives at Pharaoh's palace and Miriam witnesses her brother being taken in by Pharaoh's wife, who names him Moses.\nTwenty years later, Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses accidentally destroy a temple while racing their chariots, for which Pharaoh reprimands them. Moses tries to take the blame and tells Pharaoh that Rameses only wanted his approval. At a palace banquet that evening, Pharaoh appoints Rameses as Prince Regent and gives him authority over all the temples in Egypt. Moses is later given Tzipporah, a Midian girl the priests Hotep and Huy captured as a concubine, after she nearly attacks Rameses. Moses ends up humiliating Tzipporah by pushing her into a pool at the palace, and Rameses later appoints him as Royal Chief Architect.\nLater that night, Moses helps Tzipporah escape from the palace and, by chance, runs into his siblings Miriam and Aaron. Miriam tries to explain to Moses about his true past, but he refuses to listen and runs back to the palace. He later has a nightmare in which he witnesses several Hebrew infants being thrown in the Nile and later, Seti reveals that he \"sacrificed\" the Hebrew children, to prevent retaliation. The next day, Moses witnesses an Egyptian overseer whipping an elderly Hebrew slave. He unintentionally kills the guard by pushing him off a scaffolding. Although Rameses pleads with Moses to stay and that he is innocent, Moses bids him farewell, before exiling himself into the desert.\nMoses then arrives in the land of the Midianites, a tribe of which Tzipporah is a member. He is welcomed into the tribe by the High Priest and Tzipporah's father Jethro and becomes a part of their community (\"Through Heaven's Eyes\"). He and Tzipporah later marry. When chasing a stray sheep into a cave, Moses encounters a burning bush. Through this, the voice of God instructs him to return to Egypt and guide the enslaved Hebrews to the Promised Land. He bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that He will tell Moses what to say.\nMoses and Tzipporah then travel to Egypt and discover that while he was absent, the slaves' treatment has worsened and Pharaoh and his wife have since died, resulting in Rameses taking over. He happily greets Moses. When Moses asks Rameses to free the Hebrews and demonstrates his alliance with God by turning his staff into a Egyptian cobra, Hotep and Huy boastfully recreate this transformation (\"Playing With The Big Boys Now\"), only to have their snakes eaten by Moses'. Rather than relenting, Rameses doubles the Hebrews' workload. Moses and Tzipporah then encounter Aaron and Miriam, the former berating Moses for not feeling sorry for the years of slavery the Hebrews have endured. Miriam later convinces her brother and the other slaves to trust them. God later inflicts the Ten Plagues on Egypt, however Rameses is undeterred and refuses to give in to Moses' request.\nMoses then prepares the Hebrews for the final plague by instructing them to paint their doorposts with lamb's blood. The final plague-the Angel of Death-sweeps through the city, killing the firstborn Egyptians-including Rameses' son-and sparing the Hebrew children. A grief-stricken Rameses then allows Moses and the Hebrews to leave.\nThe next day, Moses, Aaron, Miriam and Tzipporah along with the other Hebrews leave Egypt and arrive at the Red Sea (\"When You Believe\"). Rameses and his army then arrive and pursue them, and Moses parts the sea with his staff. The Hebrews are guided safely across and the waters close on the Egyptian army, while Rameses is spared and thrown onto the rocks. Moses then bids his brother a final, emotional farewell, before leading the Hebrews to Mount Sinai, where he receives the Ten Commandments from God.\nCast.\nDirector Brenda Chapman briefly voices Miriam when she sings the lullaby to Moses. The vocal had been recorded for a scratch audio track, which was intended to be replaced later by Sally Dworsky. The track turned out so well that it remained in the film.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":32},{"uri":"Animated_movie","surface_form":"animated","offset":41},{"uri":"Musical_movie","surface_form":"musical","offset":50},{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama movie","offset":58},{"uri":"DreamWorks_Animation","surface_form":"DreamWorks Animation","offset":78},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":114},{"uri":"Book_of_Exodus","surface_form":"Book of Exodus","offset":133},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":160},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":185},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":195},{"uri":"Destiny","surface_form":"destiny","offset":213},{"uri":"Israelites","surface_form":"Israelites","offset":241},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":267},{"uri":"Brenda_Chapman","surface_form":"Brenda Chapman","offset":279},{"uri":"Simon_Wells","surface_form":"Simon Wells","offset":295},{"uri":"Steve_Hickner","surface_form":"Steve Hickner","offset":311},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"written","offset":351},{"uri":"Stephen_Schwartz","surface_form":"Stephen Schwartz","offset":362},{"uri":"Movie_score","surface_form":"score","offset":384},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composed","offset":394},{"uri":"Hans_Zimmer","surface_form":"Hans Zimmer","offset":406},{"uri":"Voice_actor","surface_form":"voice cast","offset":423},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":465},{"uri":"Michelle_Pfeiffer","surface_form":"Michelle Pfeiffer","offset":591},{"uri":"Ralph_Fiennes","surface_form":"Ralph Fiennes","offset":610},{"uri":"Ofra_Haza","surface_form":"Ofra Haza","offset":625},{"uri":"Dub","surface_form":"dubbing","offset":686},{"uri":"Steve_Martin","surface_form":"Steve Martin","offset":696},{"uri":"Martin_Short","surface_form":"Martin Short","offset":713},{"uri":"Direct-to-video","surface_form":"direct-to-video","offset":824},{"uri":"Prequel","surface_form":"prequel","offset":840},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":938},{"uri":"When_You_Believe","surface_form":"When You Believe","offset":958},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":988},{"uri":"Version","surface_form":"version","offset":992},{"uri":"Whitney_Houston","surface_form":"Whitney Houston","offset":1033},{"uri":"Mariah_Carey","surface_form":"Mariah Carey","offset":1053},{"uri":"Babyface","surface_form":"Babyface","offset":1164},{"uri":"Golden_Globe","surface_form":"Golden Globe","offset":1254},{"uri":"ALMA_Award","surface_form":"ALMA Award","offset":1361},{"uri":"Videotape","surface_form":"home video","offset":1438},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"$","offset":1488},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Pictures","surface_form":"Walt Disney Pictures","offset":1567},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1622},{"uri":"Paramount_Pictures","surface_form":"Paramount","offset":1653},{"uri":"Nickelodeon_Movies","surface_form":"Nickelodeon","offset":1663},{"uri":"The_Rugrats_Movie","surface_form":"The Rugrats Movie","offset":1678},{"uri":"Chicken_Run","surface_form":"Chicken Run","offset":1794},{"uri":"The_Simpsons_Movie","surface_form":"The Simpsons Movie","offset":1937},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":2091},{"uri":"Hebrew","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":2110},{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"Pharaoh","offset":2356},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":2511},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":2549},{"uri":"Banquet","surface_form":"banquet","offset":2896},{"uri":"Midian","surface_form":"Midian","offset":3049},{"uri":"Concubine","surface_form":"concubine","offset":3101},{"uri":"Humiliation","surface_form":"humiliating","offset":3160},{"uri":"Nightmare","surface_form":"nightmare","offset":3524},{"uri":"Sacrifice","surface_form":"sacrifice","offset":3637},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exiling","offset":3948},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":3973},{"uri":"Marry","surface_form":"marry","offset":4238},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":4266},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":4345},{"uri":"Egyptian_cobra","surface_form":"Egyptian cobra","offset":4863},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":5856},{"uri":"Mount_Sinai","surface_form":"Mount Sinai","offset":6194},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":6229},{"uri":"Brenda_Chapman","surface_form":"Brenda Chapman","offset":6271}]}
