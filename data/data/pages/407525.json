{"id":407525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_die","text":"e=\"preserve\">The right to die is the belief that people have the right to end their own lives. Usually, when people talk about the right to die, they are talking about the right of people with terminal illnesses to end their lives.\nHinduism accepts the right to die for anyone that has terminal diseases and have no desire to live. Other religions, however, vary in the tolerance of this right, and some call suicide a sin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Terminal_illness","surface_form":"terminal illness","offset":193},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":232},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":338},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":419}]}
