{"id":40755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiot","text":"Idiot is a word used to describe someone who is stupid. The adjective is idiotic. The noun idiocy describes the state of being idiotic. The word can be used in different ways.\nIn literature and folklore.\nThe word \"fool\" is similar to \"idiot\", but it is not as strong. In the history of drama a \"fool\" was a jester: someone who made people laugh. Kings often had jesters in real life. A court jester had the job of making the king feel happy when he was sad. Jesters often pretended to be stupid, but were actually very clever. There are jesters and fools in a lot of Shakespeare\u2019s plays.\nThe word simple can also be similar to \"idiot\". Someone who is simple is a person who is not very clever or \"streetwise\". They are na\u00EFve and can easily be made to believe things because they are kind and expect everyone else to be kind as well. Such people are often called simpletons.\nIdiots or simpletons are commonly used in literature. In German literature (and in Wagner\u2019s opera), Parsifal is described as \"perfect fool\" because he does not understand the evil ways of the world and is therefore completely good. That is why he can break the magic spell cast by Klingsor. The idiot often appears in Russian literature. Because the idiot is so simple he (it is always a male) is often able to express the truth which other people cannot see. Dostoevsky wrote a novel called \"The Idiot\". It is about a man who is simple and trusting. At the end of the opera \"Boris Godunov\" by Mussorgsky the crowd of poor people gather round the simpleton who is the last person to sing in the whole opera. His moans express the fact that Russia will continue to be ruled by cruel dictators and the people will remain poor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":286},{"uri":"Jester","surface_form":"jester","offset":307},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":346},{"uri":"Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare","offset":567},{"uri":"Simple","surface_form":"simple","offset":597},{"uri":"Na%C3%AFve","surface_form":"na\u00EFve","offset":719},{"uri":"Simpleton","surface_form":"simpleton","offset":862},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Wagner\u2019s","offset":957},{"uri":"Parsifal","surface_form":"Parsifal","offset":974},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1192},{"uri":"Truth","surface_form":"truth","offset":1297},{"uri":"Dostoevsky","surface_form":"Dostoevsky","offset":1334},{"uri":"The_Idiot","surface_form":"The Idiot","offset":1367},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":1443},{"uri":"Boris_Godunov","surface_form":"Boris Godunov","offset":1450},{"uri":"Mussorgsky","surface_form":"Mussorgsky","offset":1468},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":1656}]}
