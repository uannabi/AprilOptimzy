He was interested in the ways different media affected society.\nHis work was a cornerstone of media studies, and had some practical applications in the advertising and television industries. His best-known work was '.\nMcLuhan is known for coining the expressions \"the medium is the message\" and the \"global village\".\nAlthough he was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, his influence began to wane in the early 1970s. In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles. With the arrival of the internet, however, there was renewed interest in his work and perspective.\n\"The Gutenberg Galaxy\".\nMcLuhan's \"The Gutenberg Galaxy: the making of typographic man\" (1962) was a history of print, and its effect on society.\n\"Understanding Media\".\n\"Understanding Media: the extensions of Man\" was a pioneering study of the effects of media. The book suggests that media affect their content in important ways. It is an attempt to understand how different media have affected society. McLuhan suggests that media play a role, not by the content delivered, but by the characteristics of the medium itself.\nMcLuhan pointed to the light bulb as an example. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, but it is a medium that has a social effect. The light bulb lets people do things at nightime which would be impossible in darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that \"a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence\". He then goes on to compare the effects of radio, television and film (movis).\nThe book is the source of the well-known phrase \"The medium is the message\". This is the idea that a medium like television actually affects the way information is seen and understood.\n\"The Medium is the Message\".\n\"The Medium is the Message: an inventory of effects\" (1967) was a spin-off from his previous book. It was compiled by Quentin Fiore from writings of McLuhan with many photos and graphics selected by the compiler. The text is based on published McLuhan works, but the sources are not listed. It was a huge best-seller. \"eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Canada","surface_form":"CC","offset":26},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":71},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":140},{"uri":"Media_studies","surface_form":"media studies","offset":241},{"uri":"Global_village_(term)","surface_form":"global village","offset":447},{"uri":"Understanding_Media","surface_form":"Understanding Media","offset":938},{"uri":"Pioneer","surface_form":"pioneering","offset":988},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":1913}]}
