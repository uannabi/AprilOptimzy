It is the first game in the \"WWE 2K\" video game series and the first \"WWE\" game to be released under 2K Sports since Take-Two acquired the license from THQ in a bankruptcy filing. This game, along with \"NBA 2K14\", were planned for Wii U releases, but were canceled. Dwayne Johnson is the cover athlete of the game.\nReception.\nIGN rated the game a 8.7 out of 10 and said \"It still lacks the brains to deliver competent AI and commentators, but WWE 2K14 has more than enough brawn to make up for it. 30 Years of Wrestlemania provides the strongest campaign backbone the series has had in a long time, the in-ring action is faster and more fluid than it's been in years, and thanks to WWE 2K14\"s continually expanding creation suite, we're swimming in more options than we ever knew we wanted. It is indeed \"time to play the game.\"\nGameSpot gave the game a 6 out of 10 and said that the game was clunky, they stated \"It's a shame the wrestling isn't up to par in \"WWE 2K14\" because the elements surrounding it are so interesting\u2026For anyone who grew up loving professional wrestling, be prepared to be swept away in a tide of nostalgia. If only the core action could have been as compelling.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":16},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":39},{"uri":"Video_game_developer","surface_form":"developed","offset":50},{"uri":"Yuke%27s","surface_form":"Yuke's","offset":63},{"uri":"Visual_Concepts","surface_form":"Visual Concepts","offset":72},{"uri":"2K_Sports","surface_form":"2K Sports","offset":105},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":161},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":196},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":232},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":243},{"uri":"WWE_2K","surface_form":"WWE 2K","offset":279},{"uri":"NBA_2K14","surface_form":"NBA 2K14","offset":453},{"uri":"Wii_U","surface_form":"Wii U","offset":481},{"uri":"Dwayne_Johnson","surface_form":"Dwayne Johnson","offset":516},{"uri":"IGN","surface_form":"IGN","offset":576},{"uri":"GameSpot","surface_form":"GameSpot","offset":1079}]}
