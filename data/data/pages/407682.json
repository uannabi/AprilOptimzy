{"id":407682,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_amazon","text":"The Saint Vincent amazon (\"Amazona guildingii\"), also known as Saint Vincent parrot, is the only parrot that lives in the island of Saint Vincent in the Caribbean.\nIt is a large, multi-colored parrot with a yellowish white, blue and green head, greenish-bronze upperparts plumage, and violet blue-green wings.\nDescription.\nThe bird is long. The plumage of this attractive species is highly variable: virtually no two birds look alike, with a yellowish white, blue and green head, greenish-bronze upperparts, violet blue-green wings, grey feet, and reddish eye. Its tail feathers are blue with broad yellow tips. Both sexes are similar.\nThere are two different colour morphs: a more common \u2018yellow-brown\u2019 morph, and a less common \u2018green\u2019 morph. Although both morphs are broadly similar in appearance, the upperparts of the 'green' morph are mainly dull-green and the head is bluish white.\nRange and habitat.\nThe Saint Vincent amazon is endemic to the heavily forested mountains of the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent in the Lesser Antilles.\nIt lives in rainforests in the island's central mountains, from; it prefers mountains and valleys at low elevation because there are larger, mature trees needed for the nests.\nBiology.\nThe Saint Vincent amazons live in groups and feed on the upper parts of large trees. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, seeds, flowers and leaves of several species of the rainforest.\nThey breed between January and June (mostly February-May) and their nests are in holes in mature, large trees. The female usually lays two to three eggs.\nStatus.\nThe combined effects of habitat loss, hunting for food, the capture to trade them as pets, and natural disasters (volcanoes and hurricanes, made that the number of Saint Vincent Amazon declined through the 20th century.\nDue to all these contributing factors, the St. Vincent parrot is considered Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of CITES.\nConservation.\nA group of conservation measures has been able to avoid the extinction of the St Vincent Amazon, including: the enforcement of international and domestic legislation protecting this species from hunting and trade; the protection of habitat through the establishment of the St Vincent Parrot Reserve; and the delivery of successful public education campaigns.\nOn October 27, 1979, \"A. guildingii\" was declared the national bird of St. Vincent and the Grenadines as part of the country's first independence celebration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"True_parrots","surface_form":"parrot","offset":97},{"uri":"Saint_Vincent_(island)","surface_form":"Saint Vincent","offset":132},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":153},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":239},{"uri":"Plumage","surface_form":"plumage","offset":272},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":303},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":570},{"uri":"Polymorphism","surface_form":"morphs","offset":667},{"uri":"Dull","surface_form":"dull","offset":847},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":935},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":958},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":967},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":984},{"uri":"Saint_Vincent_(island)","surface_form":"Saint Vincent","offset":1004},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":1025},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":1054},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":1132},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":1147},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":1190},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":1211},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1340},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":1348},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":1355},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":1367},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":1417},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":1560},{"uri":"Habitat_loss","surface_form":"habitat loss","offset":1598},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":1612},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":1645},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":1659},{"uri":"Disaster","surface_form":"disaster","offset":1677},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":1688},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":1702},{"uri":"Decline","surface_form":"declined","offset":1759},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1780},{"uri":"IUCN_Red_List","surface_form":"IUCN Red List","offset":1888},{"uri":"CITES","surface_form":"CITES","offset":1962},{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":1994},{"uri":"Enforcement","surface_form":"enforcement","offset":2095},{"uri":"Legislation","surface_form":"legislation","offset":2137},{"uri":"List_of_national_birds","surface_form":"national bird","offset":2396},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":2475}]}
