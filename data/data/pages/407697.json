{"id":407697,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(song)","text":"\"Reflection\" is a song that is on the soundtrack of the 1998 animated movie, \"Mulan\". It was the first single by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was performed in the movie by Lea Salonga. Ming-Na Wen played the speaking voice of the main character Fa Mulan. Aguilera approached RCA Records. They allowed her to record the song. Disney was looking for a performer who could sing a musical note that was difficult for most performers. Aguilera recorded herself singing Whitney Houston's song, \"Run To You\". This was a response to Disney, who were impressed by her performance. Aguilera agreed to take a trip to Los Angeles to spend a week recording the album.\nThe song received a mixed review. Many reviewers agreed that it is a \"nice song\", however, they said it was not memorable. \"Reflection\" helped fund for Aguilera's debut album. It also gained her popularity among songwriters and music producers. Because the song was not released for commercial audiences, it only charted on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart. It peaked at number 19. The music video was included on the DVD release of \"Mulan\". Aguilera had performed the track on four televised performances. This includes at the CBS \"This Morning\" show. This caught the attention of songwriter Diane Warren.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":18},{"uri":"Soundtrack","surface_form":"soundtrack","offset":38},{"uri":"Animated_movie","surface_form":"animated movie","offset":61},{"uri":"Mulan","surface_form":"Mulan","offset":78},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":103},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":113},{"uri":"Christina_Aguilera","surface_form":"Christina Aguilera","offset":129},{"uri":"Lea_Salonga","surface_form":"Lea Salonga","offset":182},{"uri":"Ming-Na_Wen","surface_form":"Ming-Na Wen","offset":195},{"uri":"RCA_Records","surface_form":"RCA Records","offset":285},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":335},{"uri":"Musical_note","surface_form":"musical note","offset":387},{"uri":"Whitney_Houston","surface_form":"Whitney Houston","offset":474},{"uri":"Run_To_You","surface_form":"Run To You","offset":499},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":616},{"uri":"Debut_album","surface_form":"debut album","offset":828},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":877},{"uri":"Music_producer","surface_form":"music producer","offset":893},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"\"Billboard\"","offset":993},{"uri":"Adult_Contemporary","surface_form":"Adult Contemporary","offset":1005},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":1059},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":1091},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":1201},{"uri":"This_Morning","surface_form":"This Morning","offset":1206},{"uri":"Diane_Warren","surface_form":"Diane Warren","offset":1266}]}
