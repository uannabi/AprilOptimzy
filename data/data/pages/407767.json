{"id":407767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis","text":"=\"preserve\">Cirrhosis is a disease of the liver. Normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. The liver does not work so well.\nCirrhosis is caused mostly by alcoholism, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Ascites (retention of fluid in the abdomen) is the most common complication for cirrhosis. The patient's skin develops a yellowish hue (jaundice) as the disease gets worse. Liver damage by cirrhosis cannot be repaired. It leads to a poor quality of life, and can cause death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":27},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":42},{"uri":"Scar","surface_form":"scar","offset":84},{"uri":"Tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":89},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":160},{"uri":"Hepatitis_B","surface_form":"hepatitis B","offset":172},{"uri":"Hepatitis_C","surface_form":"hepatitis C","offset":187},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":235},{"uri":"Jaundice","surface_form":"jaundice","offset":336}]}
