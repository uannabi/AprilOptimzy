{"id":407930,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A Crown colony, also known in the 17th century as royal colony, was a type of colonial administration of the English and later British Empire. Crown, or royal colonies were ruled by a governor which is decided by the Monarch. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Sovereign appointed royal governors on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Under the name of \"royal colony\", the first of what would later become known as Crown colonies was the English Colony of Virginia. This happened in 1624 after the Crown removed the Royal Charter it had given to the Virginia Company.\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century, the term \"Crown Colony\" was only used to refer to those colonies which had been obtain through wars. Examples were Trinidad and Tobago, British Guiana, and the colonies of settlement, such as The Canadas, Newfoundland, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and New Zealand, later to become the Dominions. The term continued to be used up until 1981, when the British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified the remaining British colonies as \"British Dependent Territories\". From 2002 they have been known as British Overseas Territories.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colonial","surface_form":"colonial","offset":92},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administration","offset":101},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":123},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":141},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":198},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"Monarch","offset":231},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies","surface_form":"Secretary of State for the Colonies","offset":342},{"uri":"Colony_of_Virginia","surface_form":"Colony of Virginia","offset":490},{"uri":"The_Crown","surface_form":"the Crown","offset":538},{"uri":"Royal_Charter","surface_form":"Royal Charter","offset":560},{"uri":"Virginia_Company","surface_form":"Virginia Company","offset":594},{"uri":"Obtain","surface_form":"obtain","offset":726},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":741},{"uri":"Trinidad_and_Tobago","surface_form":"Trinidad and Tobago","offset":761},{"uri":"British_Guiana","surface_form":"British Guiana","offset":782},{"uri":"The_Canadas","surface_form":"The Canadas","offset":838},{"uri":"Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":851},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":865},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":882},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":894},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":911},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":921},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":931},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":954},{"uri":"Dominion","surface_form":"Dominion","offset":987},{"uri":"British_Nationality_Act_1981","surface_form":"British Nationality Act 1981","offset":1052},{"uri":"British_Overseas_Territories","surface_form":"British Overseas Territories","offset":1195}]}
