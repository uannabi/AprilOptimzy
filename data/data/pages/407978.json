She had submitted this thesis to the University of Heidelberg in 1986. She was also accused of presenting herself as being or having been a professor at that University. She never actually had such a position. The University of Heidelberg confirmed on 14 April, 2013, that plagiarism had taken place. The university also said that Sahai has no right to call herself a professor of the University of Heidelberg. Her habilitation has been revoked.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indian_people","surface_form":"Indian","offset":18},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":25},{"uri":"Gene_Campaign","surface_form":"Gene Campaign","offset":53},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":88},{"uri":"Indian_Agricultural_Research_Institute","surface_form":"Indian Agricultural Research Institute","offset":103},{"uri":"University_of_Alberta","surface_form":"University of Alberta","offset":174},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":197},{"uri":"University_of_Heidelberg","surface_form":"University of Heidelberg","offset":228},{"uri":"Habilitation","surface_form":"habilitation","offset":272},{"uri":"Human_genetics","surface_form":"human genetics","offset":288},{"uri":"Web_of_Science","surface_form":"Web of Science","offset":308},{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetically-modified organisms","offset":418},{"uri":"H-index","surface_form":"h-index","offset":509},{"uri":"Non-governmental_organization","surface_form":"non-governmental organization","offset":546},{"uri":"Plagiarism","surface_form":"plagiarism","offset":649},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":828}]}
