Graves led a group of thirteen families who moved to Chicago from Ohio in 1831. He died in 1844, and the monument was created by sculptor Lorado Taft in 1909. Taft's son, Henry Graves, asked him to create it. In Ada Bartlett Taft's \"1946 Lorado Taft; Sculptor and Citizen\", it was listed as one of his most important works. Images of Eternal Silence have been used in other artworks, including works by Claes Oldenburg. One folktale claims that if someone looks into the eyes of \"Eternal Silence\"s hooded figure, the viewer would be shown his or her own death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["NRHP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":23},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":35},{"uri":"Graceland_Cemetery","surface_form":"Graceland Cemetery","offset":45},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":152},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":159},{"uri":"Backdrop","surface_form":"backdropped","offset":180},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":201},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":228},{"uri":"Sculptor","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":237},{"uri":"Lorado_Taft","surface_form":"Lorado Taft","offset":246},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":414},{"uri":"Folktale","surface_form":"folktale","offset":772},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":902}]}
