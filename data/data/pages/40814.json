{"id":40814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Mafia is a crime group working in many parts of the world that was created in Italy more than 200 years ago. The mafia makes money from crime. They make billions of dollars a year from such crimes as making and selling illegal drugs, money laundering, from stealing, gambling and prostitution.\nEtymology.\nThe first written use of the word mafia has it being said on a list of rebels against the catholic church. It meant \"boldness, ambition, pride\", and since none of these were considered appropriate for a woman it is the name of a witch. Many people also believe that Arabic affected the word 'mafia' during the period of Arab control of Sicily, after the fall of the Roman Empire in 846 AD. 'Mahias' is an Arab word meaning 'bold man', and this is believed to be incorporated into the modern term mafia, which also suggests the bold and argumentative nature of its constituents.\nRules.\nA boss in the Sicilian mafia had a list of ten rules. These rules have been called the mafia's Ten Commandments.\nThe Mafia in Italy.\nThe mafia in Italy have been around for hundreds of years. They work in the areas of Calabria, Sicily, Naples and Apulia which are all areas in the South of Italy.\nThis group was founded by Felice Maniero, but has now been dismantled.\nThe Italian Mafia in America.\nThe Italian-American mafia began at the time when many Italians moved to the United States in the 1800s. The first Italian mafia was in New Orleans in Louisiana but soon they were in many cities across the country. The Italian mafia in the United States is actually called \"La Cosa Nostra\" which in Italian language means \"This thing of ours\" or \"Our thing\". The American mafia is divided into different groups or \"families\". Many large cities have only one Italian-American mafia family, but some larger cities like New York City have more.\nMany other American cities have Italian mafia families. These include Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Los Angeles\nMafia groups in other countries.\nThere are others as well, like the mafia groups in Russia that make money from drugs and weapons. All these groups operate in the United States, Canada, Australia, England and other Western countries and cause many problems in those countries and the countries they are from.\nHierarchy.\nJust like in a company, where people have a boss and workers, the Italian-American mafia, or La Cosa Nostra (LCN), has a hierarchy. Everyone has a job to do. Some people are bosses and some are workers. However you can always work your way up the ladder of power, and respect. Below is the hierarchy of an American mafia family.\nEach family will have a number of associates. These are people that work with them or for them but are not official members. (\"see below; Becoming a member\")\nHistory of the Mafia in New York.\nThe mafia in New York began when thousands of Italians moved there in the late 1800s and early 1900s to find a better life. At this time many Irish and Germans also moved to the US for the same reasons. Many of these people set up businesses or worked for businesses that were already there. Most earned very little money and some, who were tired of being poor, decided to earn money from crime, which was easier than earning money by working. There were many Irish and Italian criminal groups in the city who would steal, extort and murder for money. These groups were known all-together as \"the Black Hand\" but they did not actually work as one group called \"the Black Hand\"; there were many groups and they each worked on their own and the term \"Black Hand\" actually was the name of what these gangs did (extortion), not their names.\nProhibition, unification and the Castellammarese War.\nIn 1920 alcohol (or liquor) was made illegal in the US and the gangs had a new way to make money. They brought in illegal liquor from Canada and sold it in clubs. They bribed police into letting them sell liquor (which is also illegal) and made millions of dollars from this because they were the only ones who had liquor and so could sell it at extremely high prices. Around this time the gangs in New York became one large gang (the Mafia) as leaders of the gangs realized that more money could be made if all the gangs worked together. A man named Giuseppe Masseria and a man named Salvatore Maranzano both wanted to become the boss of the newly made New York mafia. Fighting, known as the \"Castellammarese War\", broke out between the two men and many of their soldiers were killed. Giuseppe Masseria's underboss was a man named Lucky Luciano who also wanted to control the New York mafia. He met with Masseria's enemy Salvatore Maranzano and plotted to kill Masseria, his own boss. Masseria was shot to death in a restaurant in New York by Maranzano's soldiers; one of them was Vito Genovese - a man who would later become boss - this was also the end of the \"Castellammarese War\". With the death of Masseria, Maranzano appointed himself the boss of the New York Mafia, in Italian language called the \"Capo di tutti Capi\" meaning \"Boss of all Bosses\". He called a meeting with the other \"mafiosi\" (plural: Italian language for Mafia members) from all over the US and made the rules that are still used today.\nThe bosses of the five families, particularly Luciano, began to grow tired of Maranzano's arrogance and the way he ran the mafia. Maranzano realized this and planned to have Luciano and his \"consigliere\" and \"underboss\", Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, as well as others, killed. Maranzano did not act quickly enough and was killed by men dressed as police officers, on the orders of Luciano and his friend, a Jewish gangster from Florida named Meyer Lansky. Luciano then became the head of the New York mafia, but not in the way Maranzano was; he helped the five families run their business but he did not control them or call himself the \"boss of bosses\". The five families were kept.\nThe Profaci family (named after the first boss Joseph Profaci) went on to become named the Colombo crime family after a later boss, Joseph Colombo. The Mangano family (named after the first boss Vincent Mangano) went on to become named the Gambino crime family after a later boss, Carlo Gambino. The Gagliano family (named after the first boss Thomas Gagliano) went on to become named the Lucchese crime family after a later boss, Gaetano Lucchese. Frank Costello became the boss of Luciano's old family which later went on to become named the Genovese crime family after Vito Genovese became the boss and tried to kill Frank Costello. The Bonanno family (named after the first boss Joseph Bonanno) kept its name as Joseph Bonanno was the boss for a very long time.\nThe Five Families over the years.\nGenovese crime family\nThe Mafia in movies.\nMany movies have been made about the mafia, particularly the American Mafia. Here are some of the most popular movies about American gangsters.\nThe television series The Sopranos is about the mafia in New Jersey and stars James Gandolfini, Steve Van Zandt, Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli, Vincent Pastore, David Proval and Joe Pantoliano among others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":96},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":237},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":245},{"uri":"Stealing","surface_form":"stealing","offset":275},{"uri":"Gambling","surface_form":"gambling","offset":285},{"uri":"Prostitution","surface_form":"prostitution","offset":298},{"uri":"Sicily","surface_form":"Sicilian","offset":922},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":1003},{"uri":"Calabria","surface_form":"Calabria","offset":1126},{"uri":"Sicily","surface_form":"Sicily","offset":1136},{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":1144},{"uri":"Apulia","surface_form":"Apulia","offset":1155},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"South","offset":1189},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1383},{"uri":"1800","surface_form":"1800","offset":1404},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":1442},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":1457},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian language","offset":1605},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1823},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":1918},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":1927},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":1941},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1954},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":2050},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":2144},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":2152},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":2163},{"uri":"Boss","surface_form":"boss","offset":2330},{"uri":"Worker","surface_form":"worker","offset":2339},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchy","offset":2407},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"1800","offset":2886},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"1900","offset":2902},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":2949},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germans","offset":2959},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":3038},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":3701},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":3706},{"uri":"Liquor","surface_form":"liquor","offset":3718},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":3832},{"uri":"Bribed","surface_form":"bribed","offset":3866},{"uri":"Giuseppe_Masseria","surface_form":"Giuseppe Masseria","offset":4249},{"uri":"Salvatore_Maranzano","surface_form":"Salvatore Maranzano","offset":4283},{"uri":"Lucky_Luciano","surface_form":"Lucky Luciano","offset":4530},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":5100},{"uri":"Arrogance","surface_form":"arrogance","offset":5301},{"uri":"Frank_Costello","surface_form":"Frank Costello","offset":5450},{"uri":"Police_officer","surface_form":"police officer","offset":5563},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":5644},{"uri":"Meyer_Lansky","surface_form":"Meyer Lansky","offset":5658},{"uri":"Joseph_Colombo","surface_form":"Joseph Colombo","offset":6032},{"uri":"Carlo_Gambino","surface_form":"Carlo Gambino","offset":6181},{"uri":"Gaetano_Lucchese","surface_form":"Gaetano Lucchese","offset":6331},{"uri":"Genovese_crime_family","surface_form":"Genovese crime family","offset":6700},{"uri":"The_Sopranos","surface_form":"The Sopranos","offset":6909},{"uri":"James_Gandolfini","surface_form":"James Gandolfini","offset":6965},{"uri":"Steve_Van_Zandt","surface_form":"Steve Van Zandt","offset":6983},{"uri":"Tony_Sirico","surface_form":"Tony Sirico","offset":7000},{"uri":"Michael_Imperioli","surface_form":"Michael Imperioli","offset":7013},{"uri":"Vincent_Pastore","surface_form":"Vincent Pastore","offset":7032},{"uri":"Joe_Pantoliano","surface_form":"Joe Pantoliano","offset":7066}]}
