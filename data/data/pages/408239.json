{"id":408239,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McCoubrey","text":"James Foster McCoubrey (13 September 1901 \u2013 5 July 2013) was a Canadian-born American supercentenarian who was at the time of his death aged 111 years, 295 days the oldest man ever born in Canada, and believed to be the oldest living American man for less than a year after Shelby Harris' death on 25 July 2012 as well as the world's oldest living man for over 3 weeks after 116-year-old Japanese man Jiroemon Kimura's death on 11 June (Kimura died on 12 June Japanese time), and after his death succeeded as the oldest living man by Jokichi Ikarashi, who already was Japan's oldest living man and died just 18 days later. However, the oldest living man after Kimura's death as well as the oldest living American man after Shelby Harris' death was later confirmed to be Spanish-born American man Salustiano Sanchez, who was less than 14 weeks older than him and died just 10 weeks after him (when he would have turned 112).\nMcCoubrey was born on 13 September 1901 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, which at that time was part of the British Empire, and present Canada. He died of pneumonia on 5 July 2013, just 10 weeks before his 112th birthday, in Walnut Creek, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":77},{"uri":"Supercentenarian","surface_form":"supercentenarian","offset":86},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":388},{"uri":"Jiroemon_Kimura","surface_form":"Jiroemon Kimura","offset":401},{"uri":"Jokichi_Ikarashi","surface_form":"Jokichi Ikarashi","offset":534},{"uri":"Salustiano_Sanchez","surface_form":"Salustiano Sanchez","offset":796},{"uri":"St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"St. John's","offset":967},{"uri":"Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"Newfoundland and Labrador","offset":979},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":1041},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1069},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":1088},{"uri":"Walnut_Creek%2C_California","surface_form":"Walnut Creek","offset":1158},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1172}]}
