{"id":408273,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Sweden","text":"The Church of Sweden (), is a Lutheran-Protestant Christian denomination in Sweden. The denomination was established in the 16th century, when Sweden converted from Catholicism to Protestantism, and became the Swedish state church. As the 19th and 20th centuries progressed, it moved towards a more liberal theology and ecumenism.\nIn late August 1995, the Swedish government and the Church of Sweden decided to go separate ways from 1 January 2000. The denomination mostly practices infant baptism.\nFemale priests were allowed in 1958, and in 1997, Christina Odenberg was appointed the denomination's first female bishop (diocese of Lund). In June 2014, Antje Jackel\u00E9n became the denomination's first female archbishop (diocese of Uppsala).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lutheranism","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":30},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":39},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":50},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":76},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":124},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":165},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestantism","offset":180},{"uri":"State_religion","surface_form":"state church","offset":218},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th","offset":239},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th centuries","offset":248},{"uri":"Liberal_theology","surface_form":"liberal theology","offset":299},{"uri":"Ecumenism","surface_form":"ecumenism","offset":320},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":346},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":443},{"uri":"Infant_baptism","surface_form":"infant baptism","offset":483},{"uri":"1958","surface_form":"1958","offset":530},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":543},{"uri":"Christina_Odenberg","surface_form":"Christina Odenberg","offset":549},{"uri":"Diocese_of_Lund","surface_form":"diocese of Lund","offset":622},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":643},{"uri":"2014","surface_form":"2014","offset":648},{"uri":"Antje_Jackel%C3%A9n","surface_form":"Antje Jackel\u00E9n","offset":654},{"uri":"Diocese_of_Uppsala","surface_form":"diocese of Uppsala","offset":720}]}
