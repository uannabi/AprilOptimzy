{"id":408579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrophore","text":"The chondrophores or porpitids are a small and unusual group of hydrozoans. They are the family Porpitidae'\".\nThey all live at the surface of the open ocean, and are colonies of carnivorous, free-floating hydroids. Their life-style in the plankton is similar to that of pelagic jellyfish.\nThe chondrophores look like a single organism but are cooperatives of polyps.\nThe most familiar members of the family Porpitidae are the blue button (\"Porpita porpita\") and the by-the-wind sailor (\"Velella velella\").\nStructure.\nChondrophores may look like a jellyfish, but they really are not. Like the siphonophores they are not a single animal. They are a colony of clones, genetically identical zooids. These zooids are small, highly modified individual polyps. Though structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.\nThis kind of set-up is also found in the siphonophores: the Portuguese man o' war. They evolved independently, and are classified in different orders.\nFossil record.\nA rare soft-bodied fossil was got from Mississippian strata in northeastern Kentucky. It was interpreted as a chondrophorine float. The origin of the group was probably in the Neoproterozoic era, some 650540 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hydrozoa","surface_form":"hydrozoa","offset":64},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":89},{"uri":"Colony_(biology)","surface_form":"colonies","offset":166},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":178},{"uri":"Hydroid","surface_form":"hydroid","offset":205},{"uri":"Life-style","surface_form":"life-style","offset":221},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":239},{"uri":"Jellyfish","surface_form":"jellyfish","offset":278},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":326},{"uri":"Polyp","surface_form":"polyp","offset":359},{"uri":"Siphonophores","surface_form":"siphonophores","offset":592},{"uri":"Clones","surface_form":"clones","offset":657},{"uri":"Genetically","surface_form":"genetically","offset":665},{"uri":"Zooids","surface_form":"zooids","offset":687},{"uri":"Cnidaria","surface_form":"cnidaria","offset":791},{"uri":"Siphonophores","surface_form":"siphonophores","offset":1004},{"uri":"Portuguese_man_o%27_war","surface_form":"Portuguese man o' war","offset":1023},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"orders","offset":1106},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":1148},{"uri":"Mississippian","surface_form":"Mississippian","offset":1168},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":1182},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":1205},{"uri":"Neoproterozoic","surface_form":"Neoproterozoic","offset":1305}]}
