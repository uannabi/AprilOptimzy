{"id":408655,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machaeroides","text":"\"Machaeroides\" (\"dagger-like\") was a genus of sabre-toothed creodonts which lived during the Eocene (56 to 34 mya). Its fossils were found in the U.S. state of Wyoming. It is the earliest known sabre-toothed mammal.\nIt looked like a small, dog-sized saber-toothed cat. \"Machaeroides\" had a longer skull than a cat-family animal, and it walked plantigrade, with its palms and heels on the ground, instead of on its toes like a cat or dog.\nThe long survival of these small animals shows that their killing method suited small cats as well as large cats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":37},{"uri":"Creodont","surface_form":"creodont","offset":60},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":93},{"uri":"U.S.","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":146},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":160},{"uri":"Saber-toothed_cat","surface_form":"saber-toothed cat","offset":250},{"uri":"Feliformia","surface_form":"cat-family animal","offset":310},{"uri":"Plantigrade","surface_form":"plantigrade","offset":343}]}
