{"id":408753,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_plug","text":"A volcanic plug is a landform created when volcanic magma hardens inside a vent on an active volcano. They are sometimes called volcanic necks or \"puys\". The plug is revealed when surrounding land is eroded.\nAs it forms, a plug may cause an extreme build-up of pressure if gas-charged magma is trapped beneath it. This sometimes leads to an explosive eruption. But if the explosion does not occur, then the volcano becomes a solid block made of hard material.\nThe plug is usually harder than the surrounding rock. Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, while a long slope of material remains on the lee side. Such landforms are called crag and tail. If a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains. This is what produces the distinctive upstanding landform.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landform","surface_form":"landform","offset":21},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":43},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":52},{"uri":"Volcanic_vent","surface_form":"vent","offset":75},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":86},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"eroded","offset":200},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":261},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":273},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":285},{"uri":"Glaciation","surface_form":"Glacial","offset":514},{"uri":"Crag_and_tail","surface_form":"crag and tail","offset":658},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":697}]}
