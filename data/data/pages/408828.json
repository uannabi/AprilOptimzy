He answered, \"I still stick to the Dutch pronunciation of the double \"o\"\u2014\"Loon\" like \"loan\" in 'Loan and Trust Co.' My sons will probably accept the American pronunciation. It really does not matter very much.\"\nBooks written by Van Loon.\nThese are the books that Hendrik Willem van Loon wrote. The dates show the first time each book was printed. The other names tell what publisher printed them.\nIn popular culture.\nFrancesco Guccini, a man from Italy who writes songs, wrote a song called \"Van Loon\".
