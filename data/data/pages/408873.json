The soldier may have been killed, injured, captured or deserted. It is not known what happened to them. If they are dead, neither their body nor grave can be found or identified. Going missing in action has been a risk for people in armed forces for as long as there has been war.\nWorld War II.\nAccording to official US Department of Army and Department of Navy casualty records, submitted to Congress in 1946 and updated in 1953, the combined possible total of missing service personnel worldwide is closer to approximately 6600 and probably considerably fewer. Since DPAA alone designates such WWII personnel as the crew of the USS Arizona and most of that of USS Oklahoma as both \"missing\" and \"unaccounted-for\" it is possible that DPAA records keeping may be somewhat idiosyncratic.\nKorean War.\nAccording to the US Dept of Defense as of January 14,2021: Total of working number of MIA US Servicemen: 7,567\nVietnam War.\nAccording to the US Dept of Defense as of January 14,2021: Total of MIA US Servicemen/Civilians: 1,585\nOthers.\nAs of January 14,2021 Total US MIAS World War II to present: 81,817","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":36},{"uri":"Missing","surface_form":"missing","offset":73},{"uri":"Killed_in_action","surface_form":"killed","offset":130},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injured","offset":138},{"uri":"Prisoner_of_war","surface_form":"captured","offset":147},{"uri":"Desertion","surface_form":"deserted","offset":159},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":240},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":249},{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":337},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":380},{"uri":"USS_Arizona","surface_form":"USS Arizona","offset":734},{"uri":"USS_Oklahoma","surface_form":"USS Oklahoma","offset":766}]}
