She is the only living grandparent of Malia and Sasha Obama. She also has one granddaughter, Leslie Robinson, and two grandsons, Avery and Austin Robinson, from her son, Craig Robinson.\nAccording to her youngest brother Steve Shields, Robinson was the fourth of seven children\u2014five girls, followed by two boys. Her father was a house painter and her mother was a licensed practical nurse.\nRobinson married Fraser Robinson on October 27, 1960. She is now a widow. In addition to their daughter Michelle, they also had a son, Craig. Craig is the current coach of the Oregon State University men's basketball team. Robinson was formerly a secretary for mail-order retailer Spiegel and at a bank. While Michelle and Barack Obama campaigned in 2008, Robinson cared for her granddaughters. Early in January 2009, it was reported that Robinson would move into the White House with the rest of the First Family (the president's family), so that she could continue to care for her granddaughters. She was the first grandmother to live in the White House since Elivera M. Doud during the Eisenhower administration. Some news agencies have called Robinson the \"First Granny.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Married_and_maiden_names","surface_form":"n\u00E9e","offset":22},{"uri":"Michelle_Obama","surface_form":"Michelle Obama","offset":67},{"uri":"Mother-in-law","surface_form":"mother-in-law","offset":86},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":103},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":113},{"uri":"Grandparent","surface_form":"grandparent","offset":150},{"uri":"Craig_Robinson_(basketball)","surface_form":"Craig Robinson","offset":297},{"uri":"Widow","surface_form":"widow","offset":583},{"uri":"Craig_Robinson)","surface_form":"Craig","offset":651},{"uri":"Oregon_State_University","surface_form":"Oregon State University","offset":692},{"uri":"Secretary","surface_form":"secretary","offset":763},{"uri":"Spiegel_(catalog)","surface_form":"Spiegel","offset":797},{"uri":"First_Family_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"First Family","offset":1017},{"uri":"Elivera_M._Doud","surface_form":"Elivera M.
