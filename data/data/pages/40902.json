It was made in 1974 and was very successful. It is still very popular. It was also made into a musical called \"Spamalot\".\nStory.\nThis is a comedy about King Arthur's search for the Holy Grail. He gathers a group of knights around him. They do not ride horses - instead, they clap coconut halves together, to make the sound of a horse galloping. They search for the grail, but keep on getting distracted by peasants (poor farmers) who want to talk about politics, or French knights insulting them.\nThe movie was made in Scotland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monty_Python","surface_form":"Monty Python","offset":62},{"uri":"Musical","surface_form":"musical","offset":171},{"uri":"Spamalot","surface_form":"Spamalot","offset":187},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":215},{"uri":"King_Arthur","surface_form":"King Arthur","offset":228},{"uri":"Holy_Grail","surface_form":"Holy Grail","offset":257},{"uri":"Knight","surface_form":"knight","offset":291},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":328},{"uri":"Clap","surface_form":"clap","offset":351},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":356},{"uri":"Half","surface_form":"halves","offset":364},{"uri":"Gallop","surface_form":"gallop","offset":410},{"uri":"Distraction","surface_form":"distracted","offset":468},{"uri":"Peasant","surface_form":"peasant","offset":482},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":497},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":529},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":542},{"uri":"Insult","surface_form":"insult","offset":557},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":595}]}
