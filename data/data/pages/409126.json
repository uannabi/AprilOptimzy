Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block. The Head of Household must nominate another HouseGuest as a replacement. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of them, the nominee with the most votes are removed from the show. When only two HouseGuests remain, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be \"expelled\" from the show for not following rules.\nThere have been several controversial remarks from some of the \"Big Brother 15\" HouseGuests. Their comments have angered viewers and because of this, the show's ratings have dropped. Many journalist have made negative reviews about the HouseGuests who made these remarks. HouseGuest including Aaryn Gries, GinaMarie Zimmerman and Spencer Clawson have made racist comments about two African American contestants on the show.
