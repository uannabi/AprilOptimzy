{"id":409191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation","text":"Biodegradation is a chemical process in which materials are dissolved by bacteria or other biological elements. If a material is \"biodegradable\", it means that it can be consumed by microorganisms and turned into compounds that are natural. It is an important process in ecology and waste management. Items that are biodegradable are considered environmentally friendly because they can turn back into elements found in nature.\nOrganic materials, such as those that come from plants and animals, can be degraded aerobically (with oxygen) or anaerobically (without oxygen). Some artificial or inorganic materials can also be biodegraded. It is possible to identify specific microorganisms that are able to biodegrade these materials.\nIn nature, different materials biodegrade at different speeds. Most microorganisms that help biodegradation need light, heat, water and oxygen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":20},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":29},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":46},{"uri":"Dissolution","surface_form":"dissolved","offset":60},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":73},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":91},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":182},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compounds","offset":213},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":271},{"uri":"Waste_management","surface_form":"waste management","offset":283},{"uri":"Environmentally_friendly","surface_form":"environmentally friendly","offset":345},{"uri":"Organic_matter","surface_form":"Organic materials","offset":428},{"uri":"Aerobic_organism","surface_form":"aerobically","offset":512},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":530},{"uri":"Anaerobic_digestion","surface_form":"anaerobically","offset":541},{"uri":"Inorganic_compound","surface_form":"inorganic","offset":592},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":853}]}
