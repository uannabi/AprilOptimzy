{"id":409198,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism","text":"e=\"preserve\">A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques.\nOrganisms that have been genetically modified include micro-organisms such as bacteria and yeast, insects, plants, fish, and mammals. GMOs are the source of genetically modified foods, and are also widely used in scientific research and to produce goods other than food.\n1976\u20131977.\nAlthough Maxam and Gilbert published their chemical sequencing method two years after the ground-breaking paper of Sanger and Coulson on plus-minus sequencing, Maxam\u2013Gilbert sequencing rapidly became more popular, since purified DNA could be used directly, while the initial Sanger method required that each read start be cloned for production of single-stranded DNA. However, with the improvement of the chain-termination method (see below), Maxam-Gilbert sequencing has fallen out of favour due to its technical complexity prohibiting its use in standard molecular biology kits, extensive use of hazardous chemicals, and difficulties with scale-up.\n2004.\nThe first genetically modified black, blue and red rose made in the lab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":57},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":72},{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetic engineering","offset":112},{"uri":"Genetically_modified_food","surface_form":"genetically modified food","offset":301}]}
