{"id":40926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if","text":"In logic and mathematics, if and only if (sometimes abbreviated as iff) is a logical operator denoting a logical biconditional (often symbolized by formula_1 orformula_1). It is often used to conjoin two statements which are logically equivalent.\nIn general, given two statement A and B, the statement \"A if and only if B\" is true precisely when both A and B are true or both A and B are false. In which case, A can be thought of as the logical substitute of B (and vice versa).\nThis makes it clear that Madison will eat all and only those fruits that are apples. She will not leave any apple uneaten, and she will not eat any other type of fruit. That a given fruit is an apple is both a \"necessary\" and a \"sufficient\" condition for Madison to eat the fruit.\nNote that the truth table shown is also equivalent to the XNOR gate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":3},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":13},{"uri":"Logical_biconditional","surface_form":"logical biconditional","offset":105},{"uri":"XNOR_gate","surface_form":"XNOR gate","offset":818}]}
