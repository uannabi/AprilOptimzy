{"id":40934,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax_Films","text":"Miramax Films is an American motion picture distribution and production company. It was headquartered in New York, New York before being bought out by The Walt Disney Company.\nIt was created by the brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein in Buffalo, New York in 1979. The name comes from combining the first names of their parents \"Max\" and \"Miriam\". The company was created to distribute independent films which the major movie studio did not think were worth distributing.\nThe company's first success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producer Martin Lewis. They got the US rights to two concert movies of benefit shows for human rights organization Amnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to combine the two movies into one movie. The movie \"The Secret Policeman's Other Ball\" was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982.\nAmong the company's most well known movies as distributors were \"The Crying Game\", \"sex, lies, and videotape\", \"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!\" and \"Scandal\". The company also made movies such as \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Shakespeare In Love\"\nMiramax also produced many movies which made a lot of money. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film revolution of the 1990s. It produced or distributed seven movies that made more than $100 million at the box office. Its most successful movie, \"Chicago\", earned more than $300 million.\nIn 1993, The Walt Disney Company bought Miramax for $80 million. Harvey and Bob Weinstein ran Miramax until they left the company on September 30, 2005. The Weinstein brothers ran Miramax separately of other Disney companies. However, Disney had the final say on what Miramax could release.\nMiramax also has a family films division, Miramax Family Films.\nMiramax is one of the Big Ten movie studios.\nIn 2011, Disney sold the Miramax library of movies to Filmyard Holdings for $663 million. Home video rights for Miramax's movies also changed. In the United States, Echo Bridge holds the video rights to 250 of Miramax's movies, while Lions Gate Entertainment controls Miramax's 550 other films. Studio Canal holds all home video rights outside of the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":20},{"uri":"Motion_picture","surface_form":"motion picture","offset":29},{"uri":"Distribute","surface_form":"distribution","offset":44},{"uri":"Production","surface_form":"production","offset":61},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York","offset":105},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":115},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"The Walt Disney Company","offset":151},{"uri":"Brother","surface_form":"brother","offset":198},{"uri":"Harvey_Weinstein","surface_form":"Harvey","offset":207},{"uri":"Bob_Weinstein","surface_form":"Bob Weinstein","offset":218},{"uri":"Buffalo%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Buffalo, New York","offset":235},{"uri":"Independent_film","surface_form":"independent film","offset":383},{"uri":"Studios","surface_form":"movie studio","offset":417},{"uri":"Martin_Lewis","surface_form":"Martin Lewis","offset":554},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":581},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":598},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":606},{"uri":"Benefit","surface_form":"benefit","offset":616},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":634},{"uri":"Amnesty_International","surface_form":"Amnesty International","offset":660},{"uri":"The_Secret_Policeman%27s_Other_Ball","surface_form":"The Secret Policeman's Other Ball","offset":769},{"uri":"Success","surface_form":"success","offset":810},{"uri":"Movie_release","surface_form":"release","offset":821},{"uri":"The_Crying_Game","surface_form":"The Crying Game","offset":929},{"uri":"Sex%2C_lies%2C_and_videotape","surface_form":"sex, lies, and videotape","offset":948},{"uri":"Tie_Me_Up%21_Tie_Me_Down%21","surface_form":"Tie Me Up!
