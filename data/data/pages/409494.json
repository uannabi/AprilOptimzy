{"id":409494,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars","text":"The Anglo-Dutch Wars () were a series of wars fought between the English and the Dutch during the 17th and 18th centuries. The two nations fought for control over trade routes on the seas. All of the wars were mostly fought by Naval warfare.\nThe First War (1652\u20131654) took place during the Interregnum in England, the period after the Civil War when England did not have a king or queen. The war was fought between the navies of England and the Dutch Republic (also known as the United Provinces). It mainly took place in the English Channel and the North Sea. It ended with the English Navy gaining control of these seas and a monopoly over trade with the English colonies.\nThe second (1665\u20131667) and third (1672\u20131674) wars happened after the English Restoration of the monarchy. England tried to end the Dutch monopoly over world trade. Most of the fighting in both wars was done in the North Sea. In the Third War, England fought alongside France. Both of these wars ended in strong victories for the Dutch. They confirmed the Dutch Republic's position as the leading maritime power of the 17th century. The English took New Netherland and the Dutch let them keep it in return for Suriname.\nThe Fourth War (1780\u20131784) took place after the Acts of Union in Britain, and involved the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Great Britain. It mainly started because Britain disagreed with the Dutch trading with the United States during the American Revolutionary War. The war ended with the Treaty of Paris (1784). It ended with a very bad defeat for the Dutch. They lost parts of their Dutch Empire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":41},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":65},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":81},{"uri":"Trade_route","surface_form":"trade route","offset":163},{"uri":"Naval_warfare","surface_form":"Naval warfare","offset":227},{"uri":"First_Anglo-Dutch_War","surface_form":"First War","offset":246},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_England","surface_form":"Interregnum","offset":290},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":335},{"uri":"Dutch_Republic","surface_form":"Dutch Republic","offset":445},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":526},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":550},{"uri":"Monopoly","surface_form":"monopoly","offset":628},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":665},{"uri":"Second_Anglo-Dutch_War","surface_form":"second","offset":679},{"uri":"Third_Anglo-Dutch_War","surface_form":"third","offset":702},{"uri":"English_Restoration","surface_form":"English Restoration","offset":744},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"monarchy","offset":771},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":889},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_France","surface_form":"France","offset":943},{"uri":"New_Netherland","surface_form":"New Netherland","offset":1124},{"uri":"Suriname","surface_form":"Suriname","offset":1184},{"uri":"Fourth_Anglo-Dutch_War","surface_form":"Fourth War","offset":1198},{"uri":"Acts_of_Union_1707","surface_form":"Acts of Union","offset":1242},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Kingdom of Great Britain","offset":1308},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1410},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":1435},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)","surface_form":"Treaty of Paris (1784)","offset":1486},{"uri":"Dutch_Empire","surface_form":"Dutch Empire","offset":1582}]}
