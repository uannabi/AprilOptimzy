The advent of League rugby saw their first name change to Newcastle Gosforth as well as a move to the Kingston Park stadium. At the start of the professional era the club adopted its current name of Newcastle Falcons and in 1998 they won the Premiership within a year of winning promotion from the second tier, a feat that has yet to be repeated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rugby_union","surface_form":"rugby","offset":63},{"uri":"Newcastle_upon_Tyne","surface_form":"Newcastle","offset":83},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":94},{"uri":"English_Premiership_(rugby_union)","surface_form":"Aviva Premiership","offset":118},{"uri":"Kingston_Park","surface_form":"Kingston Park stadium.","offset":353},{"uri":"English_Premiership_(rugby_union)","surface_form":"Premiership","offset":493},{"uri":"RFU_Championship","surface_form":"second tier","offset":549}]}
