{"id":40994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality","text":"=\"preserve\">A municipality is a word used for a city, a town or a village, or a small group of them. It has a clearly defined territory, and all the people living on that territory share one common local government.\nIn most countries, a municipality is the smallest administrative subdivision to have its own democratically elected representative leadership. A municipality is usually governed by a mayor and a city or municipal council. The municipality can be created as a municipal corporation.\nIn some countries, municipalities are referred to as \"communes\" (for example, French \"commune\", Italian \"comune\" or Swedish \"kommun\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":48},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":56},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":66},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":126},{"uri":"Local_government","surface_form":"local government","offset":198},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":224},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":266},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democratically","offset":309},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":324},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"representative","offset":332},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":399},{"uri":"Council","surface_form":"council","offset":429},{"uri":"Municipal_corporation","surface_form":"municipal corporation","offset":475},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":576},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":594},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":614}]}
