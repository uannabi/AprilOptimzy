{"id":40995,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem","text":"A problem is a situation preventing something from being achieved. The word comes from a Greek word meaning an \"obstacle\" (something that is in your way). Someone who has a problem must find a way of solving it. The means of solving a problem is called a \"solution\".\nExamples.\n\"John has locked his car keys inside his car so that he cannot get at them. John has a problem\".\nEntertainment examples.\nSome problems are made up for fun. These are like puzzles. Some of them can be solved with logic, others can be solved by trial and error or by a \"heuristic\".\nMathematical examples.\n\"John is three times as old as Mary. In three years time he will be twice as old as Mary. How old are John and Mary?\" The answer to this problem is that John is 9 and Mary is 3.\n\"Peter, Ruth, Samuel and Jessica live in the same house. Peter and Ruth went out. When they returned they found Jessica lying dead, surrounded by glass. They were sure Samuel had done it. Why did they not call the police?\" The answer is: Samuel was the cat and Jessica was a goldfish.\nA well-known example of a problem that cannot be solved is that of squaring the circle \u2013 how to get a square that has the same area as a given circle, using geometry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":489},{"uri":"Trial_and_error","surface_form":"trial and error","offset":520},{"uri":"Heuristic","surface_form":"heuristic","offset":545},{"uri":"Squaring_the_circle","surface_form":"squaring the circle","offset":1110},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":1145},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":1170},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":1200}]}
