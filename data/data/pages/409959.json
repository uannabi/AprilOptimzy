{"id":409959,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_Advance","text":"Axis of Advance was a Canadian black and death metal band from Edmonton, Alberta.\nThe band was formed in 1998 and was formerly known as Sacramentary Abolishment. The band changed their name to Axis of Advance after drummer Paulus Kressman left the band. Axis of Advance was originally suppose to be the title of Sacramentary Abolishment's third album. The band considered J. Read to be a session member because they could not imagine anyone else drumming for them even though his drumming position was apparently permanent.\nThe band released their first EP, \"Landline\" in April 1999.\nThe band split up in 2008. Vermin joined J. Read's band Revenge to play session guitars afterwards and also played for Weapon for a little while.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":22},{"uri":"Black_metal","surface_form":"black","offset":31},{"uri":"Death_metal","surface_form":"death metal","offset":41},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":53},{"uri":"Edmonton","surface_form":"Edmonton","offset":63},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":73},{"uri":"Extended_play","surface_form":"EP","offset":554},{"uri":"Revenge_(band)","surface_form":"Revenge","offset":640},{"uri":"Weapon_(band)","surface_form":"Weapon","offset":703}]}
