{"id":4100,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta","text":"Malta is a country in Europe. It is an island near the center of the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily. The capital of Malta is Valletta. Around 400,000 people live in Malta and it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Its many cities and towns grew close to each other over time.\nLanguage.\nMaltese is the national language of Malta. Maltese and English are the official languages in line with the constitution of the country. A majority of the people of Malta can speak three languages; Maltese, English and Italian.\nMoney.\nMalta had its own currency, called the Maltese Lira until 2008. The Maltese \"Lira\" was better known as the Maltese \"Pound\" because of the strong links to the United Kingdom. One Maltese Lira consisted of 100 \"cents\". In 2008 Malta joined the Euro countries in adopting the Euro as the National Currency.\nHistory.\nPeople have lived in Malta since at least 5200 BC. The island has some key archaeological sites dating from early times.\nMalta became well known as the base of the Knights Hospitaller. They moved to Malta after being forced to leave Palestine and then Rhodes, in Greece. In 1565 they survived a great attack by the Ottoman Empire. The history of the knights at Malta continued the strong Roman Catholic beliefs in the country that were started by the Norman and Spanish rulers.\nIn 1798, Napoleon took control of Malta. The French rule was not popular and in 1800 Maltese rebels invited the British Royal Navy to come to the island. This led to 200 years as a British colony and independent Commonwealth member.\nDuring World War II, Malta was attacked this time by the Axis forces. The entire island was symbolically given the George Cross for heroism.\nMalta became independent in 1964 and a republic in 1974. In 2004 Malta joined the European Union and in 2008 Malta joined the Euro.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":22},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":69},{"uri":"Sicily","surface_form":"Sicily","offset":97},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":109},{"uri":"Valletta","surface_form":"Valletta","offset":129},{"uri":"Dense","surface_form":"dense","offset":201},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"populated","offset":209},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":252},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":263},{"uri":"Maltese_language","surface_form":"Maltese","offset":315},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":339},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":370},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":533},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":567},{"uri":"Maltese_Lira","surface_form":"Maltese Lira","offset":588},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":707},{"uri":"Euro","surface_form":"Euro","offset":791},{"uri":"5200_BC","surface_form":"5200 BC","offset":904},{"uri":"Archeology","surface_form":"archaeological","offset":937},{"uri":"Knights_Hospitaller","surface_form":"Knights Hospitaller","offset":1026},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":1095},{"uri":"Rhodes","surface_form":"Rhodes","offset":1114},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":1177},{"uri":"Roman_Catholicism","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1250},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":1349},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":1385},{"uri":"1800","surface_form":"1800","offset":1420},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":1460},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":1521},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":1529},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":1540},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":1552},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1580},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1665},{"uri":"George_Cross","surface_form":"George Cross","offset":1688},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":1705},{"uri":"1964","surface_form":"1964","offset":1742},{"uri":"1974","surface_form":"1974","offset":1765},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":1774},{"uri":"EU","surface_form":"European Union","offset":1796},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":1818},{"uri":"Euro","surface_form":"Euro","offset":1840}]}
