The label was popular for folk music and blues for the next fifteen years.

This meant he could release recordings by artists who had not actually signed with Vanguard. At this time, Elektra was the main label for folk artists. Their singers, Phil Ochs and Judy Collins, were recorded at Newport, as was a Columbia artist, Bob Dylan.\nIn 1960, he signed Joan Baez.
