{"id":410173,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agly","text":"The Agly River (,) is a river in southern France. It flows mostly to the southeast through the Plain of Roussillon, in the region of Occitanie. It ends in the Mediterranean Sea.\nOn its way to the Mediterranean Sea, it flows through the departments of Aude and Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales.\nGeography.\nThe Agly river is long. Its source is on the Pass of Linas, to the northeast of the Pech de Bugarach, the highest of the Corbi\u00E8res mountains, departments of Aude, at an elevation of.\nIt then goes into the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales by the gorges of Galamus and flows into the Mediterranean Sea south of Barcar\u00E8s.\nThere is a dam on the Agly river, on Caramany, Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales; it was built to prevent floods and to store water.\nHydrology.\nThe Agly is a very irregular small river. Its flow was observed over a period of 42 years (1967-2008) in Estagel about twenty kilometers from its mouth and after receiving the waters of its tributary Verdouble.\nThe discharge of the river at this location is 6.31 m3 per second.\nThe Agly shows typical seasonal fluctuations like other small rivers in southern France. The highest levels of the river are in winter and spring, from December to May inclusive, with the highest level in February. They are followed by a rapid fall in the flow during the low water period that goes from late June to early October.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":24},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":42},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"Plain","offset":95},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":123},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":133},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":159},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":236},{"uri":"Aude","surface_form":"Aude","offset":251},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales","offset":260},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":320},{"uri":"Mountain_pass","surface_form":"Pass","offset":337},{"uri":"Pic_de_Bugarach","surface_form":"Pech de Bugarach","offset":376},{"uri":"Corbi%C3%A8res_(mountains)","surface_form":"Corbi\u00E8res","offset":413},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":423},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":434},{"uri":"Aude","surface_form":"Aude","offset":449},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":461},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales","offset":497},{"uri":"Canyon","surface_form":"gorges","offset":524},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":609},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":690},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":918},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":943},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":1029},{"uri":"Fluctuation","surface_form":"fluctuations","offset":1038},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":1134},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":1145}]}
