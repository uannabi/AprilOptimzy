{"id":41024,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration","text":"Respiration is the process in which nutrients are converted into useful energy in a cell. During respiration, energy is released in a form that can be used by cells. All living things respire. Both plant and animal cells use the process of respiration to release energy from glucose.\nThere are two types of respiration. One is aerobic respiration and the other is anaerobic respiration. This type of respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen Here oxygen is utilised to break down the food (glucose) to release high amount of energy this is called aerobic respiration. This type of respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen. During respiration in yeast and bacteria, oxygen is not involved in the oxidation of food. Food (glucose) is broken down into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide this is called anaerobic respiration.\nSome use oxygen to break down glucose completely into CO2 (Carbon dioxide) and H2O (Water).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":159},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":275},{"uri":"Aerobic_respiration","surface_form":"aerobic respiration","offset":327},{"uri":"Anaerobic_respiration","surface_form":"anaerobic respiration","offset":364}]}
