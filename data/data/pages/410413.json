{"id":410413,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_(artificial_life_series)","text":"\"Creatures\" is a series of artificial life (alife) computer programs. It was created in the mid-1990s by English computer scientist Steve Grand. It was developed by Millennium Interactive. The game is about raising alien creatures known as Norns. This involves teaching them to survive, helping them explore their world, defending them against other animals, and breeding them. The player can also teach the creatures to speak a language, and can then tell their creature to do something by typing in instructions.\nBetween 1996 and 2001, six \"Creatures\" games were released.\nThe program was notable for being one of the first commercial products to create artificial-life animals using genetics, biochemistry and neural network brains. This meant that the Norns and their DNA could \"evolve\" in many different ways. By breeding certain Norns with others, some traits could be passed on to younger generations. The genetics in \"Creatures\" are slightly different from human genetics; they are haploid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Artificial_life","surface_form":"artificial life","offset":27},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":51},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer scientist","offset":113},{"uri":"Millennium_Interactive","surface_form":"Millennium Interactive","offset":165},{"uri":"Alien","surface_form":"alien","offset":215},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":221},{"uri":"Survive","surface_form":"survive","offset":278},{"uri":"Explore","surface_form":"explore","offset":300},{"uri":"Defend","surface_form":"defend","offset":321},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":350},{"uri":"Breeding","surface_form":"breeding","offset":363},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":686},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":696},{"uri":"Neural_network","surface_form":"neural network","offset":713},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":728},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":772},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolve","offset":783},{"uri":"Selective_breeding","surface_form":"breeding","offset":818},{"uri":"Physical_anthropology","surface_form":"human genetics","offset":965},{"uri":"Haploid","surface_form":"haploid","offset":990}]}
