{"id":4105,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi","text":"Shaanxi (Chinese:\u9655\u897F, also sometimes called Shenshi) is a province in east China. The word \"Shaan\" (viz Shanzhou) is a place in Henan Province. \"Xi\" means \"west\". So \"Shaanxi\" means \"the place to the west of Shaan\".\nAlthough in pinyin, \"Shaanxi\" is spelled exactly the same as \"Shanxi\", the only difference in how the two words are pronounced is that the first syllable in \"Shanxi\" is said using the first tone in Mandarin, while the first syllable in \"Shaanxi\" is said with the third tone. Since tone markers are not usually used to show how to pronounce the two different names, the first word in \"Shaanxi\" is spelled using the Gwoyeu Romatzyh method instead, which indicates tones by adding extra letters to a syllable.\nThe river Wei He runs across it. It has a large population of more than 30 million people. The capital of Shaanxi is Xi'an. It abbreviates as Shan (\u9655) or Qin (\u79E6), also known as SanQin (\u4E09\u79E6, meaning \"Three Qins\").\nHistory.\nJanuary 23, 1556 \u2013 A massive earthquake, measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, strikes Shaanxi, killing over 850,000 people. This is the most devastating earthquake in recorded history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":57},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":74},{"uri":"Shanzhou","surface_form":"Shanzhou","offset":103},{"uri":"Henan","surface_form":"Henan","offset":127},{"uri":"Chinese_tone","surface_form":"first tone","offset":399},{"uri":"Chinese_tone","surface_form":"third tone","offset":478},{"uri":"Gwoyeu_Romatzyh","surface_form":"Gwoyeu Romatzyh","offset":629},{"uri":"Wei_He","surface_form":"Wei He","offset":732},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":770},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":797},{"uri":"Xi%27an","surface_form":"Xi'an","offset":839},{"uri":"Qin_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qin","offset":876},{"uri":"January_23","surface_form":"January 23","offset":943},{"uri":"1556","surface_form":"1556","offset":955},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":972},{"uri":"Richter_scale","surface_form":"Richter scale","offset":1005}]}
