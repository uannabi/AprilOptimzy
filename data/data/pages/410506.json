It runs through a valley in the department of the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales, in the former Roussillon. Its drainage basin is the southernmost river basin of Metropolitan France.\nThe river gives its name to two \"communes\" in the department: Le Tech and Arles-sur-Tech.\nGeography.\nThe source of the Tech is on the eastern side of Roc Colom in the Pyrenees at an elevation of, in the \"commune\" of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste.\nIt flows generally from southwest to northeast, first through the valley of Vallespir just to Ceret, and then through the Plain of Rosillon.\nThe Tech flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Natural Reserve of Mas Larrieu, also called \"Mouth of the Tech\", to the north of the town of Argel\u00E8s-sur-Mer.\nThe flow of the Tech river was observed over a period of 38 years (1979-2013) in Argel\u00E8s-sur-Mer, touristic town near the mouth of the river.\nThe discharge of the river at this location is 8.54 m3 per second.\nBoth the valley of the Tech and its mouth are part of Natura 2000, an ecological network of protected areas in the European Union.\nCantons along the river.\nThe Tech is entirely in the department of Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales. It crosses two \"arrondissements\", six \"cantons\" and 25 \"communes\". The two \"arrondissements\" are C\u00E9ret and Perpignan.\nAs for the \"cantons\", the Tech has its source in the \"canton\" of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste, and then flows through the \"cantons\" of Arles-sur-Tech, Canton Ceret, Thuir Canton, Canton Elne and finally Argel\u00E8s-sur-Mer.\nLandmark.\nThe Pont del Diable (\"Devil's bridge\") or Pont Vieux (\"Old bridge\") at C\u00E9ret over the river Tech.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":17},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":39},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":60},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":67},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":115},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales","offset":133},{"uri":"Roussillon","surface_form":"Roussillon","offset":168},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":184},{"uri":"Southernmost","surface_form":"southernmost","offset":206},{"uri":"Basin","surface_form":"basin","offset":225},{"uri":"Metropolitan_France","surface_form":"Metropolitan France","offset":234},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"\"communes\"","offset":287},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":360},{"uri":"Roc_Colom","surface_form":"Roc Colom","offset":405},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":422},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":437},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"\"commune\"","offset":458},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"Plain","offset":619},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":662},{"uri":"Natural_Reserve_of_Mas_Larrieu","surface_form":"Natural Reserve of Mas Larrieu","offset":687},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"touristic","offset":895},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":943},{"uri":"Natura_2000","surface_form":"Natura 2000","offset":1060},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecological","offset":1076},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":1087},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":1121},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"\"arrondissements\"","offset":1240},{"uri":"Cantons_in_France","surface_form":"\"cantons\"","offset":1263},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"\"communes\"","offset":1280}]}
