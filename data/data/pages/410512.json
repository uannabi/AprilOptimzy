{"id":410512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_pedal","text":"An effect pedal is an electronic device that can change the sound of an instrument or the voice of a person. Typical effects include echo, chorus, distortion, tremolo, reverb and flanger. A potentiometer is one of the electronic parts that effect pedals use to change the sound.\nMany guitarists like to use different effect pedals with each other. They stick them to a flat surface to make a pedalboard that they can take with them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronic","surface_form":"electronic","offset":22},{"uri":"Instrument","surface_form":"instrument","offset":72},{"uri":"Voice","surface_form":"voice","offset":90},{"uri":"Echo","surface_form":"echo","offset":133},{"uri":"Choir","surface_form":"chorus","offset":139},{"uri":"Distortion","surface_form":"distortion","offset":147},{"uri":"Tremolo","surface_form":"tremolo","offset":159},{"uri":"Reverb","surface_form":"reverb","offset":168},{"uri":"Flanger","surface_form":"flanger","offset":179},{"uri":"Potentiometer","surface_form":"potentiometer","offset":190},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":284},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":374}]}
