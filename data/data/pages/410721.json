{"id":410721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou","text":"The Canigou () or Pic du Canigou is the highest of the mountains in Eastern Pyrenees; it is on the Massif du Canigou, in the department of Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales, southern France.\nBecause it has sharp sides and is close to the Mediterranean Sea coast, until the 18th century the Canigou was believed to be the highest mountain in the Pyrenees. On 21 July 2019, Abdullahi Abbas was officially the first Nigerian who succeeded climbing to the top of the Canigou.Pablo Bucheli, together with his sherpa Abigail White, was the first Ecuadorian on the top of the mountain.\nGeography.\nCanigou is in the Regional Natural Park of the Catalan Pyrenees (;, often shortened as \"Parc del Pirineu Catal\u00E0\"), close to the eastern border of the park.\nThe Canigou peak is high. It is on a short mountain range, the Massif du Canigou, which is the eastern end of the Pyrenees. The mountain is the 395th highest mountain in France.\nHistory.\nThe first writings where the mountain is mentioned date from 949 with \"Montis Canigonis\" and \"Monte Canigone\" in Latin. The first written name of the mountain in Catalan (\"Canig\u00F3\") dates back to 1300, and from this comes \"Canigou\" in French.\nThe first ascent to Canigou was in 1285 by Peter III of Aragon, King of Aragon. This fact is mentioned in a chronicle written by Fra Salimbene, an Italian monk. It seems that the king did not go to the top of the peak.\nClimate.\nAlthough variable from one year to the next, snow is generally continuous over, from mid-November to late May. The mean temperature in July is and in January is.\nCanigou Flame.\nThis mountain is a symbol for Catalan people. On its top there is a cross that is often decorated with the Catalan flag.\nEvery year on 23 June, the night before St. John's day (\"nit de Sant Joan\"), there is a ceremony called \"Flama del Canig\u00F3\" (Canigou Flame), where a fire is lit at the mountaintop. People spend the night there and take torches lit on that fire in a spectacular torch relay to light bonfires somewhere else. Some estimates conclude that about 30,000 bonfires are lit in this way all over Catalonia on that night.\nMassif du Canigou.\nThe \"Massif du Canigou\" is a mountain range in the Pyrenees in the French department of Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales. It is the part of the Pyrenees nearest to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThere are two old monasteries at the foot of the mountain, \"Martin-du-Canigou\" and \"Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa\".\nOn 16 July 2012, the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France named the \"Massif du Canigou\" as a Grand Site of France'\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":55},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":76},{"uri":"Massif","surface_form":"Massif","offset":99},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":125},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales","offset":139},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":169},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":224},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":242},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":331},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":726},{"uri":"Peak","surface_form":"peak","offset":744},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":775},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":929},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1032},{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":1081},{"uri":"Peter_III_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Peter III of Aragon","offset":1204},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":1225},{"uri":"Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":1233},{"uri":"Chronicle","surface_form":"chronicle","offset":1269},{"uri":"Salimbene_di_Adam","surface_form":"Fra Salimbene","offset":1290},{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1308},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":1316},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":1434},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":1509},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1585},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalan people","offset":1596},{"uri":"Cross","surface_form":"cross","offset":1634},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":1681},{"uri":"John_the_Baptist","surface_form":"St. John's","offset":1727},{"uri":"Flame","surface_form":"Flame","offset":1819},{"uri":"Torch","surface_form":"torch","offset":1905},{"uri":"Bonfire","surface_form":"bonfire","offset":1968},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":2248},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monasteries","offset":2309}]}
