{"id":410755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_in_the_Czech_Republic","text":"Sport is an important part of Czech culture. It is a strong source of patriotism. The two most popular sports in the Czech Republic are football and ice hockey. They both get the most attention from both the media and the public. The many other sports with professional teams in the Czech Republic include basketball, volleyball, handball, athletics, floorball and others.\nThe sporting events considered the most important in the Czech Republic are the Ice Hockey World Championships, the Olympic ice hockey tournament, the European football championship, and the football World Cup. In general, any international match involving the Czech national ice hockey or football team draws attention, especially when played against a traditional rival: Germany and Slovakia in football; and Russia, Finland, Sweden, Canada and Slovakia in ice hockey.\nIce hockey.\nThe Czech national ice hockey team is one of the most successful teams in the world. It regularly competes in the World Championships, the Olympic Games and the Euro Hockey Tour. The national team won their first Olympic Gold medal at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. The Czech team won six World Championship medals between 1996 to 2011. The highest-ranking ice hockey competition in the Czech Republic is the Extraliga. Famous Czech players include Jarom\u00EDr J\u00E1gr, Dominik Ha\u0161ek, Patrik Eli\u00E1\u0161, Ale\u0161 Hemsk\u00FD, Tom\u00E1\u0161 Kaberle, Milan Mich\u00E1lek and Robert Lang.\nFootball.\nFootball has been a popular sport among Czechs for many years. Previously the old Czechoslovakia team were a strong team internationally. In 2006, the Czech national team qualified for their first World Cup since the break-up of Czechoslovokia.

The Czech Association of American football (') was created in 1994. Since then it has developed a league system that is divided into two divisions: \u010CLAF A and \u010CLAF B. The most successful team is Prague Panthers, whom have won 12 titles.\nThe A7 series is an independent league. It was created for small and rookie teams. It is 7-on-7 football. The final match of the season is called Rice bowl.
