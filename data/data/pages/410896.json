{"id":410896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugni","text":"\"Ugni\" is a genus of plants of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae). Four species belong to this genus, all from western America.\nDescription.\nThey are small evergreen shrubs. The leaves are simple, entire, opposite, elliptical; they are 1\u20132\u00A0cm long and 0.2-2.5\u00A0cm broad, dark green, and with a spicy scent if broken into many small pieces.\nThe solitary flowers are usually hanging; they are 1\u20132\u00A0cm diameter with four or five white or pale pink petals and many short stamens. The fruit is a small red or purple berry, 1\u00A0cm in diameter, with many seeds.\nName.\nThe name comes from \"U\u00F1i\" with which the Mapuches (native people from south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina) name the fruits of the best known species of the genus, \"Ugni molinae\".\nThe genus was formerly often included in either \"Myrtus\" or \"Eugenia\"; it is distinguished from these two genera by the hanging flowers with stamens shorter than the petals.\nThe Russian botanist Nicolai Stepanowitsch Turczaninow created the genus \"Ugni\" in 1849.\nWhere it grows.\nAll species of this genus are found in western South and Central America, native from southern Mexico to central southern Chile and Argentina.\nSpecies.\nThere are four species in this genus:'\nUses.\n\"Ugni molinae\" is grown as an ornamental plant and for its edible fruits; these fruits are also used to make jams.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":12},{"uri":"Myrtle","surface_form":"myrtle","offset":35},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":42},{"uri":"Myrtaceae","surface_form":"Myrtaceae","offset":50},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":67},{"uri":"Western","surface_form":"western","offset":106},{"uri":"America","surface_form":"America","offset":114},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":151},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":161},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":173},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":210},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spicy","offset":288},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"scent","offset":294},{"uri":"Flowers","surface_form":"flowers","offset":347},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":392},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"petal","offset":438},{"uri":"Stamen","surface_form":"stamen","offset":460},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":473},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berry","offset":504},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":539},{"uri":"Mapuche","surface_form":"Mapuche","offset":593},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"native people","offset":603},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":679},{"uri":"Myrtus","surface_form":"Myrtus","offset":791},{"uri":"Eugenia","surface_form":"Eugenia","offset":803},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":848},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":920},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":928},{"uri":"Nicolai_Stepanowitsch_Turczaninow","surface_form":"Nicolai Stepanowitsch Turczaninow","offset":937},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":1060},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South","offset":1068},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1078},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1116},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1143},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1153},{"uri":"Ugni_molinae","surface_form":"Ugni molinae","offset":1219},{"uri":"Ornamental_plant","surface_form":"ornamental plant","offset":1248},{"uri":"Jam","surface_form":"jam","offset":1327}]}
