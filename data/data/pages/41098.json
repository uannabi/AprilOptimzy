{"id":41098,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate","text":"The Second Triumvirate was an alliance between Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus. It was formed to punish the conspirators who assassinated Julius Caesar.\nThe Triumvirate lasted from 43 BC to 33 BC. It ended the effort by Marcus Tullius Cicero to make the Senate once again the top body of the Republic. From then on Rome was ruled by an Emperor.\nThe Triumvirate army, led by Octavian and Mark Antony, defeated the Conspirators' army led by Cassius and Brutus. The war ended with the Battle of Philippi in Roman Macedonia in 42 BC. Cassius and Brutus committed suicide and the remainder of their army joined the Triumvirate forces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alliance","surface_form":"alliance","offset":30},{"uri":"Augustus","surface_form":"Octavian","offset":47},{"uri":"Marcus_Antonius","surface_form":"Mark Antony","offset":57},{"uri":"Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus","surface_form":"Lepidus","offset":73},{"uri":"Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"assassinated","offset":127},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":140},{"uri":"Marcus_Tullius_Cicero","surface_form":"Marcus Tullius Cicero","offset":222},{"uri":"Gaius_Cassius_Longinus","surface_form":"Cassius","offset":441},{"uri":"Brutus","surface_form":"Brutus","offset":453},{"uri":"Battle_of_Philippi","surface_form":"Battle of Philippi","offset":484},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":528}]}
