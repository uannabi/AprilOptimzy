{"id":411,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge","text":"e=\"preserve\">Knowledge means the things which are true, as opposed to opinion. Information which is correct is knowledge. Knowledge can always be supported by evidence. If a statement is not supported by evidence, then it is not knowledge. The evidence makes it justified;.\nKnowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. This was the point of Ryle's distinction between \"knowing that\" and \"knowing how\". It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology. The philosopher Plato defined knowledge as \"justified true belief\". This definition is the subject of the Gettier problems.\nBut actually, in the real world, not all swans are white.\nThe most widely accepted way to find reliable knowledge is the scientific method. Yet one thing all philosophers of science agree is that scientific knowledge is just the best we can do at any one time. All scientific knowledge is provisional, not a claim of absolute truth.\nReligion and knowledge.\nKnowledge in religion is different in that it depends on faith, belief and the authority of religious leaders, not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind. There are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge.\nIn many expressions of Christianity, such as Catholicism and Anglicanism, knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.\nIn the Garden of Eden knowledge is the factor that made humans greedy and treacherous. But in the Book of Proverbs it states: 'to be wise you must first obey the LORD' (9:10).\nIn Islam, knowledge has great significance. \"The All-Knowing\" (\"al-\u02BFAl\u012Bm\") is one of the Names of God, reflecting distinct properties of God in Islam. The Qur'an asserts that knowledge comes from God () and various \"hadith\" encourage getting knowledge. Muhammad is reported to have said \"Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave\" and \"Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets\". Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title \"alim\", meaning 'knowledgeable'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"True","surface_form":"true","offset":50},{"uri":"Opinion","surface_form":"opinion","offset":70},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"Information","offset":79},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":159},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":607},{"uri":"Epistemology","surface_form":"epistemology","offset":652},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":682},{"uri":"Gettier_problems","surface_form":"Gettier problems","offset":772},{"uri":"Scientific_method","surface_form":"scientific method","offset":911},{"uri":"Philosophy_of_science","surface_form":"philosophers of science","offset":948},{"uri":"Faith","surface_form":"faith","offset":1204},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":1211},{"uri":"Authority","surface_form":"authority","offset":1226},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":1419},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":1441},{"uri":"Anglicanism","surface_form":"Anglicanism","offset":1457},{"uri":"Holy_Spirit","surface_form":"Holy Spirit","offset":1513},{"uri":"Garden_of_Eden","surface_form":"Garden of Eden","offset":1533},{"uri":"Book_of_Proverbs","surface_form":"Book of Proverbs","offset":1624},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":1857},{"uri":"Hadith","surface_form":"hadith","offset":1918},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":1955}]}
