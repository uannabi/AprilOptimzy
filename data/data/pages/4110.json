{"id":4110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound","text":"Organic compounds are carbon-based compounds. Organic compounds contain carbon bonds in which at least one carbon atom is covalently linked to an atom of another type (usually hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen). Most polymers are organic compounds.\nHistory.\nThe name \" is a historical name from the 19th century.\nPeople believed that only living things could make organic compounds and \"dead\" things (such as minerals) could make inorganic compounds. However, Friedrich W\u00F6hler proved this wrong by synthesizing urea, a well-known organic compound.\nKinds of organic compounds.\nThere are natural organic compounds, and synthetic ones. Their structure may be described by using names, and making diagrams.\nOne way of showing the molecule is by drawing its structural formula. Because molecules can have complicated structures, people have made ways to show them in simple language. One way is to use line diagrams. Each atom is shown by a letter, and connected by a line to each atom with which it is has a covalent bond. One line means a single bond, two lines means a double bond and so on.\nBecause there is in an infinite number of possible organic compounds, language is needed to give a unique name to each one. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, or IUPAC, made a system for doing this. Although an IUPAC name makes every single possible molecule unique, the names are often long and complicated, so in everyday life, \"trivial\" names--unofficial but widely understood names--are used, such as the trivial names Paracetamol, Tylenol, and Acetaminophen, which are used for a compound whose IUPAC name is \"N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide\". Some of these trivial names are trademarks.\nNatural Compounds.\nNatural compounds are compounds made by living beings. These could also be made in a lab, but many of these compounds are taken from nature because it is easier and less expensive to do it that way. For example, every year people grow and eat huge amounts of natural sugar and starch. Other common natural compounds are: amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, many antibiotics like Penicillin and Amoxicillin.\nSynthetic compounds.\nSynthetic compounds are those made by people. Sometimes, this is done by taking something natural and changing the molecule in a small way, such as making glycerin from vegetable oils. Other compounds are synthesized in long, complicated reactions with many steps. Plastics are sometimes mostly natural, and other kinds are manufactured.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":22},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compounds","offset":35},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalently","offset":122},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":176},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":186},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":196},{"uri":"Polymers","surface_form":"polymers","offset":212},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":294},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":404},{"uri":"Inorganic_compound","surface_form":"inorganic compound","offset":425},{"uri":"Urea","surface_form":"urea","offset":506},{"uri":"Diagram","surface_form":"diagram","offset":688},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":721},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent bond","offset":999},{"uri":"IUPAC","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":1267},{"uri":"Paracetamol","surface_form":"Paracetamol","offset":1528},{"uri":"Acetamide","surface_form":"acetamide","offset":1640},{"uri":"Trademark","surface_form":"trademark","offset":1684},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":1982},{"uri":"Starch","surface_form":"starch","offset":1992},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":2036},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":2049},{"uri":"Carbohydrates","surface_form":"carbohydrates","offset":2059},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":2079},{"uri":"Penicillin","surface_form":"Penicillin","offset":2096},{"uri":"Amoxicillin","surface_form":"Amoxicillin","offset":2111},{"uri":"Glycerine","surface_form":"glycerin","offset":2300},{"uri":"Plastics","surface_form":"Plastics","offset":2410},{"uri":"Manufacture","surface_form":"manufacture","offset":2469}]}
