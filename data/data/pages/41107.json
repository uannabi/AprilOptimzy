{"id":41107,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofolk","text":"=\"preserve\">Turbofolk or Pop-folk is a style of music from the Balkans that was invented in the early 1990s. It mostly comes from Greece, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, but it is also popular in other nearby countries. It sounds like a mix of Arabic-style singing (in the Serbian language) with electronic music and rock music.\nTurbofolk is sometimes associated with the recent Balkan wars and the Breakup of Yugoslavia but it is still popular.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Balkans","surface_form":"Balkans","offset":63},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":102},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":130},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":138},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":146},{"uri":"Montenegro","surface_form":"Montenegro","offset":173},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":259},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":288},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic music","offset":311},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock music","offset":332},{"uri":"Breakup_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Breakup of Yugoslavia","offset":414}]}
