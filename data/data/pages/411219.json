Joachim means \"Yahweh prepares\".\nAccording to tradition, Joachim wanted to pray in the temple but was turned away because of his childlessness. He went to a mountaintop to pray to God. An angel appeared to him and his wife, Anna. The angel told Joachim that the Lord heard their prayers and that Anna was with child.\nIt is believed that Anna and Joachim gave Mary to the service of the Temple when she was three years old.\nSt. Joachim and Saint Anna's feast day is July 26.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Virgin_Mary","surface_form":"Virgin Mary","offset":48},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":83},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":278},{"uri":"Saint_Anna","surface_form":"Saint Anna","offset":529}]}
