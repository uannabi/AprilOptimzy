{"id":411319,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massa%27s_in_de_Cold_Ground","text":"\"Massa's in de Cold Ground\" is a minstrel song by Stephen Foster. It was one of only four songs Foster published in 1852. It sold hundreds of copies. Foster received only a 2 cent royalty on each copy sold, but the song earned him US$900 within five years of its publication.\nThe song is written in D major to 4/4 time. An initial phrase is repeated five times, beginning every line except one. The phrase ends with a octave leap upwards in the melody. \"Massa\" is a slow, sad song in dialect written for the minstrel stage.\nThe song tells of slaves weeping at the grave of their deceased European-American master. After the American Civil War, another 'Cold' was entered in the title, the title then becoming, \"Massa's in de Cold, Cold Ground\".\nWhen the novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was first performed as a dramatic adaptation in November 1852 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Foster's home town), \"Massa's in de Cold Ground\" and two other Forster melodies were inserted into the production.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minstrel","surface_form":"minstrel","offset":33},{"uri":"Stephen_Foster","surface_form":"Stephen Foster","offset":50},{"uri":"US%24","surface_form":"US$","offset":231},{"uri":"D_major","surface_form":"D major","offset":299},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":484},{"uri":"Minstrel","surface_form":"minstrel","offset":508},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":624},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":754},{"uri":"Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","offset":845}]}
