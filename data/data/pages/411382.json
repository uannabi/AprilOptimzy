{"id":411382,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response","text":"Systems respond differently to inputs of different frequencies. Some systems may amplify frequencies of certain range and attenuate the other frequencies. The way that the system output is related to the input for different frequencies is called frequency response. Frequency response means a graph where can be seen how something changes in different sound frequency. It is typically used in loudspeakers. Also audio crossovers way to function can be shown with frequency response.\nThe frequency response will be represented by two numbers and measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the unit of measurement for one frequency cycle. The first number represents the lowest bass frequency while the second number indicates the highest high-frequency an audio product can produce.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amplify","surface_form":"amplify","offset":81},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graph","offset":293},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":352},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":358},{"uri":"Loudspeaker","surface_form":"loudspeaker","offset":393},{"uri":"Audio_crossover","surface_form":"audio crossover","offset":412},{"uri":"Hertz","surface_form":"Hertz","offset":557}]}
