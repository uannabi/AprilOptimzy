{"id":4114,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas","text":"Natural gas is a mixture of gas<nowiki/>es. It consists mainly of hydrocarbons. The main component is methane. Natural gas is often found in the ground, either alone or together with petroleum. Landfills and natural processes produce a little methane. Usually it is transported to users in a pipeline.\nMost natural gas is burnt as a fuel to produce energy. It burns with a clean blue flame, causing little pollution.\nNatural gas is burned to produce electricity, to cook and to heat buildings. It is also used as fuel for natural gas vehicles for transport. When natural gas is burned in a power station it boils water into steam that spins a steam turbine that turns a generator to make electricity. Some power stations use natural gas in a gas turbine.\nNatural gas is also converted into many different industrial chemicals. It is the most common feedstock for making pure hydrogen. Hydrogen is used as fuel in fuel cells, and to make ammonia. Ammonia is used as a fuel, as a fertilizer for crops, and for making many other things. Natural gas is also converted into monomers to make many plastic products.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mixture","surface_form":"mixture","offset":17},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":28},{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":66},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":102},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"petroleum","offset":183},{"uri":"Landfill","surface_form":"Landfill","offset":194},{"uri":"Pipeline","surface_form":"pipeline","offset":292},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":333},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":349},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":379},{"uri":"Pollution","surface_form":"pollution","offset":406},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":450},{"uri":"Natural_gas_vehicle","surface_form":"natural gas vehicle","offset":522},{"uri":"Power_station","surface_form":"power station","offset":590},{"uri":"Turbine","surface_form":"turbine","offset":649},{"uri":"Generator","surface_form":"generator","offset":670},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":688},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":875},{"uri":"Fuel_cell","surface_form":"fuel cell","offset":913},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":937},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":978},{"uri":"Monomer","surface_form":"monomer","offset":1069}]}
