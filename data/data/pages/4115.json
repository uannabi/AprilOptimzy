{"id":4115,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy","text":"Scientific energy.\nIn physics, energy is the capacity to do work; the influence required to perform an action. The amount of energy in a system is the amount of change that can be made to it.\nConservation of Energy.\nEnergy is a property that is not created or destroyed, although energy can change in detectable form. This is a rule that is commonly understood as the \"conservation law of energy\". In respects to this rule, the total amount of energy that exists within an isolated system will always be the same, no matter what changes have been made to it.\nIn the early 20th century, scientist were able to discover that matter itself can be created from energy and vice versa. This is just another change of form. After these discoveries, the conservation law of energy was extended to become the conservation law of matter and energy: matter and energy can neither be created from nothing nor destroyed to the point of complete erasure from reality. Albert Einstein was the first to mathematically derive this in the formula E = mc2.\nMatter can be created from energy or converted into energy through the use of processes, such as nuclear fission or nuclear fusion.\nMeasuring energy.\nEnergy can be measured. The amount of energy a thing has can be given a number.\nAs in other kinds of measurements, there are measurement units. The units of measurement for measuring energy are used to make the numbers meaningful.\nThe SI unit for both energy and work is the joule (J). It is named after James Prescott Joule. 1 joule is equal to 1 newton-metre. In terms of SI base units, 1 J is equal to 1 kg m2 s\u22122. It is most often used in science, though particle physics often uses the electronvolt.\nThe measurement for electricity most often uses the kilowatt-hour (kW\u00B7h). One kW\u00B7h is equivalent to 3,600,000 J (3600 kJ or 3.6 MJ).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Work_(physics)","surface_form":"work","offset":60},{"uri":"Conservation_of_energy","surface_form":"conservation law of energy","offset":369},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":623},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":954},{"uri":"Nuclear_fission","surface_form":"nuclear fission","offset":1135},{"uri":"Nuclear_fusion","surface_form":"nuclear fusion","offset":1154},{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measure","offset":1202},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":1260},{"uri":"Units_of_measurement","surface_form":"units of measurement","offset":1336},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":1423},{"uri":"James_Prescott_Joule","surface_form":"James Prescott Joule","offset":1492},{"uri":"Newton-metre","surface_form":"newton-metre","offset":1536},{"uri":"Particle_physics","surface_form":"particle physics","offset":1647},{"uri":"Electronvolt","surface_form":"electronvolt","offset":1679},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":1713},{"uri":"Kilowatt","surface_form":"kilowatt","offset":1745}]}
