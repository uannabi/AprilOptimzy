{"id":41151,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Food preservation is about the ways and means which help to preserve food. Food spoils from bacteria if it is not treated. For thousands of years, humans have used methods of preserving food, so that they can store food to eat later. The simplest methods of preserving food, such as drying strips of fish or meat in the hot sun have been used for thousands of years, and they are still used today by indigenous peoples. The other ancient method is to use salt, and often drying and salting are done together.\nUsually several of the techniques are combined.\nMultiple methods.\nMany common methods use several of these approaches at the same time. For example, pickles preserved in a jar are heated then put in a mixture of vinegar and brine. Fruit jams and jellies are heated and mixed with a large amount of sugar. Some preserved fruit is heated and then mixed with alcohol (for example, Brandy) and a large amount of sugar. Smoked hams are cured in brine and then exposed to the smoke from burning wood chips.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":82},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":105},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":313},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":321},{"uri":"Indigenous_people","surface_form":"indigenous people","offset":413}]}
