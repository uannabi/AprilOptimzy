{"id":411705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pays_de_Caux","text":"The Pays de Caux () is an area in Normandy, France. It makes up the greater part of the French \"d\u00E9partement\" of Seine Maritime in Normandy. It is a chalk plateau to the north of the Seine Estuary and extends to the cliffs on the English Channel coast. Its coastline is called the C\u00F4te d'Alb\u00E2tre. In the east, it borders on the Pays de Bray where the layers of soil below the chalk show through.\nThe area depends on manufacturing more than as agriculture. Even so, the soil quality of the Pays de Caux is the finest in France. It is also known for its fine fabrics.\nCauchois is a dialect of the Norman language. The Pays de Caux is one of the last places outside the Cotentin Peninsula where the Norman language is spoken. Its main cities are Le Havre, Dieppe, F\u00E9camp, Yvetot and \u00C9tretat.\nIn the Norman language \"caux\" means lime, calcium carbonate.\nArtistic connections.\nThe rugged scenery of the Pays de Caux is only a short distance from Paris. Artists including Claude Monet and Gustave Courbet came there to paint.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":34},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":44},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":88},{"uri":"D%C3%A9partement_in_France","surface_form":"d\u00E9partement","offset":96},{"uri":"Seine_Maritime","surface_form":"Seine Maritime","offset":112},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":130},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":148},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":154},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"Estuary","offset":188},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":215},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":229},{"uri":"C%C3%B4te_d%27Alb%C3%A2tre","surface_form":"C\u00F4te d'Alb\u00E2tre","offset":280},{"uri":"Pays_de_Bray","surface_form":"Pays de Bray","offset":327},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":360},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":415},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":442},{"uri":"Fabric","surface_form":"fabric","offset":556},{"uri":"Cauchois_dialect","surface_form":"Cauchois","offset":565},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":579},{"uri":"Norman_language","surface_form":"Norman language","offset":594},{"uri":"Cotentin_Peninsula","surface_form":"Cotentin Peninsula","offset":666},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":731},{"uri":"Le_Havre","surface_form":"Le Havre","offset":742},{"uri":"Dieppe%2C_Seine-Maritime","surface_form":"Dieppe","offset":752},{"uri":"F%C3%A9camp","surface_form":"F\u00E9camp","offset":760},{"uri":"Yvetot","surface_form":"Yvetot","offset":768},{"uri":"%C3%89tretat","surface_form":"\u00C9tretat","offset":779},{"uri":"Norman_language","surface_form":"Norman language","offset":795},{"uri":"Lime_(mineral)","surface_form":"lime","offset":824},{"uri":"Calcium_carbonate","surface_form":"calcium carbonate","offset":830},{"uri":"Rugged","surface_form":"rugged","offset":875},{"uri":"Scenery","surface_form":"scenery","offset":882},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":940},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"Artist","offset":947},{"uri":"Claude_Monet","surface_form":"Claude Monet","offset":965},{"uri":"Gustave_Courbet","surface_form":"Gustave Courbet","offset":982},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"paint","offset":1012}]}
