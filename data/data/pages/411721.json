{"id":411721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology","text":"Surface-mount technology (SMT) uses electronic devices that are made to be placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs).\nExamples of surface-mount devices are resistors, capacitors, LEDs and integrated circuits. Surface mounted devices are generally smaller than those used in the older through-hole technology, which need longer leads and holes in the circuit board.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Printed_circuit_board","surface_form":"printed circuit board","offset":111},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":168},{"uri":"Resistor","surface_form":"resistor","offset":180},{"uri":"Capacitor","surface_form":"capacitor","offset":191},{"uri":"LED","surface_form":"LED","offset":203},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":212},{"uri":"Through-hole_technology","surface_form":"through-hole technology","offset":308}]}
