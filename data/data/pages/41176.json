{"id":41176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_de_Gheyn_III_(painting)","text":"Jacob de Gheyn III is a famous painting.\nIt was painted by Rembrandt in 1632 and is the most stolen painting in the world. It has been stolen and recovered from galleries at least four times, making it the world's most stolen painting.\nEvery time the painting has been recovered anonymously and as a consequence nobody was accused of the theft. This painting by Rembrandt is so well known that it would be difficult for a thief to take it again.\nJacob de Gheyn III, also known as Jacob III de Gheyn (1596\u20131641), was a Dutch Golden Age engraver, son of Jacob de Gheyn II, canon of Utrecht (city), and the subject of a 1632 oil painting by Rembrandt. The portrait is half of a pair of pendent portraits. The other piece is a portrait of de Gheyn's friend Maurits Huygens, wearing similar clothing (ruffs and black doublets) and facing the opposite direction\nAs legend goes, a man by the name of Marcus Smith V was found in a gallery sneaking and slowly making his way toward the painting with intent to steal it. The ghost of Jacob de Gheyn III sneaked up behind him and killed him. the legend is most likely untrue because Smith was with a lover that night and was actually poisoned the next night.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Famous","surface_form":"famous","offset":24},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":31},{"uri":"Rembrandt","surface_form":"Rembrandt","offset":59},{"uri":"Galleries","surface_form":"galleries","offset":161}]}
