{"id":41206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Islam","text":"Yusuf Islam (born July 21, 1948) is an English singer. He sang many of his early songs when he called himself \"Cat Stevens\". He was born as Stephen Demetre Georgiou to a Swedish mother and Greek father. He became a Muslim in 1977. After 2 years, he took the name of Yusuf \u0130slam. He has sold over 60 million albums around the world since the late 1960s as Cat Stevens or Yusuf \u0130slam.\nAs a waiter in his father's cafe, he began writing songs \"to escape the mundanity of it all\". Chart success was followed by adulation, touring, drug use, confusion, tuberculosis and, in the early 1970s, Islam's changed outlook and an album called Tea For The Tillerman.\nStevens nearly drowned in an accident in Malibu in 1975. Stevens described the event in a VH1 interview some years later: \"I suddenly held myself and I said, 'Oh God! If you save me, I'll work for you.'\" He had looked into Buddhism; Zen and I Ching, numerology, tarot cards and astrology\", but when his brother David gave him a copy of the Qu'ran, Stevens began to convert to Islam.\nIn 1977 he changed his name to Yusuf Islam upon becoming a Muslim. He stopped playing and recording pop music for almost 30 years, but started performing again in 2006.\nHe lives with his family in London, England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":39},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":47},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":170},{"uri":"Greeks","surface_form":"Greek","offset":189},{"uri":"Malibu","surface_form":"Malibu","offset":694},{"uri":"VH1","surface_form":"VH1","offset":743},{"uri":"Qu%27ran","surface_form":"Qu'ran","offset":993},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1029},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":1095},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1233},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1241}]}
