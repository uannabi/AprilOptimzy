{"id":412304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate","text":"=\"preserve\">An interest rate is how much interest is paid by borrowers for the money that they borrow. It is usually a percentage of the sum borrowed. So, a simple 10% interest means that if one borrows $100, one pays back $110.\nInterest rates in a country are usually guided by a base rate set by its central bank. The interest rate to businesses and citizens is always above the base rate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interest","surface_form":"interest","offset":41},{"uri":"Percentage","surface_form":"percentage","offset":119},{"uri":"Central_bank","surface_form":"central bank","offset":302}]}
