{"id":412348,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_loudspeaker","text":"An electrostatic loudspeaker is a design of speaker. The sound is generated by force placed on a membrane suspended in an electrostatic field. The electrostatic loudspeaker is almost like magnetostatic loudspeaker but it does not use high currents, it uses high voltages. The membrane (a thin film) is controlled by voltage, and it moves between metal plates which are full of small holes.\nThe sound quality from modern models of electrostatic loudspeaker is good.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Loudspeaker","surface_form":"speaker","offset":44},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":79},{"uri":"Membrane","surface_form":"membrane","offset":97},{"uri":"Electrostatic_field","surface_form":"electrostatic field","offset":122},{"uri":"Magnetostatic_loudspeaker","surface_form":"magnetostatic loudspeaker","offset":188},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":239},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":262}]}
