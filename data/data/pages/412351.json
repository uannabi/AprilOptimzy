He said, \"That's not to say that Amazing Alex isn't an addictive experience - it's just that compared to Angry Birds, there's less excitement involved. You rarely feel like throwing your arms in the air when you've completed a puzzle, for example, and the absence of any kind of antagonist reduces the stakes slightly.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rovio_Entertainment","surface_form":"Rovio Entertainment","offset":51},{"uri":"Puzzle_game","surface_form":"puzzle game","offset":77},{"uri":"Google_Play","surface_form":"Google Play","offset":101},{"uri":"Pocket_Gamer","surface_form":"Pocket Gamer","offset":159},{"uri":"Angry_Birds","surface_form":"Angry Birds","offset":219}]}
