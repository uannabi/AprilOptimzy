It is different from earlier markets or bazaars because most of the shops are not little booths or stalls in one big open area. Each store has its own space with walls. Most of their entrances face a central walking area inside the building.\nName.\n\"Mall\" is the most common name for these buildings in American English, and \"shopping centre\" is the most common name for them in British English. Americans also talk about \"shopping centers\", but they use their spelling for the word \"center\". Malls are also sometimes called plazas.\nOverview.\nPeople visit the stores in the mall to shop. Most malls have parking lots (places to park cars). Most malls also have roofs so people can shop inside. Most malls have a food court. Food courts are areas where people buy food. Some malls have movie theatres.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":37},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":75},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"store","offset":85},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":122},{"uri":"Bazaar","surface_form":"bazaar","offset":133},{"uri":"Booth","surface_form":"booth","offset":182},{"uri":"Stall","surface_form":"stall","offset":192},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":395},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":471},{"uri":"Plaza","surface_form":"plaza","offset":617},{"uri":"Shopping","surface_form":"shop","offset":674},{"uri":"Parking_lot","surface_form":"parking lot","offset":696},{"uri":"Cars","surface_form":"cars","offset":725},{"uri":"Food_court","surface_form":"food court","offset":804},{"uri":"Movie_theatre","surface_form":"movie theatre","offset":877}]}
