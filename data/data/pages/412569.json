{"id":412569,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party_(Anti-Communist)","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"This group should not be confused with the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), which was a name used by supporters of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang in the 1930s.\"\nThe Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) (ALP-AC) was the name used by the right-wing group which split away from the Australian Labor Party in 1955. It later became the Democratic Labor Party in 1957.\nFrank McManus was elected to the Senate for Victoria and former ALP senator George Cole was re-elected to the Senate for Tasmania. Later Frank Scully gained the seat of Richmond in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the May 1955 Victorian election.\nThe members of the ALP (Anti-Communist) were mostly Roman Catholic. There were only two non-Catholics, its federal leader, Bob Joshua, who represented Ballarat in the Australian House of Representatives, and Jack Little, who led the party in the Victoria Legislative Council between 1955 and 1958. It has been suggested that the party was mainly people of Irish background, and the ALP split of 1955 was the removal of the Irish-Catholics from the ALP. However, many ALP (Anti-Communist) members were not Irish. The party attracted many voters among migrants from Catholic countries in southern Europe, and among anti-Communist Eastern European refugees. In 1957, the party became the Democratic Labor Party, which closed in 1978.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party_(Non-Communist)","surface_form":"Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist)","offset":57},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":136},{"uri":"Jack_Lang_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"Jack Lang","offset":160},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":263},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party_split_of_1955","surface_form":"split","offset":286},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Australian Labor Party","offset":306},{"uri":"Democratic_Labor_Party_(1955-78)","surface_form":"Democratic Labor Party","offset":358},{"uri":"Frank_McManus_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"Frank McManus","offset":390},{"uri":"Senate_of_Australia","surface_form":"Senate","offset":423},{"uri":"George_Cole_(politician)","surface_form":"George Cole","offset":466},{"uri":"Frank_Scully_(politician)","surface_form":"Frank Scully","offset":527},{"uri":"Victorian_Legislative_Assembly","surface_form":"Victorian Legislative Assembly","offset":575},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":694},{"uri":"Bob_Joshua","surface_form":"Bob Joshua","offset":765},{"uri":"Ballarat","surface_form":"Ballarat","offset":793},{"uri":"Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian House of Representatives","offset":809},{"uri":"Jack_Little_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"Jack Little","offset":850},{"uri":"Victoria_Legislative_Council","surface_form":"Victoria Legislative Council","offset":888},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":998},{"uri":"Migrant","surface_form":"migrant","offset":1192},{"uri":"Refugees","surface_form":"refugees","offset":1287},{"uri":"Democratic_Labor_Party_(historical)","surface_form":"Democratic Labor Party","offset":1327}]}
