{"id":412696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_People%27s_Army","text":"The National People's Army (NPA;, \"NVA\") was the armed forces of East Germany.\nThe NPA was founded on 1 March 1956. It developed from the \"Kasernierte Volkspolizei\" (Barracked People's Police), which was started in 1952. Serving with the army was voluntary at first. Conscription was introduced on 24 January 1962. Conscription was for male citizens between the ages of 18 and 26. If they were selected, they had to serve in the NPA for 18 months. The NVA was at its largest in 1987. It had about 175,000 soldiers at this time.\nThe NVA was modeled on Soviet military philosophy. Its leadership and operations were governed by the officer corp. The non-commissioned officer corps was limited in terms of authority and responsibility, unlike in the West German army. There were also political officers throughout the NVA, whose job it was to guarantee the loyalty of the military to the ruling political party.\nOrganization.\nThe NVA also had a large number of reserve and paramilitary forces. These could be called to serve during a crisis.\nThe NVA was merged into the Bundeswehr in October 1990 upon the reunification of Germany. The merging of the two German militaries was not done equally. Many non-commissioned officers and almost all commissioned officers were not accepted into the Bundeswehr. Instead, they were discharged from service. Those who were given a place in the Bundeswehr were usually demoted by one rank. Most of the barracks were closed and much of the NVA's equipment was sold or donated to other nations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"East Germany","offset":65},{"uri":"Voluntary","surface_form":"voluntary","offset":247},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"Conscription","offset":267},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":551},{"uri":"Non-commissioned_officer","surface_form":"non-commissioned officer","offset":648},{"uri":"West_Germany","surface_form":"West German","offset":747},{"uri":"Loyalty","surface_form":"loyalty","offset":854},{"uri":"Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"ruling political party","offset":885},{"uri":"Military_reserve","surface_form":"reserve","offset":958},{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":970},{"uri":"Bundeswehr","surface_form":"Bundeswehr","offset":1067},{"uri":"German_reunification","surface_form":"reunification of Germany","offset":1103},{"uri":"Barracks","surface_form":"barracks","offset":1436}]}
