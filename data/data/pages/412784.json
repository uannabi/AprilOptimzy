{"id":412784,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingelger","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ingelger (or Ingelgarius) (\u2020) was a Frankish nobleman who became the first count of Anjou. He began a dynasty known as House of Ingelger.\nCareer.\nIngelger was the son of a Frankish nobleman Tertullus and his wife Petronilla. She was the niece of Raino, Bishop of Angers. Petronilla was also a relative of Hugh the Abbot, an counselor to both Louis II and Louis III of France. His mother's influence was one of the reasons for Ingelger's success. Records of the time call Ingelger a \"miles optimus\" (a great military man). Louis II appointed Ingelger as viscount of Orl\u00E9ans which at the time was under the rule of the Bishop of Orl\u00E9ans. While at Orl\u00E9ans Ingelger married Adelais. Later Ingelger was appointed prefect (military commander) at Tours. Some time after this Ingelger was made Count of Anjou. At this time the county went only as far west as the Mayenne River. He was buried in the church of Saint-Martin at Ch\u00E2teauneuf-sur-Sarthe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%E2%80%A0","surface_form":"\u2020","offset":40},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Frankish","offset":49},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":58},{"uri":"Count_of_Anjou","surface_form":"count of Anjou","offset":88},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"dynasty","offset":115},{"uri":"House_of_Ingelger","surface_form":"House of Ingelger","offset":132},{"uri":"Hugh_the_Abbot","surface_form":"Hugh the Abbot","offset":318},{"uri":"Louis_II_of_France","surface_form":"Louis II","offset":355},{"uri":"Louis_III_of_France","surface_form":"Louis III of France","offset":368},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":402},{"uri":"Viscount","surface_form":"viscount","offset":566},{"uri":"Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Orl\u00E9ans","offset":578},{"uri":"Prefect","surface_form":"prefect","offset":721},{"uri":"Count_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Count of Anjou","offset":799},{"uri":"Mayenne_River","surface_form":"Mayenne River","offset":868},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teauneuf-sur-Sarthe","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teauneuf-sur-Sarthe","offset":930}]}
