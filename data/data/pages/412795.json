{"id":412795,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndall_effect","text":"The Tyndall effect is when light is scattered by particles of matter in its path. It makes a beam of light visible by lighting the particles.\nUnder the Tyndall effect, the longer-wavelength light is more transmitted while the shorter-wavelength light is more reflected by scattering. In effect, blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light.\nThe blue of a clear sky, and the blue of blue eyes is caused by the Tyndall effect, not by a pigment. Its named after John Tyndall.\nTyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":27},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":179},{"uri":"Scatter","surface_form":"scattering","offset":272},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":374},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":447}]}
