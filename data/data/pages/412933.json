{"id":412933,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell","text":"A cytotoxic T cell is a type of white blood cell. It is a T lymphocyte which kills cancer cells, cells infected with viruses, or cells that are damaged in other ways.\nMost cytotoxic T cells have T-cell receptors (TCRs) which recognize a specific antigen from a cancer cell or virus.\nAntigens inside a cell are brought to the surface of the cell by major histocompatibility complex molecules, where they can be recognized by the T cell. If the TCR is specific for that antigen, it binds to the complex of MHC molecule and antigen, and the T cell destroys the cell.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"White_blood_cell","surface_form":"white blood cell","offset":32},{"uri":"T_cell","surface_form":"T lymphocyte","offset":58},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":83},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":117},{"uri":"T-cell_receptor","surface_form":"T-cell receptor","offset":195},{"uri":"Antigen","surface_form":"antigen","offset":246},{"uri":"Antigen","surface_form":"Antigens","offset":283},{"uri":"Major_histocompatibility_complex","surface_form":"major histocompatibility complex","offset":348}]}
