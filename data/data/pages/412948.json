This album is about war and politics. This is because of songs like \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". The album was named \"War\" because of what was happening in the world while they were recording. Bono said that \"everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war.\"\n\"War\" sold well for the band right away.
