{"id":413009,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulk_II_of_Anjou","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fulk II of Anjou (\u2013960), called the good (), was a French nobleman and the Count of Anjou from 942 to his death in 960.\nCareer.\nFulk II was born about 905. He was the son of Fulk the Red and his wife Roscilla de Loches. She was a daughter of Warnerius, Seigneur de Villentrois. He succeeded his father in 942 as the second count of Anjou (also called the count of Angers) and remained in power until 960.\nThe Angevins, Fulk II included, had become very good at making marriage alliances that helped their goals. His father, Fulk the Red, had arranged his marriage to a Carolingian, Gerberga, the daughter of Ratburnus I Viscount of Vienne. Among other things this marriage made it possible for their daughter Adelaide-Blanche to marry a future king of France. It made them important enough for their son Guy to become Bishop of le Puy.\nAfter Gerberga died Fulk made another astute political marriage. He married Adelaide, the widow of Alan II, Duke of Brittany. Alan II had also been Count of Nantes and the marriage probably gave Fulk control of Nantes. Adelaide was also the sister of Theobald I, Count of Blois. This allowed Fulk II to form an alliance with the House of Blois. Fulk died in 960. He was succeeded by his son Geoffrey Greymantle.\nFamily.\nBy his second wife Adelaide, he had no children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":64},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":71},{"uri":"Count_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Count of Anjou","offset":88},{"uri":"Fulk_I_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Fulk the Red","offset":187},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"count","offset":336},{"uri":"Anjou","surface_form":"Anjou","offset":345},{"uri":"Angevins","surface_form":"Angevins","offset":422},{"uri":"Alliances","surface_form":"alliances","offset":490},{"uri":"Arranged","surface_form":"arranged","offset":555},{"uri":"Carolingian","surface_form":"Carolingian","offset":582},{"uri":"Viscount","surface_form":"Viscount","offset":633},{"uri":"Vienne","surface_form":"Vienne","offset":645},{"uri":"Adelaide-Blanche_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Adelaide-Blanche","offset":722},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":757},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":765},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"Bishop","offset":831},{"uri":"Astute","surface_form":"astute","offset":887},{"uri":"Widow","surface_form":"widow","offset":939},{"uri":"Alan_II%2C_Duke_of_Brittany","surface_form":"Alan II, Duke of Brittany","offset":948},{"uri":"Count_of_Nantes","surface_form":"Count of Nantes","offset":997},{"uri":"Nantes","surface_form":"Nantes","offset":1060},{"uri":"Theobald_I%2C_Count_of_Blois","surface_form":"Theobald I, Count of Blois","offset":1100},{"uri":"House_of_Blois","surface_form":"House of Blois","offset":1178},{"uri":"Geoffrey_I_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Geoffrey Greymantle","offset":1240}]}
