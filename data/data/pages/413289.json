{"id":413289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Duccini","text":"Ruth Duccini (July 23, 1918 \u2013 January 16, 2014) was an American actress and writer. She was one of the last two surviving Munchkins from the 1939 movie \"The Wizard of Oz\". The other is Jerry Maren. Duccini was the last surviving female from the movie and also the oldest.\nHer role in the movie as a Munchkin villager was not credited. Her most recent appearance was when she (along with the other surviving Munchkins from \"The Wizard of Oz\") was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nWhile Duccini could not remember what she earned filming \"Oz\" in 2013. She said that the Munchkin village actors were paid $125 a week during filming.\nDuccini made the news again when Baroness Margaret Thatcher died and critics of the former Prime Minister tried to propel \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" on the radio charts to celebrate her passing. Duccini and Maren both called the campaign \"terrible\" and were saddened by the movement while insisting the song was never to be used in such a way.\nDuccini died on January 16, 2014 from natural causes in Las Vegas, Nevada, aged 95.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":55},{"uri":"The_Wizard_of_Oz","surface_form":"The Wizard of Oz","offset":153},{"uri":"Jerry_Maren","surface_form":"Jerry Maren","offset":185},{"uri":"The_Wizard_of_Oz","surface_form":"The Wizard of Oz","offset":423},{"uri":"Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame","surface_form":"Hollywood Walk of Fame","offset":475},{"uri":"Margaret_Thatcher","surface_form":"Margaret Thatcher","offset":692},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":741},{"uri":"Las_Vegas","surface_form":"Las Vegas","offset":1054},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":1065}]}
