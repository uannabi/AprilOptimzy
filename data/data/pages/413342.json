The only vegetation that can develop there is of plants that grow on or among rocks.\nThere are two main types of vegetation: one with heathers, widespread on the island, and another with few herbaceous plants. A special feature for this altitude is the presence of small shrubs and heather trees.\nWildlife.\nSome birds found on Pico Ruivo are the common blackbird, chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. The red-legged partridge and the common linnet also nest on Pico Ruivo.\nUntil a few years ago, its slopes were used for raising goats, sheep and cows. However, to conserve the biodiversity in the region (such as the protection of the bird \"freira-da-madeira\" and plant communities in altitude), this practice was prohibited and the entire area around the peak is recovering.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Madeira","surface_form":"Madeira","offset":87},{"uri":"Mount_Pico","surface_form":"Mount Pico","offset":135},{"uri":"Pico_Island","surface_form":"Pico Island","offset":149},{"uri":"Azores","surface_form":"Azores","offset":162},{"uri":"Torre_(Serra_da_Estrela)","surface_form":"Torre","offset":174},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":183},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":195},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":262},{"uri":"Santana%2C_Madeira","surface_form":"Santana","offset":278},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rocky","offset":453},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":459},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":479},{"uri":"Ericaceae","surface_form":"heather","offset":604},{"uri":"Herbaceous","surface_form":"herbaceous","offset":661},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":741},{"uri":"Heather","surface_form":"heather","offset":752},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":760},{"uri":"Blackbird","surface_form":"blackbird","offset":823},{"uri":"Chaffinch","surface_form":"chaffinch","offset":834},{"uri":"Madeira_firecrest","surface_form":"Madeira firecrest","offset":852},{"uri":"Red-legged_partridge","surface_form":"red-legged partridge","offset":875},{"uri":"Linnet","surface_form":"linnet","offset":911},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":923},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":999},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":1006},{"uri":"Cows","surface_form":"cows","offset":1016},{"uri":"Zino%27s_Petrel","surface_form":"\"freira-da-madeira\"","offset":1110}]}
