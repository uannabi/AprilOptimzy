{"id":413344,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Friso_of_Orange-Nassau","text":"Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau (Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg; 25 September 1968 \u2013 12 August 2013) was a member of the Dutch Royal Family.\nHe was born on 25 September 1968 in the University Medical Center in Utrecht, Netherlands to Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus. He was a younger brother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. Because of his marriage without an Act of Consent in 2004, he lost his membership of the Dutch Royal House and was no longer in the line of succession to the Dutch throne. He worked as chief financial officer for Urenco Group.\nOn 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, while skiing off piste. He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck where he was in critical but stable condition.\nAccording to his doctor, even though he was trapped for a relatively short time and hopes had originally been higher, subsequent neurological tests showed that after fifty minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in moderate hypothermia he suffered massive brain damage due to oxygen shortage. The prince was in a minimally conscious state and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness. After nearly a year and a half in a coma, he died on 12 August 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dutch_Royal_Family","surface_form":"Dutch Royal Family","offset":156},{"uri":"University_Medical_Center_Utrecht","surface_form":"University Medical Center","offset":216},{"uri":"Utrecht_(city)","surface_form":"Utrecht","offset":245},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":254},{"uri":"Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Princess Beatrix","offset":269},{"uri":"Prince_Claus_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Prince Claus","offset":290},{"uri":"Willem-Alexander_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands","offset":332},{"uri":"Dutch_Royal_House","surface_form":"Dutch Royal House","offset":463},{"uri":"Chief_financial_officer","surface_form":"chief financial officer","offset":559},{"uri":"Urenco_Group","surface_form":"Urenco Group","offset":587},{"uri":"Lech_am_Arlberg","surface_form":"Lech","offset":668},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":674},{"uri":"Off_piste","surface_form":"off piste","offset":696},{"uri":"Innsbruck","surface_form":"Innsbruck","offset":737},{"uri":"Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","surface_form":"cardiopulmonary resuscitation","offset":977},{"uri":"Minimally_conscious_state","surface_form":"minimally conscious state","offset":1108}]}
