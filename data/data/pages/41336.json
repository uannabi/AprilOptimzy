{"id":41336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues","text":"Rhythm and blues (also known as R&B or RnB) is a popular music genre combining jazz, gospel, and blues influences, first performed by African American artists. It is now performed worldwide by people of many cultures and ethnic groups.\nContemporary R&B.\nDuring the 1980s, James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone had used parts of psychedelic rock and other styles in their music. Funk became a big part of disco music. In the early 1980s, funk and soul had become sultry and more sexual with the work of Prince and others. The modern style of \"contemporary R&B\" came to be a major part of American popular music.\nR&B today defines a style of African-American music. It combines elements of soul music, funk music, pop music, and (after 1986) hip hop in what is now called \"contemporary R&B\".\nIt is sometimes called \"urban contemporary\" or \"urban pop\".\nR&B in the 2000s.\nBy the 2000s, the only big difference between a record being a hip hop record or an R&B record is whether its vocals are rapped or sung. R&B started to focus more on solo artists than groups. By 2005, the most famous R&B artists include Usher, Beyonc\u00E9 (formerly of Destiny's Child), Ashanti, and Mariah Carey.\nSoulful R&B continues to be popular, with artists such as Alicia Keys, R. Kelly, John Legend, and Toni Braxton. Some R&B singers have used parts of Caribbean music in their work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"popular music","offset":49},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":79},{"uri":"Gospel_music","surface_form":"gospel","offset":85},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":97},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":134},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":208},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":221},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":265},{"uri":"James_Brown_(musician)","surface_form":"James Brown","offset":272},{"uri":"Sly_%26amp%3B_the_Family_Stone","surface_form":"Sly & the Family Stone","offset":288},{"uri":"Psychedelic_rock","surface_form":"psychedelic rock","offset":329},{"uri":"Disco","surface_form":"disco","offset":405},{"uri":"Sultry","surface_form":"sultry","offset":463},{"uri":"Sexual","surface_form":"sexual","offset":479},{"uri":"Prince_(musician)","surface_form":"Prince","offset":503},{"uri":"American_popular_music","surface_form":"American popular music","offset":588},{"uri":"Soul_music","surface_form":"soul music","offset":689},{"uri":"Funk_music","surface_form":"funk music","offset":701},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":713},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":741},{"uri":"Urban_contemporary","surface_form":"urban contemporary","offset":815},{"uri":"Vocal","surface_form":"vocal","offset":979},{"uri":"Rap","surface_form":"rap","offset":990},{"uri":"Usher","surface_form":"Usher","offset":1106},{"uri":"Beyonc%C3%A9","surface_form":"Beyonc\u00E9","offset":1113},{"uri":"Destiny%27s_Child","surface_form":"Destiny's Child","offset":1134},{"uri":"Ashanti_(entertainer)","surface_form":"Ashanti","offset":1152},{"uri":"Mariah_Carey","surface_form":"Mariah Carey","offset":1165},{"uri":"Alicia_Keys","surface_form":"Alicia Keys","offset":1237},{"uri":"R._Kelly","surface_form":"R.
