{"id":413418,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain_prime","text":"=\"preserve\">A Sophie Germain prime is a type of prime number. If a prime number is still prime after being multiplied by 2 and adding 1 to the answer, then the original prime is a Sophie Germain prime. A mathematical definition is: a prime number, denoted by \"p\", is a Sophie Germain prime if \"2p+1\" is also a prime number. \"2p+1\" is called a safe prime if it is a prime number.\nSophie Germain primes are named after the French mathematician Sophie Germain.\nMany mathematicians believe that there are an infinite amount of Sophie Germain primes, but this has not been proven.\nExamples.\n11 is a Sophie Germain prime because 23 ((2 \u00D7 11) + 1 = 23) is also a prime number.\n13 is a prime number but not a Sophie Germain prime because 27 ((2 \u00D7 13) + 1 = 27) is not a prime number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":48},{"uri":"Safe_prime","surface_form":"safe prime","offset":343},{"uri":"Sophie_Germain","surface_form":"Sophie Germain","offset":442}]}
