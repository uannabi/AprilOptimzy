{"id":41342,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc","text":"e=\"preserve\">An arc is a part of a circle. An arc is a curved line. The curve of an arc is constant and does not change (that is, an arc has constant curvature). It sometimes is portrayed as a dotted line.\nIn a circle, the arc from point A to point B is written as formula_1. We call the length of an arc an arc length. For an arc on a circle with radius \"formula_1\" subtended by an angle formula_1, its arc length is precisely formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":35},{"uri":"Curvature","surface_form":"curvature","offset":150},{"uri":"Arc_length","surface_form":"arc length","offset":308}]}
