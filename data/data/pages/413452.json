{"id":413452,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeiran_wall_lizard","text":"The Madeira wall lizard (\"Teira dugesii\") or Madeira lizard is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family, and the only member of the genus \"Teira\".\nDistribution.\nThis Madeira wall lizard is endemic to the Madeira Islands, Portugal, where it is abundant. In the Azores, this lizard is found after involuntary introduction during the 19th century by ship trade between the two archipelagos, but the lizards have never reached the population numbers as in their territory of origin. There is also a small population in the port area of Lisbon, probably accidentally transported in ships carrying bananas, and first found in 1992; a study of 2001 found that the population has remained stable in size since its discovery.\nTaxonomy.\nThe species was named after the French zoologist Louis Antoine Dug\u00E8s (1797\u20131838).\nThe subspecies \"Teira dugesii mauli\" (Mertens, 1938) from the Desertas Islands now is a synonym of \"Teira dugesii dugesii\". \"Atlantolacerta andreanskyi\" (Andreansky's lizard) from Morocco, and \"Scelarcis perspicillata\" (Menorca wall lizard) from Morocco, Algeria and Minorca, were in the genus \"Teira\" but now are in other genera.\nCharacteristics.\nThese lizards can reach in length, although adults have usually between. Their color can vary from light brown to dark gray, but with some of them (usually males) may show other colors, like green, blue and violet. Males can be easily distinguished from females due to the presence of a yellow fold at the bottom of the hind legs.\nThe females lay two to three groups of eggs annually. And some individuals could live to 16 years or more.\nFood.\nDespite being essentially an insectivorous species, ripe fruits and berries (especially blackberries) are also part of their diet.\nHabitat.\nThis species is generally found in arid areas where the vegetation is not dense. It may also occur in open woodland, areas with rocks and where crops are grown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":76},{"uri":"Lacertidae","surface_form":"Lacertidae","offset":90},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":136},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":193},{"uri":"Madeira_Islands","surface_form":"Madeira Islands","offset":208},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":225},{"uri":"Azores","surface_form":"Azores","offset":264},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":351},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":356},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":378},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":523},{"uri":"Lisbon","surface_form":"Lisbon","offset":536},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":596},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":735},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":763},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":770},{"uri":"Louis_Antoine_Dug%C3%A8s","surface_form":"Louis Antoine Dug\u00E8s","offset":780},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":817},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":901},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":993},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":1068},{"uri":"Minorca","surface_form":"Minorca","offset":1080},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":1136},{"uri":"Fold","surface_form":"fold","offset":1455},{"uri":"Insectivorous","surface_form":"insectivorous","offset":1634},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":1673},{"uri":"Blackberry","surface_form":"blackberries","offset":1693},{"uri":"Arid","surface_form":"arid","offset":1780},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":1801},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":1852},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rocks","offset":1873},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":1889}]}
