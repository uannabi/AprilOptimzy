{"id":413494,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny","text":"Exogeny refers to coming from the outside. People, planets, computers, and anything else can be influenced either by things in its environment or by things within itself. Things from within itself are indigenous.\nThe Earth is shaped by many geological processes. The forces that make these things happen come from both inside and outside the Earth.\nIn geology, exogenous processes come from forces \"on or above\" the Earth's surface. Processes caused by forces from \"within\" the Earth are endogenous processes. \"Exo\" is a prefix meaning \"out\", and \"endo\" is a prefix meaning \"in\".\nMany exogenous (extraterrestrial) forces are caused by other bodies in the Solar System. For example, the Moon causes tides in the Earth's oceans and other big bodies of water. Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they make craters in the ground.\nThe Sun is the main exogenous influence in the Solar System. It has many effects on Earth. Radiation from the Sun is a main cause of the surface temperature of the Earth, and for the growth of plant life. We are partly shielded from the Sun's solar wind by the Earth's magnetic field. Storms of solar particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiation. Sometimes we see aurorae, which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles.\nAn example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion. Erosion is mostly made by precipitation such as rain and snow, and by wind.\nThere are three main endogenous geological processes: folding, faulting and volcanism. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries. These are the zones on the edges of plates. Endogenous processes cause many major landform features.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":131},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":217},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":241},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"forces","offset":267},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":352},{"uri":"Prefix","surface_form":"prefix","offset":559},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":655},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":686},{"uri":"Tide","surface_form":"tide","offset":698},{"uri":"Oceans","surface_form":"oceans","offset":719},{"uri":"Comet","surface_form":"comet","offset":770},{"uri":"Meteoroid","surface_form":"meteoroid","offset":781},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":863},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":890},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"Radiation","offset":977},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":996},{"uri":"Solar_wind","surface_form":"solar wind","offset":1129},{"uri":"Earth%27s_magnetic_field","surface_form":"Earth's magnetic field","offset":1147},{"uri":"Ozone_layer","surface_form":"ozone layer","offset":1228},{"uri":"Ultraviolet_radiation","surface_form":"ultraviolet radiation","offset":1263},{"uri":"Aurora","surface_form":"aurora","offset":1303},{"uri":"Geographical_pole","surface_form":"poles","offset":1364},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":1452},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":1509},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":1518},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":1531},{"uri":"Fold_(geology)","surface_form":"folding","offset":1591},{"uri":"Faulting","surface_form":"faulting","offset":1600},{"uri":"Volcanism","surface_form":"volcanism","offset":1613},{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"plate boundaries","offset":1657},{"uri":"Landform","surface_form":"landform","offset":1757}]}
