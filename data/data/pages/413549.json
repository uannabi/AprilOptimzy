It was their final single before McCartney announced his departure from the band (by that time, Lennon had already left).\nBoth the \"Let It Be\" album and the US single \"The Long and Winding Road\" were released after McCartney's announced departure from and subsequent break-up of the group.\n\"Let It Be\" holds the number-one spot on \"The Fans' Top 10\" poll included in \"The 100 Best Beatles Songs: An Informed Fan's Guide\" by Stephen J. Spignesi and Michael Lewis. The song is number three in the 100 Best Beatles Songs list, only behind \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"A Day in the Life\", which is number one.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":25},{"uri":"Let_It_Be","surface_form":"Let It Be","offset":135},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"Paul McCartney","offset":165},{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"John Lennon","offset":184},{"uri":"The_Long_and_Winding_Road","surface_form":"The Long and Winding Road","offset":365},{"uri":"Strawberry_Fields_Forever","surface_form":"Strawberry Fields Forever","offset":734},{"uri":"A_Day_in_the_Life","surface_form":"A Day in the Life","offset":766}]}
