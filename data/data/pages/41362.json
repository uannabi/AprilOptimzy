{"id":41362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution","text":"e=\"preserve\">In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The substances that are dissolved are called solutes. The substance the solutes are dissolved in is called the solvent. An example from everyday experience is a solid like salt or sugar (which are crystalline solids), dissolved in a liquid (like water). Gases can dissolve in liquids. An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water. Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases.\nThe amount of solute added to the solvent determines the concentration of the solution. The solution with the large amount of solute is called a concentrated solution; the solution with less solute is called a dilute solution.\nExamples of solid solutions are alloys and some minerals. For example, brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Homogeneous","surface_form":"homogeneous","offset":43},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":78},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolved","offset":114},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":201},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":251},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":262},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":270},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":323},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":336},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"Gas","offset":344},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":389},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":407},{"uri":"Concentration","surface_form":"concentration","offset":545},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":747},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":763}]}
