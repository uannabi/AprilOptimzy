{"id":41364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunsen_burner","text":"A Bunsen burner is a common piece of laboratory equipment. It is commonly used for heating chemical substances, sterilization, and combustion. It works by burning flammable gas. It is named after Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, a German chemist. He made important improvements on an earlier burner invented by Michael Faraday.\nThe Bunsen burner can be adjusted to make a flame that is very hot without making much light. This allows seeing the different colors that various chemicals make when they are sprinkled into the flame.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":37},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":48},{"uri":"Heating","surface_form":"heating","offset":83},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":91},{"uri":"Sterilization","surface_form":"sterilization","offset":112},{"uri":"Combustion","surface_form":"combustion","offset":131},{"uri":"Flammable","surface_form":"flammable","offset":163},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":173},{"uri":"Robert_Wilhelm_Bunsen","surface_form":"Robert Wilhelm Bunsen","offset":196},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":221},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":228},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":301}]}
