{"id":413753,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_do_Fogo","text":"\"Pico do Fogo\" (\"Fire peak\") is the highest peak of Cape Verde, rising to above sea level. It is an active stratovolcano lying on the island of Fogo. The last eruption of the main volcanic cone was in 1675 and all the people living in the island had to leave.\nA lateral vent (the opening of a volcano from which lava flows) erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when earthquakes produced in all the island claimed several lives. Volcanic lava has reached the eastern coast of the island in historical times.\nIts most spectacular feature is a volcanic crater (or caldera, \"caldeira\" in Portuguese) that is about wide, with a border (\"bordeira\" in Portuguese) that is about high. The crater has a slit in its eastern wall, and a large peak like a volcanic cone rises in its center that. The central cone is the highest point of the island (2829 m) and its peak is about 100 m higher than the \"bordeira\" that surrounds the crater.\nThe lowest elevation of the floor of the \"caldeira\", known as \"Ch\u00E3 das Caldeiras\" (\"Plain of the Calderas\") is. There are, within the \"caldeira\", two villages which were evacuated during the last eruption. Traditionally, grapes are grown on the inner slopes of the \"bordeira\" and there is some subsistence agriculture on the \"caldeira\" floor.\nThe mountain's slopes are used to grow coffee, while its lava is used as building material.\nThe Fea's petrel (\"Pterodroma feae\"), a Near Threatened species of bird, breeds in this mountain.\nThe endemic plants \"Echium vulcanorum\" and \"Erysimum caboverdeanum\" are only known to occur on the outer rim of the volcano.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":52},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":80},{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":107},{"uri":"Fogo%2C_Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Fogo","offset":144},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruption","offset":159},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic cone","offset":180},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":312},{"uri":"Volcanic_crater","surface_form":"volcanic crater","offset":558},{"uri":"Caldera","surface_form":"caldera","offset":578},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":601},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":662},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic cone","offset":761},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":1165},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":1326},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":1344},{"uri":"Fea%27s_petrel","surface_form":"Fea's petrel","offset":1383},{"uri":"Near_Threatened","surface_form":"Near Threatened","offset":1419},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":1452},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":1481},{"uri":"Echium_vulcanorum","surface_form":"Echium vulcanorum","offset":1497},{"uri":"Erysimum_caboverdeanum","surface_form":"Erysimum caboverdeanum","offset":1521}]}
