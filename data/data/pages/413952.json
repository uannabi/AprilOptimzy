He studied at Richmond Hill High School and at Queens College.\n1957 incident.\nIn 1957, Kameny was fired from his position as an astronomer in the U.S. Army's Army Map Service in Washington, D.C. because of his homosexuality. This helped him to begin \"a Herculean struggle with the American establishment\" that would help a rights movement of the early 1960s for homosexuals.\nKameny protested his firing by the U.S. Civil Service Commission due to his homosexuality, and argued this case to the United States Supreme Court in 1961. Although the court denied his petition, it is notable as the first civil rights claim based on sexual orientation.\nDeath.\nKameny died on October 11, 2011 in Washington, D.C. from heart disease. He was 86 years old.\nLegacy.\nFollowing Kameny's death, the giant rainbow flag on the tall flagpole at the corner of Market Street and Castro Street in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco was flown at half-staff for 24 hours beginning on the afternoon of October 12, 2011 at the request of the creator of the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker.\nOn November 2, 2011, Kameny's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nOn July 3 2012, Minor Planet (40463) \"Frankkameny\" was named in Kameny's honor by the International Astronomical Union and the Minor Planet Center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":96},{"uri":"Gay_rights","surface_form":"gay rights","offset":105},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":173},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":188},{"uri":"Richmond_Hill_High_School","surface_form":"Richmond Hill High School","offset":212},{"uri":"Queens_College","surface_form":"Queens College","offset":245},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":326},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"U.S. Army","offset":344},{"uri":"Army_Map_Service","surface_form":"Army Map Service","offset":356},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":376},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexuality","offset":408},{"uri":"U.S._Civil_Service_Commission","surface_form":"U.S. Civil Service Commission","offset":608},{"uri":"United_States_Supreme_Court","surface_form":"United States Supreme Court","offset":692},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":824},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":886},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":908},{"uri":"Rainbow_flag","surface_form":"rainbow flag","offset":988},{"uri":"The_Castro%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"Castro Street","offset":1057},{"uri":"Castro_(San_Francisco)","surface_form":"Castro neighborhood of San Francisco","offset":1078},{"uri":"Gilbert_Baker_(artist)","surface_form":"Gilbert Baker","offset":1250},{"uri":"Dr._Franklin_E._Kameny_Residence","surface_form":"Kameny's house","offset":1286},{"uri":"National_Register_of_Historic_Places","surface_form":"National Register of Historic Places","offset":1319},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"Minor Planet","offset":1373},{"uri":"40463_Frankkameny","surface_form":"(40463) \"Frankkameny\"","offset":1386},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":1443},{"uri":"Minor_Planet_Center","surface_form":"Minor Planet Center","offset":1484}]}
