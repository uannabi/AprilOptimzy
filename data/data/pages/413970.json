Montalvo was a member of the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party for which he became a deputy and later senator for Pichincha Province.\nMontalvo became president when his predecessor Juan de Dios Mart\u00EDnez Mera was elected President but faced a congress not willing to deal with him. The congress asked Mart\u00EDnez Mera twice to resign, but he refused. The congress then censored the ministers chosen by Mart\u00EDnez Mera, one of which was Abelardo Montalvo. Mart\u00EDnez proceeded to select some new ministers to outmaneuver the congress.\nThe Chamber of Deputies then accused Mart\u00EDnez Mera of attempting to overthrow the government and institute a dictatorship. The Senate subsequently impeached Mart\u00EDnez and named his Minister of Interior, Abelardo Montalvo, acting president. Montalvo stayed on as acting president until Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa Velasco Ibarra was elected.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_heads_of_state_of_Ecuador","surface_form":"President","offset":47},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":60},{"uri":"Juris_Doctor","surface_form":"Juris Doctor","offset":122},{"uri":"Ecuadorian_Radical_Liberal_Party","surface_form":"Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party","offset":194},{"uri":"Pichincha_Province","surface_form":"Pichincha Province","offset":278},{"uri":"Juan_de_Dios_Mart%C3%ADnez","surface_form":"Juan de Dios Mart\u00EDnez Mera","offset":345},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Velasco_Ibarra","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa Velasco Ibarra","offset":974}]}
