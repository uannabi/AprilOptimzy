He rebelled against his older brother Geoffrey III and took the countship of Anjou by force.\nEarly career.\nFulk, born 1043, was the younger son of Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00E2tinais and Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou. Ermengarde-Blanche was a daughter of Fulk Nerra, count of Anjou, When Geoffrey Martel died without direct heirs he left Anjou to his nephew Geoffrey III, Fulk le R\u00E9chin's older brother. Geoffrey III was not an effective count. In 1062 Geoffrey failed to defend Saintonge and it was lost. In 1063 the county of Maine was lost to Anjou. In 1065 Geoffrey angered Archbishop Barthelemy of Tours and was excommunicated.\nCount of Anjou.\nFulk had enough and took the countship of Anjou by force. He fought with his brother and captured him in 1067. Under pressure from the Church he released Geoffrey. The two brothers started fighting again. This time Geoffrey was imprisoned for the rest of his life. Substantial territory was lost to Angevin control because of Geoffrey's poor rule and the civil war that followed. Fulk was forced to give the G\u00E2tinais to Philip I of France the king. Fulk spent the rest of his reign as count trying to regain control of his barons and all the lost lands. He also struggled with Normandy trying to regain control in Maine and Brittany.\nAuthor of the \"History of Anjou\".\nIn 1096 Fulk wrote a history of Anjou and its rulers titled \"Fragmentum historiae Andegavensis\" or \"History of Anjou.\" Only the first part of the history still exists. It describes Fulk's ancestry. The second part was thought to cover Fulk's own rule. This part has not been found. If he did write it, it is one of the first medieval works of history written by a layman.\nFamily.\nHe next married an unnamed daughter of Walter I of Brienne. This marriage also ended in divorce, in 1087. they had no children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":47},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":54},{"uri":"Count_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Count of Anjou","offset":75},{"uri":"Deposed","surface_form":"deposed","offset":113},{"uri":"Countship","surface_form":"countship","offset":194},{"uri":"Geoffrey_II%2C_Count_of_G%C3%A2tinais","surface_form":"Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00E2tinais","offset":277},{"uri":"Ermengarde-Blanche_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou","offset":312},{"uri":"Fulk_III_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Fulk Nerra","offset":378},{"uri":"Count_of_Anjou","surface_form":"count of Anjou","offset":390},{"uri":"Heirs","surface_form":"heirs","offset":447},{"uri":"Nephew","surface_form":"nephew","offset":474},{"uri":"Geoffrey_III%2C_Count_of_Anjou","surface_form":"Geoffrey III","offset":481},{"uri":"Saintonge","surface_form":"Saintonge","offset":602},{"uri":"Maine_(province)","surface_form":"Maine","offset":651},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"Archbishop","offset":701},{"uri":"Tours","surface_form":"Tours","offset":726},{"uri":"Excommunication","surface_form":"excommunicated","offset":740},{"uri":"Philip_I_of_France","surface_form":"Philip I of France","offset":1192},{"uri":"Baron","surface_form":"baron","offset":1295},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":1349},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":1386},{"uri":"Brittany","surface_form":"Brittany","offset":1396},{"uri":"Rulers","surface_form":"rulers","offset":1486},{"uri":"Ancestry","surface_form":"ancestry","offset":1628},{"uri":"Layman","surface_form":"layman","offset":1804}]}
