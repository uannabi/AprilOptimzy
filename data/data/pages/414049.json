{"id":414049,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2","text":"\"Dota 2\" is a video game that was released in 2013. It is a sequel to \"Defense of the Ancients\". Dota was originally a player-made map (also know as a mod) in ' that proved to be successful with over 5 million active players. When \"Warcraft: Frozen Throne\" game got old, it was hard to make the map. As a result, Valve Corporation, with the help of the original maker (known only as Icefrog) started to develop \"Dota 2\".\nGoal.\nThe game is a hard to learn, hard to master strategy game. You map pick one of the 115 heroes. They're then put to two teams of five: one called the Radiant(Green) and the other, Dire(Red). The map contains three lanes called top, middle and bottom lanes. Usually, the team chooses to go 2-1-2(2 in top, 1 mid and 2 bot). Sometimes, it will be 2-1-1 or 1-1-2 because there will be a roamer. A roamer, as the name applies, goes all over the map where they can help.\n'Creeps' spawn in both sides are called 'Minions' waves. They are controlled by the computer and they will attack the enemy creeps. They will target a hero or a tower if there is no creeps. The creeps are essential into winning the game since they give gold if killed by a hero.\nIn every lane, there are 3 towers. They're named by their tiers with tier 1 being the nearest to the enemies and tier 3 the farthest. You must destroy all the lane's towers before you can damage the barracks. The barracks are behind the tier 3 towers. If you destroy the 'Ranged Barracks' or 'Melee Barracks', the corresponding creeps spawn at the lane will be more powerful. If all 6 barracks get destroyed, all the creeps get boosted to Mega Creeps. Mega creeps are so powerful that an entire wave of them is equal to the power of a hero. If you have mega creeps, you will likely win the game.\nThe winning condition of the game is by destroying the enemy 'Ancient' or base while defending your own. Due to the large map and variety of scenarios,\ngames often last 30\u201350 minutes. Some games go to 2 hours if necessary.\nYou may leave the game before it ends, but you will get punished. Your next 1-5 games will be in a 'Low Priority' form. In low priority, every player gets a pool of only 3 heroes to pick. They can also not play with 'High Priority' players.\nSummary.\nThe game has two different teams with five \"heroes\" on each side. They can choose between 115 different heroes. Players have to get the rivaled towers in order to eventually get to the ancient and destroy it. Through the game, players can gain gold, buy items and of course, get kills and assists.\nNotes.\nYou can also play custom games, which are made by loyal players via the steam workshop. Dota 2 is famous for it's complexity and forceful effort. Some people have earned millions of dollars playing this game in important hostages, most knowingly, the International, which has the biggest money pool in video game history, reaching 13 million in U.S.A dollars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Defense_of_the_Ancients","surface_form":"Defense of the Ancients","offset":71},{"uri":"Valve_Corporation","surface_form":"Valve Corporation","offset":313}]}
