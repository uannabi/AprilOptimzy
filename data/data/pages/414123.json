{"id":414123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerly%2C_Rhode_Island","text":"=\"preserve\">Westerly is a town in southwestern Rhode Island, near the state line of Connecticut. The town was established in 1669. In 2010, the population was about 23,000 by the census.\nWesterly might be named because of where it is in Rhode Island. But, the town may have also gotten the name \"Westerly\" from the English village Westerleigh. During summer, Westerly becomes a tourist attraction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":26},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":47},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":84},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":315}]}
