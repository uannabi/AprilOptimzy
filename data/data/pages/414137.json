It covers the outer south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. At first it was closer to the city, but boundaries have since been changed. It originally included the suburbs of Croydon, Dandenong, Ferntree Gully and Ringwood. It now includes Boronia, Belgrave, Ferntree Gully, Berwick, Beaconsfield, Officer, Gembrook, Emerald and Cockatoo.\nThe Division was set up in 1949, and named after Charles La Trobe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria.\nMembers.\nThe first person to hold the seat was Richard Casey, Baron Casey, later the 16th Governor-General of Australia. He was later given a seat in the British House of Lords. The Division of Casey, which is next to La Trobe, is named after him. In 1961, the division was the subject of a book, \"Parties and People: A Survey Based on the La Trobe Electorate\", by Creighton Burns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":31},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":68},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":77},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":132},{"uri":"Croydon%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Croydon","offset":257},{"uri":"Dandenong%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Dandenong","offset":266},{"uri":"Ferntree_Gully%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Ferntree Gully","offset":277},{"uri":"Ringwood%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Ringwood","offset":296},{"uri":"Boronia%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Boronia","offset":322},{"uri":"Belgrave%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Belgrave","offset":331},{"uri":"Berwick%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Berwick","offset":357},{"uri":"Beaconsfield%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Beaconsfield","offset":366},{"uri":"Officer%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Officer","offset":380},{"uri":"Gembrook%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Gembrook","offset":389},{"uri":"Emerald%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Emerald","offset":399},{"uri":"Cockatoo%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Cockatoo","offset":411},{"uri":"Charles_La_Trobe","surface_form":"Charles La Trobe","offset":470},{"uri":"Governor_of_Victoria","surface_form":"Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria","offset":498},{"uri":"Richard_Casey%2C_Baron_Casey","surface_form":"Richard Casey, Baron Casey","offset":578},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_Australia","surface_form":"Governor-General of Australia","offset":621},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":685},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":693},{"uri":"Division_of_Casey","surface_form":"Division of Casey","offset":713},{"uri":"Creighton_Burns","surface_form":"Creighton Burns","offset":896}]}
