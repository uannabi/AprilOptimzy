{"id":414375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Dreamer","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Beautiful Dreamer\" is a song by Stephen Foster written about 1862. It was first published (posthumously) in 1864 by William A. Pond & Co. It has been promoted as Foster's last song, but that distinction cannot be confirmed. It is similar in some respects to his first published song, \"Open They Lattice, Love\". Both have a triple rhythm and share imagery of the sea and marine life.\nThe arpeggiated accompaniment recalls bel canto opera. The dreamer in this song is either asleep or dead. The song does not distinguish. It is a song though about dissolution of melting, of dissolving, of vanishing into mists, and, finally into death. The song is not held in the highest esteem by some musicologists and has been described by one as \"saccharine\" and \"[smacking] somewhat of the idiom of Irving Berlin.\"\nLyrics.\nStarlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;\nSounds of the rude world, heard in the day,\nLull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away!\nBeautiful dreamer, queen of my song,\nList while I woo thee with soft melody;\nGone are the cares of life's busy throng,\nBeautiful dreamer, out on the sea,\nMermaids are chanting the wild lorelei;\nOver the streamlet vapors are borne,\nWaiting to fade at the bright coming morn.\nBeautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,\nE'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;\nThen will all clouds of sorrow depart,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stephen_Foster","surface_form":"Stephen Foster","offset":46},{"uri":"Irving_Berlin","surface_form":"Irving Berlin","offset":801}]}
