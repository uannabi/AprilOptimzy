Critics gave it mixed reviews. They liked its special effects, but were critical of its length (158 minutes) and screenwriting. It made $770 million worldwide.\nPlot.\nNeutrinos from a very large solar flare from the sun cause the temperature of Earth to increase at a very fast rate, eventually causing a very large geological and meterological disaster. The plot follows Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as he tries to bring his children, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet), and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) to safety from the destructive events that occur. Among these events, a very large earthquake causes California to fall into the Pacific Ocean, the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, and a very large tsunami hits the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":17},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":26},{"uri":"Disaster","surface_form":"disaster","offset":42},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":51},{"uri":"Roland_Emmerich","surface_form":"Roland Emmerich","offset":84},{"uri":"Columbia_Pictures","surface_form":"Columbia Pictures","offset":197},{"uri":"Special_effects","surface_form":"special effects","offset":436},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"screenwriting","offset":503},{"uri":"Neutrino","surface_form":"Neutrino","offset":556},{"uri":"Solar_flare","surface_form":"solar flare","offset":584},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":705},{"uri":"Meterology","surface_form":"meterological","offset":720},{"uri":"John_Cusack","surface_form":"John Cusack","offset":777},{"uri":"Amanda_Peet","surface_form":"Amanda Peet","offset":889},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1040},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1058},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":1086},{"uri":"Yellowstone_National_Park","surface_form":"Yellowstone","offset":1105},{"uri":"Supervolcano","surface_form":"supervolcano","offset":1117},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":1155},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1172}]}
