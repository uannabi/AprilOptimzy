{"id":414525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creswick_Regional_Park","text":"The Creswick Regional Park, also known as the Creswick State Forest, is a large forest near the town of Creswick. It covers an area of 930 hectares. Much of the forest was heavily logged to supply timber to the gold mines in Ballarat and Creswick during the 1850s and 1860s. Many gold mining sites can be found in the forest.\nSt.Georges Lake is a man-made lake built to supply water for hydraulic sluicing. Eaton's Dam is another gold water supply. In 1942, students from the Creswick Forestry School fenced a small area of forest to create a breeding area for koalas. However the koalas were able to climb the fence, and the Koala Park was not successful.\nA section of the Great Dividing Trail, the Wallaby Track, passes through the Creswick Regional Park. Some of it follows the water races built by the gold miners to supply water for their activities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Creswick%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Creswick","offset":104},{"uri":"Hectare","surface_form":"hectare","offset":139},{"uri":"Koalas","surface_form":"koalas","offset":561},{"uri":"Great_Dividing_Trail","surface_form":"Great Dividing Trail","offset":674}]}
