{"id":414582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_de_Boulogne","text":"The Bois de Boulogne is a large public park in the west of Paris. It was created between 1852 and 1858 during the reign of the Emperor Louis Napoleon. It is in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, near the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine.\nThe Bois is the second-largest park in Paris, a bit smaller than the Bois de Vincennes on the eastern side of the city. It covers an area of 8.46 square kilometres, which is 2.5 times larger than Central Park in New York, and comparable in size to Richmond Park in London.\nWithin the boundaries of the Bois de Boulogne are an English landscape garden with several lakes and a cascade; two smaller botanical and landscape gardens; a zoo and amusement park; a complex of greenhouses holding a hundred thousand plants; two tracks for horse racing; a tennis stadium where the French Open tournament is held each year; and other attractions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":59},{"uri":"Louis_Napoleon","surface_form":"Louis Napoleon","offset":135},{"uri":"16th_arrondissement_of_Paris","surface_form":"16th arrondissement of Paris","offset":164},{"uri":"Boulogne-Billancourt","surface_form":"Boulogne-Billancourt","offset":213},{"uri":"Neuilly-sur-Seine","surface_form":"Neuilly-sur-Seine","offset":238},{"uri":"Bois_de_Vincennes","surface_form":"Bois de Vincennes","offset":326},{"uri":"Central_Park","surface_form":"Central Park","offset":453},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York","offset":469},{"uri":"Richmond_Park","surface_form":"Richmond Park","offset":505},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":522},{"uri":"Landscape_garden","surface_form":"landscape garden","offset":591},{"uri":"Horse_racing","surface_form":"horse racing","offset":788},{"uri":"Tennis","surface_form":"tennis","offset":804},{"uri":"French_Open","surface_form":"French Open","offset":829}]}
