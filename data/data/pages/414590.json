{"id":414590,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Forest","text":"The Caledonian Forest is a type of woodland that once covered vast areas of Scotland. Today, parts of the original forest survive, covering in 84 places. The forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife, much of which is not found elsewhere in the British Isles.\nHistory.\nThe Caledonian forests were formed at the end of the last ice age. Trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the English Channel. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a short period. Then the climate began to warm and the pine wood retreated north into the Scottish Highlands.\nThe native pinewoods which formed this westernmost outpost of the boreal forest of Europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens.\nThe forest takes its name from the Romans, who called Scotland \"Caledonia\", from the early Celtic word '*caleto-' meaning 'hard, strong'. The name was used by a local tribe or tribal confederation of native Picts or Britons called the \"Caledonii\".\nToday less than 1% of the original native pinewood forest survives, in isolated remnants.\nWildlife.\nA unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian pinewoods are home to some of the country's rarest wildlife. It is one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":35},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":76},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"wildlife","offset":196},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":250},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":332},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"Tree","offset":341},{"uri":"Land_bridge","surface_form":"land bridge","offset":404},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":441},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":525},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":568},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":598},{"uri":"Scottish_Highlands","surface_form":"Scottish Highlands","offset":633},{"uri":"Indigenous_(ecology)","surface_form":"native","offset":657},{"uri":"Taiga","surface_form":"boreal forest","offset":719},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":736},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"wilderness","offset":783},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":797},{"uri":"Birch","surface_form":"birch","offset":803},{"uri":"Rowan","surface_form":"rowan","offset":810},{"uri":"Populus_tremula","surface_form":"aspen","offset":817},{"uri":"Juniper","surface_form":"juniper","offset":824},{"uri":"Oak","surface_form":"oak","offset":833},{"uri":"Temperate_rainforest","surface_form":"temperate rainforest","offset":913},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":934},{"uri":"Fern","surface_form":"fern","offset":952},{"uri":"Moss","surface_form":"moss","offset":959},{"uri":"Lichen","surface_form":"lichen","offset":970},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":1014},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":1033},{"uri":"Caledonia","surface_form":"Caledonia","offset":1043},{"uri":"Celtic_languages","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":1070},{"uri":"Picts","surface_form":"Picts","offset":1186},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":1336},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"wildlife","offset":1434},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"wilderness","offset":1476}]}
