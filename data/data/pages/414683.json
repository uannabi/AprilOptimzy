{"id":414683,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath","text":"A heath or heathland is a shrubland habitat found mainly on low quality, acidic soils. It has open, low growing woody vegetation.\nThere are some clear differences between \"heath\" and \"moorland\". For example \"moorland\" has a very peaty topsoil, and it is also free-draining, whereas a heath is not. Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths with\u00A0\u2014 especially in Great Britain\u00A0\u2014 a cooler and damper climate.\nHeathland is common worldwide. They form extensive and diverse communities across Australia in humid and sub-humid areas. Fire regimes with burning maintain the heathlands. Even more diverse though less widespread heath occurs in Southern Africa. Extensive heath communities can also be found in the California chaparral, New Caledonia, central Chile and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to these extensive heath areas, the vegetation type is also found in scattered locations across all continents except Antarctica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shrubland","surface_form":"shrubland","offset":26},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":36},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":73},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":118},{"uri":"Moorland","surface_form":"moorland","offset":184},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":407},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":498},{"uri":"Humid","surface_form":"humid","offset":511},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":716},{"uri":"Chaparral","surface_form":"chaparral","offset":727},{"uri":"New_Caledonia","surface_form":"New Caledonia","offset":738},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":761},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":795},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":944}]}
