The \"CW\" name is derived from the first letter of the names of these corporations (CBS and Warner Bros.). According to its former President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff, the network tries to \"appeal to people 18 to 34-years-old\". The network currently airs programming six days a week: Monday through Friday afternoons and evenings (in prime time), and Saturday morning children's programming (under their The CW4Kids block).\nThe network started after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, ceased independent operations on September 15 and September 17, 2006 respectively.
