It used to be called a Russian Wolf Hound.\nThis breed of dog was brought to the United States in 1889. It was approved by the American Kennel Club one year later. The breed is beautiful and has a gentle personality. It makes it a good pet.\nThe breed was approved and the descriptive standard was written in 1650. It has not changed much since then. It is about tall at the withers (its back near the shoulders). It weighs from. Borzois have a long coat. They can be any color from solid white to brown and white, gray and white or brindle. They can also be all black. People who take care of Borzois have done a good job of stopping health problems. Borzois do not have many of the problems other breeds have with health.\nIn Russia, they were well liked by the royalty. It was illegal to sell them. They were given to those who did something special for the Tzars. They feature in Russian novels e.g. in Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\". During the Russian revolution, most of the breed were killed because they were a symbol of royalty. A few were taken from the country.\nThey have been used in advertising for luxury cars and jewelry. This is because of their elegant looks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":20},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":28},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":81},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":113},{"uri":"Approve","surface_form":"approve","offset":143},{"uri":"American_Kennel_Club","surface_form":"American Kennel Club","offset":159},{"uri":"Beauty","surface_form":"beautiful","offset":209},{"uri":"Personality","surface_form":"personality","offset":236},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":268},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":316},{"uri":"Withers","surface_form":"withers","offset":406},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":433},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weighs","offset":448},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coat","offset":481},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":503},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":520},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":529},{"uri":"Gray","surface_form":"gray","offset":546},{"uri":"Brindle","surface_form":"brindle","offset":564},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":594},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":715},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":758},{"uri":"Royal_family","surface_form":"royalty","offset":794},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":812},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"sell","offset":821},{"uri":"Tzar","surface_form":"Tzar","offset":891},{"uri":"Leo_Tolstoy","surface_form":"Tolstoy's","offset":937},{"uri":"Anna_Karenina","surface_form":"Anna Karenina","offset":948},{"uri":"Russian_revolution","surface_form":"Russian revolution","offset":975},{"uri":"Kill","surface_form":"kill","offset":1018},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1045},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"advertising","offset":1122},{"uri":"Luxury","surface_form":"luxury","offset":1138},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":1145},{"uri":"Jewelry","surface_form":"jewelry","offset":1154},{"uri":"Elegant","surface_form":"elegant","offset":1188}]}
