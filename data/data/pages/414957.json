{"id":414957,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatorrhea","text":"=\"preserve\">Steatorrhea means excess undigested fat in feces. In this case, the feces is often lighter, sometimes whitish, in color. It produces a fouler-than-usual, sour-rancid smell, and floats on the surface of the water as opposed to sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl.\nSteatorrhea is caused by the inability to digest and absorb fat in the diet. It may be helped in some cases by taking enzymes, such as those usually produced by the body, which digest fat.\nResearch should be done, and a doctor consulted if necessary, to determine the cause of the inability to digest and absorb fat.\nThe causes range from mild to very severe and life-threatenting, so simply treating symptoms may not be enough.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"undigested","offset":37},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":48},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":55},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":351},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":398}]}
