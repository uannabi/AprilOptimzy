He ruled from 965 until his death. He ruled a much smaller County of Flanders than his father.\nCareer.\nArnulf II, born about 961, was the son of Baldwin III, Count of Flanders and Mathilde. She was the daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony. His father Baldwin III died in 962 when Arnulf was just an infant. His grandfather, Arnulf I, was still alive and ruling Flanders. When Arnulf I died three years later (965), the regency was held by his kinsman Baldwin Balso. The regent Balso died in 973.\nBy the time Arnulf reached his age of majority in 976, Flanders had lost some of the southern territory acquired by Arnulf I. His grandfather had given some parts of Picardy to King Lothar of France to help make sure his grandson, Arnulf II would succeed him. Arnulf I also Boulogne as a fief to his nephew, Arnulf II, Count of Boulogne. Then early in Arnulf's minority King Lothar had taken Ponthieu and given it to Hugh Capet, and the first counts of Gu\u00EEnes had established themselves there. Arnulf died on 30 March, 987, just 26 years old.\nShortly after Arnulf's death his widow married Robert II, King of France as his first wife.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":60},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":67},{"uri":"Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Count of Flanders","offset":84},{"uri":"Flanders","surface_form":"Flanders","offset":172},{"uri":"Baldwin_III%2C_Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Baldwin III, Count of Flanders","offset":248},{"uri":"Herman%2C_Duke_of_Saxony","surface_form":"Herman, Duke of Saxony","offset":317},{"uri":"Arnulf_I%2C_Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Arnulf I","offset":425},{"uri":"Regency","surface_form":"regency","offset":520},{"uri":"Kinsman","surface_form":"kinsman","offset":544},{"uri":"Age_of_majority","surface_form":"age of majority","offset":628},{"uri":"Flanders","surface_form":"Flanders","offset":652},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":691},{"uri":"Picardy","surface_form":"Picardy","offset":763},{"uri":"Lothar_of_France","surface_form":"Lothar of France","offset":779},{"uri":"Boulogne-sur-Mer","surface_form":"Boulogne","offset":871},{"uri":"Fief","surface_form":"fief","offset":885},{"uri":"Arnulf_II%2C_Count_of_Boulogne","surface_form":"Arnulf II, Count of Boulogne","offset":905},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":958},{"uri":"Ponthieu","surface_form":"Ponthieu","offset":989},{"uri":"Hugh_Capet","surface_form":"Hugh Capet","offset":1014},{"uri":"Gu%C3%AEnes","surface_form":"Gu\u00EEnes","offset":1050},{"uri":"Robert_II_of_France","surface_form":"Robert II, King of France","offset":1187}]}
