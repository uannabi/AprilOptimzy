He ruled from 987 until his death. His reign saw Flanders grow into a powerful principality.\nCareer.\nBaldwin IV, born c.980, was the son of Arnulf II, Count of Flanders and Rozala of Ivrea. When his father died in 987 Baldwin succeeded him as Count of Flanders. His mother, Rozala, was the regent of Flanders until he reached the age of majority. After his father's death, his mother's second marriage was arranged by Hugh Capet. She married Hugh's son Robert II, King of France as his first wife. When Robert repudiated her in 991 Baldwin rebelled. When they came to terms Artois and Ostrevant, once taken from Flanders, were returned to Baldwin.\nUnlike his predecessors Baldwin was more interested in what lay east of Flanders. He left the southern part of his territory in the hands of his vassals the counts of Gu\u00EEnes, Hesdin, and St. Pol. Baldwin was the first count of Flanders to extend Flemish control eastward. He was given Zeeland as a fief by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II. He also received Valenciennes from the emperor. Then Baldwin obtained parts of the Cambresis as well as Saint-Omer and the northern Ternois (1120).\nIn the French territories the principality of Flanders remained powerful throughout the Capetian period. The Flemish economy saw strong growth during Baldwin's reign. Baldwin IV died on 30 May, 1035.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":72},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":79},{"uri":"Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Count of Flanders","offset":96},{"uri":"Flanders","surface_form":"Flanders","offset":164},{"uri":"Principality","surface_form":"principality","offset":194},{"uri":"Arnulf_II%2C_Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Arnulf II, Count of Flanders","offset":255},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":405},{"uri":"Age_of_majority","surface_form":"age of majority","offset":445},{"uri":"Hugh_Capet","surface_form":"Hugh Capet","offset":533},{"uri":"Robert_II_of_France","surface_form":"Robert II, King of France","offset":568},{"uri":"Repudiate","surface_form":"repudiated","offset":625},{"uri":"Artois","surface_form":"Artois","offset":689},{"uri":"Ostrevant","surface_form":"Ostrevant","offset":700},{"uri":"Vassal","surface_form":"vassal","offset":908},{"uri":"Gu%C3%AEnes","surface_form":"Gu\u00EEnes","offset":930},{"uri":"Hesdin","surface_form":"Hesdin","offset":938},{"uri":"Counts_of_Saint-Pol","surface_form":"St. Pol","offset":950},{"uri":"Zeeland","surface_form":"Zeeland","offset":1048},{"uri":"Fiefdom","surface_form":"fief","offset":1061},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Holy Roman Emperor","offset":1073},{"uri":"Henry_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Henry II","offset":1092},{"uri":"Valenciennes","surface_form":"Valenciennes","offset":1119},{"uri":"Saint-Omer","surface_form":"Saint-Omer","offset":1206},{"uri":"Capetian_dynasty","surface_form":"Capetian","offset":1338},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":1367}]}
