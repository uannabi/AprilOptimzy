In his early works he created a personal form of cubism which he gradually changed into a more popular figurative style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter made him a forerunner of pop art.\nHis personal style was called \"tubism\" because it was influenced by cubism, but used tube-like forms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":90},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":99},{"uri":"Film_director","surface_form":"filmmaker","offset":113},{"uri":"Cubism","surface_form":"cubism","offset":173},{"uri":"Pop_art","surface_form":"pop art","offset":327}]}
