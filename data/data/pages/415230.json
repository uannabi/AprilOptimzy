{"id":415230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustace_I%2C_Count_of_Boulogne","text":"e=\"preserve\">Eustace I, of Boulogne, was a Frankish nobleman and Count of Boulogne. He held the county of Boulogne from 1042 until his death.\nCareer.\nHe was the oldest son of Count Baldwin II of Boulogne and Adelina of Holland. Eustace became count in 1042. Eustace I was also the count of Lens.\nDuring the minority of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, Eustace's grandfather, Arnulf III, Count of Boulogne, broke free of control by the count of Flanders. Both Eustace's father and Eustace himself remained independent. In 995, having reached his majority, Baldwin IV of Flanders tried to take back several of the independently held castles. He also expanded the Flemish borders. This had caused considerable enmity between Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders and Eustace's father. When Baldwin IV's son Baldwin V succeeded him in 1035 Eustace I and Baldwin V of Flanders cooperated on several ventures including several charters. Eustace also signed charters of Baldwin V which limited the powers of the advocates.\nEustace I was allied to the house of Normandy. This was through the marriage of his son Eustace II to Goda, niece of Richard II. Under Eustace I the counts of Boulogne rose to great prominence in Northern France. He was apparently a patron of Samer Abbey near Calais and he is said to have been buried there. In 1028 Eustace I confirmed the foundation of a college of canons at his castle at Lens Eustace I died in 1049.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"Frankish","offset":43},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":52},{"uri":"Count_of_Boulogne","surface_form":"Count of Boulogne","offset":65},{"uri":"Boulogne","surface_form":"Boulogne","offset":106},{"uri":"Baldwin_II_of_Boulogne","surface_form":"Baldwin II of Boulogne","offset":181},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":219},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"count","offset":243},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":307},{"uri":"Baldwin_IV%2C_Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders","offset":319},{"uri":"Arnulf_III%2C_Count_of_Boulogne","surface_form":"Arnulf III, Count of Boulogne","offset":373},{"uri":"Age_of_majority","surface_form":"majority","offset":543},{"uri":"Enmity","surface_form":"enmity","offset":705},{"uri":"Baldwin_V%2C_Count_of_Flanders","surface_form":"Baldwin V","offset":794},{"uri":"Advocates","surface_form":"advocates","offset":995},{"uri":"House_of_Normandy","surface_form":"house of Normandy","offset":1034},{"uri":"Eustace_II%2C_Count_of_Boulogne","surface_form":"Eustace II","offset":1094},{"uri":"Goda_of_England","surface_form":"Goda","offset":1108},{"uri":"Richard_II%2C_Duke_of_Normandy","surface_form":"Richard II","offset":1123},{"uri":"Samer","surface_form":"Samer","offset":1249},{"uri":"Calais","surface_form":"Calais","offset":1266},{"uri":"College_(canon_law)","surface_form":"college of canons","offset":1363}]}
