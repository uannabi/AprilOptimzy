{"id":415295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliesin_(studio)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Taliesin near Spring Green, Wisconsin, was the summer home of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright began the building in 1911 after leaving his first wife, Catherine Tobin, and his Oak Park, Illinois, home and studio in 1909.\nThe impetus behind Wright's departure was his affair with Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who had been his client, along with her husband, Edwin Cheney. His winter home, Taliesin West, is located in Scottsdale, Arizona.\nSome of the buildings designed at Taliesin were Fallingwater, the Guggenheim Museum, the Johnson Wax Headquarters, and the first Usonian home, the first Herbert and Katherine Jacobs house, in Madison, Wisconsin (1936).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spring_Green%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Spring Green","offset":27},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":41},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":75},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":84},{"uri":"Frank_Lloyd_Wright","surface_form":"Frank Lloyd Wright","offset":94},{"uri":"1911_in_architecture","surface_form":"1911","offset":143},{"uri":"Oak_Park%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Oak Park, Illinois","offset":203},{"uri":"Mamah_Borthwick","surface_form":"Mamah Borthwick Cheney","offset":306},{"uri":"Edwin_Cheney","surface_form":"Edwin Cheney","offset":379},{"uri":"Taliesin_West","surface_form":"Taliesin West","offset":410},{"uri":"Scottsdale%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Scottsdale","offset":439},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":451},{"uri":"Fallingwater","surface_form":"Fallingwater","offset":508},{"uri":"Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum","surface_form":"Guggenheim Museum","offset":526},{"uri":"Johnson_Wax_Headquarters","surface_form":"Johnson Wax Headquarters","offset":549},{"uri":"Usonian","surface_form":"Usonian","offset":589},{"uri":"Herbert_Jacobs_House_I","surface_form":"Herbert and Katherine Jacobs house","offset":613},{"uri":"Madison%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Madison","offset":652}]}
