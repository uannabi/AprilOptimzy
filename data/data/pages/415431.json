{"id":415431,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone","text":"=\"preserve\">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), or Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is a hormone synthesized and released from neurons in the hypothalamus.\nGnRH is responsible for the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary.\nGnRH activity is very low during childhood, and is activated at puberty or adolescence. During the reproductive years, pulse activity is critical for successful reproductive function as controlled by feedback loops. However, once a pregnancy is established, GnRH activity is not required.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":105},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesized","offset":113},{"uri":"Neurons","surface_form":"neurons","offset":143},{"uri":"Hypothalamus","surface_form":"hypothalamus","offset":158},{"uri":"Follicle-stimulating_hormone","surface_form":"follicle-stimulating hormone","offset":211},{"uri":"Luteinizing_hormone","surface_form":"luteinizing hormone","offset":250},{"uri":"Pituitary_gland","surface_form":"anterior pituitary","offset":284},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":368},{"uri":"Adolescence","surface_form":"adolescence","offset":379},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":536}]}
