It is equal to of an inch. This is not to be confused with the old form of \"you\".\nEtymology.\nThou comes from the Germanic languages, a shortening of \"thousandth\".\nMil comes from the Romance languages, a shortening of \"mille\".\nHistory.\nThe thou was introduced in 1844 by Joseph Whitworth as a substitute to traditional fractions such as which cannot be defined simply in hundredths unlike (0.25) or (0.5). Traditional fractions continued to be used, as they were a substantial part of other units of length.\nUsage.\nThe thou is used in engineering and manufacturing mostly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":83},{"uri":"Imperial_units","surface_form":"Imperial System","offset":97},{"uri":"United_States_customary_units","surface_form":"United States Customary Units","offset":121},{"uri":"Germanic_languages","surface_form":"Germanic languages","offset":265},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":334},{"uri":"Joseph_Whitworth","surface_form":"Joseph Whitworth","offset":422},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fractions","offset":470},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":686},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":702}]}
