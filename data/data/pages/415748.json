{"id":415748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-ski","text":"A Sit-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. It is made from fiberglass. Early sit-skis looked like kayaks and had metal edges.\nSit-skis are used for para-Nordic skiing and para-alpine skiing. If the sit-ski has one ski, it is sometimes name a mono-ski. If a sit-ski has two skis, it is sometimes called a bi-ski. Skiers first used bi-skis in para-alpine skiing before using mono-skis. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.\nSit-ski users use outrigger skis. In para-Nordic skiing, a sit-skier may use a normal ski pole that is not as long as one people standing up to ski would use.\nWhen skiers first learn to ski, their teacher may be connected to them on a tether until the skier can control the sit-ski on their own.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Para-alpine_skiing","surface_form":"skier","offset":30},{"uri":"Paraplegia","surface_form":"paraplegia","offset":41},{"uri":"Spina_bifida","surface_form":"spina bifida","offset":53},{"uri":"Muscular_dystrophy","surface_form":"muscular dystrophy","offset":67},{"uri":"Cerebral_palsy","surface_form":"cerebral palsy","offset":90},{"uri":"Fiberglass","surface_form":"fiberglass","offset":122},{"uri":"Kayak","surface_form":"kayaks","offset":161},{"uri":"Para-Nordic_skiing","surface_form":"para-Nordic skiing","offset":211},{"uri":"Para-alpine_skiing","surface_form":"para-alpine skiing","offset":234},{"uri":"Mono-ski","surface_form":"mono-ski","offset":305},{"uri":"Outrigger_skis","surface_form":"outrigger skis","offset":553},{"uri":"Ski_pole","surface_form":"ski pole","offset":621},{"uri":"Tether","surface_form":"tether","offset":770}]}
