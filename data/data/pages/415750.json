{"id":415750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono-ski","text":"A mono-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. Mono-skis are used only in para-alpine skiing. People who use mono-skis need good balance to stop themselves from falling over. The mono-ski has a chair with one ski attached to the bottom.\nPeople first used mono-skis in 1985 in the United States. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.\nMono-skis have a hydraulic lift. This makes it easier for a skier to get in and out of the mono-ski.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Para-alpine_skiing","surface_form":"skier","offset":31},{"uri":"Paraplegia","surface_form":"paraplegia","offset":42},{"uri":"Spina_bifida","surface_form":"spina bifida","offset":54},{"uri":"Muscular_dystrophy","surface_form":"muscular dystrophy","offset":68},{"uri":"Cerebral_palsy","surface_form":"cerebral palsy","offset":91},{"uri":"Para-alpine_skiing","surface_form":"para-alpine skiing","offset":134},{"uri":"Equilibrioception","surface_form":"balance","offset":189},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":340},{"uri":"Hydraulic_lift","surface_form":"hydraulic lift","offset":460}]}
