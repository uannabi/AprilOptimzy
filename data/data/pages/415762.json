Their distances are described in two ways. redshift = z, and billion light years (Gly).\nAs of 2012, there are only about 50 possible objects z=8 or farther, and another 100 z=7 candidates. Candidates vary in their notablity, so not everything is included here. 1 Gly = 1 billion light-years = 109 ly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxies","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":73},{"uri":"Redshift","surface_form":"redshift","offset":160},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":178},{"uri":"Light_years","surface_form":"light years","offset":186}]}
