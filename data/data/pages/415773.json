{"id":415773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDFj-39546284","text":"UDFj-39546284 is a 'stellar structure' (probably a galaxy) reported January 27, 2011 as light from the oldest object. It was detected through infrared observation by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was reported in December 2012 to be at redshift z = 11.9 using Hubble and Spitzer telescope data, including Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF).\nThe actual stellar source of the light detected no longer exists. The image is likely to correspond to a compact mini-galaxy of blue stars that existed as we see it 13.42 billion years ago, around \"380 million years\" after the Big Bang (estimated at 13.8 billion years ago).\nAt the time of the announcement, it was the oldest galaxy found. It beat the previous distance record holder by about 150 million light years. With the revision of the distance, it again became the oldest galaxy found as of December 12, 2012. The next attempt to see further will be the James Webb Space Telescope launched sometime this decade.\nUnlike UDFy-38135539, UDFj-39546284 has not been spectroscopically confirmed. A galaxy first formed near to the end of the Dark Ages, it offers information from early after the Big Bang.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["galaxy"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":51},{"uri":"Most_distant_things","surface_form":"oldest object","offset":103},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":142},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"Hubble Space Telescope","offset":170},{"uri":"Redshift","surface_form":"redshift","offset":236},{"uri":"Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field","surface_form":"Hubble Ultra-Deep Field","offset":305},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":455},{"uri":"Big_Bang","surface_form":"Big Bang","offset":564},{"uri":"James_Webb_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"James Webb Space Telescope","offset":899},{"uri":"UDFy-38135539","surface_form":"UDFy-38135539","offset":964},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopically confirmed","offset":1006},{"uri":"Chronology_of_the_universe","surface_form":"Dark Ages","offset":1080}]}
