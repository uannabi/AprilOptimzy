{"id":415814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence","text":"Luminescence is light emitted by a substance not caused by heat. In contrast, incandescence is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating.\nLuminescence can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions, or piezoelectricity (stress on a crystal). The term 'luminescence' was introduced in 1888 by Eilhard Wiedemann.\nThe dials, hands, scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as 'luminising'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":16},{"uri":"Emission","surface_form":"emitted","offset":22},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":59},{"uri":"Incandescence","surface_form":"incandescence","offset":78},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":178},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electrical energy","offset":198},{"uri":"Piezoelectricity","surface_form":"piezoelectricity","offset":239},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":269}]}
