It began when the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, gave up the British Crown colony of Hong Kong to Empire of Japan on 25 December 1941. The occupation lasted for three years and eight months until Japan gave up at the end of Second World War.\nEconomics.\nOne day after the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong started, the Japanese military yen was changed to the only legal currency of Hong Kong.
