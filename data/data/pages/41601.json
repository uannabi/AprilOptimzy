{"id":41601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union","text":"The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is an international group that brings together the national astronomical groups from around the world. It was created in 1919. It was created to promote and protect the science of astronomy by getting different nations to work together. Its members are professional astronomers from all over the world, and they all work on research and education in astronomy. The IAU has good relationships with groups that include amateur astronomers. \"National Members\" are usually people with a high level of professional astronomy. There are more than 10,000 active \"Individual Members\" in 107 countries. It has 62 \"National Members\".\nThis organization has many working groups like the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), which maintains the astronomical naming conventions and planetary nomenclature for planetary bodies, and the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) for naming stars.\nThe IAU is also the group in charge of naming objects in space and anything on them such as mountains and craters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":49},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":94},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomical","offset":103},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"world","offset":139},{"uri":"1919","surface_form":"1919","offset":164},{"uri":"Promote","surface_form":"promote","offset":188},{"uri":"Protect","surface_form":"protect","offset":200},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":212},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":223},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":296},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":309},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":367},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":380},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":421},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":460},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"countries","offset":626},{"uri":"Astronomical_naming_conventions","surface_form":"astronomical naming conventions","offset":795},{"uri":"Planetary_nomenclature","surface_form":"planetary nomenclature","offset":831},{"uri":"Working_Group_on_Star_Names","surface_form":"Working Group on Star Names","offset":884},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"space","offset":994},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1029},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":1043}]}
