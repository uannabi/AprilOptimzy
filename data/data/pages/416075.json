{"id":416075,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)","text":"In the fictional Star Wars universe, Stormtroopers are highly trained soldiers working for the evil Emperor Palpatine and his sidekick Darth Vader. They wear white armor and helmets, and use blaster guns.\nSome of the Stormtroopers are clones (copies) of a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. These clones used to be on the side of the Galactic Republic, but after being told by the Emperor to kill all the Jedi, they killed most of them, and afterwards became Stormtroopers. Later, regular men and women became Stormtroopers too.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional","surface_form":"fictional","offset":7},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":17},{"uri":"Palpatine","surface_form":"Palpatine","offset":108},{"uri":"Sidekick","surface_form":"sidekick","offset":126},{"uri":"Darth_Vader","surface_form":"Darth Vader","offset":135},{"uri":"Clones","surface_form":"clones","offset":235},{"uri":"Bounty_hunter","surface_form":"bounty hunter","offset":256},{"uri":"Jango_Fett","surface_form":"Jango Fett","offset":276},{"uri":"Galactic_Republic","surface_form":"Galactic Republic","offset":331},{"uri":"Jedi","surface_form":"Jedi","offset":402}]}
