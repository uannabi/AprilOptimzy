{"id":41608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation","text":"Obfuscation means making something harder to understand, usually by complicating sentences needlessly. Weasel words are a form of obfuscation. Obfuscation is usually used when people either do not know what they are talking about or wish to hide their meaning.\nSome people say that when doctors use difficult medical words to hide unpleasant things from patients, they are using obfuscation.\nTechnical term: Obfuscation is sometimes used to make source code much harder to read and reverse engineer.
