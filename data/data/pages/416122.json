{"id":416122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_2029","text":"Abell 2029 or A2029 is a large cluster of galaxies 1 billion light years away in the constellation Virgo.\nIts central galaxy, IC 1101, is the largest galaxy known. Estimates ranging from 5.6 to over 6 million light years across. Contrast this with the Milky Way, which is 200,000 light years across.\nA2029 is also about 81 times bigger than the Milky Way, with a luminosity of 2 L\u2609. This type of galaxy may have grown to its large size by accreting nearby galaxies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxy_cluster","surface_form":"cluster","offset":31},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":42},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":53},{"uri":"Light_years","surface_form":"light years","offset":61},{"uri":"Virgo_(constellation)","surface_form":"Virgo","offset":99},{"uri":"IC_1101","surface_form":"IC 1101","offset":126},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light year","offset":209},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":252},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"luminosity","offset":363},{"uri":"Solar_luminosity","surface_form":"L\u2609","offset":379}]}
