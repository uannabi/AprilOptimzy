{"id":416166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala","text":"Padm\u00E9 Amidala is a fictional character in the fictional \"Star Wars\" universe. She is the secret wife of Anakin Skywalker and the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. She is played by actress Natalie Portman in the prequel trilogy.\nHistory.\nIn \"The Phantom Menace\", Padm\u00E9 is the fourteen-year-old queen of the planet Naboo. In the movie, Amidala gets captured by the evil Trade Federation, meets the young slave boy Anakin Skywalker, and takes her captured planet back from the Trade Federation.\nIn \"Attack of the Clones\", Padm\u00E9 is not the queen anymore; she is now an adult, and a Senator. She and Anakin Skywalker fall in love though she said it would make them live a lie. Even though Anakin is a Jedi, and Jedi aren't supposed to get married, Padm\u00E9 and Anakin got married anyway.\n\"Revenge of the Sith\" is the last movie Padm\u00E9 is in. She is going to have a baby, and her husband Anakin dreams that Padm\u00E9 will die when she has the baby. Palpatine, a man that Anakin trusts, tells Anakin that he can save Padm\u00E9 with the evil Dark Side of the Force. So Anakin goes to the Dark Side but little does he know that the power to save people from death was achieved by a jedi not a sith. He goes to a lava planet called Mustafar, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with Padm\u00E9, follow him there. Anakin, who has turned to the Dark Side, thinks that Padm\u00E9 had got Obi-Wan to come with her (she had not). Anakin chokes Padm\u00E9 using the Force and she blacks out and crumples to the floor.\nPadm\u00E9 is taken a little later to a hospital, where she gives birth to twins. Soon afterwards, because Anakin broke her heart which no none except her and Obi-Wan Kenobi knew, finally telling Obi-Wan with her last breath that she knows there's still good in Anakin, she dies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":29},{"uri":"Fictional","surface_form":"fictional","offset":46},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":57},{"uri":"Anakin_Skywalker","surface_form":"Anakin Skywalker","offset":104},{"uri":"Luke_Skywalker","surface_form":"Luke Skywalker","offset":139},{"uri":"Leia_Organa","surface_form":"Leia Organa","offset":158},{"uri":"Natalie_Portman","surface_form":"Natalie Portman","offset":196},{"uri":"The_Phantom_Menace","surface_form":"The Phantom Menace","offset":249},{"uri":"Naboo","surface_form":"Naboo","offset":321},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":410},{"uri":"Anakin_Skywalker","surface_form":"Anakin Skywalker","offset":420},{"uri":"Attack_of_the_Clones","surface_form":"Attack of the Clones","offset":504},{"uri":"Senator","surface_form":"Senator","offset":586},{"uri":"Jedi","surface_form":"Jedi","offset":704},{"uri":"Revenge_of_the_Sith","surface_form":"Revenge of the Sith","offset":789},{"uri":"Dreams","surface_form":"dreams","offset":893},{"uri":"Palpatine","surface_form":"Palpatine","offset":943},{"uri":"The_Force","surface_form":"the Force","offset":1043},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":1199},{"uri":"Mustafar","surface_form":"Mustafar","offset":1218},{"uri":"Obi-Wan_Kenobi","surface_form":"Obi-Wan Kenobi","offset":1243},{"uri":"Fainting","surface_form":"blacks out","offset":1446}]}
