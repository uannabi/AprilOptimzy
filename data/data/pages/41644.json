{"id":41644,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War","text":"The French and Indian War took place between 1754 and 1763 in British North America and French North America. These are now the United States and Canada. The French had Native American allies and the British had other Indian allies. The war is also called \"the Seven Years' War\".\nThe conflict was a part of the Seven Years' War among the European great powers including Britain and France, which took place in various parts of the world. France was already fighting Prussia, and did not send many troops to Canada.\nBattles.\nFrance built a new fort in the disputed territory and the British decided to expel them. Fighting began with the Battle of Monongahela in 1755. General Edward Braddock, the commander, died with many of his men in a failed attack against the French in what later became Pittsburgh. Militia officer George Washington led the defeated survivors home.\nIn the Battle of the Plains of Abraham Canada was conquered.\nOutcome.\nThe fighting in North America stopped on Sept. 8, 1760 with the surrender of Montreal and all of Canada to Britain. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. France lost all of its North American lands east of the Mississippi River. All of Canada was given to Britain except the small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland. Britain offered France the choice to give up either its Canadian land or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which British troops had taken during the war. France chose to keep the islands, which were valuable for their sugar plantations.\nWith the Royal Proclamation of 1763, British North American colonists became unhappy over their share of the winnings, eventually leading to the American Revolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_North_America","surface_form":"British North America","offset":62},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":88},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":128},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":146},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":169},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British","offset":200},{"uri":"Seven_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Seven Years' War","offset":311},{"uri":"Great_power","surface_form":"great power","offset":347},{"uri":"Edward_Braddock","surface_form":"Edward Braddock","offset":676},{"uri":"Pittsburgh","surface_form":"Pittsburgh","offset":793},{"uri":"Militia","surface_form":"Militia","offset":805},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":821},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Plains_of_Abraham","surface_form":"Battle of the Plains of Abraham","offset":879},{"uri":"Surrender_(military)","surface_form":"surrender","offset":1006},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":1019},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)","surface_form":"Treaty of Paris","offset":1096},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":1190},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1216},{"uri":"Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon","surface_form":"Saint Pierre and Miquelon","offset":1272},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":1303},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":1394},{"uri":"Guadeloupe","surface_form":"Guadeloupe","offset":1415},{"uri":"Martinique","surface_form":"Martinique","offset":1430},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":1559},{"uri":"Royal_Proclamation_of_1763","surface_form":"Royal Proclamation of 1763","offset":1581},{"uri":"British_North_America","surface_form":"British North America","offset":1609},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"American Revolution","offset":1717}]}
