{"id":416478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity","text":"=\"preserve\">Crystallinity is a physical property of a solid that acts like a crystal. The degree of crystallinity of a crystal has a big influence on hardness, density, transparency and diffusion.\nCrystallinity can be measured using x-ray diffraction, but calorimetric techniques are also commonly used.\nExamples would include: sodium chloride (table salt)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physical_property","surface_form":"physical property","offset":31},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":54},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":77},{"uri":"Hardness","surface_form":"hardness","offset":150},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":160},{"uri":"Transparency_and_translucency","surface_form":"transparency","offset":169},{"uri":"Diffusion","surface_form":"diffusion","offset":186},{"uri":"X-ray_diffraction","surface_form":"x-ray diffraction","offset":233},{"uri":"Calorimeter","surface_form":"calorimetric","offset":256}]}
