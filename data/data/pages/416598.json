{"id":416598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment","text":"=\"preserve\">A virtual learning environment (VLE) is a kind of e-learning system placed on a website. It gives learners online access to tools and information to help them with learning something.\nCommon tools offered on a VLE are: online quizzes, email, discussion forums and student blogs. Common information shared with learners via a VLE is: worksheets, lesson plans, homework, grades, assignments and deadlines.\nCombining the use of a VLE and normal classes is often called blended learning.\nSome well-known VLEs are Moodle, WebCT and BlackBoard, but many others exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"E-learning","surface_form":"e-learning","offset":62},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":92},{"uri":"Quiz","surface_form":"quiz","offset":238},{"uri":"Email","surface_form":"email","offset":247},{"uri":"Forum","surface_form":"forum","offset":265},{"uri":"Blog","surface_form":"blog","offset":284},{"uri":"Lesson_plan","surface_form":"lesson plan","offset":357},{"uri":"Homework","surface_form":"homework","offset":371},{"uri":"Blended_learning","surface_form":"blended learning","offset":478},{"uri":"Moodle","surface_form":"Moodle","offset":521},{"uri":"WebCT","surface_form":"WebCT","offset":529},{"uri":"BlackBoard","surface_form":"BlackBoard","offset":539}]}
