It is in Oghi Tehsil, Mansehra District, Hazara, in the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. It consists of three mountain glens, long and wide. The lower parts of the Agror valley contains many farms, villages and hamlets.\nThe main tribes and ethnic groups are the Hindko and Pashto-speaking tribes. These include the Swatis, the Gurjars, Awans and Tanolis.\nHistory.\nDuring the 17th century, the valley was ruled by a famous tribal leader of the Swatis. His title was the Khan of Agror. His real name was Akund Saad-ud-din. He was a \"mullah\" or petty Muslim religious scholar, who obtained power over the local people of the Agror valley. In time, he established himself as the local 'Khan' or chieftain and controlled the whole valley. His capital was at Oghi town.\nIn 1888, during the period of the British Empire, the Khan's descendant, Ali Gohar, was removed from power. The title and estate were formally abolished. However, the Akund's descendants still use this courtesy title.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":24},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":43},{"uri":"Oghi_Tehsil","surface_form":"Oghi Tehsil","offset":62},{"uri":"Mansehra_District","surface_form":"Mansehra District","offset":75},{"uri":"Hazara%2C_Pakistan","surface_form":"Hazara","offset":94},{"uri":"Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","surface_form":"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa","offset":121},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"farms","offset":243},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":250},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":292},{"uri":"Hindko","surface_form":"Hindko","offset":314},{"uri":"Pashto","surface_form":"Pashto","offset":325},{"uri":"Swatis","surface_form":"Swatis","offset":367},{"uri":"Gurjar","surface_form":"Gurjar","offset":379},{"uri":"Awan_tribe","surface_form":"Awans","offset":388},{"uri":"Tanoli","surface_form":"Tanoli","offset":398},{"uri":"Khan_(title)","surface_form":"Khan","offset":521},{"uri":"Mullah","surface_form":"mullah","offset":583},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":600},{"uri":"Oghi","surface_form":"Oghi","offset":805},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":850}]}
