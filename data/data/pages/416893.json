It lives in Central America, from south-east Mexico (mostly the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula) to Costa Rica. The turquoise-browed motmot is a colourful bird, mostly turquoise, green and orange. It is common and not in danger. It lives in fairly open habitats such as on the edges of forests and scrubland.\nThe motmots live in the tropical forests of Central America. They are brightly coloured with a strong beak. They have a signature tail with two bare feathers ending in tufts, just like this bird. This effect is got by the tail feathers having no barbs along the middle section.\nThis motmot has other local names. Itis called \"Torogoz\" in El Salvador and \"Guardabarranco\" in Nicaragua. It is the national bird of these two countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":59},{"uri":"Motmot","surface_form":"motmot","offset":71},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":98},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":131},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula","offset":150},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":172},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":325},{"uri":"Scrubland","surface_form":"scrubland","offset":370},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":405},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":414},{"uri":"El_Salvador","surface_form":"El Salvador","offset":719},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":755}]}
