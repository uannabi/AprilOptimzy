{"id":41695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity","text":"Ambiguity means that what a thing is, is not clear. Literally, the word refers to a choice between two different things. In the proper sense it should mean \u201Ctwo different meanings\u201D because \u201Cambi\u201D comes from the Greek word for \u201Ctwo\u201D.\nWe see things happen, and then we decide what they mean. If we cannot decide what is going on, the event is ambiguous. This is an extension of the original use of the word.\nWords or sentences that are ambiguous can lead to misunderstandings (people get the wrong meaning). This can sometimes be serious, but it can also be funny. Jokes often rely on ambiguity.\nA mother says to her little boy: \u201CJohnny, go over the road and see how old Mrs Jones is\u201D. The boy comes back and says to his mother: \u201CMrs Jones says it is none of my business\u201D.\nThe mother meant \u201Cold\u201D in a friendly way (\u201Cdear old Mrs Jones\u201D), but the sentence could also mean: find out Mrs Jones\u2019s age. This is obviously how Johnny understood his mother's instruction.\nThe opposite of ambiguous is unambiguous (meaning that something is perfectly clear and can only have one meaning).\nAmbiguity is not the same as vagueness, which means that there is so little detail given that a statement can mean almost anything.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":211},{"uri":"Joke","surface_form":"Joke","offset":563},{"uri":"Vagueness","surface_form":"vagueness","offset":1107}]}
