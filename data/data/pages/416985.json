{"id":416985,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Iron-deficiency anemia (or iron-deficiency anaemia) is a common type of anemia. It is caused by not having enough iron in food, not absorbing the iron in food, and/or losing iron because of bleeding.\nIron deficiency causes approximately half of all anemia cases worldwide, and affects women more often than men. This is partly because most women have periods (menstruate). There are probably more than one billion people who have anemia.\nAnemia is most common in areas like Brazil or Central Africa. Asia, Central America and Eastern Europe are affected too, with North America least affected.\nSymptoms include pale skin, tiredness, and weakness.\nAnemia can be diagnosed with a blood test by finding out if there is little enough hemoglobin in the blood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anemia","surface_form":"anemia","offset":85},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":127},{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":203},{"uri":"Menstruation","surface_form":"menstruate","offset":373},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":487},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":505},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":513},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":519},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":539},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":577},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"Symptom","offset":607},{"uri":"Pallor","surface_form":"pale skin","offset":624},{"uri":"Fatigue","surface_form":"tiredness","offset":635},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosed","offset":674},{"uri":"Hemoglobin","surface_form":"hemoglobin","offset":743}]}
