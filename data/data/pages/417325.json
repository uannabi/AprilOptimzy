{"id":417325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Miguel_Island","text":"S\u00E3o Miguel Island, named for the Archangel Michael (), is also referred to locally as \"The Green Island\", is the largest and most populous island in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The island has around 138,000 inhabitants and its largest city, and in the archipelago, is Ponta Delgada.\nHistory.\nIn 1427, S\u00E3o Miguel became the second of the islands discovered by Gon\u00E7alo Velho Cabral to be settled by people from continental Portugal.\nThe first capital of the island was Vila Franca do Campo, which was devastated by a major earthquake and landslides in 1522. The tragedy helped to elevate Ponta Delgada to the administrative and economic status of capital and business centre from 1546.\nWith the Portuguese Restoration War (1640), the island became a commercial centre, establishing new contacts in Brazil. Some of the island\u2019s historic buildings, including mansions and churches, date from this period; the island's development came from revenues from the export of oranges, mainly to Great Britain.\nThe period after the Liberal Wars allowed the economy to flourish, and the port of Ponta Delgada expanded, through the export of new crops such as tea, pineapple, and tobacco. The development of the fishing industry, cultivation of staple food and expansion of the dairy industry permitted the growth of many of the towns on the island.\nGeography.\nThe S\u00E3o Miguel Island has an area of. It is a narrow island; it is long (from southeast to northwest) and wide (from southwest to northeast).\nRelief.\nThe island, of volcanic nature and subject to seismic activity, presents many mountains, mainly in the interior, dominated by the \"Pico da Vara\"; those mountains are cut by valleys, gullies and streams - the only waterways because there are not rivers.\nThe island consists of an ancient massif in the eastern end, and three stratovolcanoes: Sete Cidades, Fogo and Furnas'\". The stratovolcano of Sete Cidades is known for its large caldera () of in diameter and of mean depth; in it there are two small lakes (\"Lagoa Verde\" to the south and \"Lagoa Azul\" to north).\nIn the eastern part of the island is the Pico da Vara () - the highest mountain of the island - with of altitude. In the central area, is the Sierra de \u00C1gua de Pau with 940 m height and on the west lies the Caldeira das Sete Cidades, 850 m altitude.\nLying at the eastern end of the island, Pico da Vara is the focus of a Special Protection Area containing the largest remaining laurisilva forest on the island, which is home to the endemic and critically endangered bird, the Azores Bullfinch.\nIts fertile lands produce cereals, tea, grapes (for wine), fruits and food for cattle.\nClimate.\nSimilar to other islands in the Azores archipelago, S\u00E3o Miguel is influenced by ocean currents and winds, in particular, the Gulf Stream. It functions as a moderating force in the islands, keeping temperatures hovering between throughout the year. Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year, although it is most abundant in the cool season. The island's location also makes it susceptible to many Atlantic storms.\nThe K\u00F6ppen climate classification subtype for the climate of S\u00E2o Miguel Island, in Ponta Delgada, is Csb (Mediterranean Climate).\nHuman geography.\nMost towns and cities are in plains, some along the coast and a few in the interior of the island. There are several communities within ancient craters (such as Sete Cidades, Furnas or Povoa\u00E7\u00E3o), river valleys (such as Ribeira Ch\u00E3, Pilar da Bretanha) or coastal deltas (Mosteiros).\nThere are two cities in the islands: Ponta Delgada and Ribeira Grande.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Michael_(archangel)","surface_form":"Archangel
