{"id":417378,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athelheard_of_Wessex","text":"Athelheard, also spelled \u00C6thelheard (\u2020 740), was a West Saxon nobleman and atheling. He was the King of Wessex from 726 until his death. He took the powerful kingdom of Wessex left to him by Ine and lost much of it to Mercia.\nKing of Wessex.\nWhen Ine stepped down as King of Wessex it caused a problem of succession. Ine's son had been killed rebelling against Ine a year earlier. Ine was now in his sixties and retired to Rome. He 'commended his kingdom to younger men'. It came down to a struggle between the two athelings, Oswald and Athelheard, Oswald was descended from Ceawlin. The same entry calls Athelheard kinsman to Ine. The two fought and Athelheard became king. In one charter Athelheard is called the brother of Ine's wife Atelburh.\nIn 733 Somerton was lost to King Aethelbald of Mercia. This was quickly followed by the territory beyond Selwood being lost to Mercia. Athelheard's authority was so weak that Aethelbald was able to give the Archbishop of Canterbury a gift of the monastery of Cookham in Berkshire (Wessex). Aethelbald also took Wiltshire, Sussex and much of the heartlands of Wessex. Athelheard could do nothing to prevent this loss. He also took part in Athelbald's wars with the Welsh. It seems Athelbald's wife, Frithugyth, was Mercian herself. In 737 she made a pilgrimage to Rome along with bishop Forthhere of Sherborne. Athelheard died in 740, his successor was his kinsman Cuthred.\nFamily.\nHe married Frithugyth. They had no known children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%E2%80%A0","surface_form":"\u2020","offset":37},{"uri":"Wessex","surface_form":"West Saxon","offset":51},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":62},{"uri":"Atheling","surface_form":"atheling","offset":75},{"uri":"List_of_monarchs_of_Wessex","surface_form":"King of Wessex","offset":96},{"uri":"Ine_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Ine","offset":191},{"uri":"Mercia","surface_form":"Mercia","offset":218},{"uri":"Ine_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Ine","offset":247},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":423},{"uri":"Somerton","surface_form":"Somerton","offset":754},{"uri":"Aethelbald_of_Mercia","surface_form":"Aethelbald of Mercia","offset":780},{"uri":"Selwood%2C_Somerset","surface_form":"Selwood","offset":852},{"uri":"Archbishop_of_Canterbury","surface_form":"Archbishop of Canterbury","offset":954},{"uri":"Cookham_Abbey","surface_form":"monastery of Cookham","offset":993},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":1017},{"uri":"Wiltshire","surface_form":"Wiltshire","offset":1058},{"uri":"Sussex","surface_form":"Sussex","offset":1069},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":1211},{"uri":"Pilgrimage","surface_form":"pilgrimage","offset":1296},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1310},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":1326},{"uri":"Forthhere","surface_form":"Forthhere","offset":1333},{"uri":"Cuthred_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Cuthred","offset":1411}]}
