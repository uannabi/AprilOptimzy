It was signed on 24 December 1814 in the Flemish city of Ghent. The treaty restored the borders of the two countries to the line before the beginning of the war.\nThe treaty was ratified by Parliament on 30 December 1814. It was signed into law by the Prince Regent (the future King George IV). An American army under Andrew Jackson scored a major victory at the Battle of New Orleans in early January 1815. The Treaty was not in effect until it was ratified by the U.S. Senate (unanimously) in February 1815.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peace_treaty","surface_form":"peace treaty","offset":28},{"uri":"War_of_1812","surface_form":"War of 1812","offset":56},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":80},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":113},{"uri":"Flanders","surface_form":"Flemish","offset":170},{"uri":"Ghent","surface_form":"Ghent","offset":186},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":318},{"uri":"George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George IV","offset":406},{"uri":"Andrew_Jackson","surface_form":"Andrew Jackson","offset":446},{"uri":"Battle_of_New_Orleans","surface_form":"Battle of New Orleans","offset":491},{"uri":"U.S._Senate","surface_form":"U.S. Senate","offset":594}]}
