It seeks to eliminate Sufism from Somalia and has opposed various Sufi groups. It was recognised as a cell of al-Qaeda in 2012. The official name of the group is Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (). It is now an affiliate of ISIL. Its name is Arabic for the Youth.\nSome people who were in the Islamic Courts Union formed al-Shabaab in 2006 or 2007. Wahhabi ideas inflenced al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab wants to create an Islamic state at the Horn of Africa, and to take part in a golbal djihad.\nAl-Shabaab controls large parts of southern Somalia. In the area it controls, there is a strict form of Sharia law. The group has claimed responsibility for various terrorist attacks including the Westgate shopping mall shooting in 2013, Nairobi DusitD2 complex attack early 2019 in Westlands, Nairobi, Kenya and the Garissa University attack which killed 142 people in April 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Militant_group","surface_form":"militant group","offset":16},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":40},{"uri":"Sufism","surface_form":"Sufism","offset":71},{"uri":"Clandestine_cell_system","surface_form":"cell","offset":151},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"al-Qaeda","offset":159},{"uri":"Arabic","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":292},{"uri":"Islamic_Courts_Union","surface_form":"Islamic Courts Union","offset":342},{"uri":"Wahhabi_movement","surface_form":"Wahhabi","offset":398},{"uri":"Horn_of_Africa","surface_form":"Horn of Africa","offset":485},{"uri":"Djihad","surface_form":"djihad","offset":530},{"uri":"Sharia_law","surface_form":"Sharia law","offset":642},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":703},{"uri":"Westgate_shopping_mall_shooting","surface_form":"Westgate shopping mall shooting","offset":735},{"uri":"Nairobi_DusitD2_complex_attack","surface_form":"Nairobi DusitD2 complex attack","offset":776},{"uri":"Westlands%2C_Nairobi","surface_form":"Westlands, Nairobi","offset":821},{"uri":"Garissa_University_attack","surface_form":"Garissa University attack","offset":855}]}
