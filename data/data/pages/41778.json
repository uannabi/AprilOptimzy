{"id":41778,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven%27s_Gate","text":"=\"preserve\">Heaven's Gate was the name of a UFO group led by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles, until their deaths.\nThe group ended with the appearance of Comet Hale-Bopp, in the United States in the year 1997. Applewhite convinced 38 followers to kill themselves so that their souls could ride on a spaceship they believed was hiding behind the comet. Beliefs such as this led some people to call this a \"UFO Religion\". This belief was made up of UFO, New Age and Christian ideas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UFO","surface_form":"UFO","offset":44},{"uri":"Marshall_Applewhite","surface_form":"Marshall Applewhite","offset":61},{"uri":"Bonnie_Nettles","surface_form":"Bonnie Nettles","offset":85},{"uri":"Comet","surface_form":"Comet","offset":160},{"uri":"Hale-Bopp","surface_form":"Hale-Bopp","offset":166},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":184},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":210},{"uri":"Follower","surface_form":"follower","offset":240},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"kill themselves","offset":253},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":283},{"uri":"Spaceship","surface_form":"spaceship","offset":305},{"uri":"New_Age","surface_form":"New Age","offset":458}]}
