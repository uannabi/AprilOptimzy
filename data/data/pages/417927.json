Golden moles look like moles. Sequence analysis found that these animals are not closely related to other insectivores.\nSome biologists use Tenrecomorpha as the name for the tenrec-golden mole clade, but Gary Bronner and Paulina Jenkins argue that Afrosoricida is more appropriate, despite their misgivings about the similarity between the name \"Afrosoricida\" and the unrelated shrew subgenus \"Afrosorex\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":19},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":28},{"uri":"Tenrecidae","surface_form":"Tenrecs","offset":56},{"uri":"Golden_mole","surface_form":"Golden mole","offset":72},{"uri":"Hedgehog","surface_form":"hedgehog","offset":103},{"uri":"Mole","surface_form":"mole","offset":151},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"Sequence analysis","offset":158},{"uri":"Insectivore","surface_form":"insectivore","offset":234},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":321},{"uri":"Subgenus","surface_form":"subgenus","offset":512},{"uri":"Afrosorex","surface_form":"Afrosorex","offset":522}]}
