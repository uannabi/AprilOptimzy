{"id":417992,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbar","text":"A sandbar, or shoal is a landform which is in or partly in a body of water. Usually it is made of sand, silt, and/or small pebbles.\nDescription.\nShoals are long and narrow ridges. They can develop where a stream, river, or ocean current deposits sediment and granular material.\nShoals look like a coastal landform in the sea. They are classified as a type of ocean bank, or as fluvial landforms in rivers, streams, and lakes.\nThey are usually made up of sand. They can also be made up of soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":98},{"uri":"Silt","surface_form":"silt","offset":104},{"uri":"Pebbles","surface_form":"pebbles","offset":123},{"uri":"Ridge","surface_form":"ridges","offset":172},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":205},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":213},{"uri":"Ocean_current","surface_form":"ocean current","offset":223},{"uri":"Deposition_(geology)","surface_form":"deposits","offset":237},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":246},{"uri":"Granular_material","surface_form":"granular material","offset":259},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coastal landform","offset":297},{"uri":"Ocean_bank","surface_form":"ocean bank","offset":359},{"uri":"Fluvial","surface_form":"fluvial landforms","offset":377},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"streams","offset":406},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lakes","offset":419},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":454},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":488},{"uri":"Silt","surface_form":"silt","offset":494},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":500},{"uri":"Cobble","surface_form":"cobble","offset":508},{"uri":"Shingle","surface_form":"shingle","offset":516},{"uri":"Boulder","surface_form":"boulders","offset":533}]}
