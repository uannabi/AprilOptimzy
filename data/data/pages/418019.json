{"id":418019,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_cage","text":"A bird cage (sometimes birdcage) is a cage to hold a bird. Bird cages are used in the home to contain a pet bird, such as a parakeet or a canary. Bird cages used in the home are made of metal wire. A bird cage usually has seed and water dishes, a cuttle bone, and toys such as little bells and mirrors. There are perches for the bird to sit on. A cage may be hung from a ceiling or a floor stand. The floor of the cage is usually lined with some sort of paper to absorb the bird's droppings, water spills, etc.\nSize.\nUsually, the larger a bird is, a larger cage is needed. A bird that spends most of its time caged will also need a larger cage. Birds that are breeding might need a nest inside the cage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cage","surface_form":"cage","offset":38},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":53},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"contain","offset":94},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":104},{"uri":"Parakeet","surface_form":"parakeet","offset":124},{"uri":"Canary","surface_form":"canary","offset":138},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":186},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":192},{"uri":"Cuttlebone","surface_form":"cuttle bone","offset":247},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"droppings","offset":481}]}
