{"id":418059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment","text":"Entrapment is inducement to commit a crime, especially by authorities, to get a conviction. The implication is that the person might otherwise have been unlikely to commit the crime. In some countries, entrapment is a possible defence against criminal liability.\nAnother similar term is \"agent provocateur\", an older French term for the person who does the inducing.\nA sting operation is a more sophisticated way to trap criminals. It usually involves leaving a bait, and filming or catching whoever takes the bait.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Induce","surface_form":"inducement","offset":14},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":37},{"uri":"Conviction","surface_form":"conviction","offset":80},{"uri":"Implication_(grammar)","surface_form":"implication","offset":96},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":243},{"uri":"Liability","surface_form":"liability","offset":252},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":317},{"uri":"Sting_operation","surface_form":"sting operation","offset":369},{"uri":"Bait","surface_form":"bait","offset":462}]}
