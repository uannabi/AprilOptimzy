{"id":41808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living","text":"Simple living means to choose a lifestyle where you own fewer things and focus on what you need instead of what you want. People choose this lifestyle for many different reasons, often based on their views on health, economy, or philosophy, or because they want to protect the environment. Some people do it simply because it suits them better.\nSome famous people who chose the simple living lifestyle are Francis of Assisi, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, Albert Schweitzer, Mohandas Gandhi, and Henry David Thoreau. The Amish live simply by using only things that are described in the Bible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Simple","surface_form":"Simple","offset":0},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"living","offset":7},{"uri":"Lifestyle","surface_form":"lifestyle","offset":32},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":209},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":217},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":229},{"uri":"Environmentalism","surface_form":"protect the environment","offset":265},{"uri":"Francis_of_Assisi","surface_form":"Francis of Assisi","offset":406},{"uri":"Leo_Tolstoy","surface_form":"Leo Tolstoy","offset":425},{"uri":"Rabindranath_Tagore","surface_form":"Rabindranath Tagore","offset":438},{"uri":"Albert_Schweitzer","surface_form":"Albert Schweitzer","offset":459},{"uri":"Mohandas_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mohandas Gandhi","offset":478},{"uri":"Henry_David_Thoreau","surface_form":"Henry David Thoreau","offset":499},{"uri":"Amish","surface_form":"Amish","offset":524},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":589}]}
