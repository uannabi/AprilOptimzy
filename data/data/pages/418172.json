It was developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo. It was released in North America on May 24, 2004, in Japan on June 1, 2004, and in Europe on November 19, 2004. It is a spiritual successor to \"Donkey Kong\", which was released for the Game Boy in 1994.\nIn the game, the player plays as Mario, who is chasing Donkey Kong through a toy factory after Donkey Kong stole many Mini-Mario toys. It plays similarly to the Game Boy \"Donkey Kong\" game. There are five types of levels. In the first type, Mario has to pick up a key and take it to a locked door, then find and pick up the Mini-Mario toy at the end of the level. In the second type, Mario has to guide six Mini-Mario toys to the Toy Box. While doing so, he has to protect them from dangers in the level. In the third type, Mario has to fight Donkey Kong in order to go to the next world. In the fourth type, the Plus level, Mario has to turn on one Mini-Mario with a key and take it to the door. The fifth type of level, the Expert level, plays like the first type of level, but is harder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puzzle_video_game","surface_form":"puzzle","offset":34},{"uri":"Platform_game","surface_form":"platform","offset":41},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":50},{"uri":"Game_Boy_Advance","surface_form":"Game Boy Advance","offset":69},{"uri":"Nintendo_Software_Technology","surface_form":"Nintendo Software Technology","offset":107},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":153},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":182},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":216},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":246},{"uri":"Spiritual_successor","surface_form":"spiritual successor","offset":283},{"uri":"Donkey_Kong_(handheld_game)","surface_form":"Donkey Kong","offset":307},{"uri":"Game_Boy","surface_form":"Game Boy","offset":348},{"uri":"Mario","surface_form":"Mario","offset":399},{"uri":"Donkey_Kong","surface_form":"Donkey Kong","offset":421}]}
