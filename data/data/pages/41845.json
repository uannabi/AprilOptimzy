{"id":41845,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca","text":"Yucca is a family of shrubs and trees, related to the agaves. There are between 40 and 50 different kinds of Yucca. All come from the hot and dry places in North and Central America, as well as the Caribbean.\nThey have a very special way of pollination. There is an animal, the Yucca moth, which does the pollination. It also lays its eggs in the plant. The larvae will eat some of the seeds, but not all of them.\nIn many parts of the world, yuccas are grown as ornamental flowers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":11},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":21},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":32},{"uri":"Agave","surface_form":"agave","offset":54},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"kinds","offset":100},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"hot","offset":134},{"uri":"Dry","surface_form":"dry","offset":142},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North","offset":156},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":166},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":198},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"pollination","offset":241},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":266},{"uri":"Yucca_moth","surface_form":"Yucca moth","offset":278},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":335},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":358},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":386},{"uri":"Ornament","surface_form":"ornament","offset":462},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":473}]}
