{"id":41870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playground","text":"A playground is an area used by children to play in. They usually have equipment such as slides, swings and seesaws for children to play on. They are usually outside, but sometimes they are in a building. Having a playground can enhance your macadam surface and improve your kid\u2019s time in the playground.\nThe equipment may be made of metal, wood or plastic. The ground beneath the equipment will not be hard in case a child falls. It may be a rubber floor, or there may be woodchips or sand.\nPlaygrounds give children a place for physical exercise. This helps them get and keep physical fitness and be strong and healthy. Daily exercise reduces the risks of obesity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":32},{"uri":"Play_(activity)","surface_form":"play","offset":44},{"uri":"Playground_slide","surface_form":"slides","offset":89},{"uri":"Playground_swing","surface_form":"swings","offset":97},{"uri":"Seesaw","surface_form":"seesaw","offset":108},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":334},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":341},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":349},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":486},{"uri":"Physical_exercise","surface_form":"physical exercise","offset":530},{"uri":"Physical_fitness","surface_form":"physical fitness","offset":578},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":658}]}
