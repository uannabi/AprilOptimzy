He later became the Bishop of London.\nBishop of Winchester.\nWine had been ordained in Gaul. In Wessex King Cenwalh of Wessex had grown tired of his current bishop, Agilbert, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Wine did speak Anglo-Saxon and was invited by Cenwalh to come to Wessex. Cenwalh built a new church at Winchester; dividing his kingdom into two dioceses. There, Wine was consecrated the first bishop of Winchester in 660. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and returned to Gaul. King Oswiu of Northumbria appointed a monk named Chad to be bishop to the Northumbrians. He sent Chad to Canterbury to be consecrated Bishop of York. On Chad's arrival in Kent, however, he discovered Archbishop Dusdedit had died. As no successor had yet been appointed, Chad went to Bishop Wine in Wessex to be consecrated. Wine was the only consecrated Bishop in England at the time recognized by the Church at Rome.\nBishop of London.\nWine was later expelled by Cenwalh and went to King Wulfhere of Mercia. Bede stated that Wine purchased the see (diocese) of London from Wulfhere. Wine remained the Bishop of London until his death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%E2%80%A0","surface_form":"\u2020","offset":14},{"uri":"7th_century","surface_form":"7th century","offset":34},{"uri":"Ordained","surface_form":"ordained","offset":167},{"uri":"Gaul","surface_form":"Gaul","offset":179},{"uri":"Wessex","surface_form":"Wessex","offset":188},{"uri":"Cenwalh_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Cenwalh of Wessex","offset":200},{"uri":"Agilbert","surface_form":"Agilbert","offset":257},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":467},{"uri":"Consecrated","surface_form":"consecrated","offset":493},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":515},{"uri":"Winchester","surface_form":"Winchester","offset":525},{"uri":"Oswiu_of_Northumbria","surface_form":"Oswiu of Northumbria","offset":616},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":649},{"uri":"Northumbrians","surface_form":"Northumbrians","offset":685},{"uri":"Canterbury","surface_form":"Canterbury","offset":716},{"uri":"Bishop_of_York","surface_form":"Bishop of York","offset":745},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":782},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"Archbishop","offset":811},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"Church","offset":1013},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1023},{"uri":"Wulfhere_of_Mercia","surface_form":"Wulfhere of Mercia","offset":1099},{"uri":"Bede","surface_form":"Bede","offset":1119}]}
