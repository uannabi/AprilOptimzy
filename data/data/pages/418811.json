{"id":418811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service","text":"e=\"preserve\">A file hosting service is an Internet service that stores files for its users. It allows users to upload files that could then be accessed over the internet from a different computer, tablet, smart phone or other networked device, after a password is provided. The files can possibly also be accessed by other users, depending on the service or what the user prefers.\nA variation of this is one-click hosting, which allows users to easily upload one or more files from their hard drives (or from a remote location) on to the one-click host's server. Many web services provide free one-click hosting for image files. This gives the file an accessible URL that can be used to identify it on the internet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":42},{"uri":"Service","surface_form":"service","offset":51},{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"files","offset":71},{"uri":"Upload","surface_form":"upload","offset":111},{"uri":"Tablet_computer","surface_form":"tablet","offset":197},{"uri":"Smart_phone","surface_form":"smart phone","offset":205},{"uri":"Password","surface_form":"password","offset":252},{"uri":"Upload","surface_form":"upload","offset":452},{"uri":"Hard_drive","surface_form":"hard drive","offset":488},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":555},{"uri":"URL","surface_form":"URL","offset":663}]}
