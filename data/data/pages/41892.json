{"id":41892,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoult%27s_law","text":"=\"preserve\">Raoult's law states that the vapour pressure of a binary solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly related to the mole fraction of solvent (i.e. volatile) in the solution.\nAlso, it states that the vapour pressure of each component in a binary solution containing volatile components is directly related to its respective mole fraction in the solution.\nRelative going-down of vapour pressure is equal to mole fraction of non volatile and non-electrolytic solute. This is known as Raoult's law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":48},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":69},{"uri":"Volatile","surface_form":"volatile","offset":95},{"uri":"Mole_fraction","surface_form":"mole fraction","offset":138},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":155},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":228},{"uri":"Volatile","surface_form":"volatile","offset":287},{"uri":"Mole_fraction","surface_form":"mole fraction","offset":345}]}
