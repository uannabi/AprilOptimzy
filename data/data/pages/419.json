{"id":419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language","text":"e=\"preserve\">Language is the normal way humans communicate. Only humans use language, though other animals communicate through other means.\nHuman language has syntax, a set of rules for connecting words together to make statements and questions. Language can also be changed, by adding new words, for example, to describe new things. Other animals may inherit a set of calls which have pre-set functions.\nLanguage may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make signs. It follows that language is \"not\" just any way of communicating. Even some human communication is not language: see non-verbal communication. Humans also use language for thinking.\nUNESCO says that 2,500 languages are at risk of becoming extinct.\nUniversals of language.\nAll languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication.\nThere are many more things in common between languages.\nInheritance.\nThe capacity to learn and use language is inherited. Normally, all humans are born with this capability. \"Which\" language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the child's community. The \"capacity\" is inherited, but the particular language is learned.\nChildren have a special period, from about 18 months to about four years, which is critical for learning the language. If this is seriously disrupted, then their language skills will be damaged. Older people learn differently, so they seldom learn a second language as well as they learn their native language.\nTypes of language.\nMathematics and computer science use created languages called formal languages (like computer programming languages), but these may or may not be 'true' languages. Mathematics itself is seen as a language by many. Some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language.\nChinese is the language with the most native speakers in the world, but Chinese is not really a language. It is a close family of dialects, some of which are as different as Romance languages are from one another.\nEnglish is often called \"the international language\", or lingua franca. It is the main second language of the world and the international language of science, travel, technology, business, diplomacy, and entertainment. French had a similar status until the 20th century, and other languages had it at other times.\nSome languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them, without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place. These are called constructed languages. One of the most popular of these languages is Esperanto, which is sometimes called \"La Internacia Lingvo,\" or \"The International Language.\" Another of these languages is called Volap\u00FCk, which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now. It has mostly been replaced by languages like Esperanto, Interlingua, and Ido. Dialects are basically other versions of a language. For example Hoffish is a dialect of swedish.\nPart of the reason that Volap\u00FCk became unpopular is that some sounds are hard to say for people who speak Spanish or English, two of the most widely spoken languages in the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":40},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communicate","offset":47},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":65},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":159},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":176},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":197},{"uri":"Proposition","surface_form":"statements","offset":220},{"uri":"Question","surface_form":"question","offset":235},{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"speech","offset":429},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":442},{"uri":"Sign_language","surface_form":"signs","offset":481},{"uri":"Non-verbal_communication","surface_form":"non-verbal communication","offset":604},{"uri":"Thought","surface_form":"thinking","offset":659},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":669},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":726},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"inherited","offset":964},{"uri":"Second_language","surface_form":"second language","offset":1447},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"Mathematics","offset":1527},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":1543},{"uri":"Formal_language","surface_form":"formal language","offset":1589},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":1621},{"uri":"Musical_notation","surface_form":"musical notation","offset":1762},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":1824},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1954},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":1998},{"uri":"Lingua_franca","surface_form":"lingua franca","offset":2095},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":2188},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":2197},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":2205},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":2217},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomacy","offset":2227},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":2242},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":2257},{"uri":"Constructed_language","surface_form":"constructed language","offset":2524},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":2593},{"uri":"Volap%C3%BCk","surface_form":"Volap\u00FCk","offset":2724},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":2853},{"uri":"Interlingua","surface_form":"Interlingua","offset":2864},{"uri":"Ido","surface_form":"Ido","offset":2881},{"uri":"Volap%C3%BCk","surface_form":"Volap\u00FCk","offset":3008},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":3090}]}
