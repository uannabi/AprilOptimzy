{"id":41900,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdose","text":"An Overdose is when someone takes too much of a certain drug. This may be done voluntarily (as an attempt of suicide) or involuntarily. The drug may be a drug taken to treat some medical condition, or it may be a drug taken for recreation. Overdoses are considered to be poisoning, usually. They may lead to death, depending on the drug used.\nWhat to do with people who had an overdose.\nIf someone is thought to have had an overdose it is important to get them to a doctor, or hospital. It can be very hard to see what kind of drug was taken. Therefore, it can be hard for the doctor to find an antidote to give. For this reason, a packet (even if it is empty) of the drug should be taken.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":56},{"uri":"Attempt","surface_form":"attempt","offset":98},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":109},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":228},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":271},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":308},{"uri":"Antidote","surface_form":"antidote","offset":595}]}
