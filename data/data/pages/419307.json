{"id":419307,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenant_farming","text":"=\"preserve\">Tenant farming is when the person who works the farmland does not own the land themselves. The farmer pays rent to the landowner, either with cash or with a portion of the produce. When the rent is a share of the crop, it is sharecropping.\nMany freed slaves during the Reconstruction of the United States who owned no land became tenant farmers, renting land from a great landowner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sharecropping","surface_form":"sharecropping","offset":237},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":263},{"uri":"Reconstruction_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Reconstruction of the United States","offset":281},{"uri":"Renting","surface_form":"renting","offset":358}]}
