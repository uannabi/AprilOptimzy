{"id":41932,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal","text":"The alkaline earth metals are the second group of metals on the periodic table. They are related to the Alkali metals, but they do not react as much because they need more energy to remove their two electrons, So they do not have to be stored in petrol. As ions they have a charge of +2a. The alkaline earth metals are mostly silver colored, soft metals, which react readily with \"halogens\" and water to form salts, though not as rapidly as some of the alkali metals, to form\" alkaline hydroxides\". many \"prokatates and hantates\" can be found in the crust of these metals.\nThe alkaline earth metals are: beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Radium is very radioactive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":64},{"uri":"Alkali_metal","surface_form":"Alkali metal","offset":104},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":172},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":199},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":257},{"uri":"Charge","surface_form":"charge","offset":274},{"uri":"Beryllium","surface_form":"beryllium","offset":604},{"uri":"Magnesium","surface_form":"magnesium","offset":615},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":626},{"uri":"Strontium","surface_form":"strontium","offset":635},{"uri":"Barium","surface_form":"barium","offset":646},{"uri":"Radium","surface_form":"radium","offset":658},{"uri":"Radioactive","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":681}]}
