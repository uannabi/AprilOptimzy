{"id":419321,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceol_of_Wessex","text":"Ceol (also known as Ceola or Ceolric) was the King of the Gewisse, also called the King of Wessex. He ruled from 591 to 597. He was first an underking until 592 when he replaced his uncle Ceawlin of Wessex as king.\nKing in Wessex.\nCeol was the grandson of Cynric. He was also the brother of Ceolwulf. He was underking to his uncle Ceawlin, king of the Gewisse. In 592 Ceawlin was driven out of power. This was the result of losing in a battle at Woddesbeorg (or Wodnesbeorg). The chronicle says there was a great slaughter, presumably this was among the Gewisse (West Saxons). If the story in the chronicle is correct the older king Ceawlin was removed from his throne by his nephew, Ceol. In 593 Ceawlin, along with a Cwichelm and a Crida (both otherwise unknown) died. Ceol ruled until 577 when he was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not say when he died. But he either died in 577 or shortly afterwards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":46},{"uri":"Gewisse","surface_form":"Gewisse","offset":58},{"uri":"List_of_monarchs_of_Wessex","surface_form":"King of Wessex","offset":83},{"uri":"Underking","surface_form":"underking","offset":141},{"uri":"Ceawlin_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Ceawlin of Wessex","offset":188},{"uri":"Grandson","surface_form":"grandson","offset":244},{"uri":"Cynric_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Cynric","offset":256},{"uri":"Wessex","surface_form":"West Saxons","offset":563},{"uri":"Throne","surface_form":"throne","offset":662}]}
