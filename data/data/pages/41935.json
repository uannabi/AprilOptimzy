It uses the same tune (music) as the previous anthem when the country was part of the Soviet Union. That anthem's lyrics (words for music) were written by Micha\u015B Klimkovi\u010D and set to music by Nie\u015Bcier Saka\u0142owski, and it was originally adopted in 1955. After the Soviet Union was gone, new lyrics (words) written by Klimkovi\u0107 and U\u0142adzimir Karyzna were adopted in 2002.\nRussian translation.\nBecause Russian is a second state language of Belarus, a translation is provided below.
