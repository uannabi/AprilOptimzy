{"id":41947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life","text":"e=\"preserve\">Extraterrestrial life is life that is not from the planet Earth. It is alien life. It is reasonable that planets rather like ours exist, and that life might evolve there also. So far none has been found, though it is possible that life once existed on Mars.\nSearches have been made for signals from extraterrestrial life-forms. No signals have been received.\nIt is not a new idea. Quite a few philosophers have speculated on the existence of other planets like ours, with the idea that what happened here could also happen there. One thing we do know is that many other star systems do have exoplanets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":38},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":64},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":71},{"uri":"Planets","surface_form":"planets","offset":118},{"uri":"Evolve","surface_form":"evolve","offset":170},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":265},{"uri":"Signals","surface_form":"signals","offset":299},{"uri":"Star_system","surface_form":"star system","offset":583},{"uri":"Exoplanets","surface_form":"exoplanets","offset":604}]}
