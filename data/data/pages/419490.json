{"id":419490,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9cy-en-Ponthieu","text":"Cr\u00E9cy-en-Ponthieu is a commune in the Somme department in Picardie in northern France, located south of Calais. It gives its name to Cr\u00E9cy Forest, which starts about two kilometres to the south-west of the town and which is one of the largest forests in the north of France. A very small river, the Maye, runs through the town.\nHistory.\nCr\u00E9cy-en-Ponthieu is best known as the site of the Battle of Cr\u00E9cy in 1346, one of the earliest and most important battles of the Hundred Years' War.\nYet there are other significant historical links. One is the Chausee Brunehaut which passed within two miles of the town and is the Roman road from Paris and Amiens to Boulogne, and is still visible and walkable today.\nAnd just to the north of the town, slightly to the west of where the Battle was fought, there was an airfield used in the Second World War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":23},{"uri":"Somme","surface_form":"Somme","offset":38},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":44},{"uri":"Picardie","surface_form":"Picardie","offset":58},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":79},{"uri":"Calais","surface_form":"Calais","offset":104},{"uri":"Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy","surface_form":"Battle of Cr\u00E9cy","offset":388},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":467},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":828}]}
