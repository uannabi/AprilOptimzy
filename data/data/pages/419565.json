{"id":419565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_show","text":"=\"preserve\">A cooking show (also called a cookery programme) is a television program where one or more hosts show people how to cook food dishes in a kitchen studio set. The show's host, often a celebrity chef, will make one or more food dishes in an episode. They will show the inspiration for the dish, how to make it, and the stages of cooking. These types of shows are often meant to be educational, although some shows are competitions that are meant to entertain the viewer.\nThe cable television network Food Network airs these types of shows.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television_program","surface_form":"television program","offset":66},{"uri":"Kitchen","surface_form":"kitchen","offset":150},{"uri":"Celebrity_chef","surface_form":"celebrity chef","offset":195},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":391},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competition","offset":428},{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable television","offset":485},{"uri":"Food_Network","surface_form":"Food Network","offset":510}]}
