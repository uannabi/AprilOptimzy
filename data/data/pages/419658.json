Computer animation was produced at Imagi Animation Studios in Hong Kong.\nThe series employed a small group of seasoned directors, which included Mark Risley, Bret Haaland, Steve Hickner, John Holmquist, John Stevenson, and Mark Baldo. Felix Ip served as creative director for Imagi. For the first season, DreamWorks created 30 principal sets, 500 special props, and about 100 characters. In fact, a typical episode unfolds across all 30 principal sets and features two or three unique locations as well. The lion habitat is inspired by the real Secret Garden in Las Vegas, where the actual Siegfried & Roy lions reside. In \"Father of the Pride\", the Secret Garden encompasses residences for the main characters and their families and public areas ranging from the community bar to a school classroom.\nSince Larry and his family drive the story lines for most of the episodes, their residence is the most detailed, comprising separate, contiguous sets for the living room, the kitchen, and the children's bedrooms. Meanwhile, the assets are stored in individual files in order to be loaded into separate layers and assembled modularly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":28},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"animated","offset":37},{"uri":"Siegfried_%26amp%3B_Roy","surface_form":"Siegfried & Roy","offset":88},{"uri":"Imagi_Animation_Studios","surface_form":"Imagi Animation Studios","offset":150},{"uri":"White_lion","surface_form":"white lion","offset":351},{"uri":"The_Lord_of_the_Rings","surface_form":"Lord of the Rings","offset":665},{"uri":"Las_Vegas_Valley","surface_form":"Las Vegas","offset":1230},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":1241},{"uri":"Imagi_Animation_Studios","surface_form":"Imagi Animation Studios","offset":1368},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":1395},{"uri":"Mark_Risley","surface_form":"Mark Risley","offset":1478},{"uri":"Bret_Haaland","surface_form":"Bret Haaland","offset":1491},{"uri":"Steve_Hickner","surface_form":"Steve Hickner","offset":1505},{"uri":"John_Holmquist","surface_form":"John Holmquist","offset":1520},{"uri":"John_Stevenson_(director)","surface_form":"John Stevenson","offset":1536},{"uri":"Mark_Baldo","surface_form":"Mark Baldo","offset":1556},{"uri":"Felix_Ip","surface_form":"Felix Ip","offset":1568},{"uri":"DreamWorks_Animation","surface_form":"DreamWorks","offset":1638},{"uri":"Las_Vegas_Valley","surface_form":"Las Vegas","offset":1895},{"uri":"Siegfried_%26amp%3B_Roy","surface_form":"Siegfried & Roy","offset":1923}]}
