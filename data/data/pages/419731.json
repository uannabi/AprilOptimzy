However, Grams faced opposition for the Republican party endorsement from State Senator Gen Olson, Bert McKasy (former chief of staff to David Durenberger), and Doug McFarland.\nIn the general election against Democratic Farm Labor candidate Ann Wynia and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley, Grams won a close election to become Minnesota's next US Senator.\nGrams ran for re-election in 2000 as the incumbent, losing to Mark Dayton. During the campaign, Grams' wife Christine Gunhus was revealed to have written anonymous disparaging emails about Grams' potential Democratic rival, Mike Ciresi, from her home computer. She received a fine and suspended sentence for violating political advertising regulations.\nPersonal life.\nGrams was married to Christine Gunhus until his death in 2013. On September 4, 2013 it was announced that Grams had been battling cancer since 2012 and had entered hospice care.\nDeath.\nGrams died of colon cancer on October 8, 2013 at his home in Crown, Minnesota.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":85},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":135},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":158},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"U.S. Senate","offset":205},{"uri":"Princeton%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Princeton, Minnesota","offset":336},{"uri":"Brown_Institute","surface_form":"Brown Institute","offset":370},{"uri":"Anoka-Ramsey_Community_College","surface_form":"Anoka-Ramsey Community College","offset":395},{"uri":"Carroll_University","surface_form":"Carroll College","offset":439},{"uri":"David_Durenberger","surface_form":"David Durenberger","offset":478},{"uri":"Republican_Party_of_Minnesota","surface_form":"Republican party","offset":708},{"uri":"Gen_Olson","surface_form":"Gen Olson","offset":756},{"uri":"Doug_McFarland","surface_form":"Doug McFarland","offset":829},{"uri":"United_States_Senate_election_in_Minnesota%2C_1994","surface_form":"the general election against","offset":848},{"uri":"Democratic_Farm_Labor","surface_form":"Democratic Farm Labor","offset":877},{"uri":"Ann_Wynia","surface_form":"Ann Wynia","offset":909},{"uri":"Independence_Party_of_Minnesota","surface_form":"Independence Party","offset":923},{"uri":"Dean_Barkley","surface_form":"Dean Barkley","offset":952},{"uri":"Mark_Dayton","surface_form":"Mark Dayton","offset":1094},{"uri":"Mike_Ciresi","surface_form":"Mike Ciresi","offset":1256},{"uri":"Hospice","surface_form":"hospice","offset":1564},{"uri":"Colon_cancer","surface_form":"colon cancer","offset":1599},{"uri":"Crown%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Crown, Minnesota","offset":1646}]}
