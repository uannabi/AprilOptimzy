The peninsula separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov. Crimea has a surface of. About 2.4 million people live there.\nThe Ottoman Empire had the peninsula for a long time. In the 18th century the Russian Empire took control. The Crimean War was fought here.\nCrimea was part of Russia until the Soviet Union gave it to Ukraine in 1954. Ukraine gave it a limited self-rule as an \"autonomous republic\". The seat of the government is Simferopol, which is also the biggest city. Other major cities are Sevastopol and Kerch.\nThe Crimean crisis.\nIn March, 2014, after a series of protests in Ukraine the previous month, Russian troops took control of Crimea. A referendum was held, in which over 95% of voters voted to join the Russian Federation. The Crimean parliament quickly proclaimed independence from Ukraine and on March 18, became the Republic of Crimea, a federal subject of Russia.\nHowever, Ukraine and most other countries in the world continue to recognize that Crimea is part of Ukraine. On March 24, Russia was kicked out of the G8 (which became the G7), and on March 27, the United Nations General Assembly passed 262, which says that the referendum was invalid and Crimea belongs to Ukraine. In later months, many countries including the United States and the European Union started economic sanctions to prevent Russians and their goods from entering their countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":54},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":71},{"uri":"Sea_of_Azov","surface_form":"Sea of Azov","offset":129},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":208},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":282},{"uri":"Crimean_War","surface_form":"Crimean War","offset":315},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":380},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":404},{"uri":"Autonomous_republic","surface_form":"autonomous republic","offset":464},{"uri":"Simferopol","surface_form":"Simferopol","offset":516},{"uri":"Sevastopol","surface_form":"Sevastopol","offset":583},{"uri":"Kerch","surface_form":"Kerch","offset":598},{"uri":"Euromaidan","surface_form":"a series of protests","offset":647},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":740},{"uri":"Russian_Federation","surface_form":"Russian Federation","offset":807},{"uri":"Republic_of_Crimea","surface_form":"Republic of Crimea","offset":923},{"uri":"Federal_subjects_of_Russia","surface_form":"federal subject","offset":945},{"uri":"G8","surface_form":"G8","offset":1123},{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"United Nations General Assembly","offset":1170},{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_68/262","surface_form":"262","offset":1209},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1334},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":1356}]}
