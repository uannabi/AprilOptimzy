{"id":420045,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redback_spider","text":"The redback spider is a venomous spider that lives in Australia. The female is larger than the male. The female's body is about 1\u00A0centimetre long and the male's body is about 3\u00A0millimetres long. The adult female spider is usually black and usually has a red stripe on its back. The female likes to live in warm sheltered places and makes a web to catch insects and other small creatures.\nThe spider's bite can be very painful and dangerous to people, because it can inject a venom through its fangs. An antivenom injection is available, which can help to restore the health of people who have become very ill after being bitten by the spider.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venomous","offset":24},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":33},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":54},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":353},{"uri":"Fang","surface_form":"fang","offset":493},{"uri":"Antivenom","surface_form":"antivenom","offset":503}]}
