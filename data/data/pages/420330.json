{"id":420330,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row_(series)","text":"=\"preserve\">Saints Row is a series of video games created by Volition game studios. It features mechanics similar to the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. Starting from \"Saints Row: The Third\", Volition decided to experiment with dark humour and unrealistic gameplay, ranging from impossible air stunts to the inclusion of a dildo bat as a weapon. Afterwards, Volition decided to completely abandon realistic game physics and graphics.\n\"Saints Row IV\" was released in 2013 and modified the gameplay, allowing the player to fly and use superpowers, rendering the use of motor vehicles impractical.\n\"Saints Row Gat out of Hell\" was released in 2015 and was set in Hell with the use of superpowers again.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":38},{"uri":"Volition","surface_form":"Volition","offset":61},{"uri":"Grand_Theft_Auto","surface_form":"Grand Theft Auto","offset":122},{"uri":"Stunt","surface_form":"stunts","offset":289},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":655}]}
