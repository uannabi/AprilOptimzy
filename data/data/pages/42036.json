{"id":42036,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac","text":"Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, OM (August 8, 1902 in Bristol \u2013 October 20, 1984 in Tallahassee) was an English physicist.\nDirac's father came from the French-speaking part of Switzerland.\nDirac worked out a formulation of quantum mechanics, which includes Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger's wave mechanics and Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics in 1926. In 1928 he found the Dirac equation and he found out that spin in quantum mechanics is an effect of relativity. The Dirac equation allowed Dirac to predict the existence of antimatter, which is the opposite of matter.\nIn 1933 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics.\nDirac was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics chair at Cambridge University from 1932 until his retirement in 1969. He was Professor of Physics at Florida State University from 1972 until his death in 1984.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"OM","offset":27},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":49},{"uri":"Tallahassee","surface_form":"Tallahassee","offset":79},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":99},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":107},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":218},{"uri":"Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger","surface_form":"Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger","offset":252},{"uri":"Werner_Heisenberg","surface_form":"Werner Heisenberg","offset":291},{"uri":"Dirac_equation","surface_form":"Dirac equation","offset":358},{"uri":"Spin_(physics)","surface_form":"spin","offset":395},{"uri":"Theory_of_relativity","surface_form":"relativity","offset":437},{"uri":"Antimatter","surface_form":"antimatter","offset":510},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":547},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":574},{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge University","offset":655},{"uri":"Florida_State_University","surface_form":"Florida State University","offset":747}]}
