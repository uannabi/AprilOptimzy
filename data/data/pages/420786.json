{"id":420786,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox_2","text":"\"Star Fox 2\" is a cancelled video game that was going to be released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was going to be the second game in the \"Star Fox\" series and the sequel to \"Star Fox\". It was going to be released in the summer of 1995. The game was cancelled because the Nintendo 64 was going to be released the following year.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of \"Star Fox\" is very different from the first \"Star Fox\" game. Instead of going on a path with the same missions each time, the player moves freely on a map screen of the Lylat system. When the player's ships hit an enemy, the screen switches to an action screen with gameplay like the first \"Star Fox\" game. Once the player completes what they have to do, they are taken back to the map screen to go to another area.\nThe player's goal is to destroy all of the enemies on the map while defending Corneria (seen in the lower left corner of the map). The player has to stop Corneria's damage level from reaching 100% from enemy attacks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":28},{"uri":"Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","offset":77},{"uri":"Star_Fox_(series)","surface_form":"Star Fox","offset":164},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":189},{"uri":"Star_Fox_(video_game)","surface_form":"Star Fox","offset":200},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":297}]}
