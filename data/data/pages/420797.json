In the map mode, the player takes control of several ships. The player can control up to four ships at a time. The player's goal is to stop enemy ships from reaching the \"Great Fox\". When the player meets an enemy or missile, the gameplay switches to the battle mode.\nBattle mode has gameplay that is similar to past \"Star Fox\" games. The player can move freely around the level, like some bosses and levels in \"Star Fox 64\". The player has to destroy a base ship, defeat all of the enemies, or collect a number of cores. Once the player completes what they have to do, the game goes back to the map screen. As the player plays further in the game, they will be able to take different routes when they complete some levels. Each route has different planets that the player can visit depending on what route they choose.\nMultiplayer.\nMultiplayer can be played with up to six players in DS Download Play, and with up to three players in Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection play. The goal is to destroy the ships of the other players and collect stars that they leave behind. Players can collect stars from opponents that were not killed by the player. Nintendo Wi-Fi play ranks a player from Z to A, with Z being the lowest and A being the highest. Every time a player wins a match, they get an amount of percent. When the player reaches 100%, they move to the next letter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":24},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":43},{"uri":"Star_Fox_(series)","surface_form":"\"Star Fox\" series","offset":97},{"uri":"Q-Games","surface_form":"Q-Games","offset":136},{"uri":"Nintendo_EAD","surface_form":"Nintendo EAD Group No. 2","offset":161},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":206},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":234},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":262},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":303},{"uri":"Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection","surface_form":"Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection","offset":483},{"uri":"Star_Fox_64","surface_form":"Star Fox 64","offset":1004}]}
