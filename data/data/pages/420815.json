He only appeared in three minutes of one NHL game with the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1993\u201394 NHL season. During that time, he did not face a shot and in doing this he was rendered as the NHL's comparable version to Major League Baseball's legendary Moonlight Graham. He played most of his 10-year career in various minor leagues, which includes the International Hockey League, American Hockey League, East Coast Hockey League, and Central Hockey League as well as others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_14","surface_form":"September 14","offset":22},{"uri":"1970","surface_form":"1970","offset":36},{"uri":"Gatineau","surface_form":"Gatineau","offset":44},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":54},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":67},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":84},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"goaltender","offset":95},{"uri":"University_of_Vermont","surface_form":"University of Vermont","offset":169},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":369},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":525},{"uri":"Moonlight_Graham","surface_form":"Moonlight Graham","offset":559},{"uri":"International_Hockey_League","surface_form":"International Hockey League","offset":659},{"uri":"American_Hockey_League","surface_form":"American Hockey League","offset":688},{"uri":"East_Coast_Hockey_League","surface_form":"East Coast Hockey League","offset":712},{"uri":"Central_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Central Hockey League","offset":742}]}
