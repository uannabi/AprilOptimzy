He wears only cowboy boots, a hat, and underwear, playing a guitar over his underwear to look like he is nude. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nBurck began performing in 1997 in Venice Beach, Los Angeles. He became popular when a friend suggested that he dress only in his underwear to earn more money. He is currently best-known for performing in Times Square. Tour guides on passing buses point him out, and he gets a lot of attention from tourists who stop and take pictures with him.\nBecause of his popularity, Burck has appeared on television shows, in music videos, and other mass media.
