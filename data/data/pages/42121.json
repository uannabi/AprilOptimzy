It is the official residence where the British monarch lives and works. The palace is a setting for state occasions and royal hospitality, and has been a focus for the British people at times of national rejoicing and crisis.\nBuckingham Palace was built in 1703 by John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normandy, as a townhouse (a residence in London). It was bought by the British royal family in 1761. It became the official London home of the family in 1837 and was greatly expanded in the 19th century. It has 775 rooms, 19 staterooms, and 78 bathrooms. Leading up to it is a ceremonial road called The Mall.
