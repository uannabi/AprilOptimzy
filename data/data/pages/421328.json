{"id":421328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturopathy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine. It is based on the belief that a special energy called \"vital energy\" guides bodily functions such as metabolism, reproduction and growth. Naturopaths mostly use holistic forms of treatment. They generally avoid the use of surgery and drugs. Many naturopaths reject modern science.\nNaturopathy is not supported by science. The medical community does not believe that it works.\nThe term \"naturopathy\" comes from Greek and Latin. It means \"nature disease\". Modern naturopathy developed from the Natural Cure movement in Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alternative_medicine","surface_form":"alternative medicine","offset":38},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":101},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":162},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"reproduction","offset":174},{"uri":"Growth","surface_form":"growth","offset":191},{"uri":"Holism","surface_form":"holistic","offset":222},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":283},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"drugs","offset":295}]}
