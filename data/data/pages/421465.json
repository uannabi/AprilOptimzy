{"id":421465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_I_de_Montgomery","text":"Roger I de Montgomery, was the seigneur (lord) of Montgomery and vicomte of the Hiesmois in Normandy.\nCareer.\nRoger was the son of Hugh de Montgomery and his wife Josceline. She was the niece of Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy. Roger held the lands of Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery and Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery. Both had traces of early castles. He became the Viscount of the Heismois about the same time Robert I of Normandy became Duke in 1027. But as the viscount he witnessed a royal charter to the abbey of St. Wandrille. Like Duke Robert, Roger began taking properties that belonged to the church. These included () half the town of Bernay. He took over a woodland at 'Crispus Fagidus' which belonged to Jumi\u00E8ges Abbey. He put an end to a market held by the same abbey and took it into his own domain. Later he seemed to have a change of heart. He returned the market to the abbey and paid restitution for their losses.\nAfter 1035 Roger seems to have lost favor with the young duke William. He signed an early charter of Duke William simply as 'Roger of Montgomery'. He apparently was no longer the viscount. In 1037 when rebellions broke out, Roger was one of the rebels. When he was defeated he fled to the court of Henry I of France. Roger was forced into exile by Osbern the Steward. Osbern was later killed by William de Montgomery, Roger's son. Where and when Roger died is unknown. In 1068 his wife was still holding lands at Bures and Saint-Pair.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seigneur","surface_form":"seigneur","offset":31},{"uri":"Viscount","surface_form":"vicomte","offset":65},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":92},{"uri":"Gunnora","surface_form":"Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy","offset":195},{"uri":"Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery","surface_form":"Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery","offset":249},{"uri":"Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery","surface_form":"Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery","offset":282},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":334},{"uri":"Robert_I_of_Normandy","surface_form":"Robert I of Normandy","offset":402},{"uri":"Royal_charter","surface_form":"royal charter","offset":479},{"uri":"Bernay%2C_Eure","surface_form":"Bernay","offset":636},{"uri":"Jumi%C3%A8ges_Abbey","surface_form":"Jumi\u00E8ges Abbey","offset":707},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":742},{"uri":"William_the_Conqueror","surface_form":"William","offset":985},{"uri":"Rebellions","surface_form":"rebellions","offset":1125},{"uri":"Henry_I_of_France","surface_form":"Henry I of France","offset":1221},{"uri":"Bures%2C_Orne","surface_form":"Bures","offset":1436},{"uri":"Saint-Pair","surface_form":"Saint-Pair","offset":1446}]}
