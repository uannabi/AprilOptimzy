{"id":42170,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz","text":"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (also \"Leibnitz\" or \"von Leibniz\") 1 July 1 (21 June OS) 1646 \u2013 14 November 1716) was a German intellectual who wrote mostly in French and Latin.\nHe played an important role in both philosophy and mathematics. He invented calculus independently of Newton, and his notation for derivatives is the one in general use since then. He also invented the binary system, foundation of modern computers.\nHe was taught law and philosophy. He served as secretary to two major German noble houses: one became the British royal family while he served it. Leibniz played a major role in the European politics and diplomacy of his day.\nIn philosophy, he is most remembered for optimism. He thought our universe is the best possible one God could have made. He was one of the great 17th century rationalists. Ren\u00E9 Descartes and Baruch Spinoza are the other two. His philosophy also both looks back to the Scholastic tradition and anticipates modern logic and analysis.\nLeibniz also made contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated ideas which surfaced much later in biology, medicine, geology, probability theory, psychology, and information science. He wrote on politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and philology. Sometimes, he even wrote in verse. His contributions are scattered in journals and in tens of thousands of letters and unpublished manuscripts. There is no complete edition of Leibniz's writings, and a complete account of his accomplishments is not yet possible. Leibniz is sometimes known as the last \"universal genius\".\nLeibniz is perhaps most famous for his involvement in development of calculus independent of Isaac Newton and creation of Leibniz Notation which is the standard form of calculus today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_calendar","surface_form":"OS","offset":79},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":114},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectual","offset":121},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":154},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":165},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":208},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":223},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":248},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Newton","offset":274},{"uri":"Notation","surface_form":"notation","offset":290},{"uri":"Binary_numeral_system","surface_form":"binary system","offset":374},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":410},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":435},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":443},{"uri":"Secretary","surface_form":"secretary","offset":468},{"uri":"House_of_Hanover","surface_form":"British royal family","offset":527},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":612},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomacy","offset":625},{"uri":"Optimism","surface_form":"optimism","offset":688},{"uri":"Rationalism","surface_form":"rationalists","offset":805},{"uri":"Ren%C3%A9_Descartes","surface_form":"Ren\u00E9 Descartes","offset":819},{"uri":"Baruch_Spinoza","surface_form":"Baruch Spinoza","offset":838},{"uri":"Scholasticism","surface_form":"Scholastic","offset":915},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":959},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":969},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":1014},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":1026},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":1089},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":1098},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":1108},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":1117},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":1137},{"uri":"Information_science","surface_form":"information science","offset":1153},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":1186},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1196},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":1201},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":1209},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":1219},{"uri":"Philology","surface_form":"philology","offset":1232},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":1634},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":1658}]}
