It was released one year after \"Pac-Man\", on January 13, 1982. It became one of the most popular video games of all-time after its release. This led Namco to make the game an official title in the \"Pac-Man\" series. It has a female character, new mazes, and changes in gameplay from \"Pac-Man\". It is most successful American-made arcade game, selling 115,000 arcade cabinets.\nGameplay.\n\"Ms. Pac-Man\" plays similarly to \"Pac-Man\". The player has to move Ms. Pac-Man, a yellow disc, around a maze. The goal is to eat all of the yellow pellets (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts. The player can get more points by eating fruits that appear. When Ms. Pac-Man eats a white pellet, the ghosts turn blue. The player can eat them for points. The game has 256 stages. Like \"Pac-Man\", the 256th level cannot be finished because of a problem with the creation of the game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["VG"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arcade_game","surface_form":"arcade","offset":20},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":27},{"uri":"Pac-Man","surface_form":"Pac-Man","offset":119},{"uri":"Maze","surface_form":"maze","offset":333},{"uri":"Disc","surface_form":"disc","offset":561},{"uri":"Pellet","surface_form":"pellet","offset":619},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":628},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":669},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":718}]}
