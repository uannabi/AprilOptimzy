{"id":421773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Presbyterian_Church_(Trenton%2C_New_Jersey)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The First Presbyterian Church is a historic church in Trenton, New Jersey, United States. It is located at 120 East State Street. The church building was built in 1726. During the American Revolutionary War the British occupied Trenton. They used the church as a stable to keep their horses. It was repaired when they left. In 1804 the old stone church was taken down. A new church of all brick was completed in 1805. The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nThe church graveyard is the burial place of at least two Revolutionary War notables. Colonel Johann Rall, Commander of the Hessians forces defeated by General George Washington. He died just after the Battle of Trenton. John Rosbrugh, was killed at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek (Second Battle of Trenton). He was the first U.S. chaplain killed in battle. The inventor of the steamboat, John Fitch, was a member of the congregation at First Presbyterian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trenton%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Trenton","offset":67},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":76},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":193},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British","offset":224},{"uri":"Occupied","surface_form":"occupied","offset":232},{"uri":"Stable","surface_form":"stable","offset":276},{"uri":"Hessian_(soldier)","surface_form":"Hessians","offset":637},{"uri":"Battle_of_Trenton","surface_form":"Battle of Trenton","offset":715},{"uri":"John_Rosbrugh","surface_form":"John Rosbrugh","offset":734},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Assunpink_Creek","surface_form":"Battle of the Assunpink Creek","offset":767},{"uri":"Chaplain","surface_form":"chaplain","offset":847},{"uri":"Steamboat","surface_form":"steamboat","offset":894},{"uri":"John_Fitch","surface_form":"John Fitch","offset":905},{"uri":"Congregation","surface_form":"congregation","offset":937}]}
