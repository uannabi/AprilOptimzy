It lives in deep waters off the coasts of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.\nBlobfish are typically shorter than 30\u00A0cm. They live at depths between where the pressure is several dozen times higher than at sea level.\nBlobfish are often caught accidentally in bottom trawling nets. Scientists now fear the blobfish could become an endangered species because of deep-ocean trawling.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":68},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":129},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":140},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":153},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":294},{"uri":"Bottom_trawling","surface_form":"bottom trawling","offset":347},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered species","offset":418}]}
