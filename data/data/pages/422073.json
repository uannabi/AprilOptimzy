{"id":422073,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation","text":"Female genital mutilation (FGM) is cutting off part or all of the female genitals that are outside of the body. FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision. It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual, not for medical reasons.\nFGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan. However, it also happens in other countries in Asia, the Middle East and around the world. Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital. It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia.\nDifferent ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages. Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old. Others do it when girls reach puberty, or are older. In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old.\nFGM can cause serious health problems, like infections, chronic pain, trouble getting pregnant and giving birth, bleeding so bad that it can kill. FGM does not make a person's health better in any way.\nFGM is illegal in most of the countries where it happens. However, these laws are often ignored. Since the 1970s, many countries have tried to stop FGM. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly said that FGM is a human rights problem, and voted to try harder to stop it. The World Health Organization and the \"Maputo Protocol\" to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights also say that FGM must be stopped.\nTypes of female genital mutilation.\nThere are many different types of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created four basic categories of FGM, called Types 1-IV.\nType I.\nIn Type I FGM, part or all of the clitoris is cut off. The clitoris is the female organ that makes sex feel good for women. Without it, a woman usually cannot have an orgasm.\nType III.\nWhen the labia are sewn shut, one small hole is left open so the girl can urinate and menstruate. The hole is kept open by putting something like a twig into the wound. To help the wound close, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle, for up to six weeks.\nAfter the woman gets married, her vagina is cut open so she can have sex. A midwife might cut open the vagina with a knife, or the woman's husband might tear it open with his penis. If the woman gets pregnant, the vagina is opened more for childbirth, and then often sewn back up afterward (this is called re-infibulation).\nType IV.\nType IV FGM is anything else that is done to hurt the genitals, like scraping, burning, scarring, or cutting the genitals without cutting them off.\nPrevalence.\nIn many countries where FGM is common, almost every woman and girl in the country has had FGM. In other countries, millions of women and girls have had FGM over many years.\nComplications.\nFGM can hurt women's physical and mental health throughout their lives.\nShort-term complications.\nNobody knows how many girls and women die from FGM.\nLate complications.\nPainful periods are common because it is very difficult for the monthly menstrual blood to get out of the tiny hole left by infibulation. Blood can fill the vagina and uterus, and stay there without moving. If the vagina gets completely blocked, the vagina and uterus can fill up completely with menstrual blood. Because women with this problem do not menstruate, and blood builds up in their abdomen (making it swell), it can be confused with pregnancy.\nEffects on mental health & sexual function.\nThere is not much information about the effects of FGM on women's and girls' mental health. However, a few small studies have found that women with FGM often have anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":66},{"uri":"Genitals","surface_form":"genitals","offset":73},{"uri":"Circumcision","surface_form":"circumcision","offset":165},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":228},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":286},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":316},{"uri":"Kurdistan","surface_form":"Kurdistan","offset":332},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":390},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":400},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":464},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":479},{"uri":"Razor","surface_form":"razor","offset":513},{"uri":"Anesthesia","surface_form":"anesthesia","offset":575},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":597},{"uri":"Infant","surface_form":"infant","offset":698},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":761},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":927},{"uri":"Chronic","surface_form":"chronic","offset":939},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":947},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":969},{"uri":"Childbirth","surface_form":"giving birth","offset":982},{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":996},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":1092},{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"United Nations General Assembly","offset":1251},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":1302},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":1328},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":1364},{"uri":"African_Charter_on_Human_and_Peoples%27_Rights","surface_form":"African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights","offset":1423},{"uri":"Category","surface_form":"categories","offset":1659},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoris","offset":1739},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organ","offset":1787},{"uri":"Orgasm","surface_form":"orgasm","offset":1872},{"uri":"Urination","surface_form":"urinate","offset":1964},{"uri":"Menstruation","surface_form":"menstruate","offset":1976},{"uri":"Hip","surface_form":"hip","offset":2130},{"uri":"Ankle","surface_form":"ankle","offset":2137},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":2186},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":2234},{"uri":"Midwife","surface_form":"midwife","offset":2241},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":2340},{"uri":"Mental_health","surface_form":"mental health","offset":2880},{"uri":"Dysmenorrhea","surface_form":"Painful periods","offset":3016},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":3678},{"uri":"Depression_(mental_illness)","surface_form":"depression","offset":3687},{"uri":"Post-traumatic_stress_disorder","surface_form":"post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","offset":3703}]}
