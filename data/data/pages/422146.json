{"id":422146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Ritz","text":"C\u00E9sar Ritz (23 February 1850 \u2013 24 October 1918) was a Swiss hotelier and founder of several hotels. He gave his name to the H\u00F4tel Ritz Paris and The Ritz Hotel in London. His motto was \"king of hoteliers, and hotelier to kings\". His name is the origin of the word \"ritzy\".\nBiography.\nAt fifteen Ritz was apprenticed as a \"somelier\" (wine waiter) at a hotel in Brig. Dismissed after a year as an unsuitable candidate for the hotel trade, he went to Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition.\nRitz's formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a \"ma\u00EEtre d'h\u00F4tel\", manager, and eventually hotelier.\nIn 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the H\u00F4tel Splendide in Paris, meeting many rich, self-made Americans as guests. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition. In the winter of that year his astonishing career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand H\u00F4tel in Nice. Regular moves then followed. He followed the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer.\nIn 1878, he became the manager of the Grand H\u00F4tel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand H\u00F4tel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development of luxury hoteliering, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and got a reputation for good taste and elegance. He was the first to say that \"the customer is never wrong\". His code was \"See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked\".\nIn 1888, he opened a restaurant with Auguste Escoffier in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as \"a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London\". The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now \"seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms\".\nIndependent entrepreneur.\nLater in 1898, he opened the celebrated H\u00F4tel Ritz in the Place Vend\u00F4me, Paris. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1906, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era, for the rich and famous. The Hotel Ritz Madrid in Madrid, opened in 1910, inspired by King Alfonso XIII's desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health.\nTowards the end.\nRitz himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling out his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911.\nBy 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913 he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake K\u00FCssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at K\u00FCssnacht on 26 October 1918. Although from a humble Swiss background, C\u00E9sar Ritz and his luxurious hotels became legendary, and his name entered the English language as an epitome of high-class cuisine and accommodation. He is buried in the village of his birth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":54},{"uri":"H%C3%B4tel_Ritz_Paris","surface_form":"H\u00F4tel Ritz Paris","offset":124},{"uri":"The_Ritz_London_Hotel","surface_form":"The Ritz Hotel","offset":145},{"uri":"Motto","surface_form":"motto","offset":175},{"uri":"Somelier","surface_form":"somelier","offset":322},{"uri":"Brig%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Brig","offset":360},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":577},{"uri":"Waiter","surface_form":"waiter","offset":782},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":899},{"uri":"Grand_H%C3%B4tel","surface_form":"Grand H\u00F4tel","offset":1084},{"uri":"Nice","surface_form":"Nice","offset":1099},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":1181},{"uri":"San_Remo","surface_form":"San Remo","offset":1220},{"uri":"Lucerne","surface_form":"Lucerne","offset":1287},{"uri":"Grand_H%C3%B4tel_National","surface_form":"Grand H\u00F4tel National","offset":1344},{"uri":"Lucerne","surface_form":"Lucerne","offset":1368},{"uri":"Monaco","surface_form":"Monaco","offset":1439},{"uri":"Auguste_Escoffier","surface_form":"Auguste Escoffier","offset":1945},{"uri":"Baden-Baden","surface_form":"Baden-Baden","offset":1966},{"uri":"Richard_D%27Oyly_Carte","surface_form":"Richard D'Oyly Carte","offset":2022},{"uri":"Chef","surface_form":"chef","offset":2075},{"uri":"Savoy_Hotel","surface_form":"Savoy Hotel","offset":2087},{"uri":"Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prince of Wales","offset":2349},{"uri":"H%C3%B4tel_Ritz_Paris","surface_form":"H\u00F4tel Ritz","offset":2563},{"uri":"Place_Vend%C3%B4me","surface_form":"Place Vend\u00F4me","offset":2581},{"uri":"The_Ritz_London_Hotel","surface_form":"The Ritz Hotel","offset":2622},{"uri":"Hotel_Ritz_Madrid","surface_form":"Hotel Ritz Madrid","offset":2749},{"uri":"Alfonso_XIII","surface_form":"Alfonso XIII","offset":2811},{"uri":"Auguste_Escoffier","surface_form":"Auguste Escoffier","offset":2922},{"uri":"Frankfurt","surface_form":"Frankfurt","offset":3225},{"uri":"Salsomaggiore","surface_form":"Salsomaggiore","offset":3239},{"uri":"Carlton_Hotel","surface_form":"Carlton Hotel","offset":3332},{"uri":"Lausanne%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Lausanne","offset":3543},{"uri":"K%C3%BCssnacht","surface_form":"K\u00FCssnacht","offset":3647}]}
