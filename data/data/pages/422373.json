{"id":422373,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh","text":"Marrakesh, or Marrakech (Berber:;) is an important city in the African country of Morocco. It is the fourth largest city in the country. Marrakesh is the capital of the economic region of Marrakesh-Tensift-El Haouz.\nMarrakesh is the most important city out of all of Morocco's cities that used to be imperial cities. Berber farmers lived in Marrakesh during Neolithic times. Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the chieftain and cousin of the king of the Almoravids Yusuf ibn Tashfin, founded Marrakesh in the year 1062. The Almoravids built many schools and mosques in Marrakesh. Marrakesh has the name \"Red City\" because a lot of it is made out of red sandstone.\nMarrakesh got bigger very quickly and became a cultural, religious, and trading center for sub-Saharan Africa. The mayor of Marrakesh Fatima Zahra Mansouri is the second woman mayor in Morocco.\nTourism is important to Marrakesh, and the city has about 400 hotels, some very grand indeed.\nOne of the things that most attract travelers to Morocco and, specifically, to the city of Marrakech, is the endless activities available and especially its variety. The most interesting and well-known are desert excursions from Marrakech, but in reality, you have many options: we are talking about excursions to the beach. There in the city itself, you do not have them, but there are many beaches near Marrakech that you can visit without much complication.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Berber","offset":25},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":51},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"African","offset":63},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":71},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":82},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":154},{"uri":"Economic_region","surface_form":"economic region","offset":169},{"uri":"Berber","surface_form":"Berber","offset":317},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":324},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":358},{"uri":"Abu_Bakr_ibn_Umar","surface_form":"Abu Bakr ibn Umar","offset":375},{"uri":"Chieftain","surface_form":"chieftain","offset":398},{"uri":"Cousin","surface_form":"cousin","offset":412},{"uri":"Almoravid","surface_form":"Almoravids","offset":438},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":542},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":637},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":695},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":705},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trading","offset":720},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"sub-Saharan Africa","offset":739},{"uri":"Fatima_Zahra_Mansouri","surface_form":"Fatima Zahra Mansouri","offset":782},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"Tourism","offset":842}]}
