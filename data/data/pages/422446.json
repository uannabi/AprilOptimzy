{"id":422446,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logorrhea","text":"e=\"preserve\">Logorrhea is a disorder of speech. It is a psychological disorder where a person speaks continuously in gibberish or makes no real sense. It is a sign of an underlying mental disorder, and needs psychiatric attention.\nLogorrhea happens in many different psychiatric and neurological conditions. Some of these are glossolalia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder.\nThe term is sometimes used of someone who is just very talkative. This is meant to be a humorous reference.\nIn popular culture.\nThe dramatic monologue \"Not I\" by Samuel Beckett is an example of logorrhea. So is Lucky's speech in the play \"Waiting for Godot\".\nIn the 1999 E.W. Scripps National Spelling Bee, the spelling bee champion Nupur Lala won with the word logorrhea. Then a documentary, \"Spellbound\" was made about the spelling bee.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disorder","surface_form":"disorder","offset":28},{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"speech","offset":40},{"uri":"Psychological","surface_form":"psychological","offset":56},{"uri":"Gibberish","surface_form":"gibberish","offset":117},{"uri":"Mental_disorder","surface_form":"mental disorder","offset":181},{"uri":"Psychiatric","surface_form":"psychiatric","offset":208},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"psychiatric","offset":267},{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurological","offset":283},{"uri":"Glossolalia","surface_form":"glossolalia","offset":326},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":339},{"uri":"Bipolar_disorder","surface_form":"bipolar disorder","offset":354},{"uri":"Schizoaffective_disorder","surface_form":"schizoaffective disorder","offset":376},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"dramatic","offset":534},{"uri":"Monologue","surface_form":"monologue","offset":543},{"uri":"Samuel_Beckett","surface_form":"Samuel Beckett","offset":564},{"uri":"Waiting_for_Godot","surface_form":"Waiting for Godot","offset":641},{"uri":"National_Spelling_Bee","surface_form":"National Spelling Bee","offset":686},{"uri":"Spellbound_(2002_film)","surface_form":"Spellbound","offset":796}]}
