He introduced and helped develop a way of measuring the absolute velocity of light with extreme accuracy. He provided experimental proof that the Earth rotates on its axis.\nFoucault was educated for the medical profession, but his interests turned to experimental physics. With Armand Fizeau, he began a series of investigations of light and heat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_18","surface_form":"September 18","offset":33},{"uri":"1819","surface_form":"1819","offset":47},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":53},{"uri":"February_11","surface_form":"February 11","offset":72},{"uri":"1868","surface_form":"1868","offset":85},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":105},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":112},{"uri":"Velocity_of_light","surface_form":"velocity of light","offset":188},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":269},{"uri":"Armand_Fizeau","surface_form":"Armand Fizeau","offset":401},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":455}]}
