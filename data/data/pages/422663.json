{"id":422663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pybba_of_Mercia","text":"Pybba (\u2020) (also Pibba or Wibba) was an early Anglian King of Mercia. He is the common ancestor of the Mercian kings in the four Mercian genealogies. As such he's considered by many historians to be the first known king of Mercia. He was the father of kings Penda and Eowa.\nKing of Mercia.\nPybba was the son of Creoda. The probable dates of his reign are from \u2013. Henry of Huntingdon placed him in this same time period: \"When Ceolric [Ceol] reigned over Wessex [591\u2013597], Aethelfrith over Northumbria [593\u2013616], and Pybba over Mercia, King Aethelberht of Kent and the Kentish people were converted to the faith [\u2013]...\" By this he is dated from the last decade of the 6th century into the first decade of the 7th century. The Mercian kings down to Ceolwulf all claimed to be descendants of Pybba. He also had a daughter who married (as his first wife) Cenwalh of Wessex Pybba either died or was deposed in.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%E2%80%A0","surface_form":"\u2020","offset":7},{"uri":"Angles","surface_form":"Anglian","offset":45},{"uri":"List_of_monarchs_of_Mercia","surface_form":"King of Mercia","offset":53},{"uri":"Mercia","surface_form":"Mercian","offset":102},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":110},{"uri":"Genealogies","surface_form":"genealogies","offset":136},{"uri":"Historians","surface_form":"historians","offset":181},{"uri":"Penda_of_Mercia","surface_form":"Penda","offset":257},{"uri":"Creoda_of_Mercia","surface_form":"Creoda","offset":310},{"uri":"Ceol_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Ceol","offset":434},{"uri":"Aethelfrith_of_Northumbria","surface_form":"Aethelfrith","offset":471},{"uri":"Aethelberht_of_Kent","surface_form":"Aethelberht of Kent","offset":539},{"uri":"6th_century","surface_form":"6th century","offset":666},{"uri":"7th_century","surface_form":"7th century","offset":707},{"uri":"Ceolwulf_I_of_Mercia","surface_form":"Ceolwulf","offset":746},{"uri":"Cenwalh_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Cenwalh of Wessex","offset":850}]}
