{"id":42269,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematode","text":"The Trematodes are a class of flatworms in the phylum Platyhelminthes. They are called flukes, and are internal parasites of molluscs and vertebrates. Most trematodes have a complex life cycle with at least two hosts. The primary host, where the flukes sexually reproduce, is a vertebrate. The intermediate host, which is the agent of dispersal, is usually a snail.\nThe trematodes or flukes are estimated to include 18,000 to 24,000 species","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":21},{"uri":"Flatworm","surface_form":"flatworm","offset":30},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":47},{"uri":"Platyhelminthes","surface_form":"Platyhelminthes","offset":54},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":112},{"uri":"Mollusc","surface_form":"mollusc","offset":125},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":138},{"uri":"Life_cycle","surface_form":"life cycle","offset":182},{"uri":"Snail","surface_form":"snail","offset":359},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":433}]}
