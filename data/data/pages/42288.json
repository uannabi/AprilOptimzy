{"id":42288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter","text":"A Geiger counter (sometimes called Geiger-M\u00FCller counter) is an instrument that measures ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. It is best known as a hand held radiation survey instrument, but it can also be used as a bench instrument or permanently installed.\nThe original operating principle was discovered in 1908 and since the subsequent development of the Geiger-M\u00FCller tube in 1928 the counter has been a very popular instrument due to its robust sensing detector and element and relatively low cost.\nPrinciple of operation.\nThe radiation sensor is a Geiger-M\u00FCller tube which gives out an electronic signal when radiation is present.\nThe readout is counts or radiation dose. The counts display is commonly \"counts per second\". Radiation dose rate is displayed in a unit such as the sievert.\nThe readout can be analogue or digital, and modern instruments have communications with a computer or network.\nThere is usually an option to produce audible clicks representing the radiation intensity. This allows the user to concentrate on manipulation of the instrument without looking at the display.\nTypes and applications.\nFor alpha particles and low energy beta particles the \"end window\" type of GM tube is used as these particles have a limited range even in free air and are easily stopped by a solid material.\nGeiger counters can be used to detect gamma radiation, and for this the windowless tube is used. A special type of the Geiger tube is used to measure neutrons.\nPhysical design.\nFor hand-held units there are two fundamental physical configurations: the \"integral\" unit, with both detector and electronics in the same unit, and the \"two-piece\" design which has a separate detector probe and an electronics module connected by a short cable.\nThere is a particular type of gamma instrument known as a \"hot spot\" detector which has the detector tube on the end of a long pole or flexible conduit. These are used to measure high radiation gamma locations whilst protecting the operator by means of distance shielding.\nHistory.\nIn 1908 Hans Geiger, developed a technique for detecting alpha particles that would later be used in the Geiger-M\u00FCller tube. This counter was only capable of detecting alpha particles but in 1928 Geiger and Walther M\u00FCller developed the sealed Geiger-M\u00FCller tube which could detect more types of ionizing radiation and it became a practical radiation sensor. Once this was available, Geiger counter instruments could be produced relatively cheaply.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ionizing_radiation","surface_form":"ionizing radiation","offset":89},{"uri":"Alpha_particle","surface_form":"alpha particle","offset":116},{"uri":"Beta_particle","surface_form":"beta particle","offset":133},{"uri":"Gamma_ray","surface_form":"gamma ray","offset":152},{"uri":"Sievert","surface_form":"sievert","offset":824},{"uri":"Geiger_panic.ogg","surface_form":"clicks","offset":990}]}
