Each month has 19 days. An extra 4 or 5 days are added between the last two months so that the next year also starts on the equinox. Each day begins at sunset. The time of sunset and the time of the equinox are calculated by astronomers.\nEach group of 19 years is called a V\u00E1hid.\nEach group of 19 V\u00E1hids is called a Kull-i-Shay\u2019.\nYear 1 of the Bad\u00ED' calendar started at Naw-R\u00FAz in 1844 A.D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solar_calendar","surface_form":"solar calendar","offset":91},{"uri":"B%C3%A1bism","surface_form":"B\u00E1bism","offset":114},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith","offset":129},{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"B\u00E1b","offset":175},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h","offset":194},{"uri":"Universal_House_of_Justice","surface_form":"Universal House of Justice","offset":214},{"uri":"Equinox","surface_form":"equinox","offset":284},{"uri":"Astronomers","surface_form":"astronomers","offset":548}]}
