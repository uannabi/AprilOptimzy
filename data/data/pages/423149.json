{"id":423149,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Apprentice_Scheme","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Aircraft Apprentice Scheme was a training programme in the Royal Air Force. It lasted from 1920 to 1966. The training programme was for aircraft ground crew (those who servicing the aircraft on the ground, as opposed to the pilots).\nThe Apprentice Scheme was the result of the Royal Air Force's decision to open Schools of Technical Training. RAF Halton was chosen as the home for the training of men and boys. The School of Technical Training (for boys) was not formed as a separate unit until 1919 and only became a permanent establishment on 1 January 1920. In March of that year, RAF Halton was named No. 1 School of Technical Training. No. 2 School of Technical Training at RAF Cranwell was created because there was not enough accommodation to house the boys at RAF Halton.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"training","offset":50},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":76},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":241},{"uri":"RAF_Halton","surface_form":"RAF Halton","offset":360},{"uri":"No._1_School_of_Technical_Training","surface_form":"No. 1 School of Technical Training","offset":622},{"uri":"RAF_Cranwell","surface_form":"RAF Cranwell","offset":696}]}
