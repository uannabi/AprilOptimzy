In their 2008 report Ofsted graded the school as 'outstanding'. Bruce Forsyth was a student. The school is selective and co-educational.\nAbout 186 pupils are admitted to Year 7 (aged 11 or 12) annually. Places are awarded by a competitive examination. 20 places are reserved for pupils with exceptional musical talent. The examinations taken by prospective pupils cover non-verbal reasoning, verbal reasoning and numeracy.\nAround 60-70 pupils join the sixth form in Year 12 (aged 16 or 17) per year, mixing with Latymer pupils who have made the transition from Year 11. External applicants to the sixth form sit entrance examinations and generally require 6 A grades at GCSE (or equivalent) level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grammar_school","surface_form":"grammar school","offset":24},{"uri":"Edmonton%2C_London","surface_form":"Edmonton","offset":42},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":52},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":95},{"uri":"Ofsted","surface_form":"Ofsted","offset":141},{"uri":"Bruce_Forsyth","surface_form":"Bruce Forsyth","offset":184},{"uri":"Co-educational","surface_form":"co-educational","offset":241},{"uri":"Examination","surface_form":"examination","offset":359},{"uri":"Sixth_form","surface_form":"sixth form","offset":572},{"uri":"GCSE","surface_form":"GCSE","offset":790}]}
