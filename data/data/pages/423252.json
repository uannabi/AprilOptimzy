{"id":423252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map","text":"A topographic map is a kind of map which uses contour lines or other ways to show elevation and topography. Topo maps are usually very detailed, with a large scale, though some are not. These maps are prepared based on detailed surveying of the areas concerned.\nTopographical maps may be used for many purposes. They show relief features, rivers, land use, vegetation, settlements, roads, railway lines and administrative units and their boundaries. These maps are revised periodically to update them. Town guide maps are based on them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":31},{"uri":"Contour_line","surface_form":"contour line","offset":46},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":82},{"uri":"Topography","surface_form":"topography","offset":96},{"uri":"Scale_(map)","surface_form":"scale","offset":158},{"uri":"Surveying","surface_form":"surveying","offset":228}]}
