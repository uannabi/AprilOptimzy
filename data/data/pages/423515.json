{"id":423515,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Plan","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Virginia Plan was a proposal made by Virginia delegates at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. James Madison drafted the plan for a government with 3 subdivisions, or branches that would be equal in power. It also proposed states with large populations have more representatives. States with small populations would have fewer representatives. The plan called for a congress with new powers to tax and make laws. It also proposed a president and a supreme court. Ultimately, this created a strong central government seperated into three branches. The resolutions went well beyond making minor changes to the Articles of Confederation. It succeeded in expanding the debate to include basic changes to the structure and powers of the national government.\nLater on, the Virginia plan was modified and accepted as the United States Constitution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Proposal","surface_form":"proposal","offset":37},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":54},{"uri":"Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)","surface_form":"Constitutional Convention","offset":80},{"uri":"James_Madison","surface_form":"James Madison","offset":115},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":152},{"uri":"Subdivisions","surface_form":"subdivisions","offset":170},{"uri":"Populations","surface_form":"populations","offset":261},{"uri":"Articles_of_Confederation","surface_form":"Articles of Confederation","offset":628},{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":685},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":724},{"uri":"National","surface_form":"national","offset":752}]}
