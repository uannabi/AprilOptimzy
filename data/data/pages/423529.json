{"id":423529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lythronax","text":"\"Lythronax\" is an extinct genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur. It lived about 80 million years ago (mya) in what is now southern Utah. \"L. argestes\" is the oldest known tyrannosaurid based on its stratigraphic position.\nComparisons to its close relatives suggest that \"Lythronax\" would have been about long, with a weight of around and had a large skull filled with sharp teeth.\nThe rostrum is comparatively short: it makes up less than two thirds of the total skull length. The whole skull is very broad, 0.4 times as wide as long. Overall, the skull is similar to that of \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Tarbosaurus\". Its robust jaws have two sizes of teeth: its first five teeth are much larger than the other six. Behind the skull, the rest of the skeleton is similar to that of other tyrannosaurids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":18},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":26},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurid","surface_form":"tyrannosaurid","offset":35},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":49},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":58},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":134},{"uri":"Stratigraphy","surface_form":"stratigraphic","offset":201},{"uri":"Tyrannosauridae","surface_form":"its close relatives","offset":240},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":353},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":466},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus","offset":580},{"uri":"Tarbosaurus","surface_form":"Tarbosaurus","offset":600},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":746}]}
