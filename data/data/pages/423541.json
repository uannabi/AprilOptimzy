{"id":423541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation","text":"The RAND Corporation is a nonprofit global policy think tank first formed to offer research and analysis to the United States Armed Forces. The RAND was started in 1946 inside the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was set up as an independent corporation in 1948. The name was taken from R&D (research and development), though in fact it did no development.\nPast.\nSince the 1950s, RAND research has helped form United States policy decisions on many issues: the space race, the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms confrontation, the creation of the Great Society social welfare programs, the digital revolution, and national health care. It was best known for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence by mutually assured destruction (MAD), based upon their work with game theory. Chief strategist Herman Kahn discussed the idea of a \"winnable\" nuclear exchange in his 1960 book \"On Thermonuclear War\". This led to Kahn being one of the models for \"Dr Strangelove\" in \"Dr.\u00A0Strangelove\". In the movie, RAND is spoofed as the \"BLAND Corporation\".\nPresent.\nThe RAND is now financed by the U.S.\u00A0government and private endowment, corporations, the healthcare industry, universities, and private individuals.\nThe organization now works with other governments, private foundations, international organizations, and commercial organizations on a host of non-defence issues. RAND techniques were based on operations research (O.R). which started in World War II. O.R. is the interdisciplinary application of scientific thinking to problem-solving. It relies mostly on the hard sciences like physics and mathematics, and economics. However, some famous biologists and social scientists have worked with RAND at times, and the importance of social ideas and thinking is more important than ever today.\nRAND has about 1,700 employees and three principal North American locations: Santa Monica, California (headquarters); Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute has offices in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. RAND Europe is located in Cambridge, England, and Brussels, Belgium. The RAND-Qatar Policy Institute is in Doha, Qatar. RAND's newest office is in Boston, Massachusetts.\nRAND is also home to the Pardee RAND School, which is the world's largest Ph.D.-granting program in policy analysis. Unlike many other universities, all PARDEE RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships in order to cover their education costs. RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and outsiders to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these projects are short-term and are worked on independently with the mentoring of a RAND staff members.\nRAND publishes the \"RAND Journal of Economics\", a peer-reviewed journal of economics.\nTo date, 32 winners of a Nobel Prize, mainly in economics and physics, have been associated with the RAND at some point in their career.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nonprofit","surface_form":"nonprofit","offset":26},{"uri":"Think_tank","surface_form":"think tank","offset":50},{"uri":"United_States_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"United States Armed Forces","offset":112},{"uri":"Great_Society","surface_form":"Great Society","offset":533},{"uri":"Nuclear_deterrence","surface_form":"nuclear deterrence","offset":660},{"uri":"Mutually_assured_destruction","surface_form":"mutually assured destruction","offset":682},{"uri":"Game_theory","surface_form":"game theory","offset":745},{"uri":"Herman_Kahn","surface_form":"Herman Kahn","offset":775},{"uri":"On_Thermonuclear_War","surface_form":"On Thermonuclear War","offset":857},{"uri":"How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_the_Bomb","surface_form":"Dr.\u00A0Strangelove","offset":946},{"uri":"Financial_endowment","surface_form":"endowment","offset":1091},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1218},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commercial","offset":1285},{"uri":"Operations_research","surface_form":"operations research","offset":1373},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1417},{"uri":"Interdisciplinary","surface_form":"interdisciplinary","offset":1443},{"uri":"Problem-solving","surface_form":"problem-solving","offset":1499},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":1559},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":1571},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":1588},{"uri":"Santa_Monica%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Monica, California","offset":1845},{"uri":"Arlington%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Arlington, Virginia","offset":1886},{"uri":"Pittsburgh","surface_form":"Pittsburgh","offset":1911},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":1990},{"uri":"Jackson%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Jackson","offset":2018},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":2066},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":2090},{"uri":"Doha","surface_form":"Doha","offset":2147},{"uri":"Qatar","surface_form":"Qatar","offset":2153},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":2187},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":2195},{"uri":"Peer_review","surface_form":"peer-reviewed","offset":2773},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":2834}]}
