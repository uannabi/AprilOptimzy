In the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s \"2012 Global go-to think tanks report\", Brookings is ranked the most influential think tank in the world.\nBrookings states that its scholars \"represent diverse points of view\" and describes itself as non-partisan. The media describe Brookings as \"liberal-centrist\" or \"centrist\". An analysis of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referenced by conservative politicians almost as often as liberal politicians. It got a score of 53 on a 1-100 scale with 100 the most liberal score. The same study found Brookings to be the most frequently cited think tank by the U.S. media and politicians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Think_tank","surface_form":"think tank","offset":41},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":61},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":159},{"uri":"Social_science","surface_form":"social science","offset":189},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":216},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policy","offset":227},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":235},{"uri":"Foreign_policy","surface_form":"foreign policy","offset":247},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":286},{"uri":"University_of_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"University of Pennsylvania","offset":306},{"uri":"Non-partisan","surface_form":"non-partisan","offset":535}]}
