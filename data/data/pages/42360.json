He was one of the founding fathers of quantum theory and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.\nLife.\nSchr\u00F6dinger went to the Academic Gymnasium from 1898 to 1906.\nAfterwards he studied mathematics and physics in Vienna and wrote his habilitation up from 1910.\nHe was a soldier in World War I. Afterwards he got professorships in Z\u00FCrich, Jena, Breslau and Stuttgart. In 1920 he married.\nIn 1927 he went to Berlin to fellow Max Planck.\nAfter the take-over of power by the Nazis, Schr\u00F6dinger left Germany and got a new professorship in Oxford.\nIn 1933 he was awarded the Nobel Prize.\nThree years later he returned to Austria and became professor in Graz.\nIn 1938 he had to leave Austria, because the Nazis had taken over government.\nHe went to Dublin and became director of the School for Theoretical Physics.\nIn 1956 he returned to Vienna and got a professorship for Theoretical Physics.\nHe died of tuberculosis in 1961.\nImportant work.\nSchr\u00F6dinger's most important work is the wave mechanics \u2013 a formulation of quantum mechanics, and especially the Schr\u00F6dinger equation. He also worked on the field of biophysics. He invented the concept of negentropy and helped to develop molecular biology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":77},{"uri":"Austrian","surface_form":"Austrian","offset":123},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum theory","offset":207},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":234},{"uri":"Gymnasium_(school)","surface_form":"Gymnasium","offset":305},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":451},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich_City","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":500},{"uri":"Jena","surface_form":"Jena","offset":508},{"uri":"Breslau","surface_form":"Breslau","offset":514},{"uri":"Stuttgart","surface_form":"Stuttgart","offset":526},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":576},{"uri":"Max_Planck","surface_form":"Max Planck","offset":593},{"uri":"Nazis","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":641},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":704},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":739},{"uri":"Graz","surface_form":"Graz","offset":817},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":912},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":1068},{"uri":"Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation","surface_form":"Schr\u00F6dinger equation","offset":1219},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"biophysics","offset":1272},{"uri":"Negentropy","surface_form":"negentropy","offset":1311},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":1344}]}
