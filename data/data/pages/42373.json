{"id":42373,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell","text":"James Clerk Maxwell (born 13 June 1831 in Edinburgh \u2013 died 5 November 1879) was a Scottish mathematician, physicist and discoverer of Maxwell's equations.\nMaxwell grew up in a rich religious family. In 1845, when he was only 14, he wrote a paper describing a way of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of string. In 1847 he started studying mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. In 1850 Maxwell changed to Peterhouse and then Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. He won prizes from the university for his work and was given his degree in 1854. From 1855 to 1872 he did research on colour blindness.\nIn 1856 Maxwell was made a professor of 'Natural Philosophy' (which is what science was called then) at Marischal College, Aberdeen. He worked there until the two colleges in Aberdeen joined together in 1860 and he lost his job. He then became a professor at King's College London. In 1861 he was elected to the Royal Society.\nIn 1871, became the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. He studied many things, but is known best for his mathematical work on electromagnetism and on the behaviour of gases.\nHe lived at Glenlair House, his family estate near the village of Parton, Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire. Maxwell died in 1879 from cancer, and is buried in the graveyard at Parton Church.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":42},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":82},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":91},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":106},{"uri":"Maxwell%27s_equations","surface_form":"Maxwell's equations","offset":134},{"uri":"Peterhouse%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Peterhouse","offset":417},{"uri":"Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge","surface_form":"Trinity College","offset":437},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":460},{"uri":"Colour_blindness","surface_form":"colour blindness","offset":603},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":648},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":697},{"uri":"Aberdeen","surface_form":"Aberdeen","offset":744},{"uri":"King%27s_College_London","surface_form":"King's College London","offset":880},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":933},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"electromagnetism","offset":1090},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":1131},{"uri":"Kirkcudbrightshire","surface_form":"Kirkcudbrightshire","offset":1230},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1276}]}
