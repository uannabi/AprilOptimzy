{"id":423808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Leavelle","text":"James Robert \"Jim\" Leavelle (August 23, 1920 \u2013 August 29, 2019) was a Dallas, Texas homicide detective who was escorting Lee Harvey Oswald through the basement of Dallas Police headquarters when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby.\nEarly life.\nLeavelle was born and raised in Red River County, Texas. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, and was a sailor on board the USS \"Whitney\" during the December 7, 1941 Pearl Harbor bombings.\nCareer.\nHe joined the Dallas Police Department in April 1950 and retired in April 1975.\nLeavelle later said to author Joseph McBride that to him, the murder of President John F. Kennedy was \"no different than a south Dallas nigger killing\". This remark reveals that Leavelle was a racist who was not really concerned about who killed President Kennedy.\nWhen Leavelle testified before the Warren Commission, he claimed that the first time he had ever sat in on an interrogation with Oswald was on Sunday morning, November 24, 1963. When Counsel Joseph Ball asked Leavelle if he had ever spoken to Oswald before this interrogation, he stated; \"No; I had never talked to him before\". Leavelle then stated during his testimony that; \"...the only time I had connections with Oswald was this Sunday morning [November 24, 1963]. I never had [the] occasion to talk with him at any time...\"\nLeavelle believed that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy, and said that in a 2006 discussion, he was told by Oswald's brother Robert that he believes the same thing, \"because I knew my brother.\"\nDeath.\nLeavelle died at a hospital on August 29, 2019, at the age of 99 while on a trip to Denver, Colorado from a heart attack while recovering from hip surgery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dallas%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Dallas, Texas","offset":70},{"uri":"Lee_Harvey_Oswald","surface_form":"Lee Harvey Oswald","offset":121},{"uri":"Jack_Ruby","surface_form":"Jack Ruby","offset":214},{"uri":"Red_River_County%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Red River County, Texas","offset":269},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":311},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":337},{"uri":"USS_Whitney","surface_form":"USS \"Whitney\"","offset":381},{"uri":"Pearl_Harbor","surface_form":"Pearl Harbor bombings","offset":423},{"uri":"Dallas_Police_Department","surface_form":"Dallas Police Department","offset":468},{"uri":"Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"murder of President John F.
