He graduated from there with a degree in Liberal Arts with major in Communications Electronic Media and minor in criminal justice.\nHe signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment on February 10, 2009 and was assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) where he competed under the ring name Tonga. Later in March, he joined the Washington's Secret Service stable under the ring name Agent T. where he competed alongside Agent D. and Agent C. After that was over, he changed his ring name to Donny Marlow and teamed with C.J. Parker. On July 21, 2011, Marlow and Parker defeated Calvin Raines and Big E. Langston to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship but lost the Tag Team Championship to Brad Maddox and Briley Pierce on November 3.\nHe debuted on the December 15, 2011 episode of Superstars as the enforcer of Hunico and went under the ring name Camacho. The two teamed together on the April 26 episode of Superstars and defeated The Usos. He made his pay-per-view debut at Over The Limit but was defeated in singles competition against Ryback.\nAfter that, he was sent back down to the developmental territory, the former FCW, which was rebranded into NXT Wrestling. He debuted on NXT in a losing effort against Seth Rollins. He won a match later on the same episode in a six-man tag match when he teamed with Hunico and Michael McGillicutty against Rollins, Bo Dallas and Tyson Kidd. He defeated Kidd in a singles match following a distraction from McGillicutty on the following episode of NXT.\nHe competed in the pre-show of Money in the Bank when he teamed with Hunico in a losing effort against the WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth in a non-title match.
