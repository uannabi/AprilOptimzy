Later on, they were in need of a drummer which led them to Ashton Irwin on Facebook from a mutual friend, and officially became a band on December 3,2011. Little by little, with all members singing and playing an instrument and getting serious by writing their own songs, Louis Tomlinson from One Direction (1D), directed his attention toward the 4 boys and tweeted them causing the rage of many fans to fall in love with 5 Seconds of Summer. Over the years 5SOS released EP's like \"Somewhere New (2012), Unplugged (2012), Don't Stop (2014), Good Girls (2014), Amnesia (2014), and She's Kinda Hot (2015).\" They proceeded to release their first album \"5 Seconds of Summer\" on June 27, 2014 which got recognition from fans worldwide and resulted in their very first headlining tour \"Rock Out With Your Socks Out\". Their second album \"Sounds Good Feels Good\" was released on October 23, 2015, followed by their second headlining world tour \"Sounds Live Feels Live\". 5 Seconds of Summer released their 3rd album, Youngblood, on the 15th June, 2018, after returning from their 3-year hiatus. Since then, the band has featured on The Chainsmokers' single \"Who Do You Love\", and joined The Chainsmokers on their tour, World War Joy. 5SOS have already begun writing for their fourth album, and hope to release it in 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pop-rock","surface_form":"pop-rock","offset":44},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":53},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":84},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":139},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"lead vocals","offset":217},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":230},{"uri":"Drums","surface_form":"drums","offset":257}]}
