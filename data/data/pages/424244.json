{"id":424244,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adour","text":"The Adour (,) is a river in southwestern France that flows through the Occitanie and Nouvelle-Aquitaine regions.\nIt rises in the Pyrenees, at the Arbizon mountain, and flows into the Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay) near Bayonne.\nGeography.\nThe Adour river has a length of, and a drainage basin with an area of approximately.\nCourse.\nThe Adour river is born, as Adour de Payolle, at the north side of the Arbizon mountain. In the Campan valley, that is formed by three smaller valleys corresponding to the sources of the three \"Adours\" (\"Adour de Payolle\", \"Adour de Gripp\" and the \"Adour de Lesponne\"), these small rivers meet at Campan (Arrondissement of Bagn\u00E8res-de-Bigorre) to form the Adour river.\nThe Adour flows north for almost a hundred miles through the Hautes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es to Gers. There, it turned to the west and gets into the Landes department. In Port-de-Lanne, the Adour is joined by the Gaves r\u00E9unis river and, finally, it flows into the Bay of Biscay, in the Atlantic Ocean, between Anglet (Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Atlantiques) and Tarnos (Landes).\nThe river is navigable (it is deep, wide and slow enough for a ship to pass) for about from its mouth.\nHydrology.\nThe average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) for the Adour river is at Saint-Vincent-de-Paul in the Landes department.\nAverage monthly discharge (m3/s) at Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (1918 - 2017)\nThe Adour shows typical seasonal fluctuations. The highest levels of the river are in winter and spring, from December to May inclusive, with the highest level in February. They are followed by a rapid fall in the flow during the low water period that goes from July to October.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":19},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":41},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":71},{"uri":"Nouvelle-Aquitaine","surface_form":"Nouvelle-Aquitaine","offset":85},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":129},{"uri":"Arbizon","surface_form":"Arbizon","offset":146},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":183},{"uri":"Bay_of_Biscay","surface_form":"Bay of Biscay","offset":199},{"uri":"Bayonne","surface_form":"Bayonne","offset":219},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":278},{"uri":"Adour_de_Payolle","surface_form":"Adour de Payolle","offset":360},{"uri":"Arbizon","surface_form":"Arbizon","offset":403},{"uri":"Campan_valley","surface_form":"Campan valley","offset":428},{"uri":"River_source","surface_form":"sources","offset":504},{"uri":"Campan","surface_form":"Campan","offset":629},{"uri":"Arrondissement_of_Bagn%C3%A8res-de-Bigorre","surface_form":"Arrondissement of Bagn\u00E8res-de-Bigorre","offset":637},{"uri":"Hautes-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Hautes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":762},{"uri":"Gers","surface_form":"Gers","offset":781},{"uri":"Landes","surface_form":"Landes","offset":834},{"uri":"Port-de-Lanne","surface_form":"Port-de-Lanne","offset":856},{"uri":"Gaves_r%C3%A9unis","surface_form":"Gaves r\u00E9unis","offset":898},{"uri":"Bay_of_Biscay","surface_form":"Bay of Biscay","offset":949},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":971},{"uri":"Anglet","surface_form":"Anglet","offset":995},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Atlantiques","offset":1003},{"uri":"Tarnos","surface_form":"Tarnos","offset":1029},{"uri":"Landes","surface_form":"Landes","offset":1037},{"uri":"Navigable","surface_form":"navigable","offset":1059},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":1109},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":1179},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":1190},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1200},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":1254},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":1262},{"uri":"Saint-Vincent-de-Paul%2C_Landes","surface_form":"Saint-Vincent-de-Paul","offset":1294},{"uri":"Landes","surface_form":"Landes","offset":1323},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":1438},{"uri":"Fluctuation","surface_form":"fluctuations","offset":1447},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":1500},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":1511}]}
