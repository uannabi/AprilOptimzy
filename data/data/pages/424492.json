{"id":424492,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Lindsay","text":"The Division of Lindsay is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was set up in 1984 and is named after Sir Norman Lindsay, the Australian artist, writer and sculptor.\nThe division is in the outer western suburbs of Sydney, and includes Cambridge Park, Cambridge Gardens, Castlereagh, Claremont Meadows, Cranebrook, Emu Plains, Glenmore Park, Jamisontown, Kingswood, Leonay, Llandilo, North St Marys, Oxley Park, Penrith, Regentville, St Marys, South Penrith, Werrington, Werrington County, Werrington Downs and parts of Agnes Banks, Luddenham and Wallacia.\nHistory.\nSince it was set up in 1984, its winning member of parliament has been from the party winning government.\nJackie Kelly won the seat during the 1996 election. Her win was challenged in the Court of Disputed Returns because she was still a citizen of New Zealand, and she worked as a legal officer for the Royal Australian Air Force. The Australian Constitution (Section 44) does not allow people who are citizens of another country, or people who are employed by the government to be members of Parliament. A by-election was held, and Kelly who had given up her New Zealand citizenship, and resigned from her airforce job was elected again.\nIn 2007 Kelly was again in trouble. Three days before the election her supporters, including her husband, were caught in Lindsay putting fake letters in peoples' letterboxes. These letters linked the Labor Party to Islamic terrorism.\nMembers.\nDavid Bradbury had served as the Mayor of Penrith. Every member of Lindsay to date, except Scott, has served as a minister.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":30},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":67},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":76},{"uri":"Norman_Lindsay","surface_form":"Norman Lindsay","offset":138},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":169},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":177},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":188},{"uri":"Western_Sydney","surface_form":"outer western suburbs","offset":221},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":246},{"uri":"Cambridge_Park%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cambridge Park","offset":267},{"uri":"Cambridge_Gardens%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cambridge Gardens","offset":283},{"uri":"Castlereagh%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Castlereagh","offset":302},{"uri":"Claremont_Meadows%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Claremont Meadows","offset":315},{"uri":"Cranebrook%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Cranebrook","offset":334},{"uri":"Emu_Plains%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Emu Plains","offset":346},{"uri":"Glenmore_Park%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Glenmore Park","offset":358},{"uri":"Jamisontown%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Jamisontown","offset":373},{"uri":"Kingswood%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Kingswood","offset":386},{"uri":"Leonay%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Leonay","offset":397},{"uri":"Llandilo%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Llandilo","offset":405},{"uri":"Oxley_Park%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Oxley Park","offset":431},{"uri":"Penrith%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Penrith","offset":443},{"uri":"Regentville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Regentville","offset":452},{"uri":"St_Marys%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"St Marys","offset":465},{"uri":"Werrington%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Werrington","offset":490},{"uri":"Werrington_County%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Werrington County","offset":502},{"uri":"Werrington_Downs%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Werrington Downs","offset":521},{"uri":"Agnes_Banks%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Agnes Banks","offset":551},{"uri":"Luddenham%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Luddenham","offset":564},{"uri":"Wallacia%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wallacia","offset":578},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":846},{"uri":"Royal_Australian_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Australian Air Force","offset":901},{"uri":"Australian_Constitution","surface_form":"Australian Constitution","offset":933},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":1105},{"uri":"Islamic_terrorism","surface_form":"Islamic terrorism","offset":1452}]}
