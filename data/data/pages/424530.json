It is sometimes made out of hard-carbon steel (heat treated steel).\nIt is used to cut small pieces of wood and most joints. The saw has a fine toothed crosscut for sawing plywood, thin wood and large joints.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Backsaw","surface_form":"backsaw","offset":25},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":71},{"uri":"Carpenter","surface_form":"carpenter","offset":147},{"uri":"High-speed_steel","surface_form":"high-speed steel","offset":195},{"uri":"Brass","surface_form":"brass","offset":222}]}
