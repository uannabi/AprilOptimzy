{"id":424639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon","text":"e=\"preserve\">A stop codon, or termination codon, is special sequence in the genetic code. It is a nucleotide triplet in messenger RNA that signals the end of translation.\nIt is a codon (that is, a sequence of three nucleotides in messenger RNA). It indicates the end of a gene. Similar to how a full stop indicates the end of a sentence, a stop codon signals the end of genetic translation.\nThey are also called termination codons or chain termination codons. There are three such codons: UAA, UAG and UGA.\nProteins are based on polypeptides, which are unique sequences of amino acids. Most codons in messenger RNA correspond to the addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain, which may ultimately become a protein. Stop codons indicate the end of this process, and therefore, the end of polypeptide synthesis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetic_code","surface_form":"genetic code","offset":76},{"uri":"Nucleotide","surface_form":"nucleotide","offset":98},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":120},{"uri":"Translation_(genetics)","surface_form":"translation","offset":158},{"uri":"Codon","surface_form":"codon","offset":179},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"sequence","offset":197},{"uri":"Nucleotide","surface_form":"nucleotide","offset":215},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":230},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":272},{"uri":"Full_stop","surface_form":"full stop","offset":295},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":328},{"uri":"Translation_(genetics)","surface_form":"genetic translation","offset":370},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"Protein","offset":507},{"uri":"Polypeptide","surface_form":"polypeptide","offset":529},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":573},{"uri":"Polypeptide","surface_form":"polypeptide synthesis","offset":802}]}
