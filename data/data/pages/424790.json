There was a great deal of disagreement among his noblemen during his short reign. He was deposed and exiled from Mercia by Beornwulf of Mercia who claimed the throne himself.\nKing of Mercia.\nHe was the son Cuthbert, a Mercian nobleman. His brother Coenwulf ruled Mercia before him. At his brother's death the Mercians were attacking Wales. Ceolwulf continued where Coenwulf left off. The \"Annales Cambriae\" for the year 822 said the 'Saxons' attacked and destroyed the fortress at Deganwy and then controlled Powys. Welsh poems of the time confirm Mercia was attacking Powys.
