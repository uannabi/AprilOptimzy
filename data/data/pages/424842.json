{"id":424842,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value","text":"In probability theory and statistics, the expected value of a random variable formula_1 (represented by the symbol formula_1) is the average value the variable will take, that is, assuming that the experiment is repeated an infinite number of times, and the mean (or weighted average) of all the values is calculated along the way.\nBy definition, the expected value of a discrete random variable formula_1 is calculated by the formula formula_1, where formula_1 is the probability that formula_1 equals formula_1, and formula_1 ranges over all possible values of formula_1.\nThe Law of large numbers describes how this happens.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":3},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":26},{"uri":"Random_variable","surface_form":"random variable","offset":62},{"uri":"Mean","surface_form":"mean","offset":258},{"uri":"Law_of_large_numbers","surface_form":"Law of large numbers","offset":578}]}
