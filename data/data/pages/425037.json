{"id":425037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emptiness","text":"=\"preserve\">Emptiness is a sense of general boredom, feeling socially separated from other people, and feeling that you do not care any more. Feelings of emptiness often accompany depression, loneliness, or despair. A sense of emptiness is also part of a natural process of grief, caused by separation from or the death of somebody you love.\nWhile Christianity and Western sociologists and psychologists consider a state of emptiness as a negative, bad condition, in some Eastern philosophies such as Buddhist philosophy and Taoism, emptiness is seen as a real achievement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sense","surface_form":"sense","offset":27},{"uri":"Boredom","surface_form":"boredom","offset":44},{"uri":"Depression_(mood)","surface_form":"depression","offset":180},{"uri":"Loneliness","surface_form":"loneliness","offset":192},{"uri":"Despair","surface_form":"despair","offset":207},{"uri":"Grief","surface_form":"grief","offset":274},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":314},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":348},{"uri":"Western_philosophy","surface_form":"Western","offset":365},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociologists","offset":373},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychologists","offset":390},{"uri":"Eastern_philosophy","surface_form":"Eastern philosophies","offset":472},{"uri":"Buddhist_philosophy","surface_form":"Buddhist philosophy","offset":501},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoism","offset":525}]}
