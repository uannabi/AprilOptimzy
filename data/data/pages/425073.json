It includes vocals from Colin James on two tracks, and Roxanne Potvin on one. Songs from the album have been played on House of Blues Radio Hour. Music reviewer Brad Wheeler from Canada's \"Globe and Mail\" newspaper praised the \"graceful ability he (Jones) shows on guitar\" in the album. Wheeler stated that \"...the Ottawa player makes retro moves, layering swinging blues with keyboards and very noticeable horns that never dominate the fine-lined fills and lead work.\" The Allmusic review of \"My Kind of Evil\", by Chris Nickson, states that \"He's very good on covers, such as \"I Don't Know\", but his own songs \u2014 the vast majority of this disc \u2014 have plenty of life.\"\nIn May 2009, Jones' song \"Parasomnia\" appeared on a \"Guitar World\" featured CD, \"Guitar Masters Vol. 2\". Other artists on the CD were B. B. King, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, and Carlos Santana. The \"Globe and Mail\" referred to Jones as \"one of this country's top blues guitar stars\". The \"Blues Revue Magazine\" stated that Jones' guitar playing is like T-Bone Walker's guitar playing. The review said that JW-Jones plays solo melodies like Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson, and that his guitar playing is like Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown. \"Billboard\" called Jones part of \"a new wave of young talent moving onto Canada\u2019s blues stage.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":32},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":45},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":54},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":60},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":164},{"uri":"Music_tour","surface_form":"tour","offset":446},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":532},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":543},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"clubs","offset":556},{"uri":"Kim_Wilson","surface_form":"Kim Wilson","offset":707},{"uri":"The_Fabulous_Thunderbirds","surface_form":"The Fabulous Thunderbirds","offset":730},{"uri":"Colin_James","surface_form":"Colin James","offset":782},{"uri":"Roxanne_Potvin","surface_form":"Roxanne Potvin","offset":813},{"uri":"Allmusic","surface_form":"Allmusic","offset":1232},{"uri":"Cover_version","surface_form":"covers","offset":1319},{"uri":"B._B._King","surface_form":"B.
