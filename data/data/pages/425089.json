{"id":425089,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_exam","text":"=\"preserve\">A midterm exam is a test given around the middle of a term in schools.\nPurpose.\nMidterm exams can be given for several reasons. First, it allows a student to see if they need to change how they study for the class (if they do not do well on the exam) or if they should continue to study the same way for the rest of the term (if they do well). This tells a student who does not do well that they should drop the class. Many colleges stop allowing students to drop a class a week or two after the first midterm exam. Midterm exams can also show how well a teacher is doing in teaching their class. Some teachers give more than one midterm exam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Test","surface_form":"test","offset":32},{"uri":"Academic_term","surface_form":"term","offset":66},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":74},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":159}]}
