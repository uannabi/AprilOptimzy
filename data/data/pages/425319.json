He is mostly known for his music to the British 6-part drama UTOPIA for which he won an RTS Craft Award in the best original score category in 2013.\nEarly life.\nCristo was born during the military coup d'\u00E9tat in Chile. First, his parents fled to Paris, France. While his father decided to stay there, his mother took him back to Chile. Life under Pinochet's dictatorship still proved impossible, so they found political refuge in Qu\u00E9bec, Canada.\nCareer.\nHe obtained a master's degree in Classical Music (specialization in percussion) from the Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00E9bec. In 2001 he got signed to Warner Music with his pop-band \"[http://musicvideo.wikia.com/wiki/One_Ton One Ton]\", putting a hold on his classical career. The trio won the Canadian Dance Music Award (SOCAN) in 2003 with the electro-dance single \"Supersex World\". It was Cristo who produced the album.\nMovie & TV scoring.\nIn 2011, his music for the Victorian 4-part drama \"The Crimson Petal and the White\" (dir: Marc Munden, BBC2) totally surprised the audiences.\n\"The soundtrack ranges from gnawing electronic hums to choral ecstasy. It's all brilliantly, effectively, appropriately jarring, even if it sends the Masterpiece crowd to the medicine cabinet for Dramamine.\"\nHis latest work is in the conspiracy thriller \"UTOPIA\" created by Dennis Kelly, that aired on Channel 4. A second series has already been commissioned.\nThe Royal Television Society awarded him a Craft & Design Awards for \"best original music\" in November 2013.\nHe wrote music for a new TV-show called [http://serienoire.radio-canada.ca \"S\u00E9rie Noire\"], written and directed by the writers of \"Les Invincibles\", released in January 2014 on Radio-Canada.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Score_composer","surface_form":"score composer","offset":78},{"uri":"Arranger","surface_form":"arranger","offset":94},{"uri":"Producer_(music)","surface_form":"producer","offset":104},{"uri":"Multi-instrumentalist","surface_form":"multi-instrumentalist","offset":117},{"uri":"Utopia_(TV_series)","surface_form":"UTOPIA","offset":231},{"uri":"RTS_Craft_Award","surface_form":"RTS Craft Award","offset":258},{"uri":"September_11%2C_1973_coup","surface_form":"military coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":358},{"uri":"Pinochet","surface_form":"Pinochet","offset":517},{"uri":"Conservatoire_de_musique_du_Qu%C3%A9bec_%C3%A0_Qu%C3%A9bec","surface_form":"Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00E9bec","offset":713},{"uri":"Warner_Music","surface_form":"Warner Music","offset":774},{"uri":"SOCAN","surface_form":"SOCAN","offset":944},{"uri":"The_Crimson_Petal_and_the_White_(TV_miniseries)","surface_form":"The Crimson Petal and the White","offset":1116},{"uri":"Utopia_(TV_series)","surface_form":"UTOPIA","offset":1462},{"uri":"Dennis_Kelly","surface_form":"Dennis Kelly","offset":1481},{"uri":"Channel_4","surface_form":"Channel 4","offset":1509},{"uri":"The_Royal_Television_Society","surface_form":"The Royal Television Society","offset":1567},{"uri":"Les_Invincibles","surface_form":"Les Invincibles","offset":1807},{"uri":"Radio-Canada_Television","surface_form":"Radio-Canada","offset":1853}]}
