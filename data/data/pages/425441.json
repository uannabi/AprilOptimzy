{"id":425441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin_(RAF_campaign)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Battle of Berlin was the British bombing raid on Berlin during World War II. The bombings were done from November 1943 to March 1944. British bombers had new navigation aids to help them, such as the new H2S radar. Between November 1943 and March 1944, Bomber Command made 16 attacks on Berlin. Although the bombings were mostly done by British bombers, Australian and Canadian bombers also flew to Germany.\nThe Battle of Berlin was considered a failure for the Royal Air Force (RAF). They lost 1,047 bombers, with 1,682 more damaged. The RAF also lost over 7,000 air crew members. Another reason that the battle is seen as a defeat for the British is that the bombings did not cause the Germans to give up. Although it left 450,000 Germans homeless.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":42},{"uri":"Bombing","surface_form":"bombing","offset":50},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":66},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":80},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":371},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":386},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":416},{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":479},{"uri":"RAF","surface_form":"RAF","offset":556}]}
