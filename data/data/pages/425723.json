{"id":425723,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point","text":"e=\"preserve\">In computer networks, a wireless access point is a device that allows people to connect Wi-Fi devices such as laptop computers on a wireless LAN, to a wired network. The access point is often connected to a wireless Router.\nComparison to an ad hoc network.\nA wireless ad hoc network uses two or more devices without a wireless access point. Ad hoc networks are easier to set up because an access point is not needed. This makes it similar to Bluetooth.\nLimitations.\nIt is suggested for each access point to only serve 15-25 client devices This depends on the number of devices in an area, the needed speed of data transfer, location and radio channels of the access point, obstacles and more. A repeater, which repeats the signal, can be used to reach farther places.\nThere are only a few radio channels for wireless networks. Nearby access points may use different channels to prevent them from obstructing each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"computer network","offset":16},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":64},{"uri":"Wi-Fi","surface_form":"Wi-Fi","offset":101},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"laptop","offset":123},{"uri":"Wireless_LAN","surface_form":"wireless LAN","offset":145},{"uri":"Wireless_Router","surface_form":"wireless Router","offset":220},{"uri":"Bluetooth","surface_form":"Bluetooth","offset":455}]}
