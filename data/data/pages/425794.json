Ross released his debut album Port Of Miami through the label later that year, debuting at the top spot on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, with sales of 187,000 units during the first week. Ross released his second studio album, \"Trilla\" in 2008, once again debuting atop the \"Billboard\" 200.\nIn 2009, Ross founded the record label Maybach Music Group, on which he released his studio albums \"Deeper Than Rap\" (2009), \"Teflon Don\" (2010), \"God Forgives, I Don't\" (2012), \"Mastermind\", \"Hood Billionaire\" (2014), \"Black Market\" (2015), and \"Rather You Than Me\" (2017).
