{"id":425950,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_house","text":"=\"preserve\">Hell houses are attractions normally run by Christian churches. They show sin, the torture of the damned in hell, and usually end with a depiction of heaven. They are normally run on Halloween.\nA hell house is like a haunted house attraction. It is a building used for actors attempting to frighten people with gruesome exhibits and scenes. They are presented as a series of short vignettes with a guide. Unlike haunted houses, hell houses focus on the effects of sin or the fate of unrepentant sinners in the afterlife. They occur during the month of October to take advantage of the similarities between hell houses and haunted houses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":56},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":86},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":120},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"heaven","offset":162},{"uri":"Halloween","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":195},{"uri":"Haunted_house","surface_form":"haunted house","offset":229},{"uri":"Gruesome","surface_form":"gruesome","offset":323},{"uri":"Vignette","surface_form":"vignette","offset":393},{"uri":"Afterlife","surface_form":"afterlife","offset":522},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":564}]}
