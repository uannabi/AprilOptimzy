It was fought over who had the right to be king of Spain after the previous king, Charles II, died childless. France wanted Philip of Anjou, a relative of its king, to rule. Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and other states wanted to prevent France from becoming more powerful.\nThe war was mostly fought in Europe but battles also happened in the West Indies, South America, and North America. In North America, it was called Queen Anne's War, since the ruler of Great Britain was Queen Anne. The war ended in Philip of Anjou ultimately winning and becoming the next king of Spain known as Philip V. Britain and its allies accepted Philip as King of Spain, who gave up his right to be king also of France. Austria got most of Spanish Italy, and Britain got Spanish Menorca and Gibraltar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":53},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":144},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":203},{"uri":"Philip_V_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip of Anjou","offset":217},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":267},{"uri":"Dutch_Republic","surface_form":"Dutch Republic","offset":286},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":441},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":454},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":473},{"uri":"Queen_Anne%27s_War","surface_form":"Queen Anne's War","offset":520},{"uri":"Anne_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Queen Anne","offset":575},{"uri":"Austrian_Empire","surface_form":"Austria","offset":800},{"uri":"Menorca","surface_form":"Menorca","offset":859},{"uri":"Gibraltar","surface_form":"Gibraltar","offset":871}]}
