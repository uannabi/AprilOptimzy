{"id":42665,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-optical_drive","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Magneto-optical drive is a disk drive for computers. It can read and write data to magneto-optical disks. The technology was made at the end of the 1980s. Both 5.25\" and 3.5\" media exist. The disks look like CD-ROMs, but they are protected with a plastic cover. The MiniDisc is a Magneto-optical disk. The other disks look similar but have a bigger physical size.\nHow it works.\nThe operating system sees (and uses) the disk like a normal hard-drive. 3.5\" disks can hold between 128 megabytes (MB) and 2.3 gigabytes (GB) of data. 5.25\" disks hold between 650 MB and 16.7 GB.\nResistance.\nAll disks have a physical write protection switch (like 3.5\" floppy disks). They are pretty resistant to data change, can support temperatures up to about 100\u00A0\u00B0C, and do not care much about light.\nDVD-RAM disks are very similar in appearance, they are optical though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disk_drive","surface_form":"disk drive","offset":42},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":57},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":125},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":163},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"\"","offset":179},{"uri":"CD-ROM","surface_form":"CD-ROM","offset":223},{"uri":"MiniDisc","surface_form":"MiniDisc","offset":281},{"uri":"Megabyte","surface_form":"megabyte","offset":497},{"uri":"Gigabyte","surface_form":"gigabyte","offset":520},{"uri":"Floppy_disk","surface_form":"floppy disk","offset":662},{"uri":"DVD-RAM","surface_form":"DVD-RAM","offset":798}]}
