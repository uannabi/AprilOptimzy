The Princess of Conti by marriage, she died in childbirth at the age of twenty. Some sources refer to her as \"Louis Diane\". The princess used the name Louise.\nBiography.\nLouise Diane d'Orl\u00E9ans was born in the Palais-Royal, the Paris residence of the House of Orl\u00E9ans, on 27 June 1716 as the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Orl\u00E9ans. Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate was her fathers mother and was not impressed at the thought of having another granddaughter\nUntil her marriage, she was known as \"Mademoiselle de Chartres \". known as \"Mademoiselle de Chartres\". She grew up with her younger sister \u00C9lisabeth with a convent education. Her sister would later become the Queen of Spain.\nLouise grew up in an era when her father, known as \"Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans\" or simply \"le R\u00E9gent\" was the ruler of France, him being in charge of the affairs of state since the death of Louis XIV. The Palais-Royal was where the R\u00E9gent held his court and lived openly with his mistress.\nIn her youth, she was said to have been a very sensitive child and would grow up to be one of the more beautiful of the Regent's daughters. Despite her being another girl, (1 of 7 overall), her birth was not really greeted with the joy that had met her brother, Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans.\nIn December 1731, it was decided that she should marry her distant cousin Louis Fran\u00E7ois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti. Her marriage was arranged by her mother Fran\u00E7oise Marie, \"Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00E9ans\" and her first cousin (and subsequent mother in law) Louise \u00C9lisabeth, \"Dowager Princess of Conti\".\nShe was baptised on 19 January 1732 by the Cardinal of Rohan and she married the Prince of Conti three days later, on 22 January. The marriage ceremony took place at the Palace of Versailles. Louise was then fifteen years old. At her wedding, her cousin \u00C9lisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon held her train.\nAfter the marriage, she became known at court as Her Serene Highness, the Princess of Conti. Her husband had succeeded to the Conti title in 1727 upon the death of his father, Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti. In 1734, Louise gave birth to a son, heir to the Conti name, and, in 1736, to a second child who died at birth.\nLouise died in childbirth on 26 September 1736 outside Paris. She was buried at the Saint-Andr\u00E9-des-Arcs church. Her only surviving son, Louis Fran\u00E7ois Joseph, was the last Prince of Conti.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippe_II%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":80},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7oise_Marie_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7oise Marie de Bourbon","offset":174},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV of France","offset":245},{"uri":"Madame_de_Montespan","surface_form":"Madame de Montespan","offset":283},{"uri":"Princess_of_Conti","surface_form":"Princess of Conti","offset":308},{"uri":"House_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"House of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":554},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Charlotte_of_the_Palatinate","surface_form":"Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate","offset":646},{"uri":"Louise_%C3%89lisabeth_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"\u00C9lisabeth","offset":915},{"uri":"Louis_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":1545},{"uri":"Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_Prince_of_Conti","surface_form":"Louis Fran\u00E7ois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti","offset":1653},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7oise_Marie_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7oise Marie, \"Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00E9ans\"","offset":1737},{"uri":"Louise_%C3%89lisabeth_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise \u00C9lisabeth, \"Dowager Princess of Conti\"","offset":1835},{"uri":"Armand_Gaston_Maximilien_de_Rohan","surface_form":"Cardinal of Rohan","offset":1925},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Palace of Versailles","offset":2052},{"uri":"%C3%89lisabeth_Alexandrine_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"\u00C9lisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon","offset":2136},{"uri":"Serene_Highness","surface_form":"Her Serene Highness","offset":2234},{"uri":"Louis_Armand_II%2C_Prince_of_Conti","surface_form":"Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti","offset":2361},{"uri":"Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph%2C_Prince_of_Conti","surface_form":"Louis Fran\u00E7ois Joseph","offset":2644},{"uri":"Princes_of_Conti","surface_form":"Prince of Conti","offset":2680}]}
