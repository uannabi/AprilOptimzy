{"id":426818,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljungby","text":"Ljungby is an urban area in the county of Kronoberg in Sweden. It is the seat of Ljungby Municipality. In 2015 there lived 15,785 people in Ljungby.\n11th century to 1828, before Ljugby became a town.\nThe first know persons to live in the area around Ljungby was Astrad and G\u00F6trad. Astrad and G\u00F6trad lived during the Viking Age in the 11th century. We know about them because G\u00F6trad made a runestone, The Repl\u00F6sa Stone, for his dead father Astrad.\nThe first stone church was built in during the 12th century. It was built with the creation of Ljungby parish.\nIn the 14th century an inn was built in Ljungby by order of the king. They built it because Ljungby lies were two big trade routes cross.\nDuring the 17th and 18th century the inn was owned by a woman named M\u00E4rta Ljungberg. M\u00E4rta Ljungberg earned a lot of money from the inn. She used some of the money to buy twelve other farms. The town of Ljungby would later be built on these twelve farms.\nIn the beginning of the 19th century there was a need of a town in Sunnerbo hundred. There were two places that would fit a town. One was Berga and the other was Ljungby. Berga had got permission to form a town during the 13th century, but the town had never been formed. Ljungby was located more central in Sunnerbo hundred and had better road connections. In the end it was decided that the town should be built in Ljungby.\n1828 to today, the town Ljungby.\nSometime between 1828 and 1830 the area known as Ljungby was made into a \"frik\u00F6ping\". A \"frik\u00F6ping\" is a type of smaller town, but it does not have the same town privileges as a formal town. The new town Ljungby was founded on the ground donated by M\u00E4rta Ljungberg.\nIn 1878 the first railroad was built in Ljungby. The railroad went from Vislanda, via Ljungby, to Bolmen. After some years it had been connected with other railroads and went to Karlshamn in east and to Halmstad in west. In 1899 the north-south railroad \"Sk\u00E5ne\u2013Sm\u00E5lands Railroad\" opened.\nDuring the 20th century Ljungby expanded with the help of workshops and wood industry. The biggest expansion was between 1940 and 1960.\nIn 1953, during the night between 4 July and 5 July, there was a big town fire in Ljungby. The fire had damaged twenty buildings. Thirty families became homeless and 96 persons lost their job.\nIn 1970 the \"Karlshamn\u2013Vislanda\u2013Bolmens Railroad\" was closed down. Less and less cargo was being transported by train and was instead replaced by lorries.\nThe last train in Ljungby passed in 1997 when the cargo route Helmershus-Ljungby ended. After the railroad was removed, much of the former tracks have been converted into bicycle paths.\nThe first college in Ljungby opened in 2002, H\u00F6gskolecentrum Ljungby. It cooperates with the three nearby universities Linnaeus University, J\u00F6nk\u00F6ping University, and Halmstad University.\nCulture.\nLjungby have been the home of several cultural persons. Among others, the cinematographer Gunnar Fischer and the writers Folke Fridell, Lennart Williams, and S\u00F6lve Rydell. Ljungby does also have two museums, a library, a theater, and a cinema.\nThe Ljungberg Museum.\nLjungbergmuseet, or \"The Ljungberg Museum\" in English, is a museum with paintings in Ljungby. The museum do always show paintings and other art pieces by Sven Ljungberg and his wife Ann Margret Dahlquist-Ljungberg. They do also show other temporary exhibitions by other artists.\nThe museum was built in 1990 and was made bigger in 2002. The museum was designed by the architect Pontus Ljungberg. Pontus Ljungberg is the son of Sven Ljungberg and Ann Margret Dahlquist-Ljungberg.\nIn 2012 it was decided that the museum should become Kronoberg's official museum of visual art.\nThe Museum of Legends.\nSagomuseet, or \"The Museum of Legends\" in English, is a museum about folklore in Ljungby. The museum show old legends and fairytales that have been told around Ljungby and Kronoberg. The museum have also put up signs around Kronoberg that tell stories about the location.\nEvery year the museum have a storytelling festival, Ber\u00E4ttarfestivalen. During \"Ber\u00E4ttarfestivalen\" people gather to listen to storytellers from around the world.\nIn 2013 the owners of \"The Museum of Legends\", the \"Storytelling Network Kronoberg,\" became an advisor to Swedish UNESCO about the intangible cultural heritage.\nLjungby library.\nLjungby kommunbibliotek, or \"Ljungby library\" in English, is visited by 500 to 800 people per day. The library also haves a caf\u00E9 and a small art gallery. The library was built in 1982, but there have been other libraries in Ljungby since 1920.\nLjungby library is responsible for smaller libraries in Lagan, Ryssby, and Lidhult.
