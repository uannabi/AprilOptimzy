The end of his reign marked the start of British East India Company's rule over Bengal and later almost all of South Asia.\nEarly years.\nMirza Muhammad Siraj-ud-Daulah was the grandson of Nawab Alivardi Khan and son of Amina Begum and Zainuddin Ahmed Khan. He was born in 1733 and soon after his birth Alivardi Khan appointed as the deputy governor of Bihar. So Siraj-ud-Daula was regarded as a \"fortune child\" in the family and his grandfather had special affection and favour for him. It is stated that Alivardi had given his heart to Siraj ud Daula from the day of his birth and \"never kept him apart from himself\".\nReign as Nawab.\nSiraj ud-Daulah received the title of \"Mansur-ul-Mulk, Seraj-ud-Daulla, Ghaseti Begum\"(Victory of the Country, Light of the State, Horror in War). He was to succeed as the Nawab of Bengal in April 1756 AD at the age of twenty seven. Siraj ud-Daulah's nomination to the nawabship caused jealousy and enmity of \"Mehar-un-nisa Begum\" or \"Ghaseti Begum\"(eldest sister of Siraj's Mother Amina Begum), Raja Rajballabh, Mir Jafar Ali Khan and \"Shaukat Jang\"(Siraj's Cousin). Ghaseti Begum possessed huge wealth, which was the source of her influence and strength. On Perceiving serious opposition from her, Siraj ud-Daulah seized her wealth from Moti Jheel Palace and placed her in confinement. The \"nawab\" also made certain changes in high government positions giving them to his own favorites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["monarch"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nawab_of_Bengal","surface_form":"Nawab of Bengal","offset":121},{"uri":"British_East_India_Company","surface_form":"British East India Company","offset":179},{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":218},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":249}]}
