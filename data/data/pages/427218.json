{"id":427218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution","text":"Electric power distribution is the delivery system of electricity to places that use it, such as homes and other buildings. It is done mainly by power lines, transformers, substations and meters. The electricity comes from the power station at high voltage and is delivered at medium to low voltage levels.\nIn early days, electricity was distributed as direct current (DC). Alternating current (AC) was later introduced during the War of Currents. DC distribution disappeared because transformers can easily convert AC to high voltage for electric power transmission and low voltage to use at home.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":54},{"uri":"Home","surface_form":"home","offset":97},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":113},{"uri":"Power_line","surface_form":"power line","offset":145},{"uri":"Transformer","surface_form":"transformer","offset":158},{"uri":"Electrical_substation","surface_form":"substations","offset":172},{"uri":"Electricity_meter","surface_form":"meters","offset":188},{"uri":"Power_station","surface_form":"power station","offset":227},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":291},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"direct current","offset":353},{"uri":"Alternating_current","surface_form":"Alternating current","offset":374},{"uri":"War_of_Currents","surface_form":"War of Currents","offset":431},{"uri":"Transformer","surface_form":"transformer","offset":484},{"uri":"Electric_power_transmission","surface_form":"electric power transmission","offset":539}]}
