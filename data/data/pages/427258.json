The couple purchased a land beside their shop to build a mosque. After collecting all of the money needed to make the mosque, the mosque was finally constructed and opened on 9 June 2013.\nThe establishment of the mosque shows that the number of Muslim is growing in Taiwan, where many of them work in factories, shops or houses.
