Arnulf was made archbishop of Reims in 988 by Hugh Capet of France. Arnulf was the nephew of the King's bitter rival, Charles of Lorraine and considered Arnulf a turncoat. He demanded his deposition by John XV. Hugh Capet captured both Charles and Archbishop Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991. He deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Abbot Gerbert of Aurillac who would later be known as Pope Silvester II.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"pope","offset":35},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":47},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":121},{"uri":"Papal_States","surface_form":"Papal States","offset":127},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":165},{"uri":"Papal_States","surface_form":"Papal States","offset":171},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":185},{"uri":"Arnulf_(archbishop_of_Reims)","surface_form":"Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims","offset":290},{"uri":"Hugh_Capet_of_France","surface_form":"Hugh Capet of France","offset":365},{"uri":"Charles%2C_Duke_of_Lower_Lorraine","surface_form":"Charles of Lorraine","offset":437},{"uri":"Pope_Silvester_II","surface_form":"Pope Silvester II","offset":727}]}
