{"id":427373,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Hotel%2C_Tokyo","text":"The Imperial Hotel, Tokyo is a hotel in Tokyo. It was built in the late 1880s at the request of the Japanese aristocracy to increase Western visitors to Japan. It was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The hotel site is located just south of the Imperial Palace grounds, next to the previous location of the Palace moat.\nThe modern hotel overlooks the Palace, the western-style Hibiya Park, and the Ginza neighborhood. Three buildings have stood on the hotel site, each of which embodied the finest western design of its era. The hotel eventually slipped into decay as time took its toll. In a controversial decision, it was decided to demolish the old hotel and replace it with a high-rise structure, to maximize the use of land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":31},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":40},{"uri":"Aristocracy","surface_form":"aristocracy","offset":109},{"uri":"Western_civilization","surface_form":"Western","offset":133},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":153},{"uri":"Frank_Lloyd_Wright","surface_form":"Frank Lloyd Wright","offset":179},{"uri":"Tokyo_Imperial_Palace","surface_form":"Imperial Palace","offset":243},{"uri":"Hibiya_Park","surface_form":"Hibiya Park","offset":375},{"uri":"Ginza","surface_form":"Ginza","offset":396}]}
