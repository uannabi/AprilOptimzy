{"id":427405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Royal","text":"The \"Palais Royal\" is a building in Paris. It was once a palace of the French royal family. It was built in the 1630s by Cardinal Richelieu to hold his art collection. When Richelieu died in 1642, it became the property of the young King Louis XIV. It was successively the property of the Dukes of Orl\u00E9ans and later Marie Antoinette before being destroyed in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War.\nFrom 1649, the exiled Henrietta Maria of France and her daughter Princess Henrietta lived here. The two had escaped England during the English Civil War. They were sheltered here by King Louis XIV, who was Henrietta Maria's nephew.\nIn 1692, when the Duke of Chartres (future Regent of France) married Fran\u00E7oise Marie de Bourbon, the King gave the Palais Royal to his brother, Philippe of France, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, \"Monsieur\".\nLouis Philippe I, future King of the French, was born here. He was the son of the young Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9 and his wife Louise Marie Ad\u00E9la\u00EFde de Bourbon.\nLouise Henriette de Bourbon also died here. She was married to Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans. The future Louis Philippe I was also born here.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":36},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":57},{"uri":"Royal_family","surface_form":"royal family","offset":78},{"uri":"Cardinal_Richelieu","surface_form":"Cardinal Richelieu","offset":121},{"uri":"King_of_France","surface_form":"King","offset":233},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":238},{"uri":"Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Dukes of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":289},{"uri":"Marie_Antoinette","surface_form":"Marie Antoinette","offset":316},{"uri":"Franco-Prussian_War","surface_form":"Franco-Prussian War","offset":375},{"uri":"Henrietta_Maria_of_France","surface_form":"Henrietta Maria of France","offset":418},{"uri":"Henrietta_of_England","surface_form":"Princess Henrietta","offset":461},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"English Civil War","offset":531},{"uri":"Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Regent_of_France","surface_form":"Duke of Chartres (future Regent of France)","offset":646},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7oise_Marie_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7oise Marie de Bourbon","offset":697},{"uri":"Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Philippe of France, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, \"Monsieur\"","offset":772},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe_I","surface_form":"Louis Philippe I","offset":821},{"uri":"Philippe_%C3%89galit%C3%A9","surface_form":"Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9","offset":909},{"uri":"Louise_Marie_Ad%C3%A9la%C3%AFde_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise Marie Ad\u00E9la\u00EFde de Bourbon","offset":939},{"uri":"Louise_Henriette_de_Bourbon","surface_form":"Louise Henriette de Bourbon","offset":973},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":1036},{"uri":"Louis_Philippe_I","surface_form":"Louis Philippe I","offset":1080}]}
