It is considered an important work in modern feminism. In the book Butler talks about her theory of gender performativity, which is that gender, along with sex and sexuality, is something you \"perform\" rather than an expression of human biology. In other politics, she has supported Palestine and the Democratic Party, including Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.\nEarly life.\nButler was born in Ohio and went to Hebrew school. She studied at Bennington College in the 70s before moving on to study philosophy at Yale University.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":83},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":124},{"uri":"Berkeley%2C_California","surface_form":"Berkeley, California","offset":162},{"uri":"Wendy_Brown","surface_form":"Wendy Brown","offset":201},{"uri":"Routledge","surface_form":"Routledge","offset":265},{"uri":"Feminism","surface_form":"feminism","offset":321},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":366},{"uri":"Gender_performativity","surface_form":"gender performativity","offset":376},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":413},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":531},{"uri":"Palestine_(region)","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":559},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":577},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton","surface_form":"Hillary Clinton","offset":605},{"uri":"Kamala_Harris","surface_form":"Kamala Harris","offset":625},{"uri":"Hebrew_school","surface_form":"Hebrew school","offset":688},{"uri":"Bennington_College","surface_form":"Bennington College","offset":718},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"the 70s","offset":740},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":788}]}
