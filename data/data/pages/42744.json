{"id":42744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle","text":"An assault rifle is a rifle that has a removable magazine, automatic-fire and semi-automatic modes, and uses intermediate cartridges. These cartridges do not have as much power as other rifles\u2019, like hunting rifles or battle rifles, but have more power and penetration than pistol cartridges fired by sub-machine guns.\nTwo rifles made in Italy and Russia before World War I are sometimes called assault rifles. The Germans were the first to use assault rifles in large numbers.\nExamples of an 'assault rifle' are the English L85, Russian AK-47, the American M16.\nThe term \u201Cassault rifle\u201D comes from the firearm Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44), translated to \u201CAssault Rifle 1944\u201D. The armed forces of other sovereign states adopted assault rifles later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":22},{"uri":"Magazine_(firearms)","surface_form":"magazine","offset":49},{"uri":"Intermediate_cartridge","surface_form":"intermediate cartridges","offset":109},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"cartridges","offset":140},{"uri":"Battle_rifle","surface_form":"battle rifles","offset":218},{"uri":"Submachine_gun","surface_form":"sub-machine gun","offset":301},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":338},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":348},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":362},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germans","offset":415},{"uri":"SA80","surface_form":"L85","offset":525},{"uri":"AK-47","surface_form":"AK-47","offset":538},{"uri":"M16_rifle","surface_form":"M16","offset":558},{"uri":"Armed_forces","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":676}]}
