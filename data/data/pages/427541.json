{"id":427541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Colores","text":"e=\"preserve\">De Colores is a common folk song in the Spanish-speaking world. Today, it is the anthem of the United Farm Workers movement.\nHistory.\nNo one knows for sure when the song first began to be sung in the Americas. The melody is thought to have been used in North and South America since the 16th century, having been brought over from Spain in the colonial era. However, the version of the lyrics sung today is thought to have been created by a group of Cursillo participants in Majorca, Spain, after one of the earliest Cursillo retreats in the 1940s.\nToday, in addition to being used as the unofficial anthem of the United Farm Workers movement, and as an inspirational song in Cursillo workshops, the song is often taught in schools in the United States\u2014from elementary school to community colleges\u2014as an example of a common American folk song. It often appears in collections of children's songs.\nCommon song words.\n\"De colores\" is usually sung in Spanish, but there are different English translations of the song.
