However, Wu speakers are similar to speakers of Spanish and French because they can not always understand each other. In fact, the name Wu is mainly used by people who study languages.\nThere are various subgroups of the Wu dialect.\nLike other types of Chinese, the Wu dialects are starting to be replaced by Mandarin as time goes on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chinese_languages","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":17},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":25},{"uri":"Shanghai","surface_form":"Shanghai","offset":60},{"uri":"Chiang_Kai-shek","surface_form":"Chiang Kai-shek","offset":150},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"languages","offset":341},{"uri":"Mandarin_language","surface_form":"Mandarin","offset":475}]}
