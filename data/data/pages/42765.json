{"id":42765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey","text":"Alfred Charles Kinsey (June 23, 1894 August 25, 1956) was an American biologist. He was born in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nIn the first part of his career he was an entomologist specializing in gall wasps of the family Cynipidae. Later, he became famous for the research he did on human sexuality. His research had a great influence on social and cultural values in many parts of the world. It also had an influence on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s.\nKinsey and his co-workers wrote two books which became known as the Kinsey Reports. They were based on thousands of interviews with men (first report), and then women. The aim was to find out how widespread or differentiated human sexual practices were. He developed the Kinsey Scale to measure sexual orientation. On one end of the scale, at the value 0, the individual is entirely heterosexual. On the other end, at value 6, he or she has a purely homosexual orientation. Kinsey was bisexual.\nKinsey died of heart disease and pneumonia in Bloomington, Indiana.\nA biopic of him, \"Kinsey\", was released in 2004.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":70},{"uri":"Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Hoboken, New Jersey","offset":96},{"uri":"Entomologist","surface_form":"entomologist","offset":159},{"uri":"Gall_wasp","surface_form":"gall wasp","offset":188},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":206},{"uri":"Human_sexuality","surface_form":"human sexuality","offset":275},{"uri":"Sexual_revolution","surface_form":"sexual revolution","offset":417},{"uri":"Kinsey_Reports","surface_form":"Kinsey Reports","offset":525},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":752},{"uri":"Heterosexual","surface_form":"heterosexual","offset":840},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":907},{"uri":"Bisexual","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":942},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":967},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":985},{"uri":"Bloomington%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Bloomington, Indiana","offset":998},{"uri":"Biopic","surface_form":"biopic","offset":1022},{"uri":"Kinsey_(movie)","surface_form":"Kinsey","offset":1038}]}
