{"id":42773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium","text":"Niobium is a chemical element. It is sometimes named columbium. It has the chemical symbol Nb. It has the atomic number 41. It is a rare metal. Niobium is soft and grey. It is ductile. In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals. Niobium was discovered in a variety of a mineral called columbite (now called niobite). Niobite is an ore of niobium.\nNiobium is considered a \"technology-critical element\". It is used in alloys, such as to make special steels and strong welded joints. Less than 0.1% of Niobium significantly improves the strength of steel. It is in the superconducting alloys used in MRI scanners, which are one of the most important medical inventions of the modern age.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":13},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":106},{"uri":"Rare","surface_form":"rare","offset":132},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":137},{"uri":"Ductile","surface_form":"ductile","offset":176},{"uri":"Transition_metal","surface_form":"transition metal","offset":250},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":310},{"uri":"Niobite","surface_form":"niobite","offset":347},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":371},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":456},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":488},{"uri":"Welding","surface_form":"welded joints","offset":506},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":586},{"uri":"Superconduction","surface_form":"superconducting","offset":606},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":622},{"uri":"MRI","surface_form":"MRI","offset":637},{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":687},{"uri":"Inventions","surface_form":"inventions","offset":695}]}
