{"id":427815,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load_power_plant","text":"A base load power plant is a power station that usually provides a continuous supply of electricity throughout the year with some minimum power generation requirement. Base load power plants will only be turned off during periodic maintenance, upgrading, overhaul or service. Base load power plant has the character of slow demand respond, a mechanism to match generation with the load it supplies.\nExamples of base load power plants are coal-fired power plant, geothermal power plant, tidal power plant, nuclear power plant, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Power_station","surface_form":"power station","offset":29},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":88},{"uri":"Electricity_generation","surface_form":"power generation","offset":138},{"uri":"Maintenance","surface_form":"maintenance","offset":231},{"uri":"Upgrade","surface_form":"upgrading","offset":244},{"uri":"Overhaul","surface_form":"overhaul","offset":255},{"uri":"Demand_respond","surface_form":"demand respond","offset":324},{"uri":"Electrical_load","surface_form":"load","offset":381},{"uri":"Coal-fired_power_plant","surface_form":"coal-fired power plant","offset":438},{"uri":"Geothermal_power_plant","surface_form":"geothermal power plant","offset":462},{"uri":"Tidal_power_plant","surface_form":"tidal power plant","offset":486},{"uri":"Nuclear_power_plant","surface_form":"nuclear power plant","offset":505}]}
