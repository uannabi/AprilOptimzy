{"id":427826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun","text":"Ab\u016B Ja\u02BFfar Abdull\u0101h al-Ma\u02BEm\u016Bn ibn Har\u016Bn (also spelled Almamon, Al-Maymun, Al-Ma\u2019moon, and el-M\u00E2mo\u00FBn; 13 September 786 \u2013 9 August 833) was an Abbasid caliph. He reigned from 813 until his death in 833.\nAl-Ma\u2019mun was born on 13 September 786 AD in Baghdad. His father was Harun al-Rashid, who was an Abbasid caliph. He was a member of the third dynasty of the descendants of Muhammad who were caliphs of Islam. While his father ruled, al-Ma\u2019mun was the governor of Khorasan. After al-Ma\u2019mun was born his father had another son named al-Amin. Before his father died he announced that al-Amin would be the new caliph and al-Ma\u2019mun would continue to be the governor of Khorasan even though al-Ma\u2019mun was older. When Harun al-Rashid died and al-Amin became the caliph, he took away al-Ma\u2019mun's ability to inherit the throne after he died. The two brothers went to war against each other. Al-Ma\u2019mun defeated al-Amin. He cut off al-Amin's head. Since al-Amin had no other heir to the throne, al-Ma\u2019mun became the new caliph.\nDuring his reign al-Ma\u2019mun tried to reunite Sunnis and Shiites. These are the two main brances of Islam that have different beliefs on who should lead Islam. Al-Ma\u2019mun opened many learning centers in his empire. One big one was in Baghdad, which was called the House of Wisdom. Many other libraries and schools were built all over the empire. He was also a big sponsor of philosophy and astronomy.\nHe had one wife who he tried to divorce. However, his wife got a powerful judge who refused to allow the divorce. He had no children and no heirs with this wife. Instead, he chose another woman to provide an heir.\nAl-Ma\u2019mun died on August 9, 833. He remained caliph until his death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abbasid_Caliphate","surface_form":"Abbasid","offset":141},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"caliph","offset":149},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":246},{"uri":"Harun_al-Rashid","surface_form":"Harun al-Rashid","offset":270},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":373},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":402},{"uri":"Khorasan","surface_form":"Khorasan","offset":463},{"uri":"Sunni","surface_form":"Sunni","offset":1061},{"uri":"Shiite","surface_form":"Shiite","offset":1072},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":1447},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":1489}]}
