This book contains a lot about her life at the imperial court and her feelings.

It revealed an interesting view on life at court.\nThe name \"Pillow Book\" came from an event where the empress was given a bundle of notebooks. The empress did not know what to use the notebooks for so Sei Sh\u014Dnagon asked Empress Sadako if she could have them. Sei Sh\u014Dnagon told the empress that she wanted to use them to make a pillow.\nThe book has about 320 entries. She also wrote lists in her diaries. There are about 164 lists. Some of the lists that were included in her diary were: \"Depressing things\" and \"Things that arouse a fond memory of the past\".

Some people believe that a copy of Sei Sh\u014Dnagon's book was given to Empress Sadako's daughter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":6},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":15},{"uri":"Lady-in-waiting","surface_form":"court lady","offset":33},{"uri":"Fujiwara_no_Teishi","surface_form":"Empress Teishi","offset":59},{"uri":"Heian_period","surface_form":"Heian period","offset":101},{"uri":"Diary","surface_form":"diaries","offset":166},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":178},{"uri":"CE","surface_form":"CE","offset":265},{"uri":"Imperial_Court_in_Kyoto","surface_form":"imperial court","offset":484},{"uri":"Feelings","surface_form":"feelings","offset":507},{"uri":"Gossip","surface_form":"gossip","offset":554},{"uri":"Observation","surface_form":"observation","offset":565},{"uri":"Notebook","surface_form":"notebook","offset":850},{"uri":"Pillow","surface_form":"pillow","offset":1045}]}
