{"id":427903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_laws_of_electrolysis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Faraday's laws of electrolysis are a set of scientific laws used in chemistry. They are used to express magnitudes of electrolytic effects. They were first described by Michael Faraday in 1834.\nThe first law states that the mass of a substance produced by electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of the electricity that passes through the cell.\nThe second law says: since Q, F, and z are constants, the larger the value of M/z (equivalent weight) the larger m will be.\nMathematical form.\nFaraday's laws can be summarized by\n\"M/z\" is the same as the equivalent weight of the substance altered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scientific_law","surface_form":"scientific law","offset":57},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":81},{"uri":"Magnitude","surface_form":"magnitude","offset":117},{"uri":"Electrolysis","surface_form":"electrolytic effects","offset":131},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":182},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":237},{"uri":"Chemical_substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":247},{"uri":"Proportion","surface_form":"proportion","offset":294},{"uri":"Quantity","surface_form":"quantity","offset":314},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":330},{"uri":"Electrolytic_cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":366},{"uri":"Constant","surface_form":"constant","offset":415},{"uri":"Equivalent_weight","surface_form":"equivalent weight","offset":455},{"uri":"Equivalent_weight","surface_form":"equivalent weight","offset":576}]}
