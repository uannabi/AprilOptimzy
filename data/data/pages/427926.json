{"id":427926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Center","text":"Enterprise Center is a sports arena in St. Louis, Missouri. The arena opened on October 8, 1994, and is the current home to the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena was also home to Saint Louis University's men's basketball team from 1991 to 2008.\nThe arena was originally known as Kiel Center from 1994 to 2000 and Savvis Center from Aug 2000 to 2006. Scottrade acquired naming rights for the arena in September 2006.\nThe Scottrade Center has held many WWE events as well including:, Survivor Series in 1998, the special live tribute episode of WWF Raw is War that aired after the night of Owen Hart's death, No Mercy in 2001, Judgment Day in 2007, Elimination Chamber in 2010, Royal Rumble in 2012 and Extreme Rules in 2013.\nThe arena was initially expected to be renamed as the TD Ameritrade Center by the end of 2017, once the purchase of Scottrade by TD Ameritrade closed. However, TD Ameritrade decided not to put its name on the arena. The team later reached a new deal with Enterprise Holdings, a company based in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton, Missouri that owns the Enterprise, National, and Alamo car rental companies. The deal was announced on May 21, 2018, with the name officially changing to Enterprise Center on July 1 of that year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":23},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":30},{"uri":"St._Louis","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":39},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":50},{"uri":"October_8","surface_form":"October 8","offset":80},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":91},{"uri":"St._Louis_Blues","surface_form":"St. Louis Blues","offset":128},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":151},{"uri":"Saint_Louis_University","surface_form":"Saint Louis University","offset":208},{"uri":"Scottrade","surface_form":"Scottrade","offset":379},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":480},{"uri":"Survivor_Series_(1998)","surface_form":"Survivor Series","offset":511},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"WWF Raw is War","offset":572},{"uri":"Owen_Hart","surface_form":"Owen Hart","offset":617},{"uri":"No_Mercy_(2001)","surface_form":"No Mercy","offset":636},{"uri":"Judgment_Day_(2007)","surface_form":"Judgment Day","offset":654},{"uri":"Elimination_Chamber_(2010)","surface_form":"Elimination Chamber","offset":676},{"uri":"Royal_Rumble_(2012)","surface_form":"Royal Rumble","offset":705},{"uri":"Extreme_Rules_(2013)","surface_form":"Extreme Rules","offset":730},{"uri":"TD_Ameritrade","surface_form":"TD Ameritrade","offset":882},{"uri":"Clayton%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Clayton, Missouri","offset":1072}]}
