{"id":428,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof","text":"Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof (;,; \u2013), credited as L. L. Zamenhof and sometimes as the pseudonymous Dr. Esperanto, was an eye doctor, linguist (who creates a language), and scholar who created the international language Esperanto.\nBiography.\nZamenhof was born in 1859 in the town of Bia\u0142ystok, Poland. At the time, Poland was a part of the Russian Empire. Bialystok contained three major groups: Poles, Belorussians, and Yiddish-speaking Jews. Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them.\nHis first language was said to be Polish. His parents spoke Russian and Yiddish at home. His father was a German teacher, so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age and spoke the language fluently. Later he learned French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and English. He also had an interest in Italian, Spanish and Lithuanian.\nZamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than Volap\u00FCk, an earlier international language. He attempted to create the international language with a grammar that was rich, and complex. The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887.\nHis grandson, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof, was an engineer.\nHe was 14 times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize between 1907 and 1917.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":115},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":166},{"uri":"International_auxiliary_language","surface_form":"international language","offset":190},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":213},{"uri":"Bia%C5%82ystok","surface_form":"Bia\u0142ystok","offset":276},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":287},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":431},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":567},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":593},{"uri":"Yiddish","surface_form":"Yiddish","offset":605},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":639},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":757},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":765},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":772},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":779},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":790},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":826},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":835},{"uri":"Lithuanian_language","surface_form":"Lithuanian","offset":847},{"uri":"Volap%C3%BCk","surface_form":"Volap\u00FCk","offset":963},{"uri":"Attempt","surface_form":"attempted","offset":1010},{"uri":"Rich","surface_form":"rich","offset":1081},{"uri":"Complex","surface_form":"complex","offset":1091},{"uri":"Louis-Christophe_Zaleski-Zamenhof","surface_form":"Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof","offset":1162},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":1248},{"uri":"1907","surface_form":"1907","offset":1274},{"uri":"1917","surface_form":"1917","offset":1283}]}
