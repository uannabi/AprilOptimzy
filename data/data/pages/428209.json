{"id":428209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ramsay","text":"Sir William Ramsay KCB FRS (William Ramsay, Jr.; 2 October 1852 \u2013 23 July 1916) was a Scottish chemist. Ramsay discovered the noble gases. He also helped discover several elements that are on our periodic table today. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 \"in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air\" (along with Lord Rayleigh).\nEarly life.\nRamsay was born in Glasgow on 2 October 1852. He was a nephew of the geologist Sir Andrew Ramsay. His father, William, Sr., was a civil engineer. His mother was Catherine Robertson. He studied at Glasgow Academy, at the University of Glasgow and at University of T\u00FCbingen in Germany.\nRamsay went back to Glasgow as an assistant at the Anderson College. He found a job as Professor of chemistry at the University College of Bristol in 1879.\nCareer.\nOn the evening of 19 April 1894 Ramsay was at a lecture given by Lord Rayleigh. Rayleigh had noticed a difference between the density of nitrogen made by chemical synthesis and nitrogen isolated from the air by removal of the other known components. He named the gas responsible for this difference \"argon\".\nHe was working with Morris Travers, when he discovered neon, krypton, and xenon. He also isolated helium. In 1910, he also created and characterized radon. In 1904, Ramsay received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nRamsay discovered all six elements that are in the noble gas group on the periodic table.\nPersonal life.\nRamsay was married to Margaret Buchanan in 1881. They had one daughter, Catherine, and one son, William George. William George died when he was 40.\nDeath.\nRamsay lived in Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire until his death. He died in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire on 23 July 1916 from nasal cancer (nose cancer). He died at the age of 63. He was buried in Hazlemere Parish church.\nRecognition.\nThe Sir William Ramsay School in Hazlemere is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_Bath","surface_form":"KCB","offset":19},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":23},{"uri":"Scottish_people","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":86},{"uri":"Noble_gases","surface_form":"noble gases","offset":126},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"element","offset":171},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":196},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":234},{"uri":"Lord_Rayleigh","surface_form":"Lord Rayleigh","offset":366},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":413},{"uri":"Geologist","surface_form":"geologist","offset":463},{"uri":"Andrew_Ramsay_(geologist)","surface_form":"Sir Andrew Ramsay","offset":473},{"uri":"Glasgow_Academy","surface_form":"Glasgow Academy","offset":590},{"uri":"University_of_Glasgow","surface_form":"University of Glasgow","offset":614},{"uri":"University_of_T%C3%BCbingen","surface_form":"University of T\u00FCbingen","offset":643},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":669},{"uri":"University_of_Strathclyde","surface_form":"Anderson College","offset":729},{"uri":"University_College%2C_Bristol","surface_form":"University College of Bristol","offset":795},{"uri":"Lord_Rayleigh","surface_form":"Lord Rayleigh","offset":907},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":979},{"uri":"Chemical_synthesis","surface_form":"chemical synthesis","offset":996},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":1046},{"uri":"Argon","surface_form":"argon","offset":1142},{"uri":"Morris_Travers","surface_form":"Morris Travers","offset":1170},{"uri":"Neon","surface_form":"neon","offset":1205},{"uri":"Krypton","surface_form":"krypton","offset":1211},{"uri":"Xenon","surface_form":"xenon","offset":1224},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":1248},{"uri":"Radon","surface_form":"radon","offset":1299},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":1335},{"uri":"Hazlemere","surface_form":"Hazlemere","offset":1637},{"uri":"Buckinghamshire","surface_form":"Buckinghamshire","offset":1648},{"uri":"High_Wycombe","surface_form":"High Wycombe","offset":1692},{"uri":"Buckinghamshire","surface_form":"Buckinghamshire","offset":1706},{"uri":"Nasal_cancer","surface_form":"nasal cancer","offset":1743},{"uri":"Nose","surface_form":"nose","offset":1757},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1762},{"uri":"Parish_church","surface_form":"Parish church","offset":1824},{"uri":"Sir_William_Ramsay_School","surface_form":"Sir William Ramsay School","offset":1856},{"uri":"Hazlemere","surface_form":"Hazlemere","offset":1885}]}
