{"id":428393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Lyne","text":"The Division of Lyne is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It was set up in 1949, and named for Sir William Lyne, Premier of New South Wales at the time of Federation and a minister in early Australian governments. Lyne was asked by the first Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun to form the first Federal Government. Lyne did not have the support of other politicians, and so Edmund Barton became the first Prime Minister of Australia.\nThe division is on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales. It includes Port Macquarie, Taree, Wauchope, Laurieton, Wingham, Gloucester and parts of Kempsey.\nMembers.\nMark Vaile was the leader of the National Party, and Deputy Prime Minister. He retired in July 2008 which caused a by-election. Independent politician Rob Oakeshott won the seat, and after the 2010 election was one of the independents who supported a minority Labor government led by Julia Gillard. Oakeshott retired at the 2013 election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian electoral division","offset":27},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":64},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":73},{"uri":"William_Lyne","surface_form":"William Lyne","offset":131},{"uri":"Premier_of_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Premier of New South Wales","offset":145},{"uri":"Federation_of_Australia","surface_form":"Federation","offset":187},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_Australia","surface_form":"Governor-General","offset":274},{"uri":"John_Hope%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Linlithgow","surface_form":"Lord Hopetoun","offset":292},{"uri":"Edmund_Barton","surface_form":"Edmund Barton","offset":403},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Australia","offset":434},{"uri":"Mid_North_Coast%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Mid North Coast","offset":486},{"uri":"Port_Macquarie%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Port Macquarie","offset":534},{"uri":"Taree%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Taree","offset":550},{"uri":"Wauchope%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wauchope","offset":557},{"uri":"Laurieton%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Laurieton","offset":567},{"uri":"Wingham%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Wingham","offset":578},{"uri":"Gloucester%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gloucester","offset":587},{"uri":"Kempsey%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Kempsey","offset":611},{"uri":"Mark_Vaile","surface_form":"Mark Vaile","offset":629},{"uri":"Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Deputy Prime Minister","offset":682},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":744},{"uri":"Independent_(politician)","surface_form":"Independent","offset":757},{"uri":"Rob_Oakeshott","surface_form":"Rob Oakeshott","offset":780},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Labor","offset":889},{"uri":"Julia_Gillard","surface_form":"Julia Gillard","offset":913}]}
