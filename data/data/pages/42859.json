{"id":42859,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone","text":"Persephone\u00A0(, \"Persephon\u0113\") is the goddess of the dead and queen of the\u00A0underworld in ancient Greek religion and myth. She is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter and is married to the god\u00A0Hades, with whom she rules over the souls of the dead. As a\u00A0vegetation goddess, she presided over the bounty of the harvest as it emerged during the season of spring.\nPersephone and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which promised initiates a reward in the afterlife. The tale of her being abducted by Hades, during which she was tricked into eating seeds from a pomegranate (the food of the dead), served to explain the cause of the seasons, and is one prominently featured in ancient Greek literature. Her symbols included the pomegranate, flowers and seeds of grain. The goddess Proserpina is her\u00A0Roman counterpart.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"myth","offset":113},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":142},{"uri":"Demeter","surface_form":"Demeter","offset":151},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":185},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":301},{"uri":"Demeter","surface_form":"Demeter","offset":378},{"uri":"Eleusinian_Mysteries","surface_form":"Eleusinian Mysteries","offset":418},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":526},{"uri":"Pomegranate","surface_form":"pomegranate","offset":587},{"uri":"Proserpina","surface_form":"Proserpina","offset":806}]}
