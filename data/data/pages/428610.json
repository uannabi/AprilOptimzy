{"id":428610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voortrekker_Monument","text":"The Voortrekker Monument is a monument in Pretoria in South Africa. It is a massive granite structure on a hilltop. It was built to commemorate the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854.\nMost of the Voortrekkers were not satisfied with the British government that ruled over them in the Cape in those years, that is why they packed their ox wagons and started to trek to greener valleys to the north of current South Africa.\nIt was much hardship that they had to endure for almost 20 years, both from the rural terrain as well as many hostile inhabitants they had to face. This makes the Voortrekker Monument an important structure to the white Afrikaner bloodline (children), because it shows many pictures, reliefs and statutes inside the building of what happened in the history of those years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":30},{"uri":"Pretoria","surface_form":"Pretoria","offset":42},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":54},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":84},{"uri":"Voortrekkers","surface_form":"Voortrekkers","offset":148},{"uri":"British_Cape_Colony","surface_form":"Cape Colony","offset":174}]}
