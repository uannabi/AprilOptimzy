{"id":428809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_characters","text":"Sino-Vietnamese characters () are Chinese-style characters read as either Vietnamese or as Sino-Vietnamese. When they are used to write Vietnamese, they are called N\u00F4m. The same characters may used to write Chinese. In this case, the character is given a Sino-Vietnamese, or Han-Viet, reading. Han-Viet is a system that allows Vietnamese to read Chinese. It is equivalent to pinyin in English.\nSome of these characters are also used in China; others are used only Vietnam. Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam when the Han Empire invaded the country in 111\u00A0BC. Even after Vietnam became independent in AD\u00A0939, the country continued to use Classical Chinese () for official purposes. In the 1920s, Vietnam shifted from traditional characters to the Latin alphabet. The Han-Nom Institute was founded in Hanoi in 1970 to collect and study documents written in the traditional script. The institute has submitted a list of 19,981 Sino-Vietnamese characters to Unicode for electronic encoding. This includes a core set of 9,299 characters called the N\u00F4m Ideographs.\nHistory.\nChinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the Han Empire conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but the Chinese writing system was adopted for official purposes in 1010. Soon after the country achieved independence, Vietnamese began to use Chinese characters to write their own language. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, is the earliest known example of a N\u00F4m inscription. Nguyen Thuyen composed N\u00F4m poetry in the 13th century. However, none of his work has survived. The oldest surviving N\u00F4m text is the collected poetry of King Tran Nhan Tong, written in the 13th century.\nClassical Chinese was used by the royal court and for other official purposes. The Temple of Literature in Hanoi was the best-known school for the study of Chinese. The civil service examination tested knowledge of Chinese. It was given once every three years. Students who passed the exam could go on to become magistrates. Confucian scholars saw Chinese as the language of education and looked down on N\u00F4m. Popular opinion favored N\u00F4m. Some kings thought that all writing should be done in Chinese. They suppressed N\u00F4m. Other kings promoted N\u00F4m. In 1867, King Tu Duc issued a decree encouraging the use of N\u00F4m. Only a small percentage of the population was literate in any language. But nearly every village had at least one person who could read N\u00F4m aloud for the other villagers. Jean-Louis Taberd wrote the first N\u00F4m dictionary in 1838.\nIn 1910, the colonial school system adopted a \"Franco-Vietnamese curriculum\", which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese. The Vietnamese alphabet is a form of the Latin alphabet that includes tone marks. On December 28, 1918, King Khai Dinh declared that the traditional writing system no longer had official status. The civil service exam was given for the last time at the imperial capital of Hue on January 4, 1919. The examination system, and the education system based on it, had been in effect for almost 900 years. China itself stop using Classical Chinese soon afterward as part of the May Fourth Movement.\nLanguage issues.\nChinese characters are used to write various languages in China and elsewhere, including Mandarin, the most widely spoken language in China, Cantonese, spoken in Hong Kong and southern China, and Classical Chinese, traditionally used for formal writing. The characters were formerly used in Korea and in Vietnam. Japan uses a mix of Chinese characters and two native phonetic writing systems. Even characters that retain their original meaning in all languages may be read in various ways. The character \u5341 is pronounced as \"sh\u00ED\" in Chinese romanization (pinyin), \"j\u016B\" in Japanese romanization (Hepburn), \"sip\" in Korean romanization (Revised Romanization), and \"th\u1EADp\" in the Han-Viet system used in Vietnam. In all these languages, the meaning of the character is \u201Cten.\u201D\nThe majority of the characters used in N\u00F4m are of Chinese origin, chosen because they have an appropriate pronunciation or meaning. For example, the character used to write the word \"N\u00F4m\" \u5583 is pronounced \"n\u00E1n\" in Chinese and means \u201Cchattering.\u201D The fit between the Chinese character and the Vietnamese word is not always exact. The word \"N\u00F4m\" does not have any negative connotation in Vietnamese, but rather suggests plain talk, something easy to understand.\nN\u00F4m includes thousands of characters not found in Chinese. In contrast, Japan developed only a few hundred kokuji, most of them describing plants and animals found only in Japan. Korea had just a small number of rarely used gukja. These characters were created by writers who combined pre-existing elements. One element, called the radical, indicates the character's meaning, or at least a semantic category. The other element, called the remainder, gives pronunciation. This is similar to how most Chinese characters are written. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. In contrast, Japanese and Korean can be written in phonetic scripts that do not indicate tone.\nReadings.\nWhen a character is read as Vietnamese, it is romanized according to its N\u00F4m reading. When it is read as Chinese, it can be romanized into Vietnamese as Han-Viet, or into English as pinyin. The chart below uses a darker background to display the N\u00F4m Ideographs (V0 to V3), considered to be the core N\u00F4m character set.\nEncoding.\nIn 1994, the Ideographic Rapporteur Group agreed to include Sino-Vietnamese characters in Unicode. In 1993-2001, the Han-Nom Institute assembled a collection of 9,299 \u201CN\u00F4m Ideographs\" in four sets. These are the V0, V1, V2, and V3 characters shown below. A Sino-Vietnamese character is first assigned a V Source code, and later a codepoint. These codes are used to transmit and store the character electronically. An appropriate font must be installed to render them.\nThe N\u00F4m Ideographs were extracted from two dictionaries published in the 1970s, one in Saigon and the other in Hanoi. V Source annotations were added to the glyphs that were already encoded. The rest were assigned codepoints in Extension B. \"The H\u00E1n N\u00F4m Coded Character Repertoire\" (2008) integrates the work of the Han-Nom Institute with that of the U.S.-based Vietnamese N\u00F4m Preservation Foundation. This book presents a comprehensive list of 19,981 Sino-Vietnamese characters, including the N\u00F4m Ideographs, manuscript variants, characters formerly used by the Tay people of northern Vietnam, as well as numerous Chinese characters with Han-Viet readings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chinese_characters","surface_form":"Chinese-style characters","offset":34},{"uri":"N%C3%B4m","surface_form":"N\u00F4m","offset":164},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"pinyin","offset":375},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":436},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":464},{"uri":"Han_Empire","surface_form":"Han Empire","offset":528},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":566},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":611},{"uri":"Classical_Chinese","surface_form":"Classical Chinese","offset":648},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":757},{"uri":"Hanoi","surface_form":"Hanoi","offset":810},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":965},{"uri":"Han_Empire","surface_form":"Han Empire","offset":1135},{"uri":"Temple_of_Literature","surface_form":"Temple of Literature","offset":1778},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonial","offset":2550},{"uri":"Vietnamese_alphabet","surface_form":"Vietnamese alphabet","offset":2670},{"uri":"Classical_Chinese","surface_form":"Classical Chinese","offset":3090},{"uri":"May_Fourth_Movement","surface_form":"May Fourth Movement","offset":3138},{"uri":"Mandarin","surface_form":"Mandarin","offset":3265},{"uri":"Cantonese_language","surface_form":"Cantonese","offset":3317},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"pinyin","offset":3730},{"uri":"Han-Viet","surface_form":"Han-Viet","offset":3851},{"uri":"Chinese_character","surface_form":"Chinese character","offset":4905},{"uri":"Tone_language","surface_form":"tonal language","offset":4967}]}
