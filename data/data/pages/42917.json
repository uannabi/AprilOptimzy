{"id":42917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_printer","text":"A laser printer is a printer for computers. It uses laser or LED-technology to get small particles of toner from a cartridge onto paper. Very often, this costs less to use than the ink of inkjet printers. Laser printers often print text more neatly than inkjet printers, but print photos less clearly. Printing on photo paper or coated paper designed for inkjet printers can damage the laser printer's drum and fuser unit.\nThe laser printer was first invented by a team at Xerox in 1969. The first laser printer was called the Xerox 2000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"printer","offset":21},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":33},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":52},{"uri":"LED","surface_form":"LED","offset":61},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":89},{"uri":"Toner","surface_form":"toner","offset":102},{"uri":"Ink_cartridge","surface_form":"cartridge","offset":115},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":130},{"uri":"Ink","surface_form":"ink","offset":181},{"uri":"Inkjet_printer","surface_form":"inkjet printer","offset":188},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":427},{"uri":"Invent","surface_form":"invent","offset":451},{"uri":"Xerox","surface_form":"Xerox","offset":473}]}
