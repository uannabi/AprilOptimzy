It has the atomic number 103. It is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature. It has to be made. Lawrencium is made from californium. The isotope that has the longest half-life (262Lr) has a half life of about 3.6 hours.\nNo uses for lawrencium are known. What lawrencium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight.\nIs a Block-D Group3 Period 7 element. Discovered by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers in 1961, in California. Named after Ernest O. Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a research instrument with which several new elements have been found/made.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":28},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":125},{"uri":"Radioactive","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":152},{"uri":"Californium","surface_form":"californium","offset":246},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":263},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half-life","offset":292}]}
