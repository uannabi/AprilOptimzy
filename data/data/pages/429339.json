It happened in December 1944 in the north Tuscan Apennines, near Massa and Lucca.\nIn late December 1944 the German 14th Army under General Kurt von Tippelskirch attacked the left side of the U.S. Fifth Army in the Serchio valley. He wanted to make the U.S. forces stay there.\nThe Allies had ordered two brigades from Indian 8th Infantry Division to be moved to help the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division. By the time they had arrived the Germans and Italians had captured Barga. U.S. soldiers had intended to retreat to Lucca. The German / Italian force stopped the attack and withdrew.\nBarga was recaptured one week later by the New Year. The western Gothic Line remained in place until late March 1945.\nHistorical background.\nBenito Mussolini and his Defense Minister, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, wanted to create an Italian Army. They did not want this army to be under German control. They wanted some of the newly created Italian Divisions to attack the Allies in the Italian peninsula.\nThey planned an attack in Garfagnana for two of their new Divisions. There would be 40,000 men and airplanes. Their goal was recapturing Lucca, Pisa and Livorno in Tuscany from the Allies. But the Italians lacked arms, tanks and airplanes.\nThe Germans created their own attack,\nWith 9,000 soldiers (mostly Italians), they attacked in Garfagnana a small area of the Gothic Line. They wanted to move the Allies back.\nGroups from the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division moved near Garfagnana sector in November 1944. They did not\ncapture Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.\nThe battle.\nFollowing the Ardennes Offensive in mid-December, the Allies thought the Axis might try an attack in Northern Italy.\nThe 19th and 21st Brigades of the Indian 8th Infantry Division were moved to help the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division in front of Lucca.\nOn 26 December, several RSI military did the \"Operation Winter Storm\" (Wintergewitter) attacks with three German battalions. This was a German and Italian attack against the American 92nd Infantry Division. A total of 9,100 Axis troops (of which 66% were Italians), with 100 artillery pieces but no tanks attacked. There were 18,000 Allied troops with 140 artillery batteries and 120 tanks.\nTheir goal was to capture the small towns of Barga, Sommocolonia, Vergemoli, Treppignana, Coreglia, Fornaci di Barga, Promiana, Castelvecchio and Calomini. These were all north-west of Lucca. By 27 December the attack was over. In the morning, the German troops entered Pian di Coreglia.\nThe next morning, the Axis troops occupied Piano di Coreglia. The Axis troops got more than 25\u00A0kilometres inside the Allies lines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Axis_powers","surface_form":"Axis","offset":204},{"uri":"Gothic_Line","surface_form":"Gothic Line","offset":245},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":264},{"uri":"Massa","surface_form":"Massa","offset":343},{"uri":"Lucca","surface_form":"Lucca","offset":353},{"uri":"14th_Army_(Wehrmacht)","surface_form":"German 14th Army","offset":386},{"uri":"Kurt_von_Tippelskirch","surface_form":"Kurt von Tippelskirch","offset":417},{"uri":"8th_Infantry_Division_(India)","surface_form":"Indian 8th Infantry Division","offset":595},{"uri":"Barga","surface_form":"Barga","offset":744},{"uri":"Lucca","surface_form":"Lucca","offset":792},{"uri":"Gothic_Line","surface_form":"Gothic Line","offset":924},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":1000},{"uri":"Rodolfo_Graziani","surface_form":"Rodolfo Graziani","offset":1051},{"uri":"Esercito_Nazionale_Repubblicano","surface_form":"newly created Italian Divisions","offset":1183},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allies","offset":1229},{"uri":"Garfagnana","surface_form":"Garfagnana","offset":1288},{"uri":"Lucca","surface_form":"Lucca","offset":1399},{"uri":"Pisa","surface_form":"Pisa","offset":1406},{"uri":"Livorno","surface_form":"Livorno","offset":1415},{"uri":"92nd_Infantry_Division","surface_form":"U.S. 92nd Infantry Division","offset":1693},{"uri":"Castelnuovo_di_Garfagnana","surface_form":"Castelnuovo di Garfagnana","offset":1789},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Bulge","surface_form":"Ardennes Offensive","offset":1842},{"uri":"92nd_Infantry_Division","surface_form":"92nd Infantry Division","offset":2261},{"uri":"Barga","surface_form":"Barga","offset":2514},{"uri":"Lucca","surface_form":"Lucca","offset":2654}]}
