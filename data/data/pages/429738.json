{"id":429738,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis.\nAny math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50\u00A0miles driven by 2\u00A0gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50\u00A0by\u00A02 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide \"miles\" by \"gallons\", which gives the unit \"miles/gallon\" or \"miles\u00A0per\u00A0gallon\". The final answer is \"25\u00A0miles per gallon\".\nLooking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3\u00A0miles to some number of meters, use the equation \"1609.34\u00A0meters equals one\u00A0mile\" or 1609.34\u00A0meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles \u00D7 meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":54},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":65},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":84},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":116},{"uri":"Dimensions","surface_form":"dimensions","offset":157},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":249},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":286},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":444},{"uri":"Gallon","surface_form":"gallon","offset":455},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":712},{"uri":"Division","surface_form":"division","offset":788},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":907}]}
