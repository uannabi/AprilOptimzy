{"id":42994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir","text":"e=\"preserve\">The \u00C6sir (Old Norse: singular \"\u01EB\u0301ss\" or \"\u00E1ss\"; feminine \"\u00E1synja\", plural \"\u00E1synjur\") are the principal group or tribe of deities in Norse mythology. Including Odin, Frigg, Thor, and Baldr, the \u00C6sir reside in the realm of Asgard, situated at the top of Yggdrasil's highest branch.Alongside the \u00C6sir exists a second family of gods known as the Vanir, who joined with the \u00C6sir to form a single, unified pantheon after the devastating war between the two tribes of deities. The Vanir were native to Vanaheimr, the god Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r and his children, Freyr and Freyja chief among them. The \u00C6sir gods were usually connected with power and war, while the Vanir were associated with fertility and nature.\nNorse mythology.\nThe things that happened between the \u00C6sir and the Vanir are an interesting part of Norse mythology. While other cultures have had \"elder\" and \"younger\" generations of gods, as with the Titans and the Olympians of ancient Greece, the \u00C6sir and Vanir were portrayed as contemporaries. The two tribes fought battles, concluded treaties, and exchanged hostages; Freyr and Freyja were said to be hostages. Some believe that events that occurred between the \u00C6sir and Vanir were a reflection of events common between different Norse clans at the time.\nThe \u00C6sir did not grow old, instead remaining young by eating the apples of I\u00F0unn. While they did not age, they could be killed. It was said that most of them will die at Ragnar\u00F6k.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":23},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"deities","offset":133},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":144},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":171},{"uri":"Frigg","surface_form":"Frigg","offset":177},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":184},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":194},{"uri":"Asgard","surface_form":"Asgard","offset":233},{"uri":"Yggdrasil","surface_form":"Yggdrasil's","offset":264},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"family","offset":326},{"uri":"Vanir","surface_form":"Vanir","offset":354},{"uri":"%C3%86sir-Vanir_War","surface_form":"war","offset":443},{"uri":"Vanaheimr","surface_form":"Vanaheimr","offset":507},{"uri":"Njord","surface_form":"Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r","offset":526},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":541},{"uri":"Freyr","surface_form":"Freyr","offset":551},{"uri":"Freyja","surface_form":"Freyja","offset":561},{"uri":"Interest","surface_form":"interest","offset":782},{"uri":"Clan","surface_form":"clan","offset":1244},{"uri":"Eat","surface_form":"eat","offset":1317},{"uri":"I%C3%B0unn","surface_form":"I\u00F0unn","offset":1338},{"uri":"Ragnar%C3%B6k","surface_form":"Ragnar\u00F6k","offset":1433}]}
