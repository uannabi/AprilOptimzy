{"id":43,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religion","text":"An Abrahamic religion is a religion whose followers believe in the prophet Abraham. They believe Abraham and his sons/grandsons hold an important role in human spiritual development. The best known Abrahamic religions are Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Smaller religious traditions sometimes included as Abrahamic religions are Samaritanism, Druze, Rastafari, Yazidi, Babism and Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith. Mandaeism (a religion that holds many Abrahamic beliefs) is not called Abrahamic because its followers think Abraham was a false prophet\nTrue Abrahamic religions are monotheistic (the belief that there is only one God). They also all believe that people should pray to God and worship God often. Among monotheistic religions, the Abrahamic religions have the world's largest number of followers. They are also all ethical monotheistic religions. This means they have rules that they have to follow.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":27},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":75},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":222},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":231},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":248},{"uri":"Samaritanism","surface_form":"Samaritanism","offset":330},{"uri":"Druze","surface_form":"Druze","offset":344},{"uri":"Rastafari","surface_form":"Rastafari","offset":351},{"uri":"Yazidi","surface_form":"Yazidi","offset":362},{"uri":"Babism","surface_form":"Babism","offset":370},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith","offset":381},{"uri":"Mandaeism","surface_form":"Mandaeism","offset":395},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":524},{"uri":"Monotheism","surface_form":"monotheistic","offset":561},{"uri":"Pray","surface_form":"pray","offset":656},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":672},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethical","offset":809}]}
