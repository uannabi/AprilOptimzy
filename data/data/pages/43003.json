{"id":43003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanark","text":"Lanark is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is close to Carluke and Biggar. Lanark is approximately 40 miles from Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. William Wallace once lived there. There is a statue of Wallace on the town church. A plaque remembers where he \"first drew sword to free his native land\" in 1296, when he killed Heselrig, the English sheriff of Lanark. This event forms the start of the Mel Gibson film, \"Braveheart\".\nLanark is also notable for its annual Lanimer celebrations, where local children on coloured floats parade through the streets along with marching pipe bands. A Lanimer Queen is elected from the children, and crowned in a ceremony at the foot of the High Street. A Lord Cornet is chosen from local businessmen, and acts as escort for the Queen for the events of Lanimer Week.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":12},{"uri":"South_Lanarkshire","surface_form":"South Lanarkshire","offset":20},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":39},{"uri":"Carluke","surface_form":"Carluke","offset":64},{"uri":"Biggar%2C_South_Lanarkshire","surface_form":"Biggar","offset":76},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":122},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":148},{"uri":"William_Wallace","surface_form":"William Wallace","offset":158},{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":203},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":233},{"uri":"Commemorative_plaque","surface_form":"plaque","offset":243},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":350},{"uri":"Sheriff","surface_form":"sheriff","offset":358},{"uri":"Mel_Gibson","surface_form":"Mel Gibson","offset":411},{"uri":"Braveheart","surface_form":"Braveheart","offset":429},{"uri":"Bagpipes","surface_form":"pipe","offset":589},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"Queen","offset":611}]}
