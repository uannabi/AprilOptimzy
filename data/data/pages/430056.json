{"id":430056,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_switchboard","text":"An electric switchboard is an electrical device that directs electricity from one place to another. It is usually in the form of electrical panel in an enclosure, which contains switches for such purposes.\nOne of the more common configurations for an electric switchboard is a series of interconnected electrical panels. Each of the panels in turn features a series of switches that make it possible to control the flow of electricity. Making use of the switches, it is possible to adjust the voltage that is transmitted to connected devices, ensuring that the flow is not sufficient to cause damage to the circuitry. From this perspective, the electric switchboard can be viewed as a way of enhancing the safety of using electricity in the operation of various appliances, machinery, and other devices.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":61},{"uri":"Electrical_enclosure","surface_form":"enclosure","offset":152},{"uri":"Switch","surface_form":"switch","offset":178}]}
