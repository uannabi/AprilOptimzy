{"id":430061,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_start","text":"=\"preserve\">Black start is the process to start up in a power station from zero, without the help of power from the grid connected to the station.\nUsually, a power station uses its own set of electrical generator to start the plant. This is a diesel generator called the Black start diesel generator (BSDG). This powers up all electrical panels which control the station.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Power_station","surface_form":"power station","offset":56},{"uri":"Electrical_grid","surface_form":"grid","offset":116},{"uri":"Electrical_generator","surface_form":"electrical generator","offset":192},{"uri":"Diesel","surface_form":"diesel","offset":243}]}
