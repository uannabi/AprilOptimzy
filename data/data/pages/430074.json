He was also a powerlifter and was considered for the Bulgarian national powerlifting team in the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nHe was signed by the WWE in April 2011 and competed for their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He defeated Mike Dalton in his first televised match on the July 17, 2011 episode of FCW.\nShortly after he debuted in FCW, he tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and his meniscus and spent six months rehabilitating.

While he was rehabilitating his injury, he traveled to Thailand and studied Muay Thai.\nFCW was rebranded into NXT Wrestling and he began wrestling on NXT on the May 30, 2013 episode when he competed in an 18-man battle royal to determine who would become the number one contender to the NXT Championship.
