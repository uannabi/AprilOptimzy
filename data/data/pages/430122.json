{"id":430122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression","text":"Linear regression is a way to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables using a straight line. It is a special case of regression analysis.\nLinear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously. This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters. Another advantage of linear regression is that the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\nLinear regression models try to make the vertical distance between the line and the data points (that is, the residuals) as small as possible. This is called \"fitting the line to the data.\" Often, linear regression models try to minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals (least squares), but other ways of fitting exist. They include minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or minimizing a penalized version of the least squares loss function as in ridge regression. The least squares approach can also be used to fit models that are not linear. As outlined above, the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, but they are not synonyms.\nEconomics.\nLinear regression is the main analytical tool in economics. For example, it is used to guess consumption spending, fixed investment spending, inventory investment, purchases of a country's exports, spending on imports, the demand to hold liquid assets, labor demand and labor supply.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dependent_variable","surface_form":"dependent variable","offset":65},{"uri":"Explanatory_variable","surface_form":"explanatory variables","offset":100},{"uri":"Regression_analysis","surface_form":"regression analysis","offset":169},{"uri":"Regression_analysis","surface_form":"regression analysis","offset":230},{"uri":"Parameter","surface_form":"parameters","offset":338},{"uri":"Curve_fitting","surface_form":"fit","offset":363},{"uri":"Least_squares","surface_form":"least squares","offset":837},{"uri":"Norm_(mathematics)","surface_form":"norm","offset":942},{"uri":"Least_absolute_deviations","surface_form":"least absolute deviations","offset":956},{"uri":"Loss_function","surface_form":"loss function","offset":1050},{"uri":"Ridge_regression","surface_form":"ridge regression","offset":1070},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":1338},{"uri":"Consumption_(economics)","surface_form":"consumption spending","offset":1382},{"uri":"Fixed_investment","surface_form":"fixed investment","offset":1404},{"uri":"Inventory_investment","surface_form":"inventory investment","offset":1431},{"uri":"Exports","surface_form":"exports","offset":1478},{"uri":"Imports","surface_form":"imports","offset":1499},{"uri":"Money_demand","surface_form":"demand to hold liquid assets","offset":1512},{"uri":"Labour_economics","surface_form":"labor demand","offset":1542},{"uri":"Labor_supply","surface_form":"labor supply","offset":1559}]}
