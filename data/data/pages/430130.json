{"id":430130,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_plate","text":"The Pacific plate is a tectonic plate beneath parts of the Pacific Ocean.\nNote the Ring of Fire zones on the ocean's edges. The oldest seafloor is destroyed by going down into the Asian oceanic trenches. The oldest part disappearing this way is early Cretaceous (145 to 137 million years ago).\nAll maps of the Earth's ocean floor geology show ages younger than 145 million years. This is only about 1/30 of the Earth's 4.55 billion year history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":23},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":59},{"uri":"Ring_of_Fire","surface_form":"Ring of Fire","offset":83},{"uri":"Early_Cretaceous","surface_form":"early Cretaceous","offset":245}]}
