{"id":430255,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dere_Street","text":"Dere Street (later \"Via Regia\" in Scotland) was a Roman road in Britain. It ran between Eboracum (York) and\nthe Antonine Wall at Bo'ness (Veluniate), in what is now Scotland.\nDere Street still exists as the route of major roads, including the A1 and A68 just north of Corbridge.\nIts name comes from the post Roman Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira, through which the first part of its route lies. It was sometimes referred to as \"Watling Street\" and marked on some maps as such. This can cause it to be confused with the Watling Street that linked Dover with Wroxeter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_roads_in_Britain","surface_form":"Roman road in Britain","offset":50},{"uri":"Eboracum","surface_form":"Eboracum","offset":88},{"uri":"York","surface_form":"York","offset":98},{"uri":"Antonine_Wall","surface_form":"Antonine Wall","offset":112},{"uri":"Bo%27ness","surface_form":"Bo'ness","offset":129},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":165},{"uri":"A1_road_(Great_Britain)","surface_form":"A1","offset":243},{"uri":"Coria_(Corbridge)","surface_form":"Corbridge","offset":268},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxons","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":314},{"uri":"Deira","surface_form":"Deira","offset":337},{"uri":"Watling_Street","surface_form":"Watling Street","offset":516},{"uri":"Dover%2C_Kent","surface_form":"Dover","offset":543},{"uri":"Wroxeter","surface_form":"Wroxeter","offset":554}]}
