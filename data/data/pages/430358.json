{"id":430358,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting","text":"Curve fitting is constructing a mathematical function which best fits a set of data points.\nCurve fitting may involve either interpolation or smoothing. Using interpolation requires an exact fit to the data. With smoothing, a \"smooth\" function is constructed, that fit the data approximately. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors.\nFitted curves can be used to help data visualization, to guess values of a function where no data is available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data. This is subject to a degree of uncertainty, since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"mathematical function","offset":32},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":72},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":79},{"uri":"Interpolation","surface_form":"interpolation","offset":125},{"uri":"Smoothing","surface_form":"smoothing","offset":142},{"uri":"Regression_analysis","surface_form":"regression analysis","offset":312},{"uri":"Statistical_inference","surface_form":"statistical inference","offset":368},{"uri":"Extrapolation","surface_form":"Extrapolation","offset":666},{"uri":"Range_(mathematics)","surface_form":"range","offset":727},{"uri":"Uncertainty","surface_form":"degree of uncertainty","offset":776}]}
