He was the son of nine different mothers and was called the \"White God\".\nHeimdall is the guardian of the gods. He will blow a horn, called the \"Gjallarhorn\", if Asgard is in danger. His senses are so good that he can hear the grass grow and he can see to the end of the world. Heimdall could hear a leaf fall. He does not need any sleep at all.\nHeimdall was said to be the last of the gods to die at Ragnarok when he and Loki would kill one another.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%C3%86sir","surface_form":"gods","offset":38},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Northern mythology","offset":46},{"uri":"Bifr%C3%B6st","surface_form":"Bifr\u00F6st Bridge","offset":92},{"uri":"Son","surface_form":"son","offset":119},{"uri":"Mother","surface_form":"mother","offset":141},{"uri":"Guardian","surface_form":"guardian","offset":197},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":213},{"uri":"Horn_(musical_instrument)","surface_form":"horn","offset":234},{"uri":"Asgard","surface_form":"Asgard","offset":269},{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"senses","offset":294},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":334},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"world","offset":378},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":439},{"uri":"Ragnar%C3%B6k","surface_form":"Ragnarok","offset":508},{"uri":"Loki","surface_form":"Loki","offset":529},{"uri":"Kill","surface_form":"kill","offset":540}]}
