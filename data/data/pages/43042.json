{"id":43042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B3%C3%B0i_and_Magni","text":"e=\"preserve\">Magni and M\u00F3\u00F0i\u00A0(Old Norse: \"strength\" and \"bravery\") are a pair of minor deities in Norse mythology. They are sons of the god Thor, said to be embodiments of their father's traits. While Magni is born to Thor by the j\u00F6tunn J\u00E1rnsaxa (a lover of Thor), the name of M\u00F3\u00F0i's mother is unknown.\nOther than his part after Ragnar\u00F6k, little is known about M\u00F3\u00F0i. Magni however, is featured prominently in the myth of Thor's battle with the giant Hrungnir.\nThor hit the giant Hrungnir in the head with his hammer, Mj\u00F6lnir, shattering Hrungnir's skull. The giant then fell dead, as his leg landed on Thor's neck, pinning the god to the ground. The other \u00C6sir tried to lift Hrungnir's leg off of Thor, but were unsuccessful. Thor's son, Magni, who was only three days old at the time, then came to his father and lifted Hrungnir's leg off of Thor all by himself. In his gratitude, Thor gifted his son Hrungnir's horse, Gullfaxi (Old Norse: \"Gold-mane\"). Odin himself was upset that Thor gave the horse to \"the son of a giantess\" and not to Odin, Thor's own father.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":29},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":97},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":139},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tunn","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunn","offset":229},{"uri":"Ragnar%C3%B6k","surface_form":"Ragnar\u00F6k","offset":328},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":494},{"uri":"Mjolnir","surface_form":"Mj\u00F6lnir","offset":516},{"uri":"%C3%86sir","surface_form":"\u00C6sir","offset":655},{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":929},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":954}]}
