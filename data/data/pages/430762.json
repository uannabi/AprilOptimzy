{"id":430762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism","text":"=\"preserve\">Black feminism is a type of feminism. Black feminists believe that sexism and racism are bound together. This is called intersectionality.\nBlack feminism exists because the racism that black women experience is not adequately addressed by the mainstream feminist movement, which is led by white middle-class women. In 1973 the National Black Feminist Organization was started.\nAlice Walker was the first person to use the word womanism in 1979. Womanism is a black feminist theory. Patricia Hill Collins's 1991 book \"Black Feminist Thought\" is one of the most well-known books about black feminism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Feminism","surface_form":"feminism","offset":40},{"uri":"Sexism","surface_form":"sexism","offset":79},{"uri":"Intersectionality","surface_form":"intersectionality","offset":132},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":185},{"uri":"Middle-class","surface_form":"middle-class","offset":307},{"uri":"Alice_Walker","surface_form":"Alice Walker","offset":389},{"uri":"Womanism","surface_form":"womanism","offset":439},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":486},{"uri":"Patricia_Hill_Collins","surface_form":"Patricia Hill Collins","offset":494}]}
