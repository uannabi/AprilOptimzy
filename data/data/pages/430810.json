{"id":430810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcturus","text":"Arcturus (or \u03B1\u00A0Boo, \u03B1\u00A0Bo\u00F6tis, Alpha Bo\u00F6tis) of the constellation Bo\u00F6tes is the brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere. With an apparent magnitude of\u00A0\u22120.04, it is the fourth brightest star in the night sky, after \u22121.46\u00A0magnitude Sirius, \u22120.86 magnitude Canopus, and \u22120.27\u00A0magnitude Alpha Centauri.\nIt is a relatively close star at only 36.7 light-years from Earth, and, together with Vega and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.\nArcturus is a type K1.5\u00A0IIIpe orange giant star, with an absolute magnitude of \u22120.30. It has likely exhausted its hydrogen from the core and is now in its active red giant phase. It will continue to expand before entering the horizontal branch stage of its life cycle. The diameter of Arcturus is around 40 million kilometers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alpha_(letter)","surface_form":"Alpha","offset":30},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":51},{"uri":"Bo%C3%B6tes","surface_form":"Bo\u00F6tes","offset":65},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":89},{"uri":"Celestial_sphere","surface_form":"celestial hemisphere","offset":110},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":140},{"uri":"List_of_brightest_stars","surface_form":"fourth brightest star","offset":179},{"uri":"Sirius","surface_form":"Sirius","offset":241},{"uri":"Canopus_(star)","surface_form":"Canopus","offset":265},{"uri":"Alpha_Centauri","surface_form":"Alpha Centauri","offset":294},{"uri":"Light-years","surface_form":"light-years","offset":353},{"uri":"Vega","surface_form":"Vega","offset":396},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":451},{"uri":"Stellar_classification","surface_form":"type","offset":485},{"uri":"Giant_star","surface_form":"orange giant","offset":501},{"uri":"Absolute_magnitude","surface_form":"absolute magnitude","offset":528},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":585},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red giant","offset":633}]}
