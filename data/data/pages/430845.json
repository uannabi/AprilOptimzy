{"id":430845,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_cancer","text":"Vaginal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the vagina. Primary vaginal cancer is rare in the general population of women. Metastases are more common. Vaginal cancer occurs more often in women over age 50, but can occur at any age, even in when they're pregnant. It often can be cured if found and treated in its early stages. Surgery alone or surgery combined with pelvic radiation is typically used to treat vaginal cancer.\nThere are two primary types of vaginal cancer: squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":28},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":68},{"uri":"Metastases","surface_form":"Metastases","offset":143},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":273},{"uri":"Cancer_staging","surface_form":"stages","offset":339},{"uri":"Squamous-cell_carcinoma","surface_form":"squamous-cell carcinoma","offset":493}]}
