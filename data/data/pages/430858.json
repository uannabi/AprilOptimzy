{"id":430858,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer","text":"Gallbladder cancer is a rare type of cancer which forms in the gallbladder. It is most common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, China, Japan and northern India. It is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native Americans, Indians and Hispanics.\nIf it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and lymph nodes. Most often it is found after symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other organs such as the liver.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":37},{"uri":"Gallbladder","surface_form":"gallbladder","offset":63},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"central","offset":97},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":109},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":144},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":152},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":159},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":178},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native American","offset":233},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":251},{"uri":"Hispanic","surface_form":"Hispanic","offset":263},{"uri":"Gallbladder","surface_form":"gallbladder","offset":339},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":364},{"uri":"Lymph_nodes","surface_form":"lymph nodes","offset":374},{"uri":"Symptoms","surface_form":"symptoms","offset":416},{"uri":"Abdominal","surface_form":"abdominal","offset":433},{"uri":"Jaundice","surface_form":"jaundice","offset":449},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organ","offset":505},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":524}]}
