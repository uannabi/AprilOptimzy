{"id":430869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvar_cancer","text":"Vulvar cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control in or on the vulva. The vulva is the outer part of the female genital organs. It has two folds of skin, called the labia. Vulvar cancer most often occurs on the inner edges of the labia.\nCancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts, even if it spreads to other body parts later. When cancer starts in the vagina, it is called vaginal cancer. The vagina, also called the birth canal, is the hollow, tube-like channel between the bottom of the uterus and the outside of the body. When vulvar cancers are found early, treatment works best.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vulva","surface_form":"vulva","offset":87},{"uri":"Labia","surface_form":"labia","offset":189},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":398},{"uri":"Vaginal_cancer","surface_form":"vaginal cancer","offset":419},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":535}]}
