{"id":430959,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalande_21185","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lalande 21185 is a red dwarf in the constellation of Ursa Major. Although relatively close by, it is only magnitude 7 in visible light and thus is too dim to see with the unaided eye. The star is visible through a small telescope.\nAt approximately away this star is the fifth closest stellar system to the Sun; only the Alpha Centauri system, Barnard's Star, WISE 1049-5319 and Wolf 359 are closer. Because of its proximity it is a frequent subject for astronomical surveys and other research. It is known by other designations, such as BD+36 2147, Gliese 411, and HD 95735.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Red_dwarf","surface_form":"red dwarf","offset":32},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":49},{"uri":"Ursa_Major","surface_form":"Ursa Major","offset":66},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"magnitude","offset":119},{"uri":"Visible_light","surface_form":"visible light","offset":134},{"uri":"List_of_nearest_stars","surface_form":"fifth closest stellar system","offset":283},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":319},{"uri":"Alpha_Centauri","surface_form":"Alpha Centauri","offset":333},{"uri":"Barnard%27s_Star","surface_form":"Barnard's Star","offset":356},{"uri":"WISE_1049-5319","surface_form":"WISE 1049-5319","offset":372},{"uri":"Wolf_359","surface_form":"Wolf 359","offset":391}]}
