They said, \"NHL 14 adds little of note to NHL 13 aside from better hitting, more fighting, and a disappointing NHL 94 retro mode.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":15},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":26},{"uri":"Video_game_developer","surface_form":"developed","offset":45},{"uri":"EA_Canada","surface_form":"EA Canada","offset":58},{"uri":"EA_Sports","surface_form":"EA Sports","offset":85},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":137},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":174},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":216},{"uri":"NHL_(video_game_series)","surface_form":"NHL","offset":254},{"uri":"NHL_13","surface_form":"NHL 13","offset":299},{"uri":"New_Jersey_Devils","surface_form":"New Jersey Devils","offset":308},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"goaltender","offset":326},{"uri":"Martin_Brodeur","surface_form":"Martin Brodeur","offset":337},{"uri":"NHL_97","surface_form":"NHL 97","offset":417},{"uri":"IGN","surface_form":"IGN","offset":486},{"uri":"GameSpot","surface_form":"GameSpot","offset":742}]}
