He was the son of Jos\u00E9 Canaverys and Agustina Denis. In 1830 he graduated as a Second Lieutenant of artillery. In 1940 Canaverys was suspected of belonging to the Unitarian Party. He was discharged from the army, and the government quickly ordered his detention. Feliciano decided to escape to Uruguay and enlist in the army of General Juan Lavalle. He traveled to Tacuaremb\u00F3, but was ambushed by federales troops. After being arrested, General Manuel Oribe ordered that Feliciano be executed.\nThe Denis family were among the first Irish settlers in Buenos Aires. They arrived to the R\u00EDo de la Plata in the 17th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["military person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argentine","surface_form":"Argentine","offset":48},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":91},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Canaverys","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Canaverys","offset":123},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":205},{"uri":"Unitarian_Party","surface_form":"Unitarian Party","offset":268},{"uri":"Detention_(imprisonment)","surface_form":"detention","offset":357},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":399},{"uri":"Juan_Lavalle","surface_form":"Juan Lavalle","offset":441},{"uri":"Tacuaremb%C3%B3","surface_form":"Tacuaremb\u00F3","offset":470},{"uri":"Federales_(Argentina)","surface_form":"federales","offset":502},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":532},{"uri":"Manuel_Oribe","surface_form":"Manuel Oribe","offset":550},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"executed","offset":589},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":637},{"uri":"Settler","surface_form":"settler","offset":643},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata","surface_form":"R\u00EDo de la Plata","offset":689}]}
