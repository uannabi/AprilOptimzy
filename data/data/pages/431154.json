It is named after Major Thomas Mitchell, surveyor and explorer who was the first European to explore large areas of New South Wales and Victoria. It was set up in 1949.\nThe division covers the north-west suburbs of Sydney. It includes Baulkham Hills, Beaumont Hills, Bella Vista, Box Hill, Kellyville, Nelson and Winston Hills. It also includes parts of Castle Hill, North Rocks, Northmead, Maraylya, Rouse Hill and West Pennant Hills.\nAfter the 2013 federal election, Mitchell became the safest Liberal seat in metropolitan Australia. The ALP would need a 22% swing to win it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian electoral division","offset":31},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":68},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":77},{"uri":"Thomas_Mitchell","surface_form":"Thomas Mitchell","offset":118},{"uri":"Surveyor_(surveying)","surface_form":"surveyor","offset":135},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":148},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":230},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":309},{"uri":"Baulkham_Hills","surface_form":"Baulkham Hills","offset":329},{"uri":"Beaumont_Hills%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Beaumont Hills","offset":345},{"uri":"Bella_Vista%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Bella Vista","offset":361},{"uri":"Box_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Box Hill","offset":374},{"uri":"Kellyville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Kellyville","offset":384},{"uri":"Nelson%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Nelson","offset":396},{"uri":"Winston_Hills%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Winston Hills","offset":407},{"uri":"Castle_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Castle Hill","offset":448},{"uri":"North_Rocks%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"North Rocks","offset":461},{"uri":"Northmead%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Northmead","offset":474},{"uri":"Maraylya%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Maraylya","offset":485},{"uri":"Rouse_Hill","surface_form":"Rouse Hill","offset":495},{"uri":"West_Pennant_Hills","surface_form":"West Pennant Hills","offset":510},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Liberal","offset":590}]}
