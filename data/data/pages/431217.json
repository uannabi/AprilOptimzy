{"id":431217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyon","text":"Procyon (\u03B1 CMi, \u03B1 Canis Minoris, Alpha Canis Minoris) is the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor. To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the eighth brightest in the night sky with a visual apparent magnitude of 0.34.\nIt is actually a binary star system of a white main-sequence star of spectral type F5\u00A0IV\u2013V, named Procyon\u00A0A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DQZ, named Procyon\u00A0B.\nThe reason for its brightness is not its intrinsic luminosity but its relative closeness to the Sun. Its distance was worked out by the European Space Agency Hipparcos astrometry satellite. It is just away, and is one of our nearest stellar neighbours. Its closest neighbour is Luyten's Star, about away.\nProcyon forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle, along with Sirius and Betelgeuse. Its colour index is 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alpha","surface_form":"Alpha","offset":33},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":71},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":83},{"uri":"Canis_Minor","surface_form":"Canis Minor","offset":97},{"uri":"List_of_brightest_stars","surface_form":"eighth brightest","offset":164},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":212},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":257},{"uri":"Main_sequence","surface_form":"main-sequence","offset":287},{"uri":"Spectral_type","surface_form":"spectral type","offset":309},{"uri":"White_dwarf","surface_form":"white dwarf","offset":361},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"luminosity","offset":473},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":518},{"uri":"European_Space_Agency","surface_form":"European Space Agency","offset":558},{"uri":"Hipparcos","surface_form":"Hipparcos","offset":580},{"uri":"List_of_nearest_stars","surface_form":"nearest stellar neighbours","offset":647},{"uri":"Luyten%27s_Star","surface_form":"Luyten's Star","offset":700},{"uri":"Vertex_figure","surface_form":"vertices","offset":758},{"uri":"Winter_Triangle","surface_form":"Winter Triangle","offset":774},{"uri":"Sirius","surface_form":"Sirius","offset":802},{"uri":"Betelgeuse","surface_form":"Betelgeuse","offset":813}]}
