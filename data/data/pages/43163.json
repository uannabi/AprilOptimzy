{"id":43163,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburger_cheese","text":"Limburger cheese is a cheese made from cows' milk. Its name comes from the Duchy of Limburg, which is divided between Holland, Belgium and Germany today. Limburger cheese is known for its strong smell, which is caused by the bacterium that lives in its rind. Since about the mid nineteenth century, most Limburger is produced in Germany.\nIn 2006 a study showing that the malaria mosquito (\"Anopheles gambiae\") is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology. This Cheese has now been placed in strategic locations in Africa to fight against malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":22},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":39},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":45},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Limburg","surface_form":"Duchy of Limburg","offset":75},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":118},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":127},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":139},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"smell","offset":195},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":225},{"uri":"Rind","surface_form":"rind","offset":253},{"uri":"Mosquito","surface_form":"mosquito","offset":379},{"uri":"Ig_Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Ig Nobel Prize","offset":499},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":620}]}
