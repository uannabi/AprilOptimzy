{"id":431708,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading","text":"e=\"preserve\">Insider trading means the trading of public companies' stocks and other assets on stock markets using secret information. This is done by getting people who have confidential or non-public facts about how much a stock is really worth to tell traders so they can buy or sell. A stock could be worth more or less than the public knows, depending on how well a company is doing in making money.\nIn many countries, insider trading with secret information is against the law and thought to be a bad thing to do.\nSome economists think insider trading should be allowed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"companies","offset":57},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"stock","offset":68},{"uri":"Asset","surface_form":"asset","offset":85},{"uri":"Stock_market","surface_form":"stock market","offset":95},{"uri":"Secrecy","surface_form":"secret","offset":115},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":122},{"uri":"Confidential","surface_form":"confidential","offset":175},{"uri":"Worth","surface_form":"worth","offset":241},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":479},{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":525}]}
