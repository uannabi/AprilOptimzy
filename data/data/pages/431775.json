It is also known as WISE 1049-5319.\nThese are the nearest known brown dwarfs to the Solar System, and the closest system discovered since Barnard's Star in 1916.\nThe primary has a stellar classification of L8 \u00B1 1, and the secondary is probably near the T transition. The pair orbit each other at a distance of about 3 AU with an orbital period of about 25 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Double_star","surface_form":"binary","offset":15},{"uri":"Brown_dwarf","surface_form":"brown dwarf","offset":22},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":50},{"uri":"Vela_(constellation)","surface_form":"Vela","offset":64},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":76},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":186},{"uri":"List_of_nearest_stars","surface_form":"closest system","offset":208},{"uri":"Barnard%27s_Star","surface_form":"Barnard's Star","offset":240},{"uri":"Stellar_classification","surface_form":"stellar classification","offset":282},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"AU","offset":420},{"uri":"Orbital_period","surface_form":"orbital period","offset":431}]}
