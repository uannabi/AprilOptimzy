The division was first set up in 1949 and abolished in 1984. It was recreated after a redistribution in 1992.\nThe division is named after poet and author Banjo Paterson. It is possible that is was named after Colonel William Paterson who also gave his name to the Paterson River and the town of Paterson, both of which were in the electorate. It was first contested at the 1949 election.\nIn 1949 the division included Singleton, Maitland and Muswellbrook. Redistributions moved the electorate north until it included Gunnedah and Mudgee. The original electorate was abolished in 1984. In 1992 it was recreated covering a similar area to the original electorate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Australian Electorate"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian electoral division","offset":31},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":68},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":77},{"uri":"Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Newcastle","offset":114},{"uri":"Tasman_Sea","surface_form":"Tasman Sea","offset":145},{"uri":"Anna_Bay%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Anna Bay","offset":182},{"uri":"Bulahdelah%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Bulahdelah","offset":192},{"uri":"Clarence_Town%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Clarence Town","offset":204},{"uri":"Dungog%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Dungog","offset":219},{"uri":"Forster%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Forster","offset":227},{"uri":"Hawks_Nest%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Hawks Nest","offset":236},{"uri":"Lemon_Tree_Passage%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lemon Tree Passage","offset":248},{"uri":"Medowie%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Medowie","offset":268},{"uri":"Morpeth%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Morpeth","offset":277},{"uri":"Nelson_Bay%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Nelson Bay","offset":286},{"uri":"Paterson%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Paterson","offset":298},{"uri":"Raymond_Terrace%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Raymond Terrace","offset":308},{"uri":"Stroud%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Stroud","offset":325},{"uri":"Tuncurry%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Tuncurry","offset":333},{"uri":"Nabiac%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Nabiac","offset":355},{"uri":"Thornton%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Thornton","offset":363},{"uri":"East_Maitland%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"East Maitland","offset":376},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":529},{"uri":"Banjo_Paterson","surface_form":"Banjo Paterson","offset":545},{"uri":"William_Paterson_(explorer)","surface_form":"Colonel William Paterson","offset":600},{"uri":"Paterson_River","surface_form":"Paterson River","offset":655},{"uri":"Australian_federal_election%2C_1949","surface_form":"1949 election","offset":764},{"uri":"Singleton%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Singleton","offset":809},{"uri":"Maitland%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Maitland","offset":820},{"uri":"Muswellbrook%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Muswellbrook","offset":833},{"uri":"Gunnedah%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Gunnedah","offset":908},{"uri":"Mudgee._New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Mudgee","offset":921}]}
