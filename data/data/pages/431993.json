It was built in 1862 for soldiers who were in the American Civil War. It was run by the United States Army.\nArchitect John McArthur, Jr. designed the hospital. It was near the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad so hurt soldiers could be brought to the hospital fast. It was open from January 1863 until May 1865.\nIt had room for 40,000 patients. It was shaped so that people would not get sicker or get an infection from other sick and injured people. It had many things for the people who worked there, and for the injured soldiers.
