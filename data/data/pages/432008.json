{"id":432008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dick Cheney hunting incident happened on February 11, 2006, when then U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt on a ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Both Cheney and Whittington called the incident an accident.\nOn February 14, 2006, Whittington suffered a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Cheney did not speak publicly about the incident until February 15 in an interview with Fox News. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington has since told the \"Washington Post\" that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances and has not said if Cheney apologized.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. Vice President","offset":87},{"uri":"Dick_Cheney","surface_form":"Dick Cheney","offset":107},{"uri":"Harry_Whittington","surface_form":"Harry Whittington","offset":124},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":157},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"attorney","offset":163},{"uri":"Quail","surface_form":"quail","offset":198},{"uri":"Kenedy_County%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Kenedy County, Texas","offset":223},{"uri":"Atrial_fibrillation","surface_form":"atrial fibrillation","offset":378},{"uri":"Fox_News_Channel","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":552}]}
