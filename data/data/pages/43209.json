{"id":43209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_disjunction","text":"Inclusive disjunction (also called or) is a logic operation. It normally takes two truth values as inputs and returns one truth value as output. It is false when both inputs are false, but is true otherwise. It is written with the symbol formula_1.\nIn general, given two propositions formula_1 and formula_1, formula_1 is true if formula_1 is true, or if formula_1 is true, or if both formula_1 and formula_1 are true.\nThis is different from the exclusive disjunction, which asserts \"either \"x\" or \"y\", but not both\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":44},{"uri":"Exclusive_disjunction","surface_form":"exclusive disjunction","offset":446}]}
