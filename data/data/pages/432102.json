It happened in a park called Logan Circle in Philadelphia. Other sanitary fairs took place in Chicago, Cincinnati, and New York City. The people in Philadelphia thought they should do one to raise money for the United States Sanitary Commission.\nTwo architects named Samuel Honeyman Kneass and William Stickland designed the buildings for the fair. The biggest building was 200,000 square feet in size. Inside, visitors could visit different theme areas. The areas included information about New Jersey, Delaware, sewing, corn, weapons, art and children. There was also a restaurant.\nAbraham Lincoln visited the fair on June 16. He donated 48 copies of his Emancipation Proclamation. They were sold for $10 each. He autographed all of them. The festival raised over $1 million.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fair","surface_form":"fair","offset":29},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":79},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":93},{"uri":"Fundraiser","surface_form":"raise funds","offset":122},{"uri":"United_States_Sanitary_Commission","surface_form":"United States Sanitary Commission","offset":142},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":270},{"uri":"Logan_Circle_(Philadelphia)","surface_form":"Logan Circle","offset":282},{"uri":"Sanitary_fair","surface_form":"sanitary fair","offset":318},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":347},{"uri":"Cincinnati","surface_form":"Cincinnati","offset":356},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":372},{"uri":"Samuel_Honeyman_Kneass","surface_form":"Samuel Honeyman Kneass","offset":520},{"uri":"William_Stickland","surface_form":"William Stickland","offset":547},{"uri":"Square_feet","surface_form":"square feet","offset":635},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":745},{"uri":"Delaware","surface_form":"Delaware","offset":757},{"uri":"Sewing","surface_form":"sewing","offset":767},{"uri":"Corn","surface_form":"corn","offset":775},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":825},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":837},{"uri":"Emancipation_Proclamation","surface_form":"Emancipation Proclamation","offset":910}]}
