{"id":43213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implication_(logic)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Implication (also known as logical consequence, implies, or If... then) is a logical operation. It is the relationship between statements that holds true when one logically \"follows from\" one or more others. While a statement of the form \"if \"P\" then \"Q\" is often written as formula_1, the assertion that \"Q\" is a logical consequence \"P\" is often written as formula_1.\nImplications take two arguments. It returns false if and only if the first term is true and the second term is false.\nThis may be problematic, because it means that from a false proposition, anything can follow.\nExamples.\nThe following shows a (valid) implication\nIn the second scenario, the statement is false, since the promise is broken. In other scenarios, the statement is true, since the promise is kept.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Logical","surface_form":"logical","offset":90},{"uri":"If_and_only_if","surface_form":"if and only if","offset":432}]}
