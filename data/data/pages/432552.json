{"id":432552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Brick_in_the_Wall","text":"\"Another Brick in the Wall\" is a rock and roll song by Pink Floyd. It is divided into three parts. It was released on their album \"The Wall\" in 1979. Part 1 is a song about the sadness of a child (later to become a rockstar). Part 2 continues from \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\". It is a rock opera protest song against the cruelty of teachers in Britain. Part 3 is the loudest and shortest part of \"Another Brick in the Wall\". It is about the rockstar's anger and the completion of his \"Metaphorical Wall\". It cross-fades to \"Goodbye Cruel World\". In 2004, Korn made a studio version of \"Another Brick in the Wall\". The Pink Floyd version reached 57 on the disco chart.\nThe tunes of all three parts are exactly the same, but one part will be louder than the previous part. It starts off with the tragedy of Part 1 to the protesting of Part 2 to the fury of Part 3.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":33},{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":55},{"uri":"The_Wall","surface_form":"The Wall","offset":131},{"uri":"The_Happiest_Days_of_Our_Lives","surface_form":"The Happiest Days of Our Lives","offset":249},{"uri":"Rock_opera","surface_form":"rock opera","offset":290},{"uri":"Protest_song","surface_form":"protest song","offset":301},{"uri":"Cross-fades","surface_form":"cross-fades","offset":513},{"uri":"Goodbye_Cruel_World","surface_form":"Goodbye Cruel World","offset":529},{"uri":"Korn","surface_form":"Korn","offset":560},{"uri":"Tragedy","surface_form":"tragedy","offset":799},{"uri":"Fury","surface_form":"fury","offset":852}]}
