It was set up for the first Australian federal election in 1901. It is named after its local area, the Richmond Valley and Richmond River. These were named for Charles, the fifth Duke of Richmond.\nRichmond is in the north-east corner of NSW, next to the Queensland border. The main towns are Bangalow, Brunswick Heads, Byron Bay, Kingscliff, Lennox Head, Mullumbimby, Murwillumbah, Nimbin, Ocean Shores, Pottsville, Suffolk Park and Tweed Heads.\nMembers.\nRichmond was held for 55 years by three generations of the Anthony family -- Hubert Lawrence Anthony (a minister in the Fadden and Menzies governments), Doug Anthony (leader of the National Party from 1971 to 1984 and Deputy Prime Minister in the Gorton, McMahon and Fraser governments) and Larry Anthony (a minister in the Howard government) -- the first three-generation dynasty in the Australian House of Representatives. Charles Blunt was the leader of the Nationals and one of only three major party leaders to lose their own seat in an election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian electoral division","offset":31},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":68},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":77},{"uri":"Richmond_River","surface_form":"Richmond River","offset":217},{"uri":"Charles_Gordon-Lennox%2C_5th_Duke_of_Richmond","surface_form":"Charles, the fifth Duke of Richmond","offset":254},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":348},{"uri":"Bangalow%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Bangalow","offset":386},{"uri":"Brunswick_Heads%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Brunswick Heads","offset":396},{"uri":"Byron_Bay%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Byron Bay","offset":413},{"uri":"Kingscliff%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Kingscliff","offset":424},{"uri":"Lennox_Head%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Lennox Head","offset":436},{"uri":"Mullumbimby%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Mullumbimby","offset":449},{"uri":"Murwillumbah%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Murwillumbah","offset":462},{"uri":"Nimbin%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Nimbin","offset":476},{"uri":"Ocean_Shores%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Ocean Shores","offset":484},{"uri":"Pottsville%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Pottsville","offset":498},{"uri":"Suffolk_Park%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Suffolk Park","offset":510},{"uri":"Tweed_Heads%2C_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"Tweed Heads","offset":527},{"uri":"Hubert_Lawrence_Anthony","surface_form":"Hubert Lawrence Anthony","offset":626},{"uri":"Arthur_Fadden","surface_form":"Fadden","offset":669},{"uri":"Robert_Menzies","surface_form":"Menzies","offset":680},{"uri":"Doug_Anthony","surface_form":"Doug Anthony","offset":702},{"uri":"Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Australia","surface_form":"Deputy Prime Minister","offset":767},{"uri":"John_Gorton","surface_form":"Gorton","offset":796},{"uri":"William_McMahon","surface_form":"McMahon","offset":804},{"uri":"Malcolm_Fraser","surface_form":"Fraser","offset":816},{"uri":"Larry_Anthony","surface_form":"Larry Anthony","offset":840},{"uri":"John_Howard","surface_form":"Howard","offset":873},{"uri":"Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian House of Representatives","offset":937},{"uri":"Charles_Blunt","surface_form":"Charles Blunt","offset":974}]}
