{"id":432616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem","text":"Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics which act against a wide range of bacteria. Their structure is difficult for bacterial enzymes to break down. They were originally developed from a product of \"Streptomyces cattleya\".\nCarbapenems are one of the \"antibiotics of last resort\" for many bacterial infections, such as \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\") and \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\".\nRecently, alarm has been raised about an \"Indian superbug\". This is a strain resistant to Carapenems, which was discovered in Delhi. This strain produces an enzyme which chops up the antibiotic molecule.\nAt present there are no new antibiotics in development to replace carbapenems. However, some older antibiotics may treat bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":27},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":73},{"uri":"Enzymes","surface_form":"enzymes","offset":126},{"uri":"Streptomyces","surface_form":"Streptomyces","offset":199},{"uri":"Escherichia_coli","surface_form":"Escherichia coli","offset":319},{"uri":"Klebsiella_pneumoniae","surface_form":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","offset":354},{"uri":"Delhi","surface_form":"Delhi","offset":504}]}
