{"id":432629,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces","text":"\"Streptomyces\" is the largest genus of Actinobacteria. Over 500 species of \"Streptomyces\" bacteria have been described. They are bacteria, but their manner of growth makes them look like fungi. They form long thin threads or hyphae. However, they are not related to fungi\nAs with other Actinobacteria, streptomycetes are gram-positive and have genomes with high GC content. Mostly the bacteria live in soil and decaying vegetation and produces spores as its method of reproduction.\nStreptomycetes produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin (e.g., tetracycline, neomycin and chloramphenicol). The now uncommonly used streptomycin takes its name directly from \"Streptomyces\".\n\"Streptomyces\" is the largest antibiotic-producing genus, making antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic drugs. They also make a wide range of other bioactive compounds, such as immunosuppressants.\nAlmost all of the bioactive compounds produced by \"Streptomyces\" are made while the hyphae are forming from the substrate mycelium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":30},{"uri":"Actinobacteria","surface_form":"Actinobacteria","offset":39},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":90},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":129},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":187},{"uri":"Hyphae","surface_form":"hyphae","offset":225},{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"gram-positive","offset":321},{"uri":"Genomes","surface_form":"genomes","offset":344},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":444},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproduction","offset":468},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":546},{"uri":"Tetracycline","surface_form":"tetracycline","offset":583},{"uri":"Neomycin","surface_form":"neomycin","offset":597},{"uri":"Chloramphenicol","surface_form":"chloramphenicol","offset":610},{"uri":"Streptomycin","surface_form":"streptomycin","offset":652},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":740},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":761},{"uri":"Antifungal_drug","surface_form":"antifungal","offset":790},{"uri":"Biological_activity","surface_form":"bioactive","offset":864},{"uri":"Immunosuppressive_drug","surface_form":"immunosuppressants","offset":893},{"uri":"Hyphae","surface_form":"hyphae","offset":997},{"uri":"Mycelium","surface_form":"mycelium","offset":1035}]}
