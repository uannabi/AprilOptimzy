It is a large arch, but it is not possible to drive underneath it. Jean-Fran\u00E7ois Chalgrin designed it, and it has roughly 300 steps that lead to the top. It has four main sculptures and six reliefs. Just beneath the vault of the arch, there is the tomb of the unknown soldier. The names of French generals and battles are engraved on the walls.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Champs-Elys%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Champs-Elys\u00E9es","offset":115},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":148},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":160},{"uri":"Napol%C3%A9on_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Napol\u00E9on Bonaparte","offset":175},{"uri":"Battle_of_Austerlitz","surface_form":"Battle of Austerlitz","offset":239},{"uri":"Relief","surface_form":"relief","offset":451},{"uri":"Tomb_of_the_unknown_soldier","surface_form":"tomb of the unknown soldier","offset":509}]}
