The holder of the title was a member of the extended royal family and therefore held the rank and further title of prince of the blood and the style of Serene Highness but the style was only used when in writing. The holder of the title also held the important further rank of First Prince of the blood. The heir was usually given the title of Duke of Bourbon and at other times the Duke of Enghien. The title was \"only\" to be inherited by the male line as females were expelled from to succeeding to titles. The title existed for almost two centuries and during that time the prince was one of the highest ranking prince behind that of the actual royal family.\nOver the years the princes were used to make political and financial marriages with member of the wealthy French nobility as well as princesses of other European ruling houses. The prince was a member of the French House of Bourbon.\nSmall note.\nPrinces and princesses of this line of the House of Bourbon are often \"incorrectly\" surnamed as \"Bourbon-Cond\u00E9\". Which is incorrect. Their surname was just \"de Bourbon\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prince_of_the_blood","surface_form":"prince of the blood","offset":231},{"uri":"Serene_Highness","surface_form":"Serene Highness","offset":268},{"uri":"First_Prince_of_the_blood","surface_form":"First Prince of the blood","offset":393},{"uri":"House_of_Bourbon","surface_form":"House of Bourbon","offset":993}]}
