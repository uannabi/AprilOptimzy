{"id":432887,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrogance","text":"e=\"preserve\">Arrogance (also called hubris) indicates strong pride or acting extremely self-important. In particular, a loss of contact with reality and overestimating one's own competence or capability.\nIt is when you try to reason out or state your case over a traffic violation to an enforcer - only in the Philippines.\nArrogance is also associated with lack of humility and love toward oneself. Examples include making oneself far more important than others or superiority. Children raised around arrogance may be arrogant themselves.\nArrogance is usually detrimental and fosters a negative-minded culture. Some sources, however, also indicate arrogance means taking and receiving pride with one's work.\nArrogance is different from confidence. Arrogance may be associated with insecurity. Confidence has an association with improving and examining one's own weaknesses.\nHubris is the ancient Greek concept. It is similar to arrogance, but is usually translated as \"pride\". Because their societies were more concerned with honour, it works out as somewhat different from arrogance. To understand it fully one needs to work through the Greek passages where it is used, which is beyond our scope. For example, the use of force to shame someone would have been considered hubris.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pride","surface_form":"pride","offset":61},{"uri":"Reality","surface_form":"reality","offset":141},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"Child","offset":478},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":602},{"uri":"Confidence","surface_form":"confidence","offset":736},{"uri":"Emotional_security","surface_form":"insecurity","offset":781},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":888},{"uri":"Pride","surface_form":"pride","offset":969}]}
