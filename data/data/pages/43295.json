{"id":43295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyrosaurus","text":"Zephyrosaurus was a small dinosaur. It was a relative of Hypsilophodon. It lived 132 million years ago, in the western part of what is now North America. It was 6\u00A0ft (2 metres) long and 3\u00A0ft (1 metre) high.\nThe remains are bones from various parts of the body. It had a steep face, a raised knob on the upper jaw, and a larger knob on the cheekbone. Some of the bones may have allowed movement within the skull (cranial kinesis) as well. Like other hypsilophodonts, it had beak teeth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":26},{"uri":"Hypsilophodon","surface_form":"Hypsilophodon","offset":57},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":85},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":93}]}
