It may be related to the smaller \"Coelophysis\". Specific details of its life-style are few. Some of its fossils were found in terrain which was a low-lying slow-moving river system at the time. The animal was obviously a carnivore.\n\"Dilophosaurus\" was shown in the movie \"When Dinosaurs Roamed America\" scaring off a pack of \"Megapnosaurus\" and eating an \"Anchisaurus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":69},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":87},{"uri":"Coelophysis","surface_form":"Coelophysis","offset":270},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":362},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":457},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":501},{"uri":"When_Dinosaurs_Roamed_America","surface_form":"When Dinosaurs Roamed America","offset":508},{"uri":"Megapnosaurus","surface_form":"Megapnosaurus","offset":562},{"uri":"Anchisaurus","surface_form":"Anchisaurus","offset":592}]}
