Pasolini was born in Bologna and raised in Veneto and Fruili. His poetry was first published when he was 19 years old. He wrote many novels and essays. He wrote his first screenplay in 1954. The first movie he directed was \"Accattone\" in 1961. This and many of his other works were controversial during his lifetime. In the years since his death, however, Pasolini has come to be valued by many as a visionary thinker and a major figure in Italian literature and art. Literary critic Harold Bloom considered Pasolini to be a major European poet and a major voice in 20th-century poetry.\nPasolini was gay. He was murdered on 2 November 1975. He was run over several times with his own car. He died on the beach at Ostia, near Rome. He was buried in Casarsa, in Friuli.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":60},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"movie director","offset":68},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":84},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":93},{"uri":"Bologna","surface_form":"Bologna","offset":122},{"uri":"Veneto","surface_form":"Veneto","offset":144},{"uri":"Fruili","surface_form":"Fruili","offset":155},{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essay","offset":245},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"screenplay","offset":272},{"uri":"Accattone","surface_form":"Accattone","offset":325},{"uri":"Italian_literature","surface_form":"Italian literature","offset":541},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":701},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":713},{"uri":"Ostia_(Rome)","surface_form":"Ostia","offset":814},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":826},{"uri":"Casarsa","surface_form":"Casarsa","offset":849},{"uri":"Friuli","surface_form":"Friuli","offset":861}]}
