These movies deal with fictional espionage, either in fantasy way (James Bond) or in a realistic way. Many spy fiction novels have been made into movies.\nMovies in this genre range from the 1940s Nazi thriller movies to the thriller movies of the 2010s. They have been popular worldwide with audiences.\nThe genre began with the silent era, beginning in 1914. The spy movies in the 2000s and 2010s are more realistic than fantasy movies. Examples of this are the James Bond movies \"Casino Royale\" (2006) and \"Skyfall\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":29},{"uri":"Thriller_(genre)","surface_form":"thriller","offset":38},{"uri":"Action_movie","surface_form":"action movie","offset":51},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":89},{"uri":"Espionage","surface_form":"espionage","offset":99},{"uri":"James_Bond","surface_form":"James Bond","offset":133},{"uri":"Spy_fiction","surface_form":"spy fiction","offset":173},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":185},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":262},{"uri":"Silent_movie","surface_form":"silent era","offset":394},{"uri":"Casino_Royale","surface_form":"Casino Royale","offset":547},{"uri":"Skyfall","surface_form":"Skyfall","offset":574}]}
