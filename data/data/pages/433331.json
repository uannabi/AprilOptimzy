{"id":433331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd%E2%80%94The_Wall","text":"\"Pink Floyd - The Wall\" is a British movie from 1982. It was inspired by Pink Floyd's album \"The Wall\". It was directed by Alan Parker (for the non-animation) and Gerald Scarfe (for the animation). It was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (for the original version) and Warner Bros. (for the current version).\nThe movie is about a rock star named \"Pink\", after the band. He builds a wall to separate everyone from his life. But when Pink is on trial the judge orders the wall to be pulled down. At the Cannes Film Festival in 1982, the movie was shown \"out of competition\". This means it was shown in the Festival theatre but could not win the main prize.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":37},{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":73},{"uri":"The_Wall","surface_form":"The Wall","offset":93},{"uri":"Alan_Parker","surface_form":"Alan Parker","offset":123},{"uri":"Gerald_Scarfe","surface_form":"Gerald Scarfe","offset":163},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animation","offset":186},{"uri":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","surface_form":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","offset":220},{"uri":"Warner_Bros.","surface_form":"Warner Bros.","offset":271},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"trial","offset":445},{"uri":"Cannes_Film_Festival","surface_form":"Cannes Film Festival","offset":503}]}
