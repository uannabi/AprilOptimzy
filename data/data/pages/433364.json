The song features the R&B singer R. Kelly. The song was written by both Kelly and Gaga. \"Do What U Want\" has reached the top ten in Canada and the UK and the top twenty on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It charted moderately on other charts around the world. A music video has been made for the single but was never commercially released.\nA remix was released on January 1, 2014, featuring fellow pop singer Christina Aguilera, after she and Gaga performed the song on the competition series \"The Voice\", where Aguilera was a coach.\nIn January 2019, a documentary called \"Surviving R. Kelly\" was released which talked about Kelly's alleged relationships with women. Gaga later regretted working with him on the song and had the album version removed from all music stores and streaming services. She also claimed that she was a supporter for Kelly's alleged victims. Other than remixes, only the Christina Aguilera version of the song is still available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lady_Gaga","surface_form":"Lady Gaga","offset":30},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":58},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":80},{"uri":"Artpop","surface_form":"Artpop","offset":95},{"uri":"R._Kelly","surface_form":"R.
