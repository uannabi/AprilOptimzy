{"id":43346,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor","text":"\"Velociraptor\" was a small theropod dromaeosaur of the Upper Cretaceous, about 75\u201371 million years ago, and also a smaller relative of the famous \"Deinonychus\".\nIt was a slender, lightly built carnivore. It was about two meters long (nearly seven feet) and 0.62 meters tall at the hip, bigger than the common chimpanzee.\n\"Velociraptor\" had one sickle-shaped claw on its foot which measured 6.5 centimeters along its length, and a smaller one on each hand. \"Velociraptor\" was warm blooded and had feathers.\nFossils from China suggest that the whole clade had similar traits.\nFossils of \"Velociraptor\" were first found in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia in 1922. In 1988, scientists from China found \"Velociraptor\" skeletons in northern China.\nA famous \"Velociraptor\", discovered in 1971, was found attacking a \"Protoceratops\" in a fossil from Mongolia.\nFeathers.\nIn September 2007 researchers found quill knobs on the forearm of a \"Velociraptor\" found in Mongolia. These bumps on bird wing bones show where feathers anchor, and their presence on \"Velociraptor\" indicate it too had feathers.\nTurner and colleagues interpreted the presence of feathers on \"Velociraptor\" as evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly, making \"Velociraptor\" and \"Deinonychus\" secondarily flightless. This idea has since been discarded; the unmodified forearms count against it. Therefore, the feathers in the ancestors of \"Velociraptor\" had another function. The feathers of the flightless \"Velociraptor\" may have been used for display, for covering their nests while brooding.\nThe majority view is that dinosaur feathers were primarily adaptations for temperature regulation, and that other uses came later.\nSpecies.\nIn both cases the ecology of the time was dry, with sand dunes with occasional streams.\nMedia.\nFilms such as \"Jurassic Park\" and some of \"The Land Before Time\" films helped make \"Velociraptor\" popular. However, the raptors in Jurassic Park were far larger than the real thing. They were the size of \"Deinonychus\", a larger member of the same clade. The films also exaggerated its probable intelligence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":27},{"uri":"Dromaeosaur","surface_form":"dromaeosaur","offset":36},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":55},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":85},{"uri":"Deinonychus","surface_form":"Deinonychus","offset":147},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":193},{"uri":"Common_chimpanzee","surface_form":"common chimpanzee","offset":302},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":548},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"traits","offset":566},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"Fossil","offset":574},{"uri":"Gobi_Desert","surface_form":"Gobi Desert","offset":624},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":639},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":682},{"uri":"Protoceratops","surface_form":"Protoceratops","offset":806},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":838},{"uri":"Quill","surface_form":"quill","offset":894},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":1002},{"uri":"Deinonychus","surface_form":"Deinonychus","offset":1250},{"uri":"Display_(zoology)","surface_form":"display","offset":1515},{"uri":"Avian_incubation","surface_form":"brooding","offset":1555},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":1624},{"uri":"Homeostasis","surface_form":"temperature regulation","offset":1640},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":1723},{"uri":"Sand_dune","surface_form":"sand dune","offset":1757},{"uri":"Streams","surface_form":"streams","offset":1784},{"uri":"Jurassic_Park","surface_form":"Jurassic Park","offset":1815},{"uri":"The_Land_Before_Time","surface_form":"The Land Before Time","offset":1843},{"uri":"Deinonychus","surface_form":"Deinonychus","offset":2005},{"uri":"Intelligence","surface_form":"intelligence","offset":2094}]}
