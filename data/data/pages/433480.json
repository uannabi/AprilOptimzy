{"id":433480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_learning_disorder","text":"e=\"preserve\">A nonverbal learning disorder (or nonverbal learning disability), or NVLD, is a neurological problem. It can cause lower verbal skills, lower motor, social skills and other areas. A person with NVLD also has problems in non-verbal problem solving, understanding humor and rote learning (remembering something by repeating it).\nNVLD is linked with autism spectrum disorders, mostly autism or Asperger's. Most people with either high-functioning autism or Asperger fit this actual type. This condition, though, is also tied to depression and anxiety.\nNonverbal learning disabilities affect one in ten learning disabled children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurological","offset":93},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":244},{"uri":"Humour","surface_form":"humor","offset":275},{"uri":"Rote_learning","surface_form":"rote learning","offset":285},{"uri":"Autism_spectrum","surface_form":"autism spectrum","offset":360},{"uri":"Autism","surface_form":"autism","offset":394},{"uri":"Asperger_syndrome","surface_form":"Asperger","offset":404},{"uri":"High-functioning_autism","surface_form":"high-functioning autism","offset":440},{"uri":"Depression_(mental_illness)","surface_form":"depression","offset":538},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":553}]}
