{"id":43359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacosaurus","text":"\"Psittacosaurus\" was a small ceratopsian dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of what is now Asia, about 130 to 100 million years ago. It was more basal than other members of the Ceratopsia: it was bipedal, and had no horns or frill on its head. What made it a ceratopsian was its beak.\nIt is notable for being the most species-rich dinosaur genus, but there is no general agreement on these species. Nine to eleven species are named for fossils found in different regions of China, Mongolia and Russia, with a possible additional species from Thailand.\nAll species of \"Psittacosaurus\" were gazelle-sized bipedal herbivores with a high, powerful beak on the upper jaw. At least one species had long, quill-like structures on its tail and lower back, possibly with a display function. Psittacosaurs were early ceratopsians. They developed adaptations of their own, but they also shared features with later ceratopsians, such as \"Protoceratops\" and the elephant-sized \"Triceratops\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ceratopsian","surface_form":"ceratopsian","offset":29},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":41},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":59},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":91},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":145},{"uri":"Bipedal","surface_form":"bipedal","offset":196},{"uri":"Horn_(anatomy)","surface_form":"horns","offset":216},{"uri":"Frill","surface_form":"frill","offset":225},{"uri":"Beak","surface_form":"beak","offset":279},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":318},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":340},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":436},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":474},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":481},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":494},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":542},{"uri":"Gazelle","surface_form":"gazelle","offset":589},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":611},{"uri":"Beak","surface_form":"beak","offset":644},{"uri":"Quill","surface_form":"quill","offset":698},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":836},{"uri":"Protoceratops","surface_form":"Protoceratops","offset":926},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":949},{"uri":"Triceratops","surface_form":"Triceratops","offset":965}]}
