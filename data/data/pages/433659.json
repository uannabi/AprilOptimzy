{"id":433659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiderwebs","text":"=\"preserve\">\"Spiderwebs\" is a pop rock song by No Doubt. The lyrics are about a man who keeps calling Gwen and reciting bad poetry to her. It was released as a single in 1995. On the record charts it peaked near #5 three weeks after release.\nTwo separate music videos were made. One had exploding telephones. The other was set in a Japanese restaurant. Music Television (MTV) thought the telephone explosions were not good for young viewers to see, so they added more footage of the band.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pop_rock","surface_form":"pop rock","offset":30},{"uri":"No_Doubt","surface_form":"No Doubt","offset":47},{"uri":"Gwen_Stefani","surface_form":"Gwen","offset":102},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":124},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":160},{"uri":"Record_chart","surface_form":"record chart","offset":183},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":255},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":297},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":332},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":371}]}
