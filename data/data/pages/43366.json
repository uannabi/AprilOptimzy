{"id":43366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster","text":"Oysters are a family of bivalves with rough, thick shells, the Ostreidae. Some other types of shellfish are also called 'oyster'. Many species are edible, and are usually served raw. They are also good when cooked.\nIn the past, they were an important food source, especially in France and Britain. They used to grow in huge oyster beds, but were \"overfished\" in the 19th century. Nowadays they are more expensive, so eaten less often.\nOysters are usually harvested before they are fully grown. Left to themselves, they do grow quite large. A recent example was an oyster which was 11 inches long (29cm) and 3.7 lbs in weight (1.7kg). The BBC report says \"The family (firm) estimated it could be between '15 and 20 years old' due to its size. The world's largest oyster was 13.97 inches long (35.5cm) and 4.21 inches (10.7cm) in width. It was found in Denmark in December 2013, Guinness World Records said\".\nThe seawater the oysters were in does not stay in the oyster. Oysters (and shellfish generally) are purified while still alive before sale. That starts after they are harvested. The oysters are put into tanks pumped with clean water for 48 to 72 hours. That protects the consumer from any foul bacteria that the oyster might have picked up from the sea or river water.\nSome of the unrelated 'oysters' are the pearl oyster, \"Pinctada\", which is a clam, and a few mussels which look a bit like oysters when they are taken out of their shells.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bivalve","surface_form":"bivalve","offset":24},{"uri":"Ostreidae","surface_form":"Ostreidae","offset":63},{"uri":"Edible","surface_form":"edible","offset":147},{"uri":"Raw","surface_form":"raw","offset":178},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":278},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":289},{"uri":"Overfishing","surface_form":"overfished","offset":347},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":638},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":851},{"uri":"Guinness_World_Records","surface_form":"Guinness World Records","offset":877},{"uri":"Shellfish","surface_form":"shellfish","offset":982},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":1201},{"uri":"Pearl","surface_form":"pearl","offset":1316},{"uri":"Clam","surface_form":"clam","offset":1353},{"uri":"Mussels","surface_form":"mussels","offset":1369}]}
