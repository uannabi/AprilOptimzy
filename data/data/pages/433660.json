It was released as a single in 1995. The single did not chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (rules at the time required that a commercial single were released, one was not issued on the song). It did, however, reach #1 on Hot 100 Airplay for 16 weeks. The song also hit #1 in United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand.\nThis was the most successful international song from the group.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":39},{"uri":"No_Doubt","surface_form":"No Doubt","offset":47},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":145},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":193},{"uri":"Hot_100_Airplay","surface_form":"Hot 100 Airplay","offset":343},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":397},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":413},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":421},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":436},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":452}]}
