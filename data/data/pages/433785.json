{"id":433785,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Defence_Force","text":"The South African Defence Force (SADF) was the name of the South African military from 1957 to 1994. It replaced the Union Defence Force (UDF) in 1957. The SADF, in turn, was replaced by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in 1994.\nThe South African Defence Force had four branches: the South African Army, the South African Navy, the South African Air Force, and, the South African Medical Service.\nThe SADF implemented conscription of white South Africans. However, black, Indian, and Coloured South Africans could serve in the SADF as volunteers.\nWithin South Africa, the SADF was used to suppress opposition to apartheid, often directly supporting the South African Police. South African military units were also involved in the Angolan Civil War an the side of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. The SADF was also deployed during the related South African border and Namibian independence wars.\nNuclear weapons.\nSouth Africa was the only country in Africa to have nuclear weapons, but these weapons were destroyed by the South African government during the transition to democracy. South Africa has not built nuclear weapons since.\nIntegration.\nWith the a multiracial democracy introduced to South Africa in 1994, the SADF was merged with the defence forces of several formerly \"independent\" homelands, as well as the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the PAC's Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), and the self-protection units of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IPA). The new South African military became known as the South African National Defence Force.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["national military"],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":59},{"uri":"South_African_National_Defence_Force","surface_form":"South African National Defence Force","offset":191},{"uri":"South_African_Army","surface_form":"South African Army","offset":300},{"uri":"South_African_Navy","surface_form":"South African Navy","offset":324},{"uri":"South_African_Air_Force","surface_form":"South African Air Force","offset":348},{"uri":"South_African_Medical_Service","surface_form":"South African Medical Service","offset":382},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"conscription","offset":434},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white South Africans","offset":450},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black","offset":481},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":488},{"uri":"Coloured","surface_form":"Coloured","offset":500},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"apartheid","offset":628},{"uri":"South_African_Police","surface_form":"South African Police","offset":669},{"uri":"Angolan_Civil_War","surface_form":"Angolan Civil War","offset":746},{"uri":"UNITA","surface_form":"National Union for the Total Independence of Angola","offset":783},{"uri":"Jonas_Savimbi","surface_form":"Jonas Savimbi","offset":868},{"uri":"South_African_Border_War","surface_form":"South African border","offset":929},{"uri":"Namibian_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"Namibian independence","offset":954},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1036},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapon","surface_form":"nuclear weapon","offset":1051},{"uri":"African_National_Congress","surface_form":"ANC's","offset":1405},{"uri":"Umkhonto_we_Sizwe","surface_form":"Umkhonto we Sizwe","offset":1411},{"uri":"Pan_Africanist_Congress_of_Azania","surface_form":"PAC's","offset":1456},{"uri":"Azanian_People%27s_Liberation_Army","surface_form":"Azanian People's Liberation Army","offset":1462},{"uri":"Inkatha_Freedom_Party","surface_form":"Inkatha Freedom Party","offset":1540}]}
