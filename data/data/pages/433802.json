He is the 23rd and current Prime Minister of Canada. He is also the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. He was elected leader on April 14, 2013. After leading his party to a majority government win in the 2015 federal election, Trudeau became the Prime Minister.\nTrudeau is the eldest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He is the second child in Canadian history to be born while one of his parents was prime minister; the first was John A. Macdonald's youngest daughter Margaret Mary Macdonald.\nTrudeau earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature from McGill University and a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of British Columbia. After he graduated, Trudeau worked as a social studies and French teacher. He taught at West Point Grey Academy and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nOn March 12, 2020, Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gr\u00E9goire Trudeau isolated themselves, after she showed flu-like symptoms during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic. The Prime Minister's Office announced later that day that she had tested positive for COVID-19.\nIn opposition.\nTrudeau was elected for the first time in the 2008 federal election. He was the nominee for the Liberal Party in the electoral area of Papineau. He won more votes than the incumbent, Vivian Barbot of the Bloc Qu\u00E9b\u00E9cois.\n2015 federal election.\nOn October 19, 2015, Trudeau and the Liberals won the most seats in the federal election. This was after one of the longest campaigns in over 100 years. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons and 39.5% of the total vote. Because of this, they formed a majority government. Their seat count went up by 150 compared to the 2011 federal election.\nThe results were the second-best in the history of the Liberal Party. They did very well in the eastern half of Canada. They won all of the seats in Atlantic Canada and Toronto and won 40 seats in Quebec. In Quebec, they won the most seats since Pierre Trudeau's win in the 1980 election. It was also the first time since 1980 that the Liberals won more than half the seats in Quebec. The 150 seat gain was the biggest gain for any party in an election since Canadian Confederation. It was also the first time that a party went from third place in seat count to a majority government.\nPrime Minister of Canada.\nTrudeau and the Cabinet he chose were sworn in by the Governor General David Johnston on November 4, 2015.\n2019 federal election.\nTrudeau visited the Governor General, Julie Payette on September 11, 2019. This was to ask that Parliament be dissolved and new elections would begin.\nPersonal life.\nTrudeau first met his wife, Sophie Gr\u00E9goire, when they were both children growing up in Montreal. Gr\u00E9goire was a friend of Trudeau's brother, Michel. He married her on May 28, 2005 in a Catholic wedding at the Sainte-Madeleine d'Outremont Church in Montreal. They have three children together: a son, Xavier James Trudeau (born October 18, 2007), a daughter, Ella-Grace Margaret Trudeau (born February 5, 2009), and another son, Hadrien Gr\u00E9goire Trudeau (born February 28, 2014).","categories":[],"infobox_types":["CanadianMP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":58},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":67},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Canada","offset":106},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Canada","surface_form":"Liberal Party of Canada","offset":161},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":256},{"uri":"2015_Canadian_federal_election","surface_form":"2015 federal election","offset":287},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":381},{"uri":"Pierre_Trudeau","surface_form":"Pierre Trudeau","offset":396},{"uri":"John_A._Macdonald","surface_form":"John A.
