{"id":43392,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumour","text":"A tumour (or tumor) is tissue that is growing where it should not be. Another name for a tumor is neoplasm. Tumours are either malignant (harmful) or benign (safe). Cancer, for example is malignant and sometimes spreads to other places on the body. Some tumours have a cause that makes them grow. For some tumours no cause is known. A tumour usually forms as a lump or mass.\nThe Tasmanian Devils in Tasmania, Australia are in danger of becoming extinct because of a malignant tumour that grows on their face.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":23},{"uri":"Malignant","surface_form":"malignant","offset":127},{"uri":"Benign","surface_form":"benign","offset":150},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"Cancer","offset":165},{"uri":"Metastasis","surface_form":"spreads to other places","offset":212},{"uri":"Tasmanian_Devil","surface_form":"Tasmanian Devil","offset":379},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":399},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":409},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":445}]}
