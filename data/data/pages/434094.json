There are two kinds of childlessness, voluntary and involuntary.\nVoluntary childlessness is sometimes called childfree.\nOptions for involuntary childlessness.\nSometimes a couple can have a child through artificial insemination, when a sperm is place in a woman's uterus immediately after ovulation. Another option is in vitro fertilization (or IVF). In this process, a sperm and an egg are placed together until fertilization happens, then the egg is put into the uterus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":43},{"uri":"Childfree","surface_form":"childfree","offset":209},{"uri":"Artificial_insemination","surface_form":"artificial insemination","offset":303},{"uri":"In_vitro_fertilization","surface_form":"in vitro fertilization","offset":417}]}
