{"id":434135,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Aardvark","text":"\"The Ant and the Aardvark\" is a series of 17 theatrical short cartoons produced at DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises and released by United Artists between March 5, 1969 and June 16, 1971.\nPlot.\nThe cartoons follow attempts of a blue aardvark named Aardvark (voiced by John Byner impersonating comedian Jackie Mason), to catch and eat a red ant named Charlie (also voiced by John Byner, but impersonating Dean Martin. Aardvark does this by inhaling with a loud vacuum cleaner sound. In the episode \"Rough Brunch\", he claims that his name is simply \"Aardvark.\" Charlie Ant gives his nemesis several names as sly terms of endearment (Ol' Sam, Ol' Ben, Ol' Blue, Claude, Pal, Buddy, Daddy-O). In several bumper sequences of \"The Pink Panther Show\", he is called \"Blue Aardvark.\"\nFilmography.\nAll the voices were provided by John Byner unless otherwise noted.\nProduction.\n\"The Ant and the Aardvark\" series was originally released by United Artists. Seventeen theatrical shorts were produced in the original series, and were subsequently featured in various television syndication packages, usually shown with DFE's other characters such as the Pink Panther and The Inspector. Most of the 17 entries appear in their television syndication form (complete with an audible laugh track added by NBC-TV) on the video on demand service Amazon Video.\nWhen \"The Ant and the Aardvark\" first appeared on \"The New Pink Panther Show\" in the fall of 1971, the series became wildly popular, so much in fact that the duo became a featured part of the NBC series. Even though the 17 entries remained popular throughout the broadcast run of \"The Pink Panther Show\", no new entries were produced.\nThe series used several unique production techniques for the period. The aardvark's body was solid blue: his only clothes\u2014a pair of blue shorts and matching T-shirt\u2014were a matching blue. Similarly, Charlie Ant was solid red, and did not sport any clothing. As such, the character's solid colors allowed them to stand out clearly against the multi-colored backgrounds featured prominently in the series. Charlie also sported half-closed eyes, as a sign of a bon viveur.\nMusical director Doug Goodwin was responsible for the jazzy music score. Goodwin assembled an established group of jazz session musicians to perform the series' theme music and musical cues. For the first time in animated cartoons, all six musicians\u2014Ray Brown, Billy Byers, Pete Candoli, Shelly Manne, Jimmy Rowles, and Tommy Tedesco\u2014received on-screen credit.\nArt Leonardi was responsible for the main title graphic for all DePatie-Freleng entries. For \"The Ant and the Aardvark \"series, Leonardi expanded on a technique first introduced for the first Pink Panther cartoon, \"The Pink Phink\". This entailed tearing paper into the forms of objects and characters to form stylized images.\nGerman version.\nIn the German-dubbed versions of the cartoon, the male aardvark is transformed into a female anteater named Elise (Eliza). Charlie (voiced by Fred Maire) remains male; Elise is voiced by Marianne Wischmann. The cartoons are known under the title \"Die blaue Elise\" (\"Blue Eliza\").\nRevivals.\nThe first revival featured the characters as part on the 1993 incarnation of \"The Pink Panther\". The characters remained unchanged, though unlike the original 1969-1971 cartoons, they do not appear in their own segments but rather are included in segments featuring the Pink Panther (now voiced by Matt Frewer). John Byner returned to voice both Charlie Ant and the Aardvark.\nThe second revival occurred in 2010 as part of \"Pink Panther and Pals\". Eddie Garvar voices the Aardvark, who retains his previous characterization. Kel Mitchell, using his natural voice, voices the Ant.\nHome releases.\nThe complete series was digitally remastered and issued on its own single-disc DVD collection by MGM Home Entertainment/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2007 as \"Pink Panther and Friends, Volume 5: The Ant and the Aardvark\".\nThe complete series reappeared in January 2009 as part of the DVD collection \"Pink Panther & Friends Classic Cartoon Collection\" by MGM Home Entertainment, a 9-disc DVD set containing all \"Pink Panther\", \"Ant and the Aardvark\", \"Inspector\" and (for the first time on DVD) \"Roland and Rattfink\" cartoons.\n\"The Ant and the Aardvark\" was released onto Region 1/A Blu-ray and DVD on 27 April 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["character"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":62},{"uri":"DePatie%E2%80%93Freleng_Enterprises","surface_form":"DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises","offset":83},{"uri":"United_Artists","surface_form":"United Artists","offset":127},{"uri":"Aardvark","surface_form":"aardvark","offset":228},{"uri":"John_Byner","surface_form":"John Byner","offset":263},{"uri":"Jackie_Mason","surface_form":"Jackie Mason","offset":297},{"uri":"Dean_Martin","surface_form":"Dean Martin","offset":399},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":484},{"uri":"Nemesis","surface_form":"nemesis","offset":576},{"uri":"Endearment","surface_form":"endearment","offset":614},{"uri":"The_Pink_Panther_Show","surface_form":"The Pink Panther Show","offset":716},{"uri":"United_Artists","surface_form":"United Artists","offset":923},{"uri":"Television_syndication","surface_form":"television syndication","offset":1047},{"uri":"Pink_Panther_(character)","surface_form":"Pink Panther","offset":1134},{"uri":"The_Inspector","surface_form":"The Inspector","offset":1151},{"uri":"Laugh_track","surface_form":"laugh track","offset":1259},{"uri":"Video_on_demand","surface_form":"video on demand","offset":1295},{"uri":"Amazon_Video","surface_form":"Amazon Video","offset":1319},{"uri":"Bon_viveur","surface_form":"bon viveur","offset":2125},{"uri":"Ray_Brown_(musician)","surface_form":"Ray Brown","offset":2387},{"uri":"Billy_Byers","surface_form":"Billy Byers","offset":2398},{"uri":"Pete_Candoli","surface_form":"Pete Candoli","offset":2411},{"uri":"Shelly_Manne","surface_form":"Shelly Manne","offset":2425},{"uri":"Jimmy_Rowles","surface_form":"Jimmy Rowles","offset":2439},{"uri":"Tommy_Tedesco","surface_form":"Tommy Tedesco","offset":2457},{"uri":"Art_Leonardi","surface_form":"Art Leonardi","offset":2498},{"uri":"The_Pink_Phink","surface_form":"The Pink Phink","offset":2713},{"uri":"Fred_Maire","surface_form":"Fred Maire","offset":2982},{"uri":"Marianne_Wischmann","surface_form":"Marianne Wischmann","offset":3027},{"uri":"The_Pink_Panther_(1993_TV_series)","surface_form":"The Pink Panther","offset":3208},{"uri":"Matt_Frewer","surface_form":"Matt Frewer","offset":3428},{"uri":"Pink_Panther_and_Pals","surface_form":"Pink Panther and Pals","offset":3554},{"uri":"Kel_Mitchell","surface_form":"Kel Mitchell","offset":3655},{"uri":"MGM_Home_Entertainment","surface_form":"MGM Home Entertainment","offset":3822},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox_Home_Entertainment","surface_form":"20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","offset":3845},{"uri":"MGM_Home_Entertainment","surface_form":"MGM Home Entertainment","offset":4088},{"uri":"The_Inspector","surface_form":"Inspector","offset":4185},{"uri":"Roland_and_Rattfink","surface_form":"Roland and Rattfink","offset":4229}]}
