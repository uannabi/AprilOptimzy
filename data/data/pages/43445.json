{"id":43445,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(dog)","text":"A chihuahua is a very small kind of dog and is bred to be a pet.\nAppearance.\nThey can reach a height of 6-9 inches (12.7\u201320.3\u00A0cm) and a weight of 2\u20136 pounds (0.9\u20132.7\u00A0kg). Chihuahuas can have a long or short coat, and come in many different colors. These are black, white, beige, brown, and dark brown. They only need grooming once a week if short coat or it may be twice if you have a long coat. Chihuahuas can have up to six puppies because of their small bodies.\nOrigins.\nThe Chihuahua's start goes back to Mexico as the descendants of the Techichi, a long haired and silent dog. The Techichi was liked by the Toltec people, one of the indigenous (original) people of Mexico. Chihuahuas are believed to have been made by breeding the Techichi and Chinese Crested Dogs (a type of small hairless dog) to form today's Chihuahuas.\nAnother possible start for Chihuahuas was the breeding of Techichis with Spanish terriers, which were well liked at the time and were known for their small body and black and tan colors. Mating with another type of dog increased the loudness of the Techichi's bark while making it smaller.\nChihuahuas were named after the Chihuahua state in Mexico. The word Chihuahua comes from the Na'huatl word \"xicuagua\", which means \"sandy, dry place\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Small","surface_form":"small","offset":22},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":36},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":60},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":108},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"pounds","offset":150},{"uri":"Long","surface_form":"long","offset":193},{"uri":"Short","surface_form":"short","offset":201},{"uri":"Coat_(dog)","surface_form":"coat","offset":207},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":240},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":258},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":509},{"uri":"Toltec","surface_form":"Toltec","offset":612},{"uri":"Indigenous","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":638},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":723},{"uri":"Chinese_Crested_Dog","surface_form":"Chinese Crested Dog","offset":749},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":875},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":902},{"uri":"Terrier","surface_form":"terrier","offset":910},{"uri":"Chihuahua_(state)","surface_form":"Chihuahua state","offset":1151},{"uri":"Na%27huatl","surface_form":"Na'huatl","offset":1212}]}
