{"id":43447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugops","text":"\"Rugops\" was a dinosaur related to \"Carnotaurus\". It lived in what is now Africa, about 95 million years ago. It was a medium-sized carnivorous dinosaur, up to 27 feet long.\n\"Rugops\" lived at the same time \"Spinosaurus\", \"Carcharodontosaurus\", and \"Deltadromeus\", in the Upper Cretaceous.\n\"Rugops\" was a carnivore, with weak jaws and small teeth. It may have been a scavenger, feeding on dead animals. It also may have preyed on sauropods, such as \"Paralititan\" and \"Aegyptosaurus\", and ornithopods, such as \"Ouranosaurus\". The name \"Rugops\" means \"wrinkled face\". The bony wrinkles on its snout may have helped to support a structure, such as horny crest or a wattle, like on a rooster or a turkey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":15},{"uri":"Carnotaurus","surface_form":"Carnotaurus","offset":36},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":91},{"uri":"Spinosaurus","surface_form":"Spinosaurus","offset":207},{"uri":"Carcharodontosaurus","surface_form":"Carcharodontosaurus","offset":222},{"uri":"Deltadromeus","surface_form":"Deltadromeus","offset":249},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":271},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":304},{"uri":"Paralititan","surface_form":"Paralititan","offset":449},{"uri":"Aegyptosaurus","surface_form":"Aegyptosaurus","offset":467},{"uri":"Ouranosaurus","surface_form":"Ouranosaurus","offset":509},{"uri":"Rooster","surface_form":"rooster","offset":679},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"turkey","offset":692}]}
