{"id":434584,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockjumper","text":"Rockjumpers are a genus (\"Chaetops\") and family (Chaetopidae) of small birds. They are found in southern Africa, around the Lesotho highlands and South Africa. The birds are omnivorous, meaning that they eat both plants and animals.\nThere are two species: the Cape Rockjumper and the Drakensberg Rockjumper. The two species have very similar appearances. They are mostly brown and red with plumage. They also have long white and black tails, black throats, orange bellies, and grey and black patterned backs and wings. The closest relative to the birds, although being very different in appearance are the Picathartes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":18},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":41},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":71},{"uri":"Lesotho","surface_form":"Lesotho","offset":124},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":146},{"uri":"Omnivorous","surface_form":"omnivorous","offset":174},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":247},{"uri":"Plumage","surface_form":"plumage","offset":390},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":435},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":448},{"uri":"Belly","surface_form":"bellies","offset":464},{"uri":"Pattern","surface_form":"pattern","offset":492},{"uri":"Relative","surface_form":"relative","offset":531},{"uri":"Picathartes","surface_form":"Picathartes","offset":606}]}
