Oswald was killed in this battle. According to legend, one of his arms was carried to an ash tree by a raven. Miracles were then attributed to the tree (as Oswald was considered a saint). The Welsh who held this area at the time called it \"Croes-Oswellt\" (meaning Oswald's cross). During the Anglo-Saxon period the town was called Oswald's Tree. Later this became Oswestry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":27},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":51},{"uri":"Market_town","surface_form":"market town","offset":83},{"uri":"Civil_parishes_in_England","surface_form":"civil parish","offset":99},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":115},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":127},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":149},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":201},{"uri":"Telford","surface_form":"Telford","offset":223},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":235},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"Census","offset":256},{"uri":"Urban","surface_form":"urban","offset":326},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":501},{"uri":"Heritage","surface_form":"heritage","offset":509},{"uri":"Shropshire_Council","surface_form":"Shropshire libraries","offset":541},{"uri":"Battle_of_Maserfield","surface_form":"Battle of Maserfield","offset":599},{"uri":"Penda_of_Mercia","surface_form":"Penda of Mercia","offset":671},{"uri":"Oswald_of_Northumbria","surface_form":"Oswald of Northumbria","offset":691},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":740},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":761},{"uri":"Ash_tree","surface_form":"ash tree","offset":803},{"uri":"Raven","surface_form":"raven","offset":817},{"uri":"Miracle","surface_form":"Miracle","offset":824},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":894},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":1006}]}
