{"id":434712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath","text":"A sabbath is a day reserved for rest or prayer, usually each week. The word \"Sabbath\" comes from the Hebrew word \"Shabbat\" (). This word is built from the Hebrew root \"Sh-B-T,\" meaning rest.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, or \"Tanakh,\" the root \"Sh-B-T\" is used to describe God resting on the seventh day. This is the day after He finished creating the universe. In the Bible, the idea of \"Shabbat,\" or \"Sabbath,\" as a holy day of rest starts there.\nRemembering and keeping Sabbath is also one of the Ten Commandments. From that, the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) all have a tradition of a holy day of rest or prayer set aside every week. These days are now very different from each other, including which day of the week they fall on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":15},{"uri":"Leisure","surface_form":"rest","offset":32},{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":40},{"uri":"Week","surface_form":"week","offset":61},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":101},{"uri":"Root_(linguistics)","surface_form":"root","offset":162},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":198},{"uri":"Tanakh","surface_form":"Tanakh","offset":216},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":263},{"uri":"Create","surface_form":"creating","offset":329},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":490},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religion","offset":523},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":544},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":553},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":570},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":588}]}
