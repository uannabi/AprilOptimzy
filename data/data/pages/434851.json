Glia are said to be the glue of the nervous system. Glia occur in both grey matter and white matter.\nGlia may have more functions than just these four.\nRole in degenerative brain diseases.\nA type of glial cell are thought to play a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or motor neurone disease), Alzheimer's disease (a type of dementia) and Parkinson's disease.\nThe microglia are the macrophages of the nervous system. In these neurodegenerative disorders, it is thought that the microglia digest healthy brain cells, causing the degeneration of brain function. This is especially true for Parkinson's disease, where the Glia break down dopaminergic cells, causing the symptoms associated with Parkinson's.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":38},{"uri":"Grey_matter","surface_form":"grey matter","offset":154},{"uri":"White_matter","surface_form":"white matter","offset":170},{"uri":"Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","surface_form":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","offset":323},{"uri":"Motor_neurone_disease","surface_form":"motor neurone disease","offset":361},{"uri":"Alzheimer%27s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer's disease","offset":385},{"uri":"Dementia","surface_form":"dementia","offset":416},{"uri":"Parkinson%27s_disease","surface_form":"Parkinson's disease","offset":430},{"uri":"Macrophage","surface_form":"macrophage","offset":473}]}
