{"id":435095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation","text":"=\"preserve\">Computation is the act of determining (working out) something by processing information. It involves using specific rules, either mathematical or logical. It may or may not involve using numbers; the computation of numbers and arithmetic is generally called \"calculation\". The study of computation is called computer science.\nThe theory of computation involves determining whether a certain problem can be solved by computation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Determine","surface_form":"determining","offset":38},{"uri":"Information_processing","surface_form":"processing","offset":77},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":88},{"uri":"Protocol","surface_form":"rules","offset":128},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":142},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":158},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":199},{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":239},{"uri":"Calculation","surface_form":"calculation","offset":271},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":320},{"uri":"Theory_of_computation","surface_form":"theory of computation","offset":342}]}
