It says that, if you have a triangle like the one in the picture, the equation below is true.\nThis is another version, which is also true.\nD is equal to the diameter of the triangle's circumcircle.\nThe law of sines is used to find the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known. This is known as triangulation. The law of sines can also be used when two sides and one of the angles not enclosed by the two sides are known. In some such cases, the formula gives two possible values for the enclosed angle. This is called an \"ambiguous case\".\nThe law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations which is used to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles. The other is the law of cosines.\nProof.\nThe area formula_1 of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height (drawn from the vertex not on the base). Depending on which side one chooses to be the base, the area can be given by\nMultiplying these by formula_1 gives","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":36},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":47},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":130},{"uri":"Circumcircle","surface_form":"circumcircle","offset":244},{"uri":"Triangulation","surface_form":"triangulation","offset":380},{"uri":"Law_of_cosines","surface_form":"law of cosines","offset":760}]}
