{"id":435191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A%2A","text":"Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a bright astronomical radio source at the center of the Milky Way. It is in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius.\nThe radio source is part of a larger astronomical feature known as Sagittarius A. Sagittarius A* is thought to be a supermassive black hole, like those that are at the centers of most spiral and elliptical galaxies. Observations of the star S2 in orbit around Sagittarius A* were used to show the presence of the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. This led to the conclusion that Sagittarius A* is the site of that black hole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":49},{"uri":"Galactic_center","surface_form":"center","offset":69},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":83},{"uri":"Sagittarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Sagittarius","offset":139},{"uri":"Scorpius","surface_form":"Scorpius","offset":155},{"uri":"Sagittarius_A","surface_form":"Sagittarius A","offset":232},{"uri":"Supermassive_black_hole","surface_form":"supermassive black hole","offset":281},{"uri":"Spiral_galaxy","surface_form":"spiral","offset":349},{"uri":"Elliptical_galaxy","surface_form":"elliptical galaxies","offset":360},{"uri":"S2_(star)","surface_form":"S2","offset":406}]}
