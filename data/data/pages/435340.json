The role of the South African Navy is to conduct naval operations in defence of the Republic of South Africa.\nThe current organisation of the South African Navy dates back to 1 April 1922, when the South African Naval Service (SANS) was created. (However, colonial naval volunteer units date back as far as 1861.) The South African Naval Service was later expanded and renamed to the South African Naval Forces (SANF). In 1951, the South African Naval Forces was renamed to the South African Navy and the ship title HMSAS (His Majesty's South African Ship) was changed to SAS (South African Ship) one year later.\nStrength.\nThe South African Navy has a strength of 6,104 active military personnel. The navy is divided into a Combat Fleet and a Support Fleet. The Combat Fleet is made up of five Valour-class frigates, three Heroine-class submarines, three Warrior-class patrol vessels, three T-class patrol vessels, three River-class mine countermeasures vessels, and twenty-one Namacurra-class harbour patrol boats. The Support Fleet is made up of one replenishment vessel, one Hecla-class survey vessel, and three tugboats. The navy also includes an infantry-trained special forces unit called the Maritime Reaction Squadron (MRS).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"navy","offset":30},{"uri":"South_African_National_Defence_Force","surface_form":"South African National Defence Force","offset":42},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":757},{"uri":"Frigate","surface_form":"frigate","offset":887},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":917},{"uri":"Tugboat","surface_form":"tugboat","offset":1195},{"uri":"Infantry","surface_form":"infantry","offset":1231}]}
