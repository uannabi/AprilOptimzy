{"id":435433,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Anacletus","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pope Anacletus, also sometimes referred to as Pope Cletus, was the third Pope of the Catholic Church, (the official title is Bishop of Rome). He served from 76-88 C.E. He established a Christian community in Ruvo, Apulia, where he baptized Christian followers in secret.\nAfter the death of the second Pope, Linus, Anacletus returned to Rome. He divided the area into what would today be called parishes or small groups. He established a small chapel near the burial sites of Peter and Linus which is the site of today's Basilica of St. Peter.\nHe was killed during the reign of the Emperor Domitian for being a Christian leader. He was also buried near Peter and Linus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":86},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":98},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":198},{"uri":"Apulia","surface_form":"Apulia","offset":227},{"uri":"Baptized","surface_form":"baptized","offset":244},{"uri":"Pope_Linus","surface_form":"Linus","offset":320},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":349},{"uri":"Chapel","surface_form":"chapel","offset":456},{"uri":"Saint_Peter","surface_form":"Peter","offset":488},{"uri":"Pope_Linus","surface_form":"Linus","offset":498},{"uri":"Basilica","surface_form":"Basilica of St. Peter","offset":533},{"uri":"Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor Domitian","offset":594}]}
