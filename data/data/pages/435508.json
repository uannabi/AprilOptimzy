{"id":435508,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)","text":"Romance is a feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love. In relationships, it involves a strong emotional attraction towards the other person. A romantic relationship focuses on feelings rather than sex. Romantic love is the opposite of platonic love.\nRomance is often strongest at the beginning of relationships. It comes with uncertainty and anxiety that the love may not be returned.\nAn example of love is that of Carla, for Quinten, as she loves him most.\nThe modern concept of romantic love comes from the medieval ideals of chivalry, as set out in its chivalric romance literature. It was made popular in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Knights were often said to have had intimate relationships with the noble ladies they served. These relationships were usually not physical. Since marriage was commonly just a formal arrangement without love, courtly love allowed women to be emotionally intimate with a man.\nRomance is a major theme found in art, particularly literature and fiction. It is often found in fairy tales, women's fiction and the writings of people like William Shakespeare.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"feeling","offset":13},{"uri":"Excitement","surface_form":"excitement","offset":24},{"uri":"Mystery","surface_form":"mystery","offset":39},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":63},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":72},{"uri":"Intimacy","surface_form":"strong","offset":101},{"uri":"Attraction","surface_form":"attraction","offset":118},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":211},{"uri":"Platonic_love","surface_form":"platonic love","offset":249},{"uri":"Uncertainty","surface_form":"uncertainty","offset":340},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":356},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":523},{"uri":"Chivalry","surface_form":"chivalry","offset":542},{"uri":"Chivalric_romance","surface_form":"chivalric romance","offset":570},{"uri":"Western_culture","surface_form":"Western culture","offset":623},{"uri":"Courtly_love","surface_form":"courtly love","offset":657},{"uri":"Knight","surface_form":"Knight","offset":671},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"noble","offset":739},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":818},{"uri":"Arranged_marriage","surface_form":"arrangement","offset":854},{"uri":"Theme","surface_form":"theme","offset":965},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":980},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":998},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":1013},{"uri":"Fairy_tale","surface_form":"fairy tale","offset":1043},{"uri":"Women%27s_fiction","surface_form":"women's fiction","offset":1056},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":1104}]}
