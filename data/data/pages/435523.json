This usually depends on that person's own conscience, their understanding of right and wrong. Guilt is usually related to remorse (\"feeling sorry\").\nGuilt can sometimes cause anxiety. A person may react to their guilt in either a peaceful or violent way. A person might begin blaming the victim of their own actions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"feeling","offset":11},{"uri":"Realise","surface_form":"realise","offset":47},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"believe","offset":58},{"uri":"Conscience","surface_form":"conscience","offset":145},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"right and wrong","offset":180},{"uri":"Remorse","surface_form":"remorse","offset":225},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":278},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peaceful","offset":333},{"uri":"Violent","surface_form":"violent","offset":345}]}
