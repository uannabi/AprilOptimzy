He was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989, for co-developing the ion trap technique with Wolfgang Paul. They shared one-half of the prize (the other half of the Prize in that year was awarded to Norman Foster Ramsey). Their technique was used for high precision measurement of the electron g-factor.\nDehmelt died on 7 March 2017 in the Seattle, Washington from natural causes, aged 94.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":59},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":71},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":80},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":106},{"uri":"Ion_trap","surface_form":"ion trap","offset":160},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Paul","surface_form":"Wolfgang Paul","offset":184},{"uri":"Norman_Foster_Ramsey","surface_form":"Norman Foster Ramsey","offset":290},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":376},{"uri":"G-factor_(physics)","surface_form":"g-factor","offset":385},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":431},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":440},{"uri":"Natural_causes","surface_form":"natural causes","offset":456}]}
