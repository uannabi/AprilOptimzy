{"id":435860,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function","text":"In mathematics, a constant function is a function whose output value is the same for every input value. For example, the function formula_1 is a constant function because the value of \u00A0formula_1 \u00A0is 4 regardless of the input value formula_1 (see image).\nBasic properties.\nFormally, a constant function \"f\"(\"x\"):R\u2192R has the form \u00A0formula_1. Usually we write formula_1 \u00A0or just \u00A0formula_1.\nExample: The function \u00A0formula_1 \u00A0or just \u00A0formula_1 \u00A0is the specific constant function where the output value is \u00A0formula_1. The domain is all real numbers \u211D. The codomain is just. Namely, \"y\"(0)=4, \"y\"(\u22122.7)=4, \"y\"(\u03C0)=4... No matter what value of \"x\" is input, the output is \"4\".\nDerivative of a constant function.\nIn the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function measures the rate of change of function (output) values with respect to change in input values. A constant function does not change, so its derivative is 0. This is often written: \u00A0formula_1\u00A0.\nExample: \u00A0formula_1\u00A0 is a constant function. The derivative of \"y\" is the identically zero function \u00A0 formula_1 \u00A0.\nThe converse (opposite) is also true. That is, if the derivative of a function is zero everywhere, then the function is a constant function.\nGeneralization.\nA function \"f\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" is a constant function if \"f\"(\"a\") = \"f\"(\"b\") for every \"a\" and \"b\" in \"A\".\nExamples.\nReal-world example: A store where every item is sold for 1 euro. The domain of this function is \"items in the store\". The codomain is \"1 euro\".\nExample: Let \"f\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" where \"A\"= and \"B\"= and \"f\"(\"a\")=3 for every \"a\"\u2208\"A\". Then \"f\" is a constant function.\nExample: \"z\"(\"x\",\"y\")=2 is the constant function from \"A\"=\u211D\u00B2 to \"B\"=\u211D where every point (\"x\",\"y\")\u2208\u211D\u00B2 is mapped to the value \"z\"=2. The graph of this constant function is the horizontal plane (parallel to the \"x\"0\"y\" plane) in 3-dimensional space that passes through the point (0,0,2).\nExample: The polar function \"\u03C1\"(\"\u03C6\")=2.5 is the constant function that maps every \"angle\" \u03C6 to the \"radius\" \u03C1=2.5. The graph of this function is the circle of radius 2.5 in the plane.\nOther properties.\nThere are other properties of constant functions.
