{"id":435888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_skating","text":"Inline skating is a kind of skating. It involves a person moving across land using shoes that have wheels on the bottom. It is similar to roller skating, except that the wheels are smaller and are in a single line. Inline skating is also called rollerblading, after the \"Rollerblade\" brand of skates..\nInline skates usually have between 2 and 5 polyurethane wheels. These wheels are arranged in a single line. This allows for faster speeds than roller skates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skate","surface_form":"skating","offset":28},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"moving","offset":58},{"uri":"Shoe","surface_form":"shoe","offset":83},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":99},{"uri":"Roller_skating","surface_form":"roller skating","offset":138},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":209},{"uri":"Rollerblade","surface_form":"Rollerblade","offset":271},{"uri":"Brand","surface_form":"brand","offset":284},{"uri":"Polyurethane","surface_form":"polyurethane","offset":345}]}
