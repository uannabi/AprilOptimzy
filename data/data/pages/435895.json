{"id":435895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_floss","text":"Candy floss is sugar that is spun with air. It is also called cotton candy or fairy floss. It is spun in machines. When spun, a small amount of sugar creates a much larger serving of candy floss. This is because it is mostly air. It is usually served on a stick or in a bag. Food colouring is sometimes used to change the natural white colour. Flavour is also sometimes added. Candy floss is often sold at fairs or circuses.\nCandy floss was first made in Europe in the 18th century. At that time, spun sugar was expensive. The average person could not afford it. Machines to spin the sugar were invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C. Wharton. They introduced it at the World's Fair in 1904, under the name \"Fairy Floss\". It was very successful. They sold 68,655 boxes at 25 cents each box (equivalent to US$6 per box today). In UAE it sold in 5 AED.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":15},{"uri":"Spin","surface_form":"spun","offset":29},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":39},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":105},{"uri":"Food_colouring","surface_form":"Food colouring","offset":275},{"uri":"Flavour","surface_form":"Flavour","offset":344},{"uri":"Carnival","surface_form":"fairs","offset":406},{"uri":"Circus","surface_form":"circus","offset":415},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":455},{"uri":"World%27s_Fair","surface_form":"World's Fair","offset":679}]}
