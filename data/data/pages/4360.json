{"id":4360,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass","text":"Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Some types of brass are called bronzes.\nBrass has a golden appearance. It is harder than pure metals and resists corrosion. It costs more than zinc.\nProperties.\nBrass is more malleable than bronze or zinc. The melting point of brass can be 900 to 940 \u00B0C or 1,650 to 1,720 \u00B0F, depending on what it is made of. The density of brass is 8.4 to 8.73 g/cm3 (0.303 to 0.315 lb/cu in).\nToday, almost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled. Brass is not ferromagnetic. Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry. In the foundry, it is melted and recast into billets. The billets are heated and streched into the form and size that is wanted.\nBrass will corrode when it is exposed to moisture, chlorides, acetates, ammonia, and some acids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":12},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":21},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":32},{"uri":"Bronzes","surface_form":"bronzes","offset":69},{"uri":"Corrosion","surface_form":"corrosion","offset":151},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":181},{"uri":"Malleable","surface_form":"malleable","offset":213},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":228},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":238},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":248},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":351},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloys","offset":447},{"uri":"Recycling","surface_form":"recycled","offset":458},{"uri":"Ferromagnetism","surface_form":"ferromagnetic","offset":481},{"uri":"Scrap","surface_form":"scrap","offset":502},{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"transported","offset":525},{"uri":"Foundry","surface_form":"foundry","offset":544},{"uri":"Billet","surface_form":"billets","offset":598},{"uri":"Corrode","surface_form":"corrode","offset":693},{"uri":"Chloride","surface_form":"chlorides","offset":733},{"uri":"Acetate","surface_form":"acetates","offset":744},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":754},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acids","offset":772}]}
