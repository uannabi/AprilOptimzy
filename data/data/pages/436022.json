On May 15, 2011, he became Cultural Counselor and Head of Educational Mission at the Embassy of Egypt in Berlin.\nEarly life and education.\nHe attended high school in Cairo. In 1979, he registered at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University. In July 1981, he was looking for a summer job as a student. He went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and met with Dr. Mohamed Saleh, the vice director of the museum. He worked there for one month. In summer 1982, he worked at the museum again for a summer student job. He did work that brought him in contact with all departments of the museum. In 1983, he graduated at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University.\nAfter his graduation, he worked again for the museum for one month for free. After that, he joined the restoration team of the Coptic Museum for several months. In January 1984, he started his 15 month long conscription service. He worked at the museum again from April 1985 to September 1987. He rejoined his Faculty at Cairo University to resume higher studies. The thesis of his Master's Degree was \"St- Meskhnet hall at Dendara Temple, linguistic and cultural study\" under supervision of Prof. Abdelhalim Noureldin and partnership of Dr. Ola El-Aguizy.\nThrough his work at the Museum he became acquainted to many Egyptologists and archaeologists who visited the Museum. Among those was Prof. Erich Winter at Trier University, who along with his wife visited Egypt in 1987 and were accompanied by the young Mamdouh Eldamaty during their 3-day visit to Siwa Oasis. This new contact proved to be quite useful as Prof. Winter encouraged the young Egyptologist to continue his studies under his supervision at the Department of Egyptology at Trier University.\nIn October 1988 he worked as a curator at Faculty of Archaeology Museum of Cairo University. During his work he got his Master Degree in April 1989 in Egyptology from the same faculty. Immediately he left Egypt for Germany on leave to prepare his PhD.\nTrying his luck without any state sponsored scholarship it was rather difficult to get an entry visa to study in Germany without guarantor. Thanks to the help and support of his Professor and guarantor, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Saleh, an entry visa was issued and he started his German courses at Cologne University as soon as he arrived to Germany. He supported his life by working during summer vacation. While in Cologne he held correspondence with Trier University. He got an acceptance from Trier University, which he joined from winter semester 1989/ 1990.

He registered for Egyptology as major subject with classical archaeology and ethnology as minor subject in summer semester 1991.\nAt the winter semester 1992/ 93 he registered for his PhD with thesis \u2018Sokar- Osiris- Kapelle im Tempel von Dendera\u2019 for which he received a study scholarship from Ministry of Culture at Rhineland Palatia that enabled him to conclude his study in June 1995.\nDuring his stay in Germany, on February 26th 1992 he married Aida Abdelghany Ahmed, who studied sociology at Zagazig University. She accompanied him to Germany where gave birth to their first daughter, Mariam (11.Feb. 1993) in Trier.\nHaving concluded his PhD, he returned to Egypt in September 1995 but kept visiting Trier frequently in the years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2007 in order to follow recent publications and studies on Egyptology.\nBack in Cairo, where the family got a son and another daughter, he resumed his work for the Faculty\u2019s Museum until January 1996.\nStarting from January 1996 he started as lecturer for Egyptology at Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, Cairo University, Fayoum Branch. Upon founding an archaeological department at the Faculty of arts, Ain Shams University in August 1998, he moved to the new department as a lecturer for Egyptology until end of 2001.\nDirector General of Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\nAt the beginning of 2001 he was appointed Director General of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, a post that he held until End of January 2004.\nDuring his directorship the Museum witnessed several far reaching activities, developing its cellar (April 2001), restoration of old records of the Museum (May 2001), preparing for the second chamber for royal mummies (June 2001) and establishing restoration laboratory for papyrus, in cooperation with Corrado Basile, Director of Istituto Internazionale del Papiro, Siracusa in Italy (March 2003).\nIn July 2001 he laid forward a concept for the centennial of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which included several projects to promote and develop the old institution. This concept was approved by Dr. Gaballa Ali Gaballa, the then Secretary General of the Higher Council for Monuments and by the Minister of Culture as well.\nThese activities were performed in late 2002 in the time of the successor of Gaballa, Dr. Zahi Hawas, who gave this ceremony special attention.\nEldamaty was assigned also to supervise the external exhibitions committee from May 2002 till February 2004.\nProfessor at Ain Shams University.\nHaving concluded his assignment at the Egyptian Museum he returned to his main work in teaching at the Ain Shams University. There he got the post of associate professor of Egyptology at the Faculty of Arts from 25.03.2001 till 20.08.2006. As of 21.08.2006 he became a full professor of Egyptology and presided over the archaeological Department of Faculty of Arts at Ain Shams University from 12.09.2006 till 12.09.2009.\nBesides he was assigned to head the college center for studies, consultations and training from 15.10.2008 till 13.10.2009 when he overtook the post of director of open education center from 22.03.2009 till 15.11.2009.\nStarting from 13.09.2009 till 14.05.2011 he was the Dean of Faculty of Arts at the Ain Shams University. During his deanship he supervised the project for sustainable development and qualifying for Accreditation. This sustainable development specified certain criteria for selection of university cadres, which was approved by the college council, albeit not by the university council due to the political conditions accompanying the Arab spring in January 2011.\nFollowing the revolution he organized the first election process in Egyptian universities to choose his successor as Dean of the Faculty in March 2011, as he left the country on 15.05.2011 in the capacity of cultural counselor at the Egyptian Embassy to Berlin and head of educational mission there.
