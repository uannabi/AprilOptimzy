{"id":436093,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_proven","text":"e=\"preserve\">Not proven is a type of verdict in Scottish law. Out of the country, the \"not proven\" verdict may be referred to as the Scottish verdict, and in Scotland itself it may be referred to colloquially as the bastard verdict, which was a term coined by Sir Walter Scott, who was sheriff in the court of Selkirk.\nScottish law is distinct from English law, and this is one of the differences. Juries may convict with a guilty verdict or they may acquit (see below)). A criminal case jury consists of 15 jurors, and make their decision by a simple majority vote: eight votes are necessary and sufficient for the verdict \"guilty\", which has replaced the older verdict \"proven\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scottish_law","surface_form":"Scottish law","offset":48},{"uri":"Walter_Scott","surface_form":"Walter Scott","offset":264},{"uri":"Selkirk","surface_form":"Selkirk","offset":310},{"uri":"Jury","surface_form":"Juries","offset":398},{"uri":"Guilty_verdict","surface_form":"guilty verdict","offset":424}]}
