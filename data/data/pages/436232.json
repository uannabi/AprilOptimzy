At first, reports said the fire appears to have started in a mechanical room. An official communication from the library stated that the fire is being investigated. At this time, the fire appears to be unrelated to the Boston Marathon bombings that occurred on the same day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Presidential_library","surface_form":"presidential library","offset":59},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":174},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
