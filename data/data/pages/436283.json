{"id":436283,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Benzer","text":"Seymour Benzer (October 15, 1921 \u2013 November 30, 2007) was an American physicist, biologist and geneticist. He was of Jewish descent.\nHis career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s, and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics. He led a genetics research lab at Purdue University and at the California Institute of Technology.\nBenzer made fundamental discoveries in two quite different fields of genetics. He got his PhD in solid-state physics, but soon switched to genetics after he read Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger's book \"What is Life?\"\nPhage genetics.\nAt Purdue University, Benzer developed the \"T4 rII system\", a new genetic technique. This used recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants to map the inside structure of genes. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, he could make a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes.\nTaking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.\nBehavioral genetics.\nBenzer was one of the first scientists in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field's leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch.\nHirsch believed that behaviors were so complex they could not be explained as the action of single genes, Benzer thought behaviors might be directed by single genes. Both researchers tried their ideas out on \"Drosophila\". Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer used methods to isolate mutants for a particular behavior. Benzer and Hirsch's competing philosophies developed behavioral genetics, and helped it become a legitimate area of study in the scientific community.\nHonors and awards (selection).\nHe was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":70},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":81},{"uri":"Geneticist","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":95},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":117},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":161},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":283},{"uri":"Purdue_University","surface_form":"Purdue University","offset":327},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"California Institute of Technology","offset":356},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":482},{"uri":"Solid-state","surface_form":"solid-state","offset":489},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":501},{"uri":"Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger","surface_form":"Erwin Schr\u00F6dinger","offset":554},{"uri":"What_is_Life%3F","surface_form":"What is Life?","offset":580},{"uri":"Recombination","surface_form":"recombination","offset":706},{"uri":"Bacteriophage","surface_form":"bacteriophage","offset":726},{"uri":"Genes","surface_form":"genes","offset":783},{"uri":"Alfred_Sturtevant","surface_form":"Alfred Sturtevant","offset":961},{"uri":"Chromosomes","surface_form":"chromosomes","offset":992},{"uri":"Deletion_(genetics)","surface_form":"deletions","offset":1399},{"uri":"Point_mutation","surface_form":"point mutation","offset":1410},{"uri":"Missense_mutations","surface_form":"missense mutations","offset":1427},{"uri":"Nonsense_mutations","surface_form":"nonsense mutations","offset":1451},{"uri":"Jerry_Hirsch","surface_form":"Jerry Hirsch","offset":1712},{"uri":"Behavior","surface_form":"behavior","offset":1747},{"uri":"Drosophila","surface_form":"Drosophila","offset":1935},{"uri":"Artificial_selection","surface_form":"artificially selected","offset":1955},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":2342},{"uri":"French_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"French Academy of Sciences","offset":2364}]}
