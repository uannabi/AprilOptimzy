{"id":436327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict","text":"An ethnic conflict (or ethnic war) is a conflict where different ethnic groups fight each other. It is different from a civil war, where a single nation or ethnic group is fighting among itself.\nExamples of ethnic wars since the 1990s were typically caused by secessionist movements leading to the breakup of multi-ethnic states along ethnic lines: the Yugoslav Wars, the First Chechen War, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the Rwandan Civil War and the War in Darfur, among others\nAcademic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist or constructivist. Intellectual debate has also focused around the issue of whether ethnic conflict has become more common since the end of the Cold War, and on finding ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conflict","surface_form":"conflict","offset":40},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":65},{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"civil war","offset":120},{"uri":"Secession","surface_form":"secession","offset":260},{"uri":"Yugoslav_Wars","surface_form":"Yugoslav Wars","offset":353},{"uri":"First_Chechen_War","surface_form":"First Chechen War","offset":372},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh_War","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh War","offset":395},{"uri":"Rwandan_Civil_War","surface_form":"Rwandan Civil War","offset":421},{"uri":"War_in_Darfur","surface_form":"War in Darfur","offset":447},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":744},{"uri":"Consociationalism","surface_form":"consociationalism","offset":825},{"uri":"Federalisation","surface_form":"federalisation","offset":847}]}
