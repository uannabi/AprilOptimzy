{"id":436490,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode","text":"A photodiode is a light sensitive semiconductor. It is a type of photodetector capable of changing (or converting) light into either current or voltage, depending upon the mode of operation. If the anode and cathode leads of a photodiode are joined together by a wire, when in the dark, no current will flow. On the other hand, when in the light, current flows from the cathode to the anode. The diode part of a photodiode allows current to flow in only one direction.\nPhotodiodes may contain optical filters, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas. Photodiodes usually have a slower response time as its surface area increases. The common, traditional solar cell used to generate electric solar power is a large area photodiode. Photodiodes and phototransistors look the same physically but have different functions.\nIt is based on a reversed bias circuit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":34},{"uri":"Photodetector","surface_form":"photodetector","offset":65},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"current","offset":133},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":144},{"uri":"Mode","surface_form":"mode","offset":172},{"uri":"Anode","surface_form":"anode","offset":198},{"uri":"Cathode","surface_form":"cathode","offset":208},{"uri":"Diode","surface_form":"diode","offset":396},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":458},{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"optical","offset":493},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"filter","offset":501},{"uri":"Lens_(optics)","surface_form":"lenses","offset":519},{"uri":"Surface_area","surface_form":"surface area","offset":555},{"uri":"Response_time","surface_form":"response time","offset":604},{"uri":"Solar_cell","surface_form":"solar cell","offset":673},{"uri":"Solar_power","surface_form":"solar power","offset":710},{"uri":"Phototransistor","surface_form":"phototransistors","offset":766}]}
