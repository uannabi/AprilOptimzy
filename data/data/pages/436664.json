{"id":436664,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function","text":"In basic mathematics, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line in 2-dimensions (see images). An example is: \"y\"=2\"x\"\u20131. In higher mathematics, a linear function often refers to a linear mapping.\nBasic Properties.\nThere are three main forms for writing linear functions: slope-intercept, standard and parametric.\nSlope-intercept form.\nThe slope-intercept (also called point-slope or explicit) form of a linear function is \u00A0formula_1\u00A0 or \u00A0formula_1\u00A0. This form has 2 variables \"x\" and \"\u0443\" and 2 constants \"m\" and \"b\".\nExample: \"y\"=\u20132\"x\"+4. The slope is \"m\"= \u20132 and the \"y\"-intercept is \"b\"=4 or the point (0,4). Substituting \"y\"=0 and solving for \"x\", we get 0=\u20132\"x\"+4 or \"x\"=2. So \"x\"=2 is the root of this linear function and the point (2,0) is the \"x\"-intercept. Since the slope is \"m\" = \u20132, the line is decreasing. Since |\u20132|=2>1, the decrease is \"relatively\" steep. For each change in \"\u0445\" of 1 (to the right), the value of \"\u0443\" changes -2 (goes down).\nExample: \"y\"=\u20132\"x\"+4. Substituting \"x\"=0 we get \"y\"=4 (this is the \"y\"-intercept) and thus the point (0,4). Substituting \"x\"=1, we get \"y\"=2 and thus the point (1,2). Plot these points and draw the line. (Notice that the 2nd point is 1 to the right and 2 down from the 1st point. As we said in the above example, this happens because the slope is \"m\"= \u20132)\nExample: \"y\"= \u2013\"x\"+2. Suppose \"y\"= \u20131. We substitute \"y\"= \u20131 and get: \u20131= \u2013'x\"+2 or \"x\"=3. This is the only solution. We can do this for any \"y\"-value.\nStandard form.\nformula_1.\nExample: The linear function 3\"x\"\u20132\"y\"=1 is in standard form. The constants are \"A\"=3, \"B\"=\u20132 and \"C\"=1.\nExample: The lines 3\"x\"\u20132\"y\"=1 and 6\"x\"\u20134\"y\"=2 are coincident (same line). Here the factor is: \"k\"=2. We multiplied the first equation by 2 to get the second equation. The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: \"y\"=1.5\"x\"\u20130.5 (solve either equation for y).\nVector-Parametric form.\nParametric form: formula_1 \u00A0\u00A0 or\nVector form: formula_1 \u00A0or\u00A0 formula_1\u00A0.\nExample: X'\"=(\u20131,1)+\"t\"(2,3), t\u2208R is a line in vector form. Here: \"a\"1=2, \"a\"2=3, \"x\"1=\u20131 and \"x\"2=1. The line goes through the points (\"x\"1,\"y\"1)=(\u20131,1) and (\"x\"1+\"a\"1,\"y\"1+\"a\"2)=(1,4). The corresponding parametric form of this line is: \"x\"(\"t\")= \u20131+2\"t\", \"y\"(\"t\")=1+3\"t\". The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: \"y\"(\"x\")=1.5\"x\"+2.5 \u00A0 (solve the first equation for \"t\" and substitute this result into the second equation).\nExample: X'\"=(\u20131,1,2)+\"t\"(2,3,\u20131), t\u2208R is a line in 3-dimensional space. The line goes through the points (\u20131,1,2) and (1,4,1).\nDerivative of a linear function.\nExample: \"y\"= \u20132\"x\"+4. Here \"m\"= \u20132 and so \"y\"\u2032= \u20132.\nLinear function vs. Linear equation.\nOften, the terms \"linear equation\" and \"linear function\" are confused. Both are polynomials. However, the word \"linear\" in \"linear equation\" means that all terms with variables are first degree. (The word \"linear\" in \"linear function\" means the graph is a line.) A linear equation can have 1, 2, 3, or more variables. So a linear equation is a linear function only if it has exactly 2 variables. (A linear equation in one variable is a point on the number line and a linear equation in 3 variables is a plane in 3-dimensional space.)\nNotation.\nMany countries and disciplines use different letters and ordering for the different forms.\nIn many countries, a linear functions is often written as formula_1 where \"a\" is the slope and \"b\" is the \"y\"-intercept.\nIn business and economics, a linear function is often written as formula_1 where \"a\" is the \"y\"-intercept and \"b\" is the slope.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":45},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graph","offset":60},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"straight line","offset":71},{"uri":"Linear_mapping","surface_form":"linear mapping","offset":201},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":487},{"uri":"Constant","surface_form":"constant","offset":515},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"Vector","offset":1935},{"uri":"Linear_equation","surface_form":"linear equation","offset":2677},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":2739},{"uri":"Degree","surface_form":"degree","offset":2846},{"uri":"Number_line","surface_form":"number line","offset":3108},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":3162}]}
