{"id":4367,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron","text":"A neuron (or neurone'\") is a nerve cell that carries electrical impulses. Neurons are the basic units of our nervous system.\nNeurons have a cell body (\"soma\" or \"cyton\"), dendrites and an axon. Dendrites and axons are nerve fibers. There are about 86 billion neurons in the human brain, which is about 10% of all brain cells. The human brain has about 16 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex. The neurons are supported by glial cells and astrocytes.\nNeurons are connected to one another, but they do not actually touch each other. Instead they have tiny gaps called synapses. These gaps are chemical synapses or electrical synapses which pass the signal from one neuron to the next.\nBy connection.\nThere are three classes of neurons: motor neurons, sensory neurons and interneurons.\nCell division.\nMature neurons never divide: that is the general rule. They do not undergo cell division. In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells. A type of glial cell, called astrocytes, have also been seen to turn into neurons. In humans, neurogenesis (the origin of new nerve cells) largely ceases during adulthood but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb, there is strong evidence for substantial numbers of new neurons.\nThe largest part of the human brain by far is the neocortex. It has at least~1010 neurons which stay with us from cradle to grave.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":109},{"uri":"Dendrite","surface_form":"dendrite","offset":171},{"uri":"Axon","surface_form":"axon","offset":188},{"uri":"Glial_cell","surface_form":"glial cells","offset":424},{"uri":"Astrocyte","surface_form":"astrocyte","offset":440},{"uri":"Synapse","surface_form":"synapse","offset":568},{"uri":"Chemical_synapse","surface_form":"chemical synapse","offset":593},{"uri":"Electrical_synapse","surface_form":"electrical synapse","offset":614},{"uri":"Mitosis","surface_form":"cell division","offset":875},{"uri":"Stem_cell","surface_form":"stem cell","offset":947},{"uri":"Glial_cell","surface_form":"glial cell","offset":969},{"uri":"Astrocyte","surface_form":"astrocyte","offset":988},{"uri":"Hippocampus","surface_form":"hippocampus","offset":1158},{"uri":"Olfactory_bulb","surface_form":"olfactory bulb","offset":1178},{"uri":"Neocortex","surface_form":"neocortex","offset":1309}]}
