{"id":436711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloured","text":"In South African, Namibian, Zambian, Botswanan, and Zimbabwean context, the term Coloured (\"Kleurlinge\" in Afrikaans) is used to refer to people of mixed European and Khoisan or Bantu ancestry.\nThey form the majority of the Northern Cape and Western Cape populations. Most Coloured speak Afrikaans as their first language, although there are some native English speakers. The majority of Coloureds living in Cape Town are able to speak both languages.\nBecause of South Africa's history of racial discrimination, many feel that the term \"coloured\" is derogatory. The official term is \"Coloured people\", but many Coloureds prefer to call themselves \"Black\", \"Khoisan\", or just \"South African\".\nApartheid.\nDuring apartheid, people were classified into four groups: White, Black, Coloured, and Asian. The Cape Malays, who are of Asian descent, were not classified as Asians, but as Coloureds.\nAlthough they were discriminated upon by the government, many Coloureds and Asians got to enjoy certain rights during the apartheid era. For example, they did not have to carry around a passbook, had limited political representation, and were considered citizens of South Africa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":3},{"uri":"Namibia","surface_form":"Namibia","offset":18},{"uri":"Zambia","surface_form":"Zambia","offset":28},{"uri":"Botswana","surface_form":"Botswana","offset":37},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":52},{"uri":"Afrikaans","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":107},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":154},{"uri":"Khoisan","surface_form":"Khoisan","offset":167},{"uri":"Bantu_people","surface_form":"Bantu","offset":178},{"uri":"Northern_Cape","surface_form":"Northern Cape","offset":224},{"uri":"Western_Cape","surface_form":"Western Cape","offset":242},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":354},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":408},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"apartheid","offset":710}]}
