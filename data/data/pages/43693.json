{"id":43693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty","text":"The Zhou Dynasty defeated the Shang Dynasty using the mandate of heaven and said they where immortal at about 1046 BC, and came to power. They changed the capital from Henan to a place near present-day Xi'an, near the Yellow River. The Zhou Dynasty also brought a new theory. This theory told the people that kings had the order of the gods to rule the country (Mandate of Heaven). Almost all dynasties of Chinese rulers continued to repeat this theory. The kings of this dynasty won many new areas. For the first time in the history of China, large numbers of persons also moved from one area to other area for settlement.\nDuring the Zhou Dynasty, the origins of matured Chinese philosophy developed. The greatest Chinese philosophers were \"Kong Fuzi\" (Latin: Confucius), founder of Confucianism, and Laozi, founder of Daoism. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought in this era were Mozi (Latin: Micius), founder of \"Mohism\", Mengzi (Latin: Mencius), a famous Confucian who expanded upon Kong Fuzi's legacy, Shang Yang and Han Feizi, responsible for the development of ancient Chinese Legalism (the core philosophy of the Qin Dynasty), and Xunzi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Former Country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Shang Dynasty","offset":30},{"uri":"Xi%27an","surface_form":"Xi'an","offset":202},{"uri":"Yellow_River","surface_form":"Yellow River","offset":218},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"Dynasty","offset":241},{"uri":"Mandate_of_Heaven","surface_form":"Mandate of Heaven","offset":362},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":537},{"uri":"Mature","surface_form":"matured","offset":664},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":680},{"uri":"Confucius","surface_form":"Confucius","offset":761},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucianism","offset":784},{"uri":"Laozi","surface_form":"Laozi","offset":802},{"uri":"Daoism","surface_form":"Daoism","offset":820},{"uri":"Mozi","surface_form":"Mozi","offset":899},{"uri":"Mengzi","surface_form":"Mengzi","offset":942},{"uri":"Legacy","surface_form":"legacy","offset":1016},{"uri":"Shang_Yang","surface_form":"Shang Yang","offset":1024},{"uri":"Han_Feizi","surface_form":"Han Feizi","offset":1039},{"uri":"Legalism","surface_form":"Legalism","offset":1101},{"uri":"Qin_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qin Dynasty","offset":1138},{"uri":"Xunzi","surface_form":"Xunzi","offset":1156}]}
