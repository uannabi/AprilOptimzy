{"id":43694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi","text":"Frank Anthony \"Tony\" Iommi (born 19 February 1948, in Birmingham, England) is an English guitarist and songwriter. He is most famous for starting the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He is the only person who has stayed a member of the band since it began in 1968. He lost two finger tips in a work accident, and made two fake finger tips from a plastic bottle. This helped give Black Sabbath their heavy sound.\nIn 2003, Iommi was listed at number 86 in Rolling Stone Magazine's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" issue.\nAlong with Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Iommi is oft considered one of the greatest riff writers of all time. Iommi used several riffs in Black Sabbath's songs.\nIn 2006 Tony Iommi was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":54},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":66},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":81},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":89},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":103},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":150},{"uri":"Black_Sabbath","surface_form":"Black Sabbath","offset":167},{"uri":"Rolling_Stone_Magazine","surface_form":"Rolling Stone Magazine","offset":453},{"uri":"Jimmy_Page","surface_form":"Jimmy Page","offset":534},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame","offset":724}]}
