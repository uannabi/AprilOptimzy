{"id":436993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_mapping","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics (particularly in linear algebra), a linear mapping (or linear transformation) is a mapping \"f\" between vector spaces that preserves addition and scalar multiplication.\nDefinition.\nSometimes, a linear mapping is called a linear function. However, in basic mathematics, a linear function means a function whose graph is a line. The set of all linear mappings from the vector space \"V\" to vector space \"W\" can be written as formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"linear algebra","offset":45},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"mapping","offset":111},{"uri":"Vector_space","surface_form":"vector space","offset":131},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":160},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":180},{"uri":"Linear_function","surface_form":"linear function","offset":298},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":322},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graph","offset":337}]}
