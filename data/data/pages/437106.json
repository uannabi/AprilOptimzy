It opened in 1929, and closed in 1994. It was demolished in 1995 because the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls moved to the United Center.\nMichael Jordan played his prime years and the Bulls won their first three championships while using Chicago Stadium.\nThe Stadium hosted the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL from 1929\u20131994 and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 1967\u20131994.\nThe arena was the site of the first NFL playoff game in 1932; the 1932, 1940, and 1944 Democratic National Conventions; and the 1932 and 1944 Republican National Conventions.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks, also previously known as the Chicago Stadium Corporation, and not the Bulls, are the actual owners of both Chicago Stadium and the United Center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sports_arena","surface_form":"sports arena","offset":72},{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"theater","offset":89},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":100},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":109},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":196},{"uri":"Chicago_Bulls","surface_form":"Chicago Bulls","offset":219},{"uri":"United_Center","surface_form":"United Center","offset":246},{"uri":"Michael_Jordan","surface_form":"Michael Jordan","offset":261},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Blackhawks","offset":401},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"NHL","offset":427},{"uri":"1929%E2%80%9330_NHL_season","surface_form":"1929","offset":436},{"uri":"1993-94_NHL_season","surface_form":"1994","offset":441},{"uri":"Chicago_Bulls","surface_form":"Chicago Bulls","offset":454},{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"NBA","offset":475},{"uri":"1967%E2%80%9368_NBA_season","surface_form":"1967","offset":484},{"uri":"1993-94_NBA_season","surface_form":"1994","offset":489},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":499},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"NFL","offset":531},{"uri":"1932_NFL_Playoff_Game","surface_form":"playoff game","offset":535},{"uri":"1932_NFL_season","surface_form":"1932","offset":551},{"uri":"Democratic_National_Convention","surface_form":"Democratic National Convention","offset":582},{"uri":"Republican_National_Convention","surface_form":"Republican National Convention","offset":637}]}
