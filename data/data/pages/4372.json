{"id":4372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A point is a precise position in space. Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size to speak of.\nIn geometry, a point has no size, but has a position. This means it has no volume, area or length. We usually represent a point by a small cross 'X' or by a small dot (a small, round shape). Points are always labelled by capital letters (A, B, C...X, Y, Z). It is one of the most fundamental but undefined terms in geometry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"position","offset":34},{"uri":"Space_(physics)","surface_form":"space","offset":46},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":216},{"uri":"Size","surface_form":"size","offset":241},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":288},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":296},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":304},{"uri":"Represent","surface_form":"represent","offset":323},{"uri":"Cross","surface_form":"cross","offset":352},{"uri":"Capital_letter","surface_form":"capital letter","offset":434}]}
