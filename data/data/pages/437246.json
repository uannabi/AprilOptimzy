{"id":437246,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere","text":"The Gomphotheres were a varied family of extinct elephant-like animals (proboscidea) the Gomphotheriidae. They had a wide distribution. They were common in North America during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, 121.6 million years ago. Some lived in parts of Eurasia, Beringia and, after the Great American Interchange, South America.\nBeginning about 5 million years ago, they were gradually replaced by modern elephants. The last two South American species, in the genus \"Cuvieronius\", did not become extinct until about 9000 years ago. \"Stegomastodon\" remains have been dated as recently as 6,000 years ago in the Valle del Magdalena, Colombia. Gomphotheres also survived in Mexico and Central America until the end of the Pleistocene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":31},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":41},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":49},{"uri":"Proboscidea","surface_form":"proboscidea","offset":72},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":156},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":181},{"uri":"Pliocene","surface_form":"Pliocene","offset":193},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":258},{"uri":"Beringia","surface_form":"Beringia","offset":267},{"uri":"Great_American_Interchange","surface_form":"Great American Interchange","offset":291},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":319},{"uri":"Cuvieronius","surface_form":"Cuvieronius","offset":472},{"uri":"Stegomastodon","surface_form":"Stegomastodon","offset":538},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":636},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":676},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":687},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":724}]}
