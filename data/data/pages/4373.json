{"id":4373,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line","text":"A line is the path of one point moving. A line has length but no width. A line is a type of geometric figure.\nA line is made up of an endless number of points.\nStraight and curved lines.\nA line can be straight or curved. In geometry, the word \"line\" means a \"straight line\". A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. A straight line is the line traced by a point moving in a direction that does not change.\nA \"curved line\" is sometimes called a curve. The edge of a circle is not straight and is an example of a curve.\nNaming lines.\nLines can get their names from any two points on the line. For example, if a line contains two distinct points, named formula_1 and formula_1, then the line can be called either formula_1, or formula_1.\nSometimes, lines are also named with just one symbol. In which case, a letter such as formula_1 might be used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":51},{"uri":"Width","surface_form":"width","offset":65},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometric","offset":92},{"uri":"Figure","surface_form":"figure","offset":102},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"endless","offset":134},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"points","offset":152},{"uri":"Straight","surface_form":"straight","offset":201},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":213},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":224},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":307},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"points","offset":328},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":394},{"uri":"Change","surface_form":"change","offset":418},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":464},{"uri":"Edge","surface_form":"edge","offset":475},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":485},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":531},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":826}]}
