{"id":437361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomixis","text":"Apomixis is reproduction where only one parent passes genes to the offspring. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent (clones).\nThe method is most seen in plants, especially flowering plants. Brambles (blackberry) are apomictic. Some authorities give \"reproduction by special tissues without fertilisation\", or \"asexual formation of a seed from the maternal tissues of the ovule, avoiding meiosis and fertilization, leading to embryo development\".\nApomixis includes some methods which are more common in animals, such as parthenogenesis.\nIn botany, apomixis was defined by Hans Winkler as the replacement of the normal sexual reproduction by asexual reproduction, without fertilization.\nHorticulture methods, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, is not apomixis. \"Natural replacement of the seed by an asexual method\" is apomixis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clones","surface_form":"clones","offset":152},{"uri":"Flowering_plants","surface_form":"flowering plants","offset":207},{"uri":"Blackberry","surface_form":"blackberry","offset":235},{"uri":"Fertilisation","surface_form":"fertilisation","offset":325},{"uri":"Meiosis","surface_form":"meiosis","offset":422},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":460},{"uri":"Parthenogenesis","surface_form":"parthenogenesis","offset":554},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":574},{"uri":"Asexual_reproduction","surface_form":"asexual reproduction","offset":675},{"uri":"Horticulture","surface_form":"Horticulture","offset":720},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":779}]}
