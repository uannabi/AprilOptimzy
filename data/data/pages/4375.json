{"id":4375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle","text":"When two straight lines come together, they make an angle. The two lines are called the \"sides\" of the angle, and they meet at a point. A flat surface (called a plane) also forms an angle when it meets another.\nTo represent an angle, Greek letters such as formula_1 (alpha), formula_1 (beta), formula_1 (gamma) and formula_1 (theta) are sometimes used. An angle indicates the space between its sides, or the amount of rotation needed to make one side coincide the other.\nTo measure the size of an angle, we use units called degrees. A degree is a standard unit and we use the symbol \u00B0 after a number to show that it is a number of degrees. We can use a decimal number or a fraction for part of a degree, but a degree can also be divided into 60 minutes (1\u00B0 = 60'), and a minute can be divided into 60 seconds (1' = 60\"). So 22.5\u00B0, 22\u00B0 and 22\u00B0 30' are all the same angle.\nIn mathematics, angles can also be (and often are) measured in radians instead of degrees, by using the conversion factor formula_1 (for example, formula_1). Yet another unit of angle is gradian, with formula_1.\nAngles are studied in geometry, where an angle where edges meet is often called a vertex. For example, the three sides of a triangle are its \"edges\" and two of the edges meet at each \"vertex\". Similarly, two of the six sides (or \"faces\") of a cube meet at each of its twelve edges, and three edges meet at each of its eight corners (or vertices, which is the plural version of \"vertex\").\nTypes of angles.\n\u2022In a zero angle the lines lie one upon the other thus creating a 0\u00B0 angle aka the zero angle.\n\u2022An angle greater than 0\u00B0 but less than 90\u00B0 is called an acute angle.\n\u2022An angle of 90\u00B0 is called a right angle.\nAn angle greater than 90\u00B0 but less than 180\u00B0 is called an obtuse angle.\n\u2022An angle that measures 180\u00B0 is called a straight angle.\nAn angle greater than 180\u00B0 and less than 360\u00B0 is called a reflex angle.\n\u2022An angle that has a made or full circle/ completed 360\u00B0 is called a full or complete angle.\nSupplementary angles are two angles with the sum equal to 180\u00B0, and complementary angles are two angles with the sum equal to one right angle (90\u00B0). On the other hand, two angles that sum to one full circle (360\u00B0) are sometimes called explementary angles, or conjugate angles.\nPeople usually use a protractor to measure and draw angles. Sometimes, people use a 360\u00B0 protractor to measure angles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Straight","surface_form":"straight","offset":9},{"uri":"Side","surface_form":"side","offset":89},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"point","offset":129},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":161},{"uri":"Greek_letter","surface_form":"Greek letters","offset":234},{"uri":"Alpha","surface_form":"alpha","offset":267},{"uri":"Beta","surface_form":"beta","offset":286},{"uri":"Gamma","surface_form":"gamma","offset":304},{"uri":"Theta","surface_form":"theta","offset":326},{"uri":"Size","surface_form":"size","offset":486},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":511},{"uri":"Degree_(geometry)","surface_form":"degrees","offset":524},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":576},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal number","offset":653},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":673},{"uri":"Minute","surface_form":"minute","offset":745},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":801},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":874},{"uri":"Radian","surface_form":"radian","offset":934},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":1105},{"uri":"Edge","surface_form":"edge","offset":1136},{"uri":"Vertex","surface_form":"vertex","offset":1165},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":1207},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":1326},{"uri":"Corner","surface_form":"corner","offset":1407},{"uri":"Vertices","surface_form":"vertices","offset":1419},{"uri":"Zero_angle","surface_form":"zero angle","offset":1571},{"uri":"Acute_angle","surface_form":"acute angle","offset":1640},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":1682},{"uri":"Obtuse_angle","surface_form":"obtuse angle","offset":1753},{"uri":"Straight_angle","surface_form":"straight angle","offset":1808},{"uri":"Reflex_angle","surface_form":"reflex angle","offset":1882},{"uri":"Full_or_complete_angle","surface_form":"full or complete angle","offset":1965},{"uri":"Supplementary_angles","surface_form":"Supplementary angles","offset":1989},{"uri":"Sum","surface_form":"sum","offset":2034},{"uri":"Equal","surface_form":"equal","offset":2038},{"uri":"Complementary_angles","surface_form":"complementary angles","offset":2057},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":2119},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":2189},{"uri":"Explementary","surface_form":"explementary","offset":2224},{"uri":"Conjugate","surface_form":"conjugate","offset":2248},{"uri":"Protractor","surface_form":"protractor","offset":2287},{"uri":"360%C2%B0_protractor","surface_form":"360\u00B0 protractor","offset":2350}]}
