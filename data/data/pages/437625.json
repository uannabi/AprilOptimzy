{"id":437625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_technology","text":"The history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and techniques, and is similar in many ways to the history of humanity.\nPeople make new things and, conversely, many scientific endeavors are possible through technologies. Technology lets us travel to places we could not otherwise go, and probe the nature of the universe in more detail than our natural senses allow.\nTechnological artifacts are products of an economy, a force for economic growth, and a large part of everyday life. Technological innovations affect, and are affected by, a society's cultural traditions. They also are a means to develop and project military power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tools","surface_form":"tools","offset":61},{"uri":"Technique","surface_form":"technique","offset":71},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":331},{"uri":"Senses","surface_form":"senses","offset":372},{"uri":"Artifact","surface_form":"artifact","offset":400},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":429},{"uri":"Innovation","surface_form":"innovation","offset":516},{"uri":"Cultural_heritage","surface_form":"cultural traditions","offset":569},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":635}]}
