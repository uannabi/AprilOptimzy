{"id":437636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidos","text":"e=\"preserve\">Aidos () was the Greek goddess of shame, modesty and humility. She was a close friend of the goddess Nemesis. One source calls her the daughter of Prometheus.\nAidos is often considered to be more of a personification than a physical goddess. She was said to be the feeling of reverence that stops men from doing bad things. She was also said to be a feeling of shame that a rich person might get when they saw poor people.\nShe is spoken about in some early Greek plays, such as \"Prometheus Bound\" by Aeschylus, \"Iphigenia at Aulis\" by Euripides, and \"Oedipus Rex\" by Sophocles.\nThere were altars to Aidos in Athens and in Lacedaemon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek","offset":30},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":36},{"uri":"Shame","surface_form":"shame","offset":47},{"uri":"Modesty","surface_form":"modesty","offset":54},{"uri":"Humility","surface_form":"humility","offset":66},{"uri":"Nemesis_(mythology)","surface_form":"Nemesis","offset":114},{"uri":"Prometheus","surface_form":"Prometheus","offset":160},{"uri":"Personification","surface_form":"personification","offset":214},{"uri":"Feeling","surface_form":"feeling","offset":278},{"uri":"Reverence","surface_form":"reverence","offset":289},{"uri":"Theatre_of_Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek plays","offset":470},{"uri":"Prometheus_Bound","surface_form":"Prometheus Bound","offset":492},{"uri":"Aeschylus","surface_form":"Aeschylus","offset":513},{"uri":"Iphigenia_at_Aulis","surface_form":"Iphigenia at Aulis","offset":525},{"uri":"Euripides","surface_form":"Euripides","offset":548},{"uri":"Oedipus_Rex","surface_form":"Oedipus Rex","offset":564},{"uri":"Sophocles","surface_form":"Sophocles","offset":580},{"uri":"Altar","surface_form":"altar","offset":602},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":621},{"uri":"Lacedaemon","surface_form":"Lacedaemon","offset":635}]}
