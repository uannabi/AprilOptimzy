{"id":437737,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_heap_of_history","text":"=\"preserve\">The \"ash heap of history\", also called \"dustbin of history\" or \"garbage heap of history\" or \"landfill of history\", is a figurative speech about people, events, artifacts, and ideologies. It is used about people that are forgotten or things that will be forgotten in history.\nRonald Reagan used this speech as an example and the Soviet Union, Leninism, and Marxism will eventually fall and be forgotten.\nLeon Trotsky once famously used the phrase \"dustbin of history\" referring to when the Mensheviks walked out of a meeting during the Russian Revolution in 1917.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":287},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":340},{"uri":"Leninism","surface_form":"Leninism","offset":354},{"uri":"Marxism","surface_form":"Marxism","offset":368},{"uri":"Leon_Trotsky","surface_form":"Leon Trotsky","offset":415},{"uri":"Menshevik","surface_form":"Menshevik","offset":501},{"uri":"Russian_Revolution","surface_form":"Russian Revolution","offset":547}]}
