Thus, it was an early ancestor of \"Tyrannosaurus\" and its relatives in the Upper Cretaceous.\nThe animal in life was about 3m long and weighed up to 60kg.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":30},{"uri":"Middle_Jurassic","surface_form":"Middle Jurassic","offset":48},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":83},{"uri":"Gloucestershire","surface_form":"Gloucestershire","offset":110},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":127},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":154},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":166},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":228},{"uri":"Ceratosaurus","surface_form":"Ceratosaurus","offset":241},{"uri":"Coelurosaur","surface_form":"coelurosaur","offset":295},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus","offset":344},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":384}]}
