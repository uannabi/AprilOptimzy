These will begin airing in early 2014 and 2015. The first half of the final season will premiere on April 13, 2014.\n\"Mad Men\" is set in the 1960s. The scene is the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in New York City. Later it becomes the newly created company, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (later Sterling Cooper & Partners). According to the show's pilot, the phrase \"Mad men\" was a slang term started in the 1950s by advertisers working on Madison Avenue to refer to themselves. This claim has since been denied. The main character is Don Draper (Jon Hamm), creative director at Sterling Cooper and a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. The plot focuses on the business of the advertising agency as well as the personal lives of the characters.\n\"Mad Men\" has received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its historical authenticity, visual style, costume design, acting, writing, and directing. The show has won many awards, including fifteen Emmys and four Golden Globes. It is the first basic cable series to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning it in each of its first four seasons. In 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked it sixth in its list of the sixty greatest dramas of all time. It was ranked seventh in a list of the 101 best-written TV series of all time by the Writers Guild of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":16},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":25},{"uri":"Produced","surface_form":"produced","offset":61},{"uri":"Matthew_Weiner","surface_form":"Matthew Weiner","offset":73},{"uri":"Premiered","surface_form":"premiered","offset":100},{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable television","offset":143},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":160},{"uri":"AMC_(TV_channel)","surface_form":"AMC","offset":168},{"uri":"Season_(television)","surface_form":"season","offset":195},{"uri":"Episodes_(TV_series)","surface_form":"episodes","offset":215},{"uri":"Fictional","surface_form":"fictional","offset":437},{"uri":"Agency","surface_form":"agency","offset":475},{"uri":"Madison_Avenue","surface_form":"Madison Avenue","offset":485},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":503},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":553},{"uri":"Television_pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":651},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":685},{"uri":"Advertising","surface_form":"advertisers","offset":720},{"uri":"Jon_Hamm","surface_form":"Jon Hamm","offset":850},{"uri":"Plot","surface_form":"plot","offset":958},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":978},{"uri":"Critical_acclaim","surface_form":"critical acclaim","offset":1096},{"uri":"Authenticity","surface_form":"authenticity","offset":1146},{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":1167},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":1174},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":1182},{"uri":"Acting","surface_form":"acting","offset":1190},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":1198},{"uri":"Awards","surface_form":"awards","offset":1244},{"uri":"Primetime_Emmy_Award","surface_form":"Emmys","offset":1270},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award","surface_form":"Golden Globes","offset":1285},{"uri":"TV_Guide","surface_form":"TV Guide","offset":1443},{"uri":"Writers_Guild_of_America","surface_form":"Writers Guild of America","offset":1608}]}
