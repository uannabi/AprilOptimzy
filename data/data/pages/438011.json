Diesel generators are located at places where there is no electricity supply from the electrical grid or for emergency supply if there is problem with the normal electricity supply.\nDiesel generator is often referred as \"generator set\" or \"genset\" for short, which is a combination of diesel generator with its supporting equipment, such as base, canopy, control system, sound attenuation, circuit breaker, starting system, exhaust system, diesel fuel supply etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diesel-electric","surface_form":"diesel-electric","offset":24},{"uri":"Diesel_engine","surface_form":"diesel engine","offset":50},{"uri":"Electrical_generator","surface_form":"electrical generator","offset":78},{"uri":"Electricity_generation","surface_form":"produce electricity","offset":102},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":181},{"uri":"Electrical_grid","surface_form":"electrical grid","offset":209},{"uri":"Control_system","surface_form":"control system","offset":478},{"uri":"Sound_attenuation","surface_form":"sound attenuation","offset":494},{"uri":"Circuit_breaker","surface_form":"circuit breaker","offset":513},{"uri":"Exhaust_system","surface_form":"exhaust system","offset":547},{"uri":"Diesel_fuel","surface_form":"diesel fuel","offset":563}]}
