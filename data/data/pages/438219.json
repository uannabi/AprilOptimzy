{"id":438219,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Bishop","text":"John Michael Bishop (born February 22, 1936) is an American immunologist and microbiologist. He shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Harold Varmus and was co-winner of 1984 Alfred P. Sloan Prize. He currently serves as an active faculty member at the University of California, San Francisco.\nBishop is best known for his Nobel-winning work on retroviral oncogenes. Working with Varmus in the 1980s, he discovered the first human oncogene, c-Src.\nTheir findings showed how malignant tumors are formed from changes to the normal genes of a cell. These changes can be produced by viruses, by radiation, or by exposure to some chemicals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Immunologist","surface_form":"immunologist","offset":60},{"uri":"Microbiologist","surface_form":"microbiologist","offset":77},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":112},{"uri":"Harold_Varmus","surface_form":"Harold Varmus","offset":155},{"uri":"Alfred_P._Sloan_Prize","surface_form":"Alfred P.
