{"id":438455,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Medical_Council","text":"e=\"preserve\">The General Medical Council (GMC) is a fee-based registered charity with statutory obligation to maintain a register of medical practitioners within the United Kingdom. Registration with the GMC confers a number of privileges and duties.\nPurpose.\nThere is a legal requirement for a register, the list of \"registered medical practitioners\" in Britain. That is the main job of the GMC. The GMC controls entry to the List of Registered Medical Practitioners (\"the medical register\"). \"The main objective of the General Council in exercising their functions is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public\".\nSecondly, the GMC regulates and sets the standards for medical schools in the UK. It liaises with other nations' medical and university regulatory bodies over medical schools overseas, leading to some qualifications being mutually recognised. Since 2010, it also regulates postgraduate medical education.\nThirdly, the GMC is responsible for a licensing and revalidation system for all practising doctors in the UK, separate from the registration system. This was done by order of the Privy Council on 3 December 2012.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fee","surface_form":"fee","offset":52},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charity","offset":73},{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"statutory","offset":86},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"medical practitioners","offset":133},{"uri":"Medical_school","surface_form":"medical school","offset":696},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":719},{"uri":"Postgraduate","surface_form":"postgraduate","offset":914},{"uri":"Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Privy Council","offset":1125}]}
