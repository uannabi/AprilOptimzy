He is best known for his role as Michael Scofield in the Fox television series \"Prison Break\" (2005\u20132009, 2017\u2013present). For this role, he has a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in The CW series \"The Flash\", and later the spin-off \"Legends of Tomorrow\". His first screenplay, the thriller drama \"Stoker\", was released in 2013.\nMiller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England. He moved to Brooklyn, New York, United States at the age of one. His parents are Americans. His father has African-American, Jamaican, English, German, Jewish, and Cherokee background, and his mother is of Russian, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.\nIn 2007, Miller denied to \"InStyle\" that he was gay. He later came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website. In the letter he turned down the offer to go to the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival. The reason was because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens. This was referring to anti-LGBT laws passed banning \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":52},{"uri":"Michael_Scofield","surface_form":"Michael Scofield","offset":135},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox","offset":159},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":163},{"uri":"Prison_Break","surface_form":"Prison Break","offset":182},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award","surface_form":"Golden Globe Award","offset":247},{"uri":"The_CW","surface_form":"The CW","offset":369},{"uri":"The_Flash_(2014_TV_series)","surface_form":"The Flash","offset":384},{"uri":"Spin-off","surface_form":"spin-off","offset":410},{"uri":"Legends_of_Tomorrow","surface_form":"Legends of Tomorrow","offset":420},{"uri":"Thriller_(genre)","surface_form":"thriller drama","offset":468},{"uri":"Stoker_(movie)","surface_form":"Stoker","offset":484},{"uri":"Chipping_Norton","surface_form":"Chipping Norton","offset":534},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":551},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":564},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":585},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":595},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":680},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":698},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":708},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":717},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":725},{"uri":"Cherokee","surface_form":"Cherokee","offset":737},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russian","offset":779},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":788},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":796},{"uri":"Syrian_people","surface_form":"Syrian","offset":803},{"uri":"Lebanese_people","surface_form":"Lebanese","offset":815},{"uri":"InStyle","surface_form":"InStyle","offset":861},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":882},{"uri":"GLAAD","surface_form":"GLAAD","offset":955},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg_International_Film_Festival","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg International Film Festival","offset":1024},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1126},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":1205},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":1231}]}
