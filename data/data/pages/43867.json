{"id":43867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithomimus","text":"\"Ornithomimus\" was a lightly built fast-running North American feathered dinosaur.\n\"Ornithomimus\" had three toes on each foot, long arms and neck, but a small head. It also had claws on each hand and foot. It had no teeth and weak jaws, which might mean it was omnivorous.\n\"Ornithomimus edmonticus\" was the largest species, 12 ft (3.5 meters) long, 7 feet (2.10 meters) high and weighed about 100-150\u00A0kg. It walked on two legs and looked slightly like an ostrich, except for its long tail.\nThere has been trouble with naming. Some speciments are put in other genera, like \"Dromiceiomimus\" and \"Struthiomimus\".\nFeathers.\nIn 1995, 2008 and 2009, three \"O. edmontonicus\" specimens with evidence of feathers were found. Two adults had quill knobs on the lower arm, indicating the former presence of bird-like feather shafts. A juvenile had impressions of long fluffy feathers in the form of hair-like filaments covering the rump, legs and neck.\nThe feather imprints were found in sandstone, previously thought to not be able to support such impressions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":48},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":73},{"uri":"Three","surface_form":"three","offset":102},{"uri":"Toe","surface_form":"toe","offset":108},{"uri":"Foot","surface_form":"foot","offset":121},{"uri":"Claw","surface_form":"claw","offset":177},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":216},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":231},{"uri":"Omnivorous","surface_form":"omnivorous","offset":261},{"uri":"Ostrich","surface_form":"ostrich","offset":455},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":559},{"uri":"Struthiomimus","surface_form":"Struthiomimus","offset":594},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstone","offset":976}]}
