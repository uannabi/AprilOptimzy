{"id":438803,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Von_Erich","text":"Michael Brett Adkisson (March 2, 1964 \u2014 April 12, 1987) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known under the ring name Mike Von Erich. He was a member of the famous Von Erich family. His father was Fritz Von Erich, a wrestling promoter and professional wrestler. Mike made his professional wrestling debut on November 24, 1983. Unlike his older brothers, however, he never wanted to do wrestling (according to certain wrestlers tied to Mike, including his brother Kevin).\nIn 1985, Von Erich was diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome (rare among men). The condition caused brain damage that then affected his behavior and overall performing abilities.\nIn April 1987, he was arrested for drunk driving and drug charges. A few days later, Mike wrote and left a suicide note for his family, went to Lake Dallas and overdosed on Placidyl and alcohol. His body was found four days later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestler","offset":72},{"uri":"Ring_name","surface_form":"ring name","offset":125},{"uri":"Von_Erich_family","surface_form":"Von Erich family","offset":181},{"uri":"Fritz_Von_Erich","surface_form":"Fritz Von Erich","offset":214},{"uri":"Kevin_Von_Erich","surface_form":"Kevin","offset":480},{"uri":"Toxic_shock_syndrome","surface_form":"toxic shock syndrome","offset":526},{"uri":"Brain_damage","surface_form":"brain damage","offset":586},{"uri":"Drunk_driving","surface_form":"drunk driving","offset":700},{"uri":"Suicide_note","surface_form":"suicide note","offset":772},{"uri":"Lake_Dallas%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Lake Dallas","offset":809},{"uri":"Ethchlorvynol","surface_form":"Placidyl","offset":838},{"uri":"Alcoholic_drink","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":851}]}
