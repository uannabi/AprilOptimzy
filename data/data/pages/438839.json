{"id":438839,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_renaissance","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dinosaur renaissance is a term coined in a 1975 issue of \"Scientific American\" by Robert Bakker to describe the renewed interest in paleontology. This has lasted from the 1970s to the present. It was caused by a great increase in dinosaur discoveries, and by new ideas of how they lived.\nThe \"renaissance\", a word which means \"rebirth\", changed how dinosaurs pictured both by professional illustrators, and in the public eye.\nJohn Ostrom's 1964 discovery of \"Deinonychus\" is one of the most important fossil finds. \"Deinonychus\" was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its \"terrible claw\". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. One conclusion was that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and so in some cases were warm-blooded. This was popularized by Ostrom's student Robert Bakker. The impression of dinosaurs as being slow, cold-blooded, small-brained reptiles needed to be rethought, at least for some of the carnivores.\nChinese lagerst\u00E4tten.\nThe discovery of new feathered dinosaurs in China has kept the field in the forefront of research and populat attention. Lower Cretaceous geological formations in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning are especially noteworthy. The animals found there are known as the Jehol biota.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scientific_American","surface_form":"Scientific American","offset":71},{"uri":"Robert_Bakker","surface_form":"Robert Bakker","offset":95},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"paleontology","offset":145},{"uri":"Illustrator","surface_form":"illustrator","offset":402},{"uri":"John_Ostrom","surface_form":"John Ostrom","offset":439},{"uri":"Deinonychus","surface_form":"Deinonychus","offset":472},{"uri":"Tendon","surface_form":"tendon","offset":718},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":867},{"uri":"Warm-blooded","surface_form":"warm-blooded","offset":905},{"uri":"Robert_Bakker","surface_form":"Robert Bakker","offset":960},{"uri":"Poikilotherm","surface_form":"cold-blooded","offset":1018},{"uri":"Feathered_dinosaurs","surface_form":"feathered dinosaurs","offset":1159},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1182},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":1259},{"uri":"Geological_formation","surface_form":"geological formation","offset":1276},{"uri":"Liaoning","surface_form":"Liaoning","offset":1338},{"uri":"Jehol_biota","surface_form":"Jehol biota","offset":1415}]}
