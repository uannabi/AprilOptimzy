{"id":438847,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_I_of_Portugal","text":"Maria I (English: \"Mary\u00A0I\") (17 December 1734 \u2013 20 March 1816) was the Queen of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Known as Maria the Pious (in Portugal), or Maria the Mad (in Brazil), she was the first undisputed Queen (in her own right) of Portugal. Her court, then under the direction of her eldest son and heir Dom Jo\u00E3o, the Prince Regent, moved to the then Portuguese colony of Brazil. Later on, Brazil would be elevated from the rank of a colony to that of a Kingdom. This led to the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.\nEarly life.\nMaria was born at the Ribeira Royal Palace in Lisbon. On the day of her birth, her grandfather, King Jo\u00E3o V, created her the Princess of Beira. She was the eldest of all her four siblings.\nWhen her father succeeded to the throne in 1750 as Jos\u00E9 I, Maria became his heiress presumptive and was given the traditional titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza. She was also an Infanta of Portugal from birth and thus entitled to the style of Royal Highness. She grew up during the dominating Marquis of Pombal\nMarriage.\nIn 1760 Maria married her uncle Pedro, younger brother of her father Jose I. They had six children, of whom the eldest surviving son succeeded Maria as Jo\u00E3o VI on her death in 1816.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"Queen","offset":71},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":80},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":90},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Algarve","surface_form":"Algarves","offset":105},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"Queen","offset":214},{"uri":"Royal_court","surface_form":"court","offset":256},{"uri":"Prince_regent","surface_form":"Prince Regent","offset":329},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":445},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"Kingdom","offset":465},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_Portugal%2C_Brazil_and_the_Algarves","surface_form":"United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves","offset":507},{"uri":"Grandfather","surface_form":"grandfather","offset":655},{"uri":"Princess","surface_form":"Princess","offset":697},{"uri":"Sibling","surface_form":"sibling","offset":751},{"uri":"Throne","surface_form":"throne","offset":794},{"uri":"Heir_presumptive","surface_form":"heiress presumptive","offset":837},{"uri":"Duchess","surface_form":"Duchess","offset":920},{"uri":"Infante","surface_form":"Infanta of Portugal","offset":957},{"uri":"Royal_Highness","surface_form":"Royal Highness","offset":1022},{"uri":"Marquis","surface_form":"Marquis","offset":1072},{"uri":"Uncle","surface_form":"uncle","offset":1126}]}
