I don't know what to say. I can't believe it. It is so surreal and I am so happy to win a gold medal for Canada. I don't think it will hit me until later. It is truly amazing. There are a number of really good girls out there and I came out on top. This is the best moment in my entire life...I said it earlier this week, I hope a Canadian brings home a gold medal for Sarah. I can't believe it's me. It's totally for Sarah and I cannot believe it.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Huntsville%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Huntsville","offset":37},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":49},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":63},{"uri":"Freestyle_skiing","surface_form":"freestyle skier","offset":72},{"uri":"2014_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2014 Winter Olympics","offset":117},{"uri":"Sochi","surface_form":"Sochi","offset":141},{"uri":"X_Games","surface_form":"Winter X Games XVII","offset":293},{"uri":"Aspen%2C_Colorado","surface_form":"Aspen, Colorado","offset":316},{"uri":"Sarah_Burke","surface_form":"Sarah Burke","offset":390}]}
