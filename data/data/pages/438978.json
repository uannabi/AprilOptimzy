{"id":438978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsal_formula","text":"The tarsal formula is the number of segments on the tarsi of arthropods. The tarsus is the bottom part of an arthropod's legs, see diagram.\nThe formula has 3 numbers a-b-c, starting with the front leg (a), then the middle leg (b), then the hind leg (c). For example, a tarsal formula of \"5-5-4\" means there are 5 segments in the fore leg's tarsi, 5 segments in the middle leg's tarsi, and 4 segments in the hind leg's tarsi. This character is especially useful at family rank and higher.\nThe characteristic is useful when identifying insects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Segmentation","surface_form":"segments","offset":36},{"uri":"Arthropods","surface_form":"arthropods","offset":61}]}
