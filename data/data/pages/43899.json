The song is sung at the start of the FA Cup finals.\nLyrics.\nAbide with me; fast falls the eventide;\nThe darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me.\nSwift to its close ebbs out life\u2019s little day;\nEarth\u2019s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;\nChange and decay in all around I see;\nO Thou who changest not, abide with me.\nNot a brief glance I beg, a passing word;\nBut as Thou dwell\u2019st with Thy disciples, Lord,\nCome not to sojourn, but abide with me.\nCome not in terrors, as the King of kings,\nBut kind and good, with healing in Thy wings,\nTears for all woes, a heart for every plea\u2014\nCome, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.\nThou on my head in early youth didst smile;\nAnd, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,\nThou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee,\nOn to the close, O Lord, abide with me.\nI need Thy presence every passing hour.\nWhat but Thy grace can foil the tempter\u2019s power?\nWho, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?\nThrough cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.\nI fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\nIlls have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\nWhere is death\u2019s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\nI triumph still, if Thou abide with me.\nHold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;\nShine through the gloom and point me to the skies.\nHeaven\u2019s morning breaks, and earth\u2019s vain shadows flee;\nIn life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":32},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":42},{"uri":"Hymn","surface_form":"hymn","offset":50},{"uri":"Henry_Lyte","surface_form":"Henry Lyte","offset":74},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":119},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":130},{"uri":"George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George VI of the United Kingdom","offset":135},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"Queen","offset":186},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Elizabeth II","offset":192},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":243}]}
