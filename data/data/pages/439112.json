{"id":439112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism","text":"Geocentrism is the belief that the Earth is fixed at the centre of the Universe. Geocentrists accept that the earth is round. Before the 16th century most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. The Ancient Greek astronomer, Ptolemy wrote a book to explain in great detail how the spherical Earth is surrounded by things that move in the sky. From the time of Ptolemy round the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD through to the 16th Century AD educated people who knew the earth is round almost always believed the Geocentric theory of Ptolemy.\nFrom the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers, especially Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called heliocentrism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":35},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"Universe","offset":71},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":137},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":231},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":239},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":276},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":290},{"uri":"Ptolemy","surface_form":"Ptolemy","offset":302},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":647},{"uri":"Copernicus","surface_form":"Copernicus","offset":671},{"uri":"Galileo","surface_form":"Galileo","offset":683},{"uri":"Kepler","surface_form":"Kepler","offset":695},{"uri":"Heliocentrism","surface_form":"heliocentrism","offset":786}]}
