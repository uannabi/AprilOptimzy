{"id":43918,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent in the Western Christian calendar. It occurs 46 days before Easter. The date is different each year because the date of Easter varies. It can fall as early as February 4 and as late as March 10.\nThose able to and willing to should fast voluntarily between Ash Wednesday and Easter. There are exceptions, though. Pregnant women, sick people, children, and the old usually don't have to.\nAsh Wednesday is a very important part of Lent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lent","surface_form":"Lent","offset":47},{"uri":"Western_Christianity","surface_form":"Western Christian","offset":59},{"uri":"Fasting","surface_form":"fast","offset":283},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"Pregnant","offset":364},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":373},{"uri":"Sickness","surface_form":"sick","offset":380},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":393}]}
