{"id":43935,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryolophosaurus","text":"\"Cryolophosaurus\" is a theropod dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic period. It is the only theropod to be found in Antarctica. \"Cryolophosaurus\" was discovered in the Jurassic Hanson Formation in the Transantarctic Mountains. The find of this dinosaur was significant because it proves that the dinosaurs lived on all continents and that high latitude climates were tolerated by dinosaurs at that time.\n\"Cryolophosaurus\" is also significant because it is the oldest known tetanuran from any continent: it is the only one from the early Jurassic.\n\"Cryolophosaurus\" had a large crest on the top of the skull, above the eyes. It extends upwards from the skull.\n\"Cryolophosaurus\" was found about from the South Pole but then it was about or so farther north. Also found were the remains of \"Glacialisaurus\" (a large basal sauropodomorph), a crow-sized pterosaur, synapsids, and another unknown theropod. There are also the remains of many plant genera around the same age as fossils of \"Cryolophosaurus\", proving that dense plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":23},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":32},{"uri":"Lower_Jurassic","surface_form":"Lower Jurassic","offset":50},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":112},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":164},{"uri":"Transantarctic_Mountains","surface_form":"Transantarctic Mountains","offset":197},{"uri":"Tetanuran","surface_form":"tetanuran","offset":469},{"uri":"Crest","surface_form":"crest","offset":573},{"uri":"South_Pole","surface_form":"South Pole","offset":698},{"uri":"Glacialisaurus","surface_form":"Glacialisaurus","offset":784},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":809},{"uri":"Sauropodomorph","surface_form":"sauropodomorph","offset":815},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":845},{"uri":"Synapsid","surface_form":"synapsid","offset":856},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":938}]}
