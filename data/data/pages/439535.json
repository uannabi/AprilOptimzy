{"id":439535,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphaga","text":"The Polyphaga is the largest and most diverse suborder of beetles. The name is got from two Greek words: \"poly\"-, meaning 'many', and \"phagein\", meaning 'to eat', so the suborder is called the \u201Ceaters of many things\u201D. Polyphaga has 144 families in 16 superfamilies, and shows an enormous variety of specialization and adaptation. It has over 315,000 described species, about 90% of all beetle species so far discovered.\nClassification.\nThe infraorder Cucujiformia includes most phytophagous [plant-eating] beetles. Adoption of a plant-eating lifestyle promoted speciation and diversity in beetles, with Cucujiformia, especially weevils, forming a major radiation. Much of this adaptive radiation has taken place at the same time as the evolution of the flowering plants. \"99% of phytophagous beetles feed on flowering plants\".p399","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Suborder","surface_form":"suborder","offset":46},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":58},{"uri":"Specialization","surface_form":"specialization","offset":299},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":318},{"uri":"Speciation","surface_form":"speciation","offset":561},{"uri":"Weevil","surface_form":"weevil","offset":628},{"uri":"Adaptive_radiation","surface_form":"adaptive radiation","offset":677},{"uri":"Flowering_plants","surface_form":"flowering plants","offset":753}]}
