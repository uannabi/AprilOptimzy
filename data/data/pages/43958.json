{"id":43958,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ull","text":"In Norse mythology, Ull (or Ullr or Uller) is the son of Sif, and the of Thor. He is thought to be the god of Winter, of hunting, of hand-to-hand combat, and of the willow tree. He is married to Skadi, the goddess of winter, and the ex-wife of Njord. His name means \"glory\". He was said to be a great archer and skier who left blazing trails across the sky.\nFor this reason he is celebrated in modern times as the god of skiing. His name is used as a name for ski lodges like the House of Ullr at Thredbo, New South Wales.
