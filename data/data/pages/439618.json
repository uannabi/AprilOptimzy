He became Mexico's top drug kingpin in 2003 after the arrest of his rival Osiel C\u00E1rdenas of the Gulf Cartel. He was thought to be one of the \"most powerful drug traffickers in the world\" by the United States Department of the Treasury.\nGuzm\u00E1n was once again arrested by Mexican authorities in Mexico on February 22, 2014. He was found in a beach resort in Mazatlan, but details of the arrest have not been revealed. On January 8, 2016, Guzm\u00E1n was captured at the coastal city of Los Mochis, in northern Sinaloa, following a gun battle by the Mexican Navy.\nHe was extradited to the United States on 19 January 2017 to face criminal charges related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel. He was found guilty by a jury in Brooklyn on 12 February 2019 of all drug trafficking counts and is scheduled for life imprisonment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":60},{"uri":"Drug_lord","surface_form":"drug lord","offset":68},{"uri":"Sinaloa_Cartel","surface_form":"Sinaloa Cartel","offset":93},{"uri":"Sinaloa","surface_form":"Sinaloa","offset":180},{"uri":"Osiel_C%C3%A1rdenas","surface_form":"Osiel C\u00E1rdenas","offset":363},{"uri":"Gulf_Cartel","surface_form":"Gulf Cartel","offset":385},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury","surface_form":"United States Department of the Treasury","offset":483},{"uri":"Mazatlan","surface_form":"Mazatlan","offset":645},{"uri":"Los_Mochis","surface_form":"Los Mochis","offset":768},{"uri":"Sinaloa","surface_form":"Sinaloa","offset":792},{"uri":"Extradited","surface_form":"extradited","offset":852},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":1010}]}
