{"id":439702,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_International_Bandy","text":"The Federation of International Bandy (FIB) is the international governing body for the sport of bandy, including the variant called rink bandy.\nThe federation was formed in 1955 in Stockholm, Sweden, and has had its base in Sweden since 1979. The present office is situated in S\u00F6derhamn, headed by FIB Secretary General Bo Nyman. Boris Skrynnik is the FIB President.\nThe federation was named the International Bandy Federation (abbreviated IBF) between 1957 and 2001. The current name was adopted in 2001. The name change was made at a request from the International Olympic Committee (abbreviated IOC) when the IOC made bandy a \"recognized sport\". The abbreviation IBF was already in use by the International Badminton Federation. In 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC.\nWhen FIB was formed in 1955, it introduced the same rules for bandy all over the world. Especially in Russia, different rules had been used prior to this. Bandy World Championship for men have been organized since 1957 and Bandy World Championship for women have been organized since 2004.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport_governing_body","surface_form":"governing body","offset":65},{"uri":"Bandy","surface_form":"bandy","offset":97},{"uri":"Rink_bandy","surface_form":"rink bandy","offset":133},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":182},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":193},{"uri":"S%C3%B6derhamn","surface_form":"S\u00F6derhamn","offset":278},{"uri":"Boris_Skrynnik","surface_form":"Boris Skrynnik","offset":331},{"uri":"International_Badminton_Federation","surface_form":"International Badminton Federation","offset":697},{"uri":"Bandy_World_Championship_for_men","surface_form":"Bandy World Championship for men","offset":928},{"uri":"Bandy_World_Championship_for_women","surface_form":"Bandy World Championship for women","offset":996}]}
