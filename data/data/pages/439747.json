{"id":439747,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelobasileus","text":"\"Adelobasileus\" is an extinct proto-mammal from the Upper Triassic, about 225 million years ago. There is only a partial skull from strata in western Texas.\nSkull features, like the housing of the cochlea, suggest that \"Adelobasileus\" is a transitional form in the evolution from cynodonts to end-Triassic mammals. For this reason, it may be close to the common ancestor of modern mammals. Their sleek body type suggests they moved very fast.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":36},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":52},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":121},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":132},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":150},{"uri":"Cochlea","surface_form":"cochlea","offset":197},{"uri":"Transitional_fossil","surface_form":"transitional form","offset":240},{"uri":"Cynodont","surface_form":"cynodont","offset":280},{"uri":"Common_descent","surface_form":"common ancestor","offset":355}]}
