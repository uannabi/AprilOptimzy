{"id":439853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Malik_Hasan","text":"Nidal Malik Hasan (born September 8, 1970) is a former United States Army Major and psychiatrist. On 5 November 2009 he entered the Soldier's Readiness Center at Fort Hood, Texas. He fired approximately 100 rounds at soldiers in the center. Hasan admitted to the shootings at his court-martial in August 2013. The jury convicted him of 45 counts (crimes) of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder. One count each for the 13 unarmed soldiers he killed and one count for each of the 32 people he shot at. On 28 August 2013 the same military court sentenced Hasan to death. He is in prison at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Hasan is awaiting execution while his case is reviewed by appellate courts.\nHasan was born in Arlington County, Virginia. His Palestinian parents immigrated to the United States. The shooting was believed to have been bought on by his Islamic religious radicalism. Before the shooting, he communicated with the late American-Yemeni Islamic militant, Anwar al-Awlaki.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":55},{"uri":"Major","surface_form":"Major","offset":74},{"uri":"Psychiatrist","surface_form":"psychiatrist","offset":84},{"uri":"Fort_Hood","surface_form":"Fort Hood","offset":162},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":173},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"rounds","offset":207},{"uri":"Soldiers","surface_form":"soldiers","offset":217},{"uri":"Court-martial","surface_form":"court-martial","offset":280},{"uri":"Conviction","surface_form":"convicted","offset":319},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":347},{"uri":"Premeditated_murder","surface_form":"premeditated murder","offset":358},{"uri":"Unarmed","surface_form":"unarmed","offset":439},{"uri":"Shot","surface_form":"shot","offset":509},{"uri":"Sentence_(law)","surface_form":"sentenced","offset":560},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":595},{"uri":"United_States_Disciplinary_Barracks","surface_form":"United States Disciplinary Barracks","offset":609},{"uri":"Fort_Leavenworth","surface_form":"Fort Leavenworth","offset":648},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":666},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"execution","offset":692},{"uri":"Appellate_court","surface_form":"appellate court","offset":732},{"uri":"Arlington_County%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Arlington County","offset":768},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":786},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":800},{"uri":"Immigrate","surface_form":"immigrate","offset":820},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":838},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":909},{"uri":"Extremism","surface_form":"radicalism","offset":927},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":999},{"uri":"Anwar_al-Awlaki","surface_form":"Anwar al-Awlaki","offset":1024}]}
