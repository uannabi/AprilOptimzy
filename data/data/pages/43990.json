{"id":43990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergstra%C3%9Fe_Route","text":"Bergstra\u00DFe (\"Mountain Road\") is the name of a mountain route, and the area around it, which stretches across the western edge of the Odenwald in southern Hesse and northern Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg, Germany.\nThe name \"Bergstra\u00DFe\" also refers to the district Kreis Bergstra\u00DFe, the independent wine-growing region of Hessische Bergstra\u00DFe and the Badische Bergstra\u00DFe in the Baden wine-growing area.\nRoute.\nThe route goes almost straight from north to south at the spot where the Rhine lowlands meet the western edge of the Odenwald. The name comes from the road's route along the foot of the mountains, the Rhine lowlands once being too damp to build a road there.\nThe route mostly follows the modern B3 road. It begins in Darmstadt and, after passing through Eberstadt, splits into the \"Old Bergstra\u00DFe\" and the \"New Bergstra\u00DFe\", which goes somewhat farther to the west. The two routes meet again at Zwingenberg.\nIn Weinheim-L\u00FCtzelsachsen the route splits into an old and a new Bergstra\u00DFe again. The new one passes west of the old route as far as Heidelberg-Handschuhsheim, where the two meet once more. The route carrying on after the Neckar from Heidelberg to Wiesloch is still usually known as the Bergstra\u00DFe, even though the type of country and climate typical of the Bergstra\u00DFe is no longer as clear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":46},{"uri":"Odenwald","surface_form":"Odenwald","offset":133},{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse","offset":154},{"uri":"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg","offset":173},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":192},{"uri":"Bergstra%C3%9Fe_Rural_District","surface_form":"Kreis Bergstra\u00DFe","offset":251},{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hessische","offset":308},{"uri":"Badische_Bergstra%C3%9Fe","surface_form":"Badische Bergstra\u00DFe","offset":337},{"uri":"Baden","surface_form":"Baden","offset":364},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":469},{"uri":"Odenwald","surface_form":"Odenwald","offset":513},{"uri":"Bundesstra%C3%9Fe_3","surface_form":"B3","offset":691},{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":713},{"uri":"Eberstadt","surface_form":"Eberstadt","offset":750},{"uri":"Zwingenberg","surface_form":"Zwingenberg","offset":890},{"uri":"Weinheim-L%C3%BCtzelsachsen","surface_form":"Weinheim-L\u00FCtzelsachsen","offset":906},{"uri":"Heidelberg-Handschuhsheim","surface_form":"Heidelberg-Handschuhsheim","offset":1037},{"uri":"Neckar","surface_form":"Neckar","offset":1126},{"uri":"Heidelberg","surface_form":"Heidelberg","offset":1138},{"uri":"Wiesloch","surface_form":"Wiesloch","offset":1152}]}
