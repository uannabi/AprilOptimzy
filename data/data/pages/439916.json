He served for seventeen years but was consider an weak and ineffectual pope without education who relied heavily upon his deacon Callistus who would become the next Pope.\nDuring his time there was a group of people who practiced Montanism and Adoptionism who preached things which were against the teachings of the Catholic Church. Both these groups taught that Jesus Christ was a holy person but not the son of God. Theologians at that time were very disappointed with Pope Zephrynus for not taking severe action against these groups. They considered him a weak pope.\nHis feast day is celebrated August 26.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":55},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Rome","surface_form":"Bishop of Rome","offset":87},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":109},{"uri":"Pope_Callixtus_I","surface_form":"Callistus","offset":255},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":488},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"Theologians","offset":543}]}
