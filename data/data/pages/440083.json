Cladistic analysis indicates that the animal is probably a basal chordate or a basal craniate. It does not show enough detail to be definitely included in either stem group.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Craniata","surface_form":"craniate","offset":46},{"uri":"Cambrian_explosion","surface_form":"Cambrian explosion","offset":157},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"Cladistic analysis","offset":311},{"uri":"Chordate","surface_form":"chordate","offset":376},{"uri":"Stem_group","surface_form":"stem group","offset":473}]}
