{"id":440128,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-R","text":"=\"preserve\">DVD-R is a recordable DVD format. It uses a thin organic dye layer which is recorded by a high-power laser. The laser bleaches the recorded areas, creating reflective areas that can then be played back with a low-power laser. A DVD-R can be recorded with DVD-Video, DVD-Audio, or DVD-ROM content.A DVD-R typically has a storage capacity of 4.7 GB. Pioneer has also developed an 8.5 GB dual layer version, DVD-R DL, which appeared on the market in 2005.\nDVD-R(W) is one of three competing industry standard DVD recordable formats; the others are DVD+R(W) and DVD-RAM. A DVD-R can be written only once, in contrast with a rewritable DVD formats such as DVD-RW or DVD+RW which can be rewritten multiple (1000+) times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":34},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":69},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":113},{"uri":"Reflection","surface_form":"reflective","offset":168},{"uri":"DVD-Video","surface_form":"DVD-Video","offset":267},{"uri":"DVD-Audio","surface_form":"DVD-Audio","offset":278},{"uri":"DVD-ROM","surface_form":"DVD-ROM","offset":292}]}
