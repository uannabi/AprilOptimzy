Maximinus Thrax did not tolerate Christians and pursued them violently. He arrested Pontian and Hippolytus and sent them to the mines in Sardinia where they died soon after. Pontian's body was returned to Rome a short time later and they were buried in the catacombs of Callistus on the Appian Way. Catacombs were underground chambers where many Christians lived, died and were buried.\nPontian is known for his condemnation of Origen a theologian of the time, and forbade his teachings. Pontian is considered a martyr and a saint of the Catholic Church. His feast day is celebrated on August 13 along with a fellow martyr Hippolytus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":77},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Rome","surface_form":"Bishop of Rome","offset":109},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":131},{"uri":"Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Roman Emperor","offset":198},{"uri":"Severus","surface_form":"Severus","offset":212},{"uri":"Christians","surface_form":"Christians","offset":264},{"uri":"Maximinus_Thrax","surface_form":"Maximinus Thrax","offset":305},{"uri":"Sardinia","surface_form":"Sardinia","offset":459},{"uri":"Origen","surface_form":"Origen","offset":749},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theologian","offset":758},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":833},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":846}]}
