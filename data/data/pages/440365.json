Though the process of peening has become rarer in metal fabrication, the ball-peen hammer remains useful for many tasks, such as striking punches and chisels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peening","surface_form":"peening","offset":89},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":97},{"uri":"Metalworking","surface_form":"metalworking","offset":112},{"uri":"Hemispherical","surface_form":"hemispherical","offset":221},{"uri":"Punch_(tool)","surface_form":"punch","offset":379},{"uri":"Chisel","surface_form":"chisel","offset":391}]}
