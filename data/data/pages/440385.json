{"id":440385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Ham","text":"Kenneth Alfred Ham (born 20 October 1951) is an Australian young-Earth creationist. He is the president of Answers in Genesis (AiG). Ham is also the founder of the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, United States. He is a former high school science teacher.\nCareer.\nHam was born on 20 October 1951 in Cairns, Queensland. His father was a Christian educator who settled his family in Brisbane, working as a school principal. Ham earned a Bachelor of Applied Science degree from Queensland Institute of Technology. He also earned a diploma in Education from the University of Queensland.\nBill Nye debate.\nOn 4 February 2014, at the Creation Museum, Ham debated Bill Nye (also known as \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\"). The topic was the question \"Is Creation A Viable Model of Origins?\". The televised event drew over three million viewers. Ham's position was the world was created about 6,000 years ago. He also defended his position that all animals alive today descend from those aboard Noah's Ark. Nye argued that radioisotopic and ice core data shows that Earth has existed for much longer than 6,000 years. He also added that using the Bible's description of the Ark it could not float. A number of experts were critical of the debate saying that it did not discuss important areas. At least one said neither did very well. An informal viewer's poll showed 92% thought Nye won the debate. However, \"Debate is a tool for showing who's a better orator, not necessarily who's right. And Ken Ham is no mean orator, usually,\" noted the National Center for Science Education, a not-for-profit membership organization that defends the teaching of evolution and climate science.\"\nPersonal life.\nHe married Marylin \"Mally\" on 30 December 1972. They have five children together. The Ham couple live in unincorporated Boone County, Kentucky.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australians","surface_form":"Australian","offset":48},{"uri":"Young_Earth_creationism","surface_form":"young-Earth creationist","offset":59},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":94},{"uri":"Answers_in_Genesis","surface_form":"Answers in Genesis","offset":107},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"found","offset":149},{"uri":"Creation_Museum","surface_form":"Creation Museum","offset":164},{"uri":"Petersburg","surface_form":"Petersburg","offset":183},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":195},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":205},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":235},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":247},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":255},{"uri":"Cairns%2C_Queensland","surface_form":"Cairns","offset":307},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":315},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":344},{"uri":"Educator","surface_form":"educator","offset":354},{"uri":"Brisbane","surface_form":"Brisbane","offset":389},{"uri":"School_principal","surface_form":"school principal","offset":412},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Applied_Science","surface_form":"Bachelor of Applied Science","offset":443},{"uri":"Queensland_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"Queensland Institute of Technology","offset":483},{"uri":"Diploma","surface_form":"diploma","offset":536},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"Education","offset":547},{"uri":"University_of_Queensland","surface_form":"University of Queensland","offset":566},{"uri":"Bill_Nye","surface_form":"Bill Nye","offset":665},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"televised event","offset":791},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":823},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":863},{"uri":"Noah%27s_Arc","surface_form":"Noah's Ark","offset":989},{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argued","offset":1005},{"uri":"Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator","surface_form":"radioisotopic","offset":1017},{"uri":"Ice_core","surface_form":"ice core","offset":1035},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":1044},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":1060},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":1141},{"uri":"Description","surface_form":"description","offset":1149},{"uri":"Float","surface_form":"float","offset":1185},{"uri":"Expert","surface_form":"expert","offset":1204},{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":1233},{"uri":"Orator","surface_form":"orator","offset":1508},{"uri":"National_Center_for_Science_Education","surface_form":"National Center for Science Education","offset":1536},{"uri":"Not-for-profit","surface_form":"not-for-profit","offset":1577},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":1603},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1645},{"uri":"Climatology","surface_form":"climate science","offset":1659},{"uri":"Boone_County%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Boone County, Kentucky","offset":1812}]}
