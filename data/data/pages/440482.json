He was against Batista since the general's effective coup in 1952, which he called unconstitutional, but became more critical of the movement's shift towards Marxist principles, and closing ties with leaders of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). He was convicted of \"treason and sedition\" by the new Castro regime. He would spend 20 years in prison (1959\u20131979) before being released in 1979.\nAfter his release, he spent his time between Miami, Florida, United States and Costa Rica. He was politically active in speaking out against the Cuban government.\nMatos died from a heart attack on 27 February 2014 in Miami, Florida. He was aged 95.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":64},{"uri":"Yara%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Yara","offset":105},{"uri":"Granma_Province","surface_form":"Granma Province","offset":111},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":178},{"uri":"Che_Guevara","surface_form":"Che Guevara","offset":192},{"uri":"26th_of_July_Movement","surface_form":"26th of July Movement","offset":229},{"uri":"Fulgencio_Batista","surface_form":"Fulgencio Batista","offset":292},{"uri":"Cuban_Revolution","surface_form":"Cuban Revolution","offset":325},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup","offset":396},{"uri":"Constitutionalism","surface_form":"unconstitutional","offset":426},{"uri":"Marxist","surface_form":"Marxist","offset":501},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"Communist Party of Cuba","offset":558},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami","offset":780},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":787},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":796},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":814},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":916}]}
