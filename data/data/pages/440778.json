{"id":440778,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_memory","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sensory memory (SM) is an automatic response, not under conscious control. It deals with the input from the senses. The information people received which is stored in sensory memory is just long enough to be transferred to short-term memory.\nThe SM is made up of stores of different kinds of information. Each has different rates of information processing and decay. Genetics also plays a role in SM capacity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Senses","surface_form":"senses","offset":121},{"uri":"Short-term_memory","surface_form":"short-term memory","offset":236}]}
