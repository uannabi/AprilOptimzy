{"id":440896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar","text":"The Holocene calendar, or Human era (HE), is a year numbering system that adds 10,000 years to the present \"Anno Domini\" (AD) or Common Era (CE) system. It puts the first year near the beginning of the Holocene epoch and the Neolithic revolution. People who like the HE system say that it makes for easier geological, archeological, dendrochronological and historical dating.\nThe current year of can be made into a Holocene year by adding the number \"1\" before it, making it 1. The HE idea was first thought of by the scientist Cesare Emiliani in 1993 (11993).\nInstead, HE starts at 10001. This is a rough approximation of the start of the current geologic epoch, the Holocene or Recent period. settlements, first cities and agriculture probably started in this period. All important dates in human history can then be listed using a simple increasing date scale with smaller dates always before larger dates.\nConversion.\nConversion to the Human Era from Julian or Gregorian AD years can be achieved by adding 10,000. BC years are converted by subtracting the BC year from 10,001.\nA useful check is that the last single number of BC and HE equivalent pairs must add up to 1 or 11.\n!
