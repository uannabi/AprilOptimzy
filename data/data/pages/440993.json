{"id":440993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricin","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ricin is a poison. It is a highly toxic, naturally occurring protein. It is produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant \"Ricinus communis\".\nA dose the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human. The median lethal dose (LD50) of ricin is around 22 micrograms per kilogram (1.78\u00A0mg for an average adult, around of a standard aspirin tablet/0.4\u00A0g gross) in humans if injected or inhaled. Oral exposure to ricin is far less toxic and a lethal dose can be up to 30\u201340\u00A0milligrams per kilogram.\nRicin prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins, and death occurs after a few hours up to a day. Ricin has been used as a terrorist weapon, including the assassination of Georgi Markov in 1978, supposedly by the KGB.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":47},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":74},{"uri":"Castor_oil_plant","surface_form":"castor oil plant","offset":118},{"uri":"Median_lethal_dose","surface_form":"median lethal dose","offset":230},{"uri":"Injection","surface_form":"injected","offset":395},{"uri":"Inhalation","surface_form":"inhaled","offset":407},{"uri":"Cells","surface_form":"cells","offset":534},{"uri":"Amino_acids","surface_form":"amino acids","offset":564},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":581},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":664},{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassination","offset":696},{"uri":"Georgi_Markov","surface_form":"Georgi Markov","offset":713},{"uri":"KGB","surface_form":"KGB","offset":754}]}
