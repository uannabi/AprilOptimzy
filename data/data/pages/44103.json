He started the Inca empire.\nAs he says it, his legend started at the waters of Lake Titicaca, when he was told by the sun god to go East to set up his empire. As they walked looking for a good place, Manco taught men to farm, hunt, and fish while Mama Ocllo, his wife taught women to work with wool and cotton. Near Cusco, as his sacred golden staff sank in the ground, Manco decided this was to be the capital city of his empire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1107","surface_form":"1107","offset":21},{"uri":"Inca","surface_form":"Inca","offset":57},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":72},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":98},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":125},{"uri":"Lake_Titicaca","surface_form":"Lake Titicaca","offset":157},{"uri":"Sun_god","surface_form":"sun god","offset":196},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"East","offset":210},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farm","offset":298},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunt","offset":304},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fish","offset":314},{"uri":"Mama_Ocllo","surface_form":"Mama Ocllo","offset":325},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":372},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":381},{"uri":"Cusco","surface_form":"Cusco","offset":394},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":481}]}
