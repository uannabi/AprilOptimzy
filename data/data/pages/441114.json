{"id":441114,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre-gram-second_system_of_units","text":"e=\"preserve\">The centimetre-gram-second system (abbreviated CGS or cgs) is a variant of the metric system. The derived units are on the centimeter as the unit of length, the gram as a unit of mass and the second as a unit of time. The system evolved in the nineteenth century when it was used to define both electrical and mechanical units.\nThe cgs units of energy and force are the \"dyne\" and the \"erg\".\nThe coherent cgs unit of pressure was the \"barye\" (symbol Ba). A \"bayre\" is one dyne per square centimeter.\nThe dyne and the erg were used to define the units for electrical quantities. Two different forms of cgs units were developed. One form was developed for electrostatic units and another for electromagnetic units. Electrical engineering units were based on the MKS (metre-kilogram-second) system instead of the CGS system.\nDuring the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries many other units were defined using cgs units. In 1960 the BIPM published the International System of Units (SI) which was based on the metre, the kilogram, the second and the ampere. SI has now replaced the CGS system of units in most applications.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metric_system","surface_form":"metric system","offset":92},{"uri":"Derived_units","surface_form":"derived units","offset":111},{"uri":"Centimeter","surface_form":"centimeter","offset":136},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":162},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":174},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":192},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":205},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":225},{"uri":"Electrical","surface_form":"electrical","offset":308},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":323},{"uri":"Dyne","surface_form":"dyne","offset":384},{"uri":"Erg","surface_form":"erg","offset":399},{"uri":"Barye","surface_form":"barye","offset":448},{"uri":"Electrostatic","surface_form":"electrostatic","offset":667},{"uri":"Electromagnetic","surface_form":"electromagnetic","offset":703},{"uri":"BIPM","surface_form":"BIPM","offset":946},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"International System of Units","offset":965},{"uri":"Ampere","surface_form":"ampere","offset":1063}]}
