When she was seven years old, her mother, Gladys (Monroe) Baker Mortenson, was hospitalized after being diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, a severe mental condition. Norma was left in a series of foster homes and the Los Angeles Orphans' Home Society. The constant move from one foster home to another resulted in Norma's \"sketchy\" educational background.\nAfter Norma's sixteenth birthday, her foster parents had to move from California. To avoid an orphanage or a new foster home, Norma chose to get married. On June 19, 1942, Norma married James Dougherty, but the marriage would all but end when he joined the U.S. Merchant Marines in 1943. Though her difficult childhood and early failed marriage would make Norma Jean a strong and resilient woman, these experiences would also add to her insecurities and flaws\u2014things that would ultimately shape her into a great tragic figure of the twentieth\u00A0century..\nMovies.\nMarilyn Monroe became famous, starring in a number of hit movies during the 1950s and early 1960s. She also became famous for modeling for photographers and singing in her musical movies. One time, she sang \"Happy Birthday\" to President John F. Kennedy. It turned out to be one of her last appearances.\nMarriages.\nThe 16-year-old Norma Jeane married James Dougherty on June 19, 1942. After the wedding, he joined the navy.

She had met DiMaggio on a blind date, during the filming of the movie \"Monkey Business\" in 1952. The marriage was closely followed by the public. DiMaggio retired from baseball, and Marilyn became very famous. DiMaggio was sad that his career as a baseball star was ending, and was jealous of Marilyn for being admired. He spent most of his time watching television and Monroe found it boring. They separated on October 31, 1954. From 1961, they became friends again. DiMaggio said that he gave Marilyn a rose every week for 10 years.\nMarilyn married Arthur Miller on June 29, 1956. She converted to Judaism.
