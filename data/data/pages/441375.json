{"id":441375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPRAT","text":"The SPRAT (for \"Syst\u00E8me de pose rapide de travures\") is an assault bridge built on a military heavy truck. It is made in France and used by the French army. It's purpose is as a mobile bridge for military vehicles. It was used starting in 2011.\nWithin the forward edge of battle, the PTA is a unique gap crossing solution. The modularity offered by the PTA also provides a tactical advantage for vehicles up to class MLC 80. Since 2009, the Modular Assault Bridge has been commissioned into the French Army under the name SPRAT (Syst\u00E8me de Pose Rapide de Travure - rapid bridge layer system).\nIn front of the breach, it is capable of deploying two short 14.3 m bridges or one long 26 m bridge.\nThe bridge is deployed from the armored cab, thus ensuring operator safety. Rapid horizontal deployment (10 minutes with 2 operators for the long bridge) ensures operational discretion.\nThanks to its stabilizing legs, the PTA can establish a bridge from unprepared banks (inclination of +/- 5%, slope of +/- 10%).\nThe high mechanical strength of the PTA's bridges allows the crossing of vehicles up to class MLC 80 over a gap of up to 24 meters in a repetitive manner as they are stress and fatigue qualified according to the FINABEL code.\nEquipped with a digital, automated combat system (including an IR camera, operator interface and telemetry), the Modular Assault Bridge can be used day or night.\nWeighing less than 60 metric tons, it can be driven on ordinary roads and can also be transported by air.\nThe assault bridge SPRAT is manufactured by the French company CNIM.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Assault","surface_form":"assault","offset":59},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":67},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":85},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":100},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":121},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":151},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":185},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":196},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":205},{"uri":"2011","surface_form":"2011","offset":239}]}
